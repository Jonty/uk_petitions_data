            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "As a result of the 2007 Pension Act,  persons that paid in excess of the 30 years entitlement by way of voluntary payments (Class 3 NI conts.) reaching pension age on or after 6 April 2010 find the money they have paid will not be repaid or applied to their pension provision. By reducing the qualifying years for a full pension from a higher number of years (man 44: woman 39) to 30 the Government has accepted money on the basis that it would be applied to provision of a State pension but refuses to honour that promise or make repayment. This action is tantamount to obtaining monies by false pretence (or, theft). In some cases circa. \u00a34000 has been taken from an individual in this way. Please sign this petition as tax money is being used to protect all manner of interests (e.g. Northern Rock depositors) and yet money paid by people, acting prudently, to provide for their old age under the Government's own advice has now been purloined for other uses.",
