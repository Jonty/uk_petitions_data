        "action": "request that the Chancellor of the Exchequer moves his Budget speech to November in order to reduce duplication and waste in the production of tax, NI and PAYE software and documentation",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The current timing of the Chancellor's Budget speech so close to the end of the tax year is very wasteful. As an example HMRC send out employer packs for the new tax year in February then re-issue essentially the same material with revised figures in April. Software houses also have to do two updates of PAYE and tax related software, one in time for the tax year end (5th April) and the second to incorporate Budget changes some weeks later.\n\nMoving to November, as was the practice in the mid-90s, would give ample time for all parties to issue a single set of publications or software that incorporates the new tax year changes and the Budget provisions, substantially reducing wasted activity in Government and the private sector.",
