            "background": "The Air Pistol section of the Airgun BBS is \"lost\" within a sub-forum which is not easily navigable by new users seeking advice on air pistol ownership, maintenance and shooting, to the detriment of pistol enthusiasts.\n\nWe request that the Prime Minister order the Airgun BBS Administrators to stop being so beastly and horrid to the UBC and to other air pistol aficionados, and to insist that they provide home-page, one-click access to the well-attended Air Pistol section for ease of use by all.\n\nWe contend that the Black Powder and Reviews sections are poorly attended and therefore unnecessary on the home page. Accordingly, their removal to sub-forums to make space for the Air Pistol section would not adversely disadvantage the handful of users who frequent those sections on a casual basis. \n\nThe Administrators of the Airgun BBS should jolly-well realise that an easily accessible Pistol section would only serve to enhance the development of the site by attracting new users, and we urge the Prime Minister to emphasise this point by slapping them about a bit, shoving the Administrators forcefully, and by using any lapel-grabbing, head-butting or yelling techniques as he sees fit.",
