            "background": "The House of Commons is supposed to hold the Executive, i.e. the Prime Minister, in check but in reality it is his poodle, thanks to party politics. We should therefore directly elect our Prime Minister as the French and the Americans do their President. Legislation should be introduced by the public by, for example, the Downing St petitions website, with the (20 or 30) most popular being put forward yearly to be ratified by a public vote. The PM would therefore be a public servant whose job would be to implement the people\u2019s laws rather than make them and there would be no need for either the House of Commons or the House of Lords.",
