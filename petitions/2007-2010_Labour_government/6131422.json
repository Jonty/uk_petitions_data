            "background": "For as long as I can remember now, when watching a live football match on TV the score has always been on-screen at the top of the screen for all to see? Handy for when watching a game in the pub with a crowd, handy because the game is played with the feet and the action stays primarily at the bottom of the screen. So why have Sky chosen to move this to the bottom of the screen this season. It is off-putting. It is unnecessary and it is about time our New Prime Minister stepped in to sort it out. Or at least for the masses of football fans like myself to show Sky that this needs to be changed!\n\nSign up now and show them that you want the score back up where it belongs!",
