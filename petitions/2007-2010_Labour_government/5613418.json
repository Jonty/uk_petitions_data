            "background": "when will the goverment start to help british lorry drivers abroad. we have no rights when it comes to other countries. yet when things go wrong we're told it is a problem for the british authorities. i know there is a few that do things wrong, like drugs and people smuggling, but the majority are hard working people trying to make a living. when approached or find immigrants in our trailers we are mugged, beaten or gassed in our cabs while sleeping. will it take one of us to get killed before something is finally done as i think this is the wrong way to do things. when will someone take this seriously as we have famillies to go home to, that do worry when we are on the road, so please if you read this petition sign it, tell your friends to sign it, as us drivers do need help out there, as some of us are trying to make an honest living and trying to get home to our famillies at the weekend safely and not in a coffin.",
