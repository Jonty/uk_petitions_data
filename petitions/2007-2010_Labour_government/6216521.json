If someone comes to live in this country then they should adopted the British culture! If the British flag or culture is offensive to them then they shouldn't come here to live! A person who thinks that they are being excluded when we promote the British culture is someone who is not living the British way of life. They are excluding themselves, and eroding the social cohesion of society. The government should not be helping to promote other cultures but helping people to become British. If someone does not want to be British or live the British way of life then why are they living in the UK!\n\nBe proud to be British, fly the Union Jack, and stop pandering to those who want to change this country into a copy of their own country.",
