            "background": "Please sign this petition asking the Prime Minister to take measures to make the recycling process easier for the general public and therefore MORE likely to be done. This will mean that it will NOT be up to the public to separate from plastic different types of plastic including bags and wrappings and bottles. It will NOT be up to the public to separate different papers and cardboards from each other. It will NOT\nbe up to the public to separate different glass items from each other. It will NOT be up to the public to separate different metal types from each other. Instead accomodaing containers will be made avaiable for ALL plastics. Containers will be made available for ALL paper and cardboard. Containers will be made available for ALL metal. Containers will be maid available for ALL glass. Such containers will of course be for waste from food packing only and small goods.The public will not spend too much time recycling and this will make things easier and more realistic. The separation will be done by people employed to the industry. \n\n    Thank you.",
