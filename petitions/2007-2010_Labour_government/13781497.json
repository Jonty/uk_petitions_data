I believe that where they need to print any major corrections, retractions, or are found to have breached the PCC code, they should be forced to give these the same prominence as the original articles. I believe this would lead to more accurate reporting of issues, and lessen the instances of often hurtful, baseless reporting of people's private lives.",
