            "background": "At the moment social services means tests are at the descretion of local authorities.  These tests are unrealistic and injust.  They do not realistically take into account what a person is actually having to pay for their individual needs to stay in their own home.  They only take into account what the local authority guidelines are,and this is at the descretion of their assessor. I feel this government does not recognise the injustice of means tests and the hardship it causes to the people who need the care in the community.  I have already complained to my local MP and the latter PM  but nobody seems to be bothered about the vulnerable in this society.  I thought this government prided itself in equal opportunities but all it seems to be doing is lining its own MP's expenditure perks at the expense of the tax payer and vulnerable people.  People are loosing faith,trust and respect for this government. More and more people are just existing on and below the bread line.  This as to change.  Please sign this petition if you agree.  Thank you.",
