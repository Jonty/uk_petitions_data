            "background": "The government has recently used \u00a34bn of taxpayers money to purchase 43% of Lloyds TSB as a supposed \"bail out\". As both a taxpayer and customer of Lloyds i along with thousands of others more than likely wont see a penny of that \u00a34bn(which technically is our money). Now the government wants Lloyds along with other banks to keep lending money to its customers. Surely this is the problem? People borrowing money and not being able to pay it back! Why not lower income tax or even give tax breaks to taxpayers giving us more money to spend thus giving more money to businesses to pay into the banks. Am i talking rubbish and dont know what im talking about or does this sound like a more viable solution than pouring money into banks so it can disappear into fatcats back pockets?",
