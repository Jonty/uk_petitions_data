The fireworks, that you can buy down the shops, and that you set up in your garden, are rubbish and a waste of money. Not to mention DANGEROUS! On countless occasions have many people been badly and even critically injured at Home Firework Displays. Imagine you setting up a display at home, and one hitting your child in the face. Could you live with it? Plus, going to a fireworks display organised by your local council or a properly organised and licenced one, if much more fun. And because of the licence being owned, you can get much better fireworks, and it usually only costs abouth \u00a35.00 per adult! So, sign this petition now, to stomp out injuries caused by fireworks.",
