            "background": "The current controversy over golliwogs has led to people being fired, shops being emptied of gollies, and a horrible Puritan finger-pointing.\n\nGollies give people pleasure and create happiness. Most people are fed up with the politically correct zealots who endeavour to spread their gloom everywhere they go.\n\nPlease sign the petition, as a small challenge to their dreariness.",
