            "background": "There has recently been a case where people have tried to put barbed wire around their allotments to stop criminals from getting in or steeling.  However they got asked to take it down because it may cause harm to the criminal.  In my opinion if someone wants to break into your home or steel property of yours you should be able to defend it before those people get hold of it.  Sign this petition today and let Gordon Brown know we should have rights to defend our belongings",
