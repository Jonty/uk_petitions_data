            "background": "The new rules have been in place since 2003.  The old rules are complex and require significant effort from both parents and from the CSA.  The new system is easier for all involved and transfers could easily be made when peoples circumstances change.  The only reason to keep the old system in place is job creation for the CSA.  The CSA make errors with assessments and payments so moving to a less complex system should save time and money (i.e. taxpayers money).  A firm commitment is required from ministers to push this through otherwise the CSA may continue to drag its heels.  Real efficiencies could be made from the move to the new system.",
