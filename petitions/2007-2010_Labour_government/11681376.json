            "background": "BPA or Bisphenol A as it is also known is used in plastic. It is used in things like food containers and babies bottles. In Canada they have banned BPA being used in babies bottles and in some States in the USA they could be doing same. I believe that the UK should not only ban it being used in babies bottles, but in everything else that people and animals come into contact with that contain this chemical. There is a lot of information that can be found about this chemical and what it is doing to people online. I believe if enough people sign we could have a good chance in banning it so please sign this petition.",
