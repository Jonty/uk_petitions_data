How easy would it be for an MP to ... offer a bit more reassurance than is acceptable, or to blackmail someone based on confidential information?\nAnd as their prospective employers, like every employer of someone who could deal one-to-one with vulnerable people, we, the public really ought to know about any issues BEFORE we vote, so logically all candidates should be CRB checked before they are able to stand as candidates.",
