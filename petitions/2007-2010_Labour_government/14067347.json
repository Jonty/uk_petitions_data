            "background": "Dear Prime Minister,\n\nHaving heard of the governments' recent recognition of the vital role\ncarried out during WW2 by the Bevin Boys by issuing a commemorative\nbadge, I have made enquiries on behalf of my grandfather who sadly\npassed away a few years since.\n\nI have been informed that the badge will not be issued posthumously; I\nfind this totally disgraceful after a period in excess of 60 years to\nachieve their much deserved recognition! I would imagine that the\nmajority of the Bevin Boys have since passed away in any case!\n\nI have to express that once again I am utterly disgusted with this outrageous and disrespectful decision!\n\nI feel that many other families would be delighted to see this much deserved\nrecognition be awarded to Bevin Boys that have since passed away, in\nrecognition of their vital service to their country. I would also\nimagine that they too would feel extremely bitter about the decision to\naward the badge to survivors only. \n\nYours sincerely,\n\nAndrew Wright",
