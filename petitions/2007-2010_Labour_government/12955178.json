            "background": "chase up financial institutions, and companys in default, who mis sold ppi. the time scales are appalling in the cases where people are under the threat of repossesion. in the case of front loaded ppi where the ins is a loan put on at the start(and in most cases only covers you for the first 5 years) and secured on your property, these ppi amounts are in some cases extortionate, people who are in arrears find themselves in this position due to the ppi monthly payments, and these companys are reposessing properties while homeowners are waiting for the refund of ppi due to mis sell. homes could be saved and a lot of stress reduced for these people if the fos and the companys were to pay out faster,the loan would then be recalculated and the monthly repayments affordable, as they should have been without the ppi. once your home is repossesed it doesnt matter what cheque you receive, you have lost the home you have worked for all your life. give these people a chance to stay in their homes, as this will benefit the companys as well,because repossesion will get them a lot less than the actual debt that is owed, so it is in their best interests to speed the mis sell payouts up.",
