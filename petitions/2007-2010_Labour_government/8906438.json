            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I am a mature adult who has not smoked since 2002, but I enjoy a couple of pints of Real Ale most days and have done so for many years. Since draught Real Ale reached \u00a32.00 a pint I have become an infrequent visitor to pubs. I now buy from supermarkets whatever bottled or canned Real Ale is currently the best discounted offer, just so that I can have a quiet relaxing drink at home.\nThe excessive hike in alcohol duties following the 2008 Budget is not just targeting young idiot binge drinkers, but ALL DRINKERS!! It is purely a Puritanical Nanny State Revenue producing operation, that will continue what the smoking ban has started by killing-off local community pubs. I started drinking in pubs in 1972, the price of a pint of beer then was 20p, and it should be no more than \u00a31.00 now!\nAs well as threatening the existence of local community pubs, small traditional Real Ale breweries will be forced to close, losing jobs and a vital part of our culture and heritage.\nWhy not double the duty on alco-pops instead?",
