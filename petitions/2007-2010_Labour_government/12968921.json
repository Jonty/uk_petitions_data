            "background": "Bryntysilio Outdoor Education Centre, near Llangollen, North Wales is owned and subsidised by Walsall Council. There are proposals of closing this centre as a fourth option, which has provided benefits to generations of Walsall school children.\nMy son recently went to the centre as I did over 15 years ago and has benefited greatly. I understand that funding is a detrimental part of the future of Bryntysilio, but surely other options need to be exhausted rather than depriving children of this beneficial experience. The location is approximately halfway between Walsall and the coast of North Wales and provides the ideal educational opportunity by the proximity of rural life and the coast especially for children from low income families.\nI encourage the right honourable Prime Minister to support us in our plight of keeping this centre open for future generations as it is a necessity for our children. Its loss would be a significant impact for Walsall and its school children.",
