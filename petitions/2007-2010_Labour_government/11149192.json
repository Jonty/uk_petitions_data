Every year since then, June has provided a focus for the nation to recognise the part played by veterans of all ages in conflicts both past and present. The addition of a public holiday would allow all members of the public to celebrate the contibutions of all of of our armed forces. To quote a great leader 'Never was so much owed by so many to so few'",
