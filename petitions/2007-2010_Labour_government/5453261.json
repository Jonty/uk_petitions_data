            "background": "There are many co-habiting couples who see them selves as life partners but do not wish to get married due to the religious and social links that the terms marriage, man/husband and wife, and Mr and Mrs have. I would like to see the civil partnership opened to allow opposite sex couples to have a civil partnership if they wish rather than them being forced into the antiquated system of marriage in order to guarantee the same legal status as married and same sex civil partners.",
