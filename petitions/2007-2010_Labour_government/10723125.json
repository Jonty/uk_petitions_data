            "background": "With the multiplicity of speed restrictions in force on Britain's roads it is not always easy for a driver to know what speed limit is in force in any area.  The highway code says that one should assume a 30mph limit in urban areas unless roundels on street lamp posts indicate otherwise.  It is quite easy for one to miss the signs at the start of a speed restriction or one may join a road and not know the speed limit on it.  Many reminders are already in place but these are not mandatory.  Often speed limits change up and down a stretch of road and drivers are frustrated by not knowing what the limit is themselves or by other drivers driving too slow or too fast for the road.  20mph speed limits are being introduced in many urban areas and the start signs frequently go missing or people start driving after having been parked up and forget about them.  Frequent repeater roundels on lamp posts seem to be required almost everywhere.",
