        "background": "Imidacloprid is highly persistent in the soil once it has been used on a field. Two years after Imidacloprid was used in a field of oilseed rape,  the new crop was still contaminated with the chemical at a level that has been shown to have pronounced sub-lethal effects on foraging bees. Long before it kills bees, Imidacloprid affects complex behaviours like flight, navigation, vision, smell etc, and crucially in the case of queens - mating and orientation flights. It is also highly persistent in water & is equally lethal to aquatic vertebrates, invertebrates & insects. Could this be affecting farm ditches & freshwater ponds in arable crop areas? Since it attacks all animal nervous-systems, Imidacloprid and its related poisons like Fipronil and Clothianidin, kill 100% of all earthworms and soil invertebrates in any treated field: beetles, cranefly larvae, slugs, snails \u2013 all are killed. Many animals like hedgehogs, shrews & many more bird species depend on insects & larvae. Since virtually all arable crop land in the UK is now saturated with Imidacloprid, is it surprising that we are seeing a decline in wildlife?",
