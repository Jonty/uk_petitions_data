            "background": "The Prime Minister's good work is being hampered by speculation about his future. If he resigns as Labour leader, but pledges to remain Prime Minister, he could focus on the business of government unhampered by electoral concerns, or indeed widespread concern about his tenure as Labour leader. His successor as party leader could then campaign for their own mandate in government, unhampered by the actual business of government (just as the other party leaders do).",
