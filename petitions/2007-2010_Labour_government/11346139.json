Old people, rather like soldiers, often have the misfortune to be trapped in an institution that the Government would rather ignore. \n\nThe British Army is, of course, an institution that is widely renowned and respected abroad for its efficiency and courage. Its prevailing tragedy is that it is not respected by our Goverment.",
