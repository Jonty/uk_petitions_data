            "background": "If you have given birth in the UK and breast feeding is not an option, the best thing for your new child(ren) is to express breast milk for them.  If your child(ren) are in SCBU then you can borrow a breast pump for free which is excellent and gives them the best start possible.  If you want to continue this after hospital you are forced to hire one at great expense or buy one.  The current cost of a hospital grade machine to the general public is in excess of \u00a3700 and to rent is \u00a340 per month.  Considering all the promotion the Dept for Health and Government gives to the advantages of breast milk, I feel it is rather hypocritical to levy a charge for the loan of Breast Pumps and would like to see a scheme for new mothers to be able to loan a hospital grade pump without incurring 'financial penalties'.",
