            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In this country we have hundreds of miles of rivers.It does not take a genius to work out that with some decent investment we could install hundreds \"Undershot Water Wheels\" which can generate clean enviromentally freindly electricity, collectively  they could match if not exceed output from nuclear and without the need to dispose of radioactive waste. In my own locality I can name at least 3 if not 5 sites that would be suitable for installing water mills for this purpose without the need for massive dams  and lakes. All you need is flowing water! This is not a new idea, just some good old fashioned long forgotten technology.\nAs a by product if the government took this idea on board, hundreds of construction and maintenance jobs could be created. \nOn the same lines where we already have massive reservoirs could we not install more traditional if not somewhat smaller Hydro generators to their outlets, this in itself should provide enough electricity for a small town. \n\nYours Sincerely\nAndrew Senior",
