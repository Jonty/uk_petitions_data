        "background": "Our roads are a national disgrace. Potholes alone cost British drivers a staggering \u00a31million in repairs every single day.\n\nBut while roadworks blight every city, town and village in the country, nothing ever improves.\n\nLocal authorities, gas, water, phone, TV and electricity companies routinely dig up the roads and leave holes unattended for days, causing huge tailbacks. \n\nLast year, 140 million working hours were lost in traffic jams.\n\nWorst of all, British drivers pay a staggering \u00a345 billion-a-year in motoring taxes, but just a sixth of that is invested back into our roads. \n\nEvery major motoring organisation in the country, including the AA and RAC, is backing this petition\u2026and now we need your support. \n\nPlease join us and sign up so your voice is heard. \n \nLet's Get Britain Moving.",
