I am only 1 and can't get the same training, because 1100 people can shout louder than 1. It doesn't mean it is right. I have contacted job centre plus who now offer a self service and did not offer any training or funding. I contacted PACE, they refused to help because I am not part of a large scale redundancy. Most large scale redundancies are given government money to the tune of 2000 and told to get training. This isnt available to me as I am not part of large scale redundancy. I regularly ask if there is any more training available at the job centre but nothing more is available.",
