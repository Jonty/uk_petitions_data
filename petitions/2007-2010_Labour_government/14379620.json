            "background": "It 'IS' against the law to not pay maintenance, yet there is no civil enforcement powers in place to make absent parents pay.\n\nThis is a contradiction in terms and this needs dealing with, with immediate effect to ensure that 'children' receive maintenance in order for them to not fall into the poverty trap hence enabling single parents to return to work. This is the sort of enforement this country needs to 'GET TOUGH WITH ABSENT PARENTS' by NOT allowing huge debts to accumulate and spiral out of control and to not pay maintenance in the form of arrears over the next 50 years. These children need this money NOW not when they are in there 60's.\nWhen going to court to recoup arrears the CSA/CMEC want to ensure that the debt is paid back within 2 years so ensure that the judge and the clerk of the court are fully aware as to whether the absent parents pays maintenance and fully arm them with any procedures prior to a court case that proves they are able to pay but just refuse to meet there moral obligations towards there children",
