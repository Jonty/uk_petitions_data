            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "A 50% tax rate (plus NI and removing the personal allowance) is proven to be economically counterproductive. At best it raises a paltry sum in comparison to treasury funds required over the next 5 years, at worst it results in a net reduction in taxable income.  It creates a disincentive for the most productive members of society from wanting to maximise their gross income, pushes high performers to move overseas, and reduces the disposable cash available for discretionary spending.\nThis is a socialist effort to lock the stable door after the many horses have bolted, and looks to penalise the performers of the future (under hopefully improved regulation) for the sins of society and governments of the past. \n\nWhat's the point of creating new legislation to reduce the treasuries income and make Britain less competitive.",
