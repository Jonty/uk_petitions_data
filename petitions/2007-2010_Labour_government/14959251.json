            "background": "It is time language education served our economy and the lives and aspirations of individuals in Britain. I propose beside the traditional modern foreign languages such as French, German and Spanish, the Government should encourage the mandatory learning of less traditional languages such as Chinese, Arabic, Japanese and Turkish. As well as being our trading partners and locations where many British companies are based and British people work (Dubai, Tokyo, Shanghai..), the countries where these countries are spoken are important emerging economies in the world.  The economic opportunities for Britain as a country and for individuals would be great.",
