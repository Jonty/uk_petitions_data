Usually this entertainment involves the Carling Beer Amnesty, which not only plays great tunes, but also provides cold Carling in the manner of 'A Can for a Can'. This was not present at the 2009 festival and many festival goers with camping tickets were gutted. We, the undersigned, would love it back in 2010 if at all possible and we ask the Prime Minister to ask the IOW festival and Carling to provide this for the thousands of people it usually entertains!",
