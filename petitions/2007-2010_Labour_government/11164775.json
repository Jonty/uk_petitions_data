            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The 'Single Survey' scheme, due to be introduced on the 1st December 2008 for properties first marketed on or after that date is likely to have a detrimental effect on the recovery of a struggling housing market in Scotland.  Not only will sellers be required to purchase a survey to meet the requirements of the scheme, which is likely to cost them up \u00a3820 a time (The Herald) and has an estimated shelf life of 3 months, but buyers are likely to require a home buyers report in addition to this as it remains unclear whether mortgage lenders will accept the 'Single Survey'.  The result is multiple surveys, the very thing the new legislation is intended to prevent.  In addition to this the 'Single Survey' is likely to be less comprehensive than a current Scheme 2 homebuyers survey, which is currently pretty much standard for buyers of older properties.  \nThe introduction of such a scheme in the current climate of recession is likely to hinder the recovery of the housing market in Scotland.",
