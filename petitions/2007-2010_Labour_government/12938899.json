            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "It does NOT make sense for under 25s on Income-based Jobseekers Allowance to have a \u00a360 a week restriction on their housing benefits meaning they have to pay the remaining balance of the rent a week out of their benefits. For example, rent costing \u00a3104 a week will only have \u00a360.65 paid weekly towards their rent from the council meaning out of \u00a350.95 per week, they are required to pay \u00a340.45 towards the rent, leaving \u00a310.50 to pay gas/electric bills, water rates and buy food. \n\nHowever, if you are over 25 you get all your rent paid by the council and get \u00a364.30 per week from benefits to yourself. \n\nRecent studies have also shown that people between the ages of 17-24 are finding it the hardest to find a job during the recession.\n\nThis is obviously unfair to those under 25 with no family in the surrounding area and can not live at home.\n\nThis restriction needs to be abolished to help under 25s get out of poverty.",
