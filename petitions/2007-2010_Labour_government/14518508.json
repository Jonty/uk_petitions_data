            "background": "The MOD should not axe the Officer's Training Corps on the grounds of simply saving it's 82m per annum budget. In comparison to the horrendous overspending of MOD Producurement the OTC must offer much better value for money. The overspend on the current Nimrod project alone could run the OTC for over 17 years. In addition to recruiting high quality Officers in both the Army and other services, none-serving ex-OTC members give the Armed Forces support as future business leaders. Prior to considering axing the OTC cuts should be made to reduce/stop overspend in MOD procurement . Alternatively operation of the OTC with reduced and/or no pay to cadets should be considered.",
