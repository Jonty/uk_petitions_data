            "background": "The new licensing laws that allow pubs and clubs to open later simply do not work. Instead of encouraging people to leave when they want they simply mean that a vast horde of drunk people are released onto the streets at 2 AM rather than at 11 30 PM. This not only stretches the police force but also blights the lives of those people who still maintain (sometimes listed) houses in our town centres. The Department of Culture says that there is a broad consensus in favour of the new laws. Perhaps they might hear a different answer if they asked residents who live in provincial towns and to this end I invite Gordon brown to visit a small market town at 2 AM and see the effects of the new licensing laws for himself.",
