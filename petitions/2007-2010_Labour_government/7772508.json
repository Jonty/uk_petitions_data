If you are a prospective Job seeker you have to crawl through many adverts before finding a geniune one.\n\nThe government should support the people who are seeking a job by legislating this to make a clear path for candidates to be able to actually apply for jobs that are geniunely advertising rather than trawl through the data capture minefield. \n\nThis would benefit businesses who are employing, the government as the time taken to find a job will massively decrease and also benefit the job seeker as they will be able to find a job quicker, more secure and also show the true figures of available jobs rather than false statistics.\n\nIf it were made law that all positions have to be geniune this would show that the government are making a positive step for the welfare of the persons who want to work.",
