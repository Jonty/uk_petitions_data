            "background": "Global Warming is a huge problem, as I am sure you are aware, yet renewable energy is not the way forward.  Nuclear Power stations are currently mainly Nuclear Fission reactors, and although these produce Nuclear Waste, this can be dealt with safely, and the reactors themselves are very safe when maintained correctly.  The National Grid requires a constant base load to provide power to people, and renewable energy forms such as solar and wind power cannot provide this due to the volatility of how they produce energy.  Nuclear Power can provide this, and research into Nuclear Fusion which is a clean and safe form of Nuclear Power could help replace the Nuclear Fission reactors that can cause minor problems if need be.  We urge the Prime Minister to introduce more nuclear power stations, and provide more support for research into nuclear fusion.  Thank You.",
