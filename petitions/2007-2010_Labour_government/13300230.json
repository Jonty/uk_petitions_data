Such a tiny\n     thing does get votes but when it comes to things like...\n\n     The war in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Lisbon treaty, the\n     European Union and even who our actual prime minister is!! \n     These things are not important enough for the public majority\n     but a simple congestion charge is?\n\n     Prime minister. LISTEN TO THE PUBLIC MAJORITY!",
