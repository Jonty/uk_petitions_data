            "background": "We the undersigned propose the following:\n\n1. Charge charge students the full for providing a university education. They will be provided with a loan for the fee with the interest rate linked to inflation.\n\n2. Provide students with a generous \"living loan\", also with the interest rate linked to inflation.\n\n3. When a students passes (does not drop out) both loans are written off.\n\n4. Students are about to drop out, are encouraged to stay on to complete their course. If they fail, the loan must be paid back over a generous duration of time.\n\nThis carrot and stick approach will encourage people to work harder and discourage layabouts from enrolling as a holiday. It will also help reduce class sizes in lectures and seminars.",
