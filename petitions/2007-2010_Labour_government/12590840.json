            "background": "Many parents returning to work would prefer a close family member to care for their child, they know the child, and the parents trust them above all others. \n\nUnfortunatly, even if the relative is a registered childcare provider parents are unable to claim the child care element of tax credits to pay the relative to care for the child. \n\nFinancially it is usually impossible for the relative to give up work to care for the child for free, and it is usually impossible for the parent to be able to afford the cost of full child care. \n\nThis petition is to allow parents to apply for childcare allowance for relatives, if they are a registered childcare provider - ie childminder, nanny, nursery practitioner. They have done the training for the position but are unable to use their expertise when it comes to family members.",
