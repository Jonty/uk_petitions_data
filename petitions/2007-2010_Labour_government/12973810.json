            "background": "Britain has only had a European capital of culture status twice. Once with Glasgow in 1990 and once with Liverpool in 2008.\nFrance and Belgium have had it four times\nHolland, Greece, Spain and Italy have had it three times. According to the future plans Britain wont have it again until at least 2020! Giving Belgium, France, Italy, Holland and Spain that status again before 2020. Even Germany and Portugal will get this status a third time before us.\n\nCan we have Manchester nominated for this status? That will give Britain this status a third time.\n\nEuropean capital of couture is a great thing for any city and it would be a fantastic thing for Manchester. Probably just what we need to improve some of the most neglected areas in the country, to get children off the streets. This would be a fantastic thing for Manchester and the people of Britain.",
