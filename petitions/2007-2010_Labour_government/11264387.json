They then check to see if the deceased had a MySpace profile, and dig up everything they can about this person.\n\nThis is done without asking permission from the bereaved families. They simply talk about, make fun of and ridicule the dead without having known them at all. They take pictures from the deceased's profiles and parade them on the website, and are glamourising death and the dead - which is unhealthy. Their focus on death should be stopped or they should at least need to ask permission of the families of those they wish to discuss.",
