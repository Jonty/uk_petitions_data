            "background": "Why do MPs that live within a 1.5 hour train journey of Westminster need a 2nd home allowance? The Cambridgeshire East MP (travelling time <> 55 mins) could travel back and forth whenever needed in parliament, on occasions that there are late night sessions are required a hotel room would prove much cheaper than his expenses claim for rent and council tax on a second home. The same could be said for all MPs living within this distance of Westminster. We need to stop all Mps that live within a commutable distance from claiming second homes allowances.",
