            "action": "amend the logo for the London 2012 Olympic Games to include a capital \u2018L\u2019, thus preventing the widespread implicit endorsement of incorrect grammar.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "It would be irresponsible for the Government to allow the London 2012 logo to continue in its present form as 'london 2012'.  A capital letter belongs at the start of a proper noun and by endorsing its omission the Government is encouraging children and adults alike to abandon important rules of writing in preference for stylistic touches.\nDue to the massive global reach of this logo it would not be appropriate to continue with it in its present form.  An ammendment now would prevent doing so in the future when associated costs would be increased, and should be done publically to emphasise the importance of grammer in all walks of life.",
