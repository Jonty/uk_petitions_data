            "background": "Road/tyre/aerodynamic/engine and exhaust noise are at unacceptable levels - particularly exhaust noise, which,surely,cannot comply with MOT regulations,or is not being tested properly,or vehicles are modified illegally after testing - or the limits are too high!Together with excessive noise,go excessive speed,fuel consumption and emissions - and road collisions, injuries and death! Speed and noise are used to display aggression by an anti-social minority, which needs taming.At all hours,lives & sleep are being disrupted by shrieking exhaust noise well above any acceptable level - crack down on this anti-social minority and get a grip on MOT enforcement - if they can't make this horrific din,they may slow down and you may cut pollution and fuel wastage AND save lives.Police trafic patrols don't exist,which is carte blanche for the speed/noise/pollution terrorists - cameras don't detect noise or pollution and motorcycles are immune,with their undersized number plates,rendering identification impossible - the chances of encountering a police check on our roads are less than winning the lottery - and the petrol head speed & noise merchants know it!",
