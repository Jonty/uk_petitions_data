Mandatory assistance to pregnant mothers who smoke to stop should be provided. Enforcing penalties for those who refuse to accept the help. The health care pregnant woman receive from midwifes, doctors, antenatal clinics and labour wards should have an increased focused on assisting women to stop successfully and discourage smoking while pregnant all together.\nProviding this kind of support while a child is developing in the womb will eventually reduces the costs to the NHS in treating and curing childhood illness. Retailers of tobacco products have the right to refuse sale to anyone they believe under the legal age, this legislation should include unborn children carried by their mothers.",
