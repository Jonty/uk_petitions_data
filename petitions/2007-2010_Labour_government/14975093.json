        "background": "Life in the UK is tough.\n\nNever mind the recession, the gloomy weather, the government, the gloomy weather, the endless traffic jams, the gloomy weather, the tepid brown liquid which passes for tea and of course, the gloomy weather.\n\nEvery day millions of hard working UK citizens invest hours of their time helping to make other people fat and rich through thankless toil and meaningless targets.\n\nIt is time this government took real action and addressed the real day-to-day challenges people experience.\n\nWe in the UK have resigned ourselves to gloomy weather, MPs with little idea of how to use a calculator, celebrities who believe the world revolves around them, weak tea, laws which protect the culprits and punish the innocent.\n\nAs UK citizens we demand more. We demand a free biscuit allowance for all those in work. And not just any biscuit - chocolate biscuits - the ones you can dunk in your pale lukewarm cuppa. We are British, and it is pleasures such as these which will make us stand tall, and proud and determined to make this once great country great once again.",
