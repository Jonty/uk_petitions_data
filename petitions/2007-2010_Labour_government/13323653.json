            "background": "ASLEF has recently called for a six day drivers strike from 21st September to 26th September 2009. In light of recent disputes and the severe disruption they brought to passengers, this latest action is unwarranted and unnaceptable. National Express East Anglia has shown an inability to manage the franchise for the benefit of its customers or secure the support and goodwill its staff. In light of their mis-handling of the East Coast franchise and now employment disputes within the East Anglia operation, we, the passengers and staff of NXEA, have no confidence in their continued ability to manage the East Anglia franchise.",
