            "background": "Given UK pubs are in decline due to the smoking ban, and local pubs are closing every day, why not put the price of alcohol up to 50p/unit in shops (such as high street stores) ONLY, but keep the price low in pubs & clubs.\n\nThat way, people will go to pubs to drink 'cheaply', and under-age drinking will not be allowed due to the age restriction of drinking in pubs.\n\nThis could create more custom for pubs, keeping more pub businesses going.\n\nWith the cost of drink more expensive in shops, the desired result of deterring binge drinking could be curbed by restricting access to cheap booze by those who are under age.",
