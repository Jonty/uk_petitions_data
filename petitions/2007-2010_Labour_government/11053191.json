They devote huge amounts of effort and money to follow the England team around the world.\n\nWe urge the Prime Minister to persuade the FA to hold an England charity football match on St. George's Day - England's National Day.\n\nWe don't expect the first team squad, the under-21s or similar will do fine. We just want to see if the FA are as passionate about England as the fans.",
