        "background": "Since the creation of the Accumulated Campaign Service Medal (ACSM), the military service that qualified for a UN or NATO Medal does not count towards the totals required for ACSM eligibility. These tours of duty were just as operationally demanding and many serving personnel completed multiple tours in the likes of Bosnia, Kosovo, Congo etc. What the MOD is implying is that they do not recognise this service as being worthy of a british issued medal.\nThis small gesture would go a long way to addressing the matter.",
