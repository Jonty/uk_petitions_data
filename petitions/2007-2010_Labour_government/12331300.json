Criminals  are being entertained for free whilst the victims of their crimes who are left unable to work struggle to pay for their licence and can not afford the luxury of the internet. Victims  left in care homes should not have to pay for the simple pleasure of watching TV in the privacy of their own room whilst inmates watch in their cells for free.",
