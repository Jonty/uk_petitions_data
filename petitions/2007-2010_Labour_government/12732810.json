        "background": "I would like to propose that the existing emergency service vehicle siren be replaced with a siren which is less disruptive to residents. I would propose the following:\n\n1. A directional siren which targets the area in front of the vehicle only, leaving those to the side and behind relatively quiet. This is where the sound is required. Why have a unidirectional siren blaring out at 100db when you're trying to get people out of the way?\n\n2. More discretion about when sirens are used at night, using them only when essential. Further to this, when they are used, a 'night mode' could be adopted which is designed for use when the ambient sound pressure level drops at night and the siren sound level can also be dropped accordingly.",
