            "background": "Now that the RSPCA has pulled out of the UK's annual Cruft show it is about time that the government also took steps to stop the public parade of in-bred dogs\n\nAs an example the King Charles spaniel, many are suffering from syringomyelia, which is when a dog's brain is too big for its skull. It is compared to a size 9 foot being shoved into a size 5 shoe. Alot of Boxer dogs also suffer from epilepsy, pugs with breathing problems and bulldogs who are unable to mate or give birth unassisted. The in-breeding is too extreme and should be banned.\n\nBelow is a quote from the RSPCA's chief vet, stated in a BBC programme: \"What I see in front of me is a parade of mutants. It's some freakish, garish beauty pageant that has nothing frankly to do with health and welfare.\"\n\nHelp to stop this in-breeding program and public display of the poor animals for human self satisfication.",
