        "background": "We would like to urge the Prime Minister to introduce a law which forces all bus companies (i.e Arriva, Stagecoach, Selkent) to make their service free to all under 16's and students, cheaper for under 18's that are not in full time education, our OAP's and those who have been made redundant. This will lead to more people taking buses all over your country, thus less cars on the road, and greener country.",
