            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "FACT:Councils all over the UK are forcing the transport home to school upon parents who choose to send their children to a Denoninational school instead of a Council school. In doing this, The Councils are directly imposing financial hardship for many families in the UK.  \n\nFACT: Local Authorities do not have a statutory duty to provide school transport if the child does not go to a Council school.\nMY PROPOSAL: The Local Authorities must have responsibility for home to school transport to all UK children, regardless if a child goes to a Council school or to a Denominational school.  Councils must do all they can to CREATE SCHOOL BUSES where walking and cycling is not safe.\nAll children should have a right to access their school.\n\nPlease sign this Petition in support.\n\nPlease help in the name of Diversity and Equality.",
