        "action": "enable the continued use of asthma inhalers with CFC propellants until alcohol-free alternatives are available.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The use of asthma inhalers containing propellants with CFCs is being phased out in the UK, in accordance with a change to the Montreal Protocol made in 1997, despite the fact that originally medical devices deemed \"essential uses,\" such as inhalers, were exempted from the protocol, and that CFC inhalers release negligible amounts of CFCs and do not pose a threat to ozone depletion. Currently, the only available substitutes for these inhalers contain alcohol (ethanol). This means that asthmatic children, as well as women with asthma who are pregnant, breast-feeding or trying to conceive will be forced to consume alcohol on a daily basis. The new inhalers are also inappropriate for people whose religion does not allow them to consume alcohol.",
