            "background": "Scrap the proposed increases in vehicle excise duty for vehicles registered before 2006 as this unfairly penalises many people who own cars over 3 years old. Making this increase retrospective does not give people choice as many could not afford to buy a vehicle with a lower Co2 rating. It would also make older cars unsellable due to the higher VED rates payable.",
