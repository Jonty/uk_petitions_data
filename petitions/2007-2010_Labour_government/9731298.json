            "background": "We as students of the United Kingdom have to pay many other fees to go to university. On top of these fees if we want to just watch terrestrial  television to relax to whilst not working then we have to pay an extra \u00a3139.50! We may only watch it once/twice a week but even if this is the case we have to pay the full amount which to a student is a lot of money.\n\nAfter talking to many other students we have come to the conclusion that we should be entitled to a discount off this fee.",
