It is there indefinitely and prevents the subject of this report from working with children, even as a volunteer, and may affect employment chances to the extent that early retirement must be considered.\n\nA review can be requested from the Information Commissioner, which is referred back to the Police Authority. Comments are merely added \u2013 appeals are allowed only through the High Court beyond the means of most people. Justice is therefore denied.\n\nIn one incident, a man of 40 responded to a girl of 13 who had a crush on him by confiding in her parents that he wished to wait for the girl to grow up before allowing any relationship with her to develop. Police investigation found no crime. This was evidence that he had openly come to terms with a perilous situation and avoided committing a crime. This man is now finding himself permanently blacklisted from secure employment.",
