            "background": "During the tenure of this present government, so much legislation has gone onto our statute books which were never mentioned when seeking election? & things promised were renaged on e.g. the elimination of our freedom of speech, Health & Safety overkill, etc.\nNo top-up fees, Referenda on contencious issues etc.  Also our armed forces have become embroiled in two areas of conflict which have nothing to do with this country, and apart from the appalling loss of life of our service personell is costing us a fortune, for which we get not thanks, but threats.  Given the dire financial state of our country the petition I want to propose will hopefully prevent such things happening again.",
