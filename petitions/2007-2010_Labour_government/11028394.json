        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "On 6th Novemeber 2008 the Bank of England's Base Rate was reduced by 1.5% to 3%. On the face of it, this was good news for the Country as a whole and, in particular, for all of those paying mortgages or proposing to take out new mortgages. On closer inspection however, it is apparent that many lenders are not passing the benefit of the rate cut to their existing or prospective customers. Many lenders have already chosen to withdraw the availablity of variable rate mortgages to new customers and will not pass on the benefit of the rate cut to existing customers. The Government, where possible, should encourage or compell lenders to pass on the benfit of the rate cut.",
