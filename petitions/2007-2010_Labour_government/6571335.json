            "background": "While most would accept that it is prudent, with climate change and CO2 emissions a big issue, that the government should do all it can to tackle this problem. To do so by having high taxation on vehicle fuel is a very blunt approach. It unfairly taxes those who already pay more, those in rural and remote areas who do not have the option to switch to public transport. Therefore the government should implement a split taxation regime, with higher taxes on fuel in areas where the public have the option to use public transport. Or alternately, instead of charging different taxation on fuel in different areas there could be a scheme that allows residents of rural areas to reclaim tax paid on vehicle fuel.",
