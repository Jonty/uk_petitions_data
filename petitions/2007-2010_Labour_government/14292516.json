        "background": "The world is not facing a threat from global warming, but global cooling.\n\nIn Europe, most of the USA and even in Asia, including China, many of us in the early days of 2010 are currently experiencing extreme cold weather.\n\nI call on the government to increase taxes - and to spend the revenue on sun farms. A sun farm would use electricity to power huge lamps that might heat an area the size of a small town.\n\nI have studied temperatures globally over the last few months and if the world continues to cool at the current trend the whole of humanity is threatened.",
