            "background": "My stepfather died from Mesothelioma, Pleural thickening and other asbestos-related diseases, but despite starting the claim process more than 3 years ago, the claim is no further forward. My mother, who is continuing the claim has severe heart disease, and the continued stress caused by not even being given a date yet for the claim to go to court is enormous, and deteriorating her own health. We have heard of some cases taking 5 years or longer just to reach the courts. We have been told that if my Mother dies before the claim is decided, the claim will die with her, meaning no-one else in the family can continue the claim and the company responsible will no longer be liable. We request the time for such claims to reach a court for decision and settlement is reduced to a maximum of 3 years, after which the claimant has an immediate right to be given a date for a court hearing.",
