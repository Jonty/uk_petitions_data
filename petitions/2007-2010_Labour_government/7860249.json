The latest of these threats is being led by the FBI which they call \"Server in the Sky\" where an unacceptable amount of very personal data of UK citizens will be made available to law enforcement officials from a number of countries.  It has already been proved such data is not safe to store.  That this is being considered at a time when the government has proved itself unable to protect the data it already has we should not be expected to put ourselves at further risk.  As an IT professional I am convinced it will be absolutely impossible to keep all of this data safe and that very serious losses will occur, losses which have the potential to ruin the lives of many millions of people from many countries.  I petition the Prime Minister to do the honourable thing and put the interests of the people of Britain before those of another nation, even an ally.  Keep us safe, keep us out.",
