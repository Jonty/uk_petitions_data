It is not fair to put the bill on those who were not even in the bankers' casinos to subsidise the cost of recession. Few on IS even put someone else's money into accommodation to distort the housing market.\nIt is always better to smooth flows of funds. In this we move to abolish bank holidays and weekends for 24x7x365.25 computer uptime to the 9th 9.\nA regressive move to fortnightly benefit payments is potentially another 10p tax issue?",
