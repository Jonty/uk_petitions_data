            "background": "To increase the powers of the Children's Commissioner (England) to enable them to view children's files and records held by local authorities, in situations when it has evidence that they appear to be acting against the best interests of children.\n\nFor instance, it has recently been reported (Guardian May 09) that many children have been trafficked through a Hillingdon Council home for children. \n\nHowever, the Council refused to provide details of children going missing from it's care much earlier(requested in Jan 08) or provide access to children's records and files, because the Commissioner did not have the power to do so. If they had the power the Trafficking no doubt would have been identified much earlier on.\n\nMore background information can be found at:\n\nHillingdon Council and others, trafficking of children\nhttp://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/hillingdon_council_and_others_tr#outgoing-20885",
