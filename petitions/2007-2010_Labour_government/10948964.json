        "background": "for years if you rent, then you are entitled to help with the payments if you find yourself in dept or out of work from no fault of your own.....also for years a homeowner, whom, through all intents and purposes, are trying to get along with life and have something to show for it, have had no help, not at least for 5 months, this I understand has been reduced to three months, but it still is NOT good enough, if I were unemployed and rented I could afford to live, but because I own my house(even though I rent it from the bank!)I get no help whatsoever; I think it is totally wrong and unjust, not forgetting owner discrimination. LET\u2019S HAVE HELP NOW, BEFORE THE BANK DECIDES TO TAKE MY HOUSE FROM MY FAMILY AND ME.",
