            "background": "The Cabinet of Worcestershire County Council stated in their meeting of 12th September 2005 that if the Infants' and Junior Schools were amalgamated the school would be \"too big and not educationally desirable\". We strongly agree with this statement.\n\nWe feel that any changes made to our schools should not be based on political decisions and financial economies of scale, which we believe would be detrimental to the children's stability and would not promote their continuity of education.",
