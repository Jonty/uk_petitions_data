It's gone against the people with the 10p tax row, fuel taxation, removing prisoners first pay-rise for a decade, the 42 day terror law, car-tax increases, HIPs - which are all forcing commerical failure and economic crisis for working voters. Call a general election and let the people decide who they want.",
