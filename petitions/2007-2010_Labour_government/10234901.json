            "background": "Virtually all the bungalows and ground floor properties close to shops are restricted to applicants of over 50 and often over 60, on the council house application lists. I can understand that the disabled should be given priority for ground floor accomodition, but a 16 year old can be even more disabled than a 90 year old. Putting age restrictions on council properties is ageism, and all it does is segregate people according to age, create abnormal communities, and make it impossible for young people to get a council property.",
