            "background": "The motorist in the UK has long been the whipping boy for tax collection. The vast amount of a litre of petrol is tax revenue and this must stop and be immediately reduced by a minimum of forty percent. Hikes in road tax, parking charges etc have all been designed purposely by the government to raise tax from one area of the people. This is discriminatory by being out of proportion to other taxes. Have we become so stupid in this country that we just accept anything now. USE THIS PETITION TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MOTORIST GETS A FAIR DEAL.",
