The medal would cost pence, certainly a lot less than the  recently issued lapel badge, cost.  This may be the last time, men and women who served their Sovereign and country, can be acknowledged. Normally medals are issued to existing members of the armed forces and establishment figures. The rank and file are as usual forgotten. They to are proud and remember their serviceand devotion to their country.The government should use this opportunity to remember the service of a dwindling group of men and women.",
