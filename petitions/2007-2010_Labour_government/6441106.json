            "background": "I've recently started noticing that instead of putting, e.g., \"take one morning and evening\" on bottles of medicine (or pills) the label just says \"to be taken as instructed by the prescriber\".  This is obviously much more convenient for pharmacists but what if the patient CAN'T REMEMBER how many to take and at what intervals?  This could even result in an overdose! which, quite apart from the obvious effect on the individual, would be far more inconvenient to the N.H.S. as a whole than simply giving each patient full instructions on how to take his/her medicine.",
