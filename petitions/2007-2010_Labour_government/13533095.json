        "background": "Many politicians, including the Mayor of London Boris Johnson have in the past expressed an interest in ingegrating the study of Classics (including languages such as Latin and Ancient Greek) as a possiblity into the National Curriculum however; up until now the study of Classics is still mostly reserved to public and grammar schools. The study of the classics is the study of the world, and to open up this area of oppertunity to regular school pupils would benefit society dramaticaly as a whole.",
