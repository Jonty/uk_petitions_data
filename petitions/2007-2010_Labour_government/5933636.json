            "background": "The HSE burden us all continually with more and more legislation to try to remove all risk from peoples lives. This is having a dreadful effect on the freedom of people to take part in many different activities, for example:\n1. Childrens playground games are banned by schools because of HSE recommedations.\n2. Bonfire night without bonfires because the organisers cannot afford to meet the HSE regulations & afford the subsequent insurance.\n3. Air displays severly curtailed because the insurance is so expensive due the the HSE regulations.\n4. Churches cannot afford to have high light bulbs changed due to HSE regulations about working from ladders.\n\nI could go on & on with the same stupidity - taken to extremes if the HSE continues we will all sit in padded rooms all day & do nothing - the HSE will then presumable be satisfied that we are all 'safe'!\nThe HSE are altering the way we all conduct our lives and are taking away our freedom to decide how we conduct our lives. I don't want to be told by a Government Department that I can't do something because they have decided that its too dangerous - I want to make that decision myself and take responsibilty for my descision.",
