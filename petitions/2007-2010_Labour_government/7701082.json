            "background": "Christopher Standen, inventor of the vehicle emission diverter recognised that most cars on Britains roads, particularly of european origin, pump fumes directly onto the pavement area.  This of course gives rise to the number of pedestrians breathing in fumes from exhausts directly into their lungs that causes conditions such as Asthma.  The way those vehicles exhausts are set up, means that the health of Britains people is compromised.  Should support by the Primeminister be given, the vehicle emission diverter will prove to be an effective way of diverting traffic fumes away from pedestrian walkways in Britain .",
