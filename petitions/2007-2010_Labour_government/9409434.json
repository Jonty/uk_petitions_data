            "background": "The price of petrol and diesel is excessive, it is hurting British business and the ordinary motorist.  The tax and duty system on fuel should be used to stabilise the price of petrol and diesel at below \u00a31 per litre.  This would help the haulage industry and help the ordinary motorist at a time when the oil price has hit a record high.",
