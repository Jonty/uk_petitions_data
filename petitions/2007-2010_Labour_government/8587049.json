        "background": "There is no doubt that the dominance of the four main supermarkets is contributing to the split between rural, farming communities and the consumer. The function of this office would be to promote quality food. It would fund this by imposing a 5% cheap food tax, the proceeds of which would be split between organisations promoting quality. This would help both rural communities; small, local retailers and the nations health.",
