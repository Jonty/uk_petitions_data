        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Thousands of members of the general public are  converting their vehicles to use alternative fuels, such as LPG, Bioethanol and Bio-diesel.  This serves to reduce their carbon footprint, and the CO2 emissions of their vehicles.  This should be recognised by the government, and, as an incentive for more members of the general public to make the switch to alternative fuels, the Government should give discounts on the Road Fund Licence (\"Road Tax\") for any vehicles which have been converted to use alternative fuels.",
