        "background": "As you will be aware, the weather this winter is severe and is causing the U.K to come to a complete stand still in many regions (Northern Ireland included.)  There are many people, either single or as part of a family, who are not able to afford the cost of the ever rising price of fuel.  Some people are currently entitled part of a cold weather payment , which does not stretch far enough to be able to afford a delivery of fuel anyway, however these people have to 'tick the right boxes' to be eligable.  Not everyone fits the correct criteria, but this does not mean that they are financially in a better position to be able to keep a warm house- something everyone has the right to.  We believe that everybody on any recognised, means tested State benefit should be entitled to a full allowance (by means of a State loan if need be (which are also being rejected)) to provide themselves and thier dependants the warmth in their own home that they should have the right to expect.",
