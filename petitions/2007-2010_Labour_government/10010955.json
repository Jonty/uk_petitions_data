            "background": "The majority of diagnostic scans are conducted at 16 weeks - because only then can the fetus be adequately visualised for the purpose that scans are conducted - to check size, growth, embryogenesis and give parents the choice of termination of indicated by disability. Pro - life activists, embodied in HEF cries undermines the reproductive rights of each individual to receive healthcare appropriate to them, judging each case by it's merits.\n\nThe petitioner is urging the PM to intervene to see fair play. Only parents who have to live for the rest of their lives with a disabled child and the professionals providing services for them should be involved in this decision - making process - NOT pressure groups, busy - bodies and do - gooders who infringe civil liberties, though they do not themselves have any parental, financial or legislative responsibilities to a disabled offspring.\n\nWe the undersigned urge the P.M. to address how this kind of voyeurism on other people's grief and distress, fuelled by the media, whose press photographers get paid for every snapshot, is detrimentally affecting care, particularly in the emergency services for Britain's citizens.",
