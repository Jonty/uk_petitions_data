            "background": "Given that the increased number of different mediums, a company can communicate with the nation as a whole from within the UK or outside of it on a world scale through the internet. I feel that it has become apparent that media groups have accumulated a great deal of power and influence across state and country boundaries. This can only be self serving and not in the interest of humanity. Any one company having a mass amount of influence through differing outlets and entities, I feel that it is undemocratic and not in the interests of the UK or its people as a whole. This shouldn\u2019t be allowed to continue. \n\nThus I petition the PM to limit the number of outlets to communicate with the public that any one company can control within the UK, be that newspaper, TV/radio station, website, Mobile Phone Company or any other media communications device or medium.",
