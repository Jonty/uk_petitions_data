            "background": "Too much money is wasted on uniform, cars and kit that should be spent on fighting crime. Individual force badges can be retained but other aspects should be dictated nationally. All kit should be fit for purpose eg. Moisture removing T-shirts for use under body armour. Stop wasting public money on individual force choices, the worst examples being the Met kit, chose from the other forces who have had to economise long ago but retained usability superior to the Met. Too many forces use inappropriate combinations [ties with body armour] or multiple types of vehicles that are not purpose built compromising health & safety or value for money.",
