Whether one agrees with the Chinese occupation or not, PM Brown must show that the British people recognise the right of ordinary citizens to protest, and to voice their concerns.  In the lead up to the Olympics, this nation must state firmly that we denounce all attemps to silence the Tibetan people by force.",
