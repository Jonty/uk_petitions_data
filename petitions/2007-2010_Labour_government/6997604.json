        "background": "Currently, only the names and occupations of the bride and groom's fathers are asked for on a marriage certificate. We need marriage certificates to be brought up to date and display the equality modern-day marriage is meant to embody. This disregard for mothers' importance is outdated, offensive and implies both social and familial inferiority. Sign this petition today and help our country take another small step towards making sexism history.",
