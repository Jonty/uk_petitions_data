One hypothesis is that bees arebringing into their hives traces of pesticides called neonicotinoids, whose use has expanded greatly in the past few years. Some scientists believe that these damage the development of the bee larvae, and inhibit the queen's production of eggs. As a result, these pesticides have already been withdrawn from sale in France, Germany, Italy and Slovenia.",
