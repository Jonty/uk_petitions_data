            "background": "In simple terms, banks that have received government help should reciprocate by giving its customers easy access to small amounts like \u00a31000-2500 loans and or overdraft.  This will soften the crisis, keep the public spending, the high street open and the banks indirectly in business and in the short term, hopefully, keep the government in power.  Medium term, everybody gains including the government. Credit card charges should also be reduced drastically to mitigate the present siege mentality of the general public.  We can worry about inflation later. Either way, money has to re-enter the messed up system again to really avoid deflation!",
