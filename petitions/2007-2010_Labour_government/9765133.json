        "background": "Whilst it is fair to say that a company car is generally a benefit it needs to be recognised that there are a percentage of people who need a company car to fulfil their work but DO NOT use the vehicle privately. The ruling that exists for zero tax on company vans (if no private use) should be extended to company cars. The driver must of course take responsibility for recording all genuine business mileage and being able to prove the vehicles use.",
