            "background": "The people of Forsbrook request Gordon Brown to listen to the people and assist the village by instructing Staffordshire County Council to install a crossing in the center of the village as promised rather than waste the money on upgrading CCTV's that dont work. The last petition was bounced backwards and forwards with no one taking responsibility, listening to or even meeting the people of the Village. All we request is some where safe to cross. Some where our Children and the Elderly can get from one side of the road to the other without taking there lives in there hands. Staffordshire County Council ignored the last petition completely showing utter contempt for the tax payers of this village. Will someone please help this before the worst happens.",
