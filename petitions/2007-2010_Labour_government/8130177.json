I was originally found to be intentionally homeless and denied any permanent accommodation.  That decision was overturned on appeal and since then I have been found a property.  The local authority in question have failed in their duty to my family and other families.  Anyone losing their home needs quick and proactive intervention not a year of uncertainty and stress",
