        "background": "Many, many people are completely fed up with the yob culture that has been allowed to sweep this country.\nPeople want something done about it and quickly.  We all have rights to go about our normal business without fear of intimidation and harm.  This right also includes our expectation that the police force is there to protect us and support us in times of need.  Not to prosecute us if we have taken steps to protect our property/family.  There is too much emphasis on the human rights of the perpetrators - what about the human rights of the victims?\nThe whole yob culture is totally out of hand and something must be done before more people are killed, maimed or too frightened to leave their own house.\nEnough is enough.",
