Currently if you own a business with a partner/spouse you can pay dividends according to shareholding. The Government want to scrap this by not allowing spouses who do not work in the business to take dividends and utlise the tax allowances available.\nSoon it won't be worth trying to run your own business. When you take into account coporation tax and high rate dividend tax the marginal rate is 57.5%. Hardly worth working hard to generate profits!",
