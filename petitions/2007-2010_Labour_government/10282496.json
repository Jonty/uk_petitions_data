            "background": "It is hoped that if people do not want to have GM food, then why not use GM technology for the use of GM Bio Fuels.\n\nIt will create jobs, create cheap instant fuel and will leave countries making food sell at a lower price. This ultimately reduces the need for foreign fuels.\n\nThe advantage of GM Bio Fuels is that you can create high levels of what you want that can make your engine run better and absorb CO2/NOx emissions. The technology is there it needs not only more research but funding for the future of Britain and the World.",
