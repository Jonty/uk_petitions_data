            "background": "Carbon Emissions are not making a difference in our climate. We, humans as a whole are only contributing to 1% of 'climate change'. There is so much carbon in the air, we are not actually making a difference. It has not ever actually been PROVED that it is making an impact, if they are worried about global warming, tell that to the dinosaurs who lived back in the pre-historical times, they didn't emit Carbon off cars did they? Yet the world still heated and cooled dramatically. In the recent ice age, the temperature plummeted during a short [In the the earth's existence] amount of time. So I am asking to stop increasing taxes on things to stop carbon emissions and just  not try to do too much about it in general, and everyone should be a lot happier.",
