            "background": "On 1st July 2007, a ban on smoking in public places came into force in England.\n\nOn 6th July 2007, Charles Kennedy MP was caught exhaling smoke through a window on the 11:05 service from Plymoth to London Paddington station.  When asked to stop smoking by train staff, Mr Kennedy refused.  This required the British Transport Police to be summoned.\n\nMr Kennedy's actions were in contravention of the Health Act 2006.  Mr Kennedy, the Member of Parliament for Ross, Skye and Lochaber, voted in favour of a smoking ban on 14th February 2006 (Source: Public Whip).\n\nAs a legislator of the United Kingdom, Mr Kennedy was fully aware of the implications of defying the aforementioned legislation.  Consequently, Mr Kennedy should be prosecuted for breech of the Health Act 2006.",
