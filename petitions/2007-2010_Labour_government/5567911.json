When asked to stop smoking by train staff, Mr Kennedy refused.  This required the British Transport Police to be summoned.\n\nMr Kennedy's actions were in contravention of the Health Act 2006.  Mr Kennedy, the Member of Parliament for Ross, Skye and Lochaber, voted in favour of a smoking ban on 14th February 2006 (Source: Public Whip).\n\nAs a legislator of the United Kingdom, Mr Kennedy was fully aware of the implications of defying the aforementioned legislation.  Consequently, Mr Kennedy should be prosecuted for breech of the Health Act 2006.",
