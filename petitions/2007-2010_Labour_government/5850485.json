If an intruder decides to enter a property illegally, then they  must accept any consequences that come their way.  My view is that the intruder makes a choice to enter a property illegally, therefore the resident has the choice to defend what is theirs without being convicted of any crime or sued by the intruder.  The law must be on the side of the law-abiding citizen not the law-breaking one.",
