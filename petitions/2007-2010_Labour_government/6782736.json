            "background": "Many people regularly encounter problems with letting agencies trading unfairly.  This may be in such manors as the letting agency charge referencing fees or other and then make business ongoingly difficult as to keep the fees charged which they state as unrefundable.  Generally, there is no governing rules, regulations or overseeing authority who people can go to asking for advice or to deal with complaints or to enforce any kind of law without paying for a lawyer.  Thus preventing people taking action and the letting agencies getting away with their unfair trading practices.  Letting agencies can join certain membership authorities, but this is optional, it should atleast be made compulsory.",
