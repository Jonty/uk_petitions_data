            "background": "The government has been keen to promote personal pensions, encouraging us to save for retirement. Due to the economic crisis many people are now finding that the value of their pension fund is worth less than their total contributions, even after many years of saving. It is also particularly galling for the general public to see bankers getting huge bonuses, paid out of the public purse, as well as having pension funds of millions of pounds. The government was very quick to guarantee savers\u2019 deposits when the banks were in trouble and should now guarantee all contributions made into personal pensions, thereby giving equal treatment to those who have worked and saved hard for their retirement.",
