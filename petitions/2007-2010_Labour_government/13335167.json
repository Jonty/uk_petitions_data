            "background": "Bring all our forces back from Afganistan and use them to defend and protect Great Britian from within our own country.  Use them for immigration control at sea ports,airports, rail terminals and on the streets working alongside police, and imigration control officers. Give them the authority to arrest and detain all suspects.  Use prefab type buildings (cheap to errect) in remote places like Dartmoor to hold all suspects in and set up inhouse courts for quick trials and swift removal of undesirable or illegal immigrants and those that claim assylam illegally.  \nMake all acceptable immigrants take an oath of alligance to Britain and serve 2 years in our armed forces learning how to speak English and the history of Great Britian and our religion to ensure complete integration into OUR society and not Great Britian being integrated into their way of life.  Make it law that they carry ID at all times and if ID cannot be produced they will be detained in an Army style prison indefinately micro chipped and made to work for their food and keep only doing labouring type jobs which would benefit the British society.",
