The geographic division has the inconvenient to give a competitive advantage to \"actor\" or commercial like politician. \"Actor\" like politician has good communication skill but are usually unproductive in the material sense and are also clever liar. Like most citizen, I don't recognize myself in those people. I would like to nominate MP by recursive delegation right (*). The 700 MP with the highest right will constitute the house of common.  It should also solve the gender issue.\n(*) I give my right to Achilles who has two rights  (his and me). Achilles can't give his right to me but he can give his right to Bob who got 3 rights.  The winner is the one who has the more counting right and declares himself candidate.",
