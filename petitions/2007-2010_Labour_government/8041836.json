            "background": "It is time that the offence of \"causing death by dangerous driving\" whilst in charge of a stolen vehicle, be changed to that of `manslaughter` at the least.It is my understanding that causing death while carrying out a crime is liable to a charge of `murder`. Given that a stolen car must be the outcome of a crime, ie theft, then the law should be changed to accomodate these crimes. This may go some way to reducing the theft and use of motor vehicles by the feral youth abundant in the country.",
