        "background": "Mr. Ross' recent appalling, bullying behaviour has brought both the BBC and the honour he holds into disrepute. Many British citizens are dismayed at the thought that he might be seen as representative of their views and moral compass. He is not worthy to hold such an honour which is founded on service to others and leadership by example.",
