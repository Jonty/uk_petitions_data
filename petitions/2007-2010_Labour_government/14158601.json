            "background": "Yes Loans Group are charging people for brokering a loan to one of their own loan companies at extortionate interest rates.  Very often they do not offer a loan and even if you decide that you do not wish them to broker the loan it is extremely difficult to get your money back.  In our society today this type of operation should not be allowed to continue.  We have a duty to people in unfortunate circumstances not to rip them off any more.  It has to stop and yes loans should be investigated and return all of the money to the people who have not benefitted from a service they purport to give but do not.",
