            "background": "National Service formally ended on 31 December 1960. While National Service was compulsory, the United Kingdom was a fine and well mannered place to live. Since then however violence has risen dramatically. As in the past, every healthy man between 17 and 21 was expected to serve in the armed forces for 18 months. I feel that this would stear youths in the right direction, and turn them into fine young gentlemen. The British Armed Forces, is without doubt the best in the world and i feel that this would be a great Act to return to our Country!",
