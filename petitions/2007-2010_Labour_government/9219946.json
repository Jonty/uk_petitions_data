        "background": "The recent changes in tax banding has resulted in the people most severly affected, subsidising people who can more readily afford it.  This is obviosly an unforseen result of the changes and should be rectified asap.\nThe PM states that these taxpayers are compensated by tax credits.  This is far from the reality.  Lowpaid workers without children, or pensioners on early retirment without tax credits, who have paid income tax throughout their working lives are now being asked to subsidise higher paid taxpayers, clearly this is wrong, unintended and deserves to be corrected immediatly.",
