        "action": "Limit all Local Authority parking fines to a maximum of \u00a320 and not increase it for 3 months from the date of issue",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The current standard parking fine of \u00a350 for any parking offence however minimal is disproportionate to the offence committed. It encourages Local Authorities to contract armies of ticket issuers to raise revenue from and generally harass already stressed out urban drivers. This is often subcontracted to private companies for whom it is a highly profitable enterprise. This intimidation continues with the requirement to pay up within 14 days or have the fine doubled or even tripled, which acts as a very strong incentive not to contest the ticket. The main job of the previous generation of Traffic Wardens was to keep the traffic flowing and the carriageways clear, but this has long been forgotten in the rush to generate additional revenues. The size of parking fines must be limited to a reasonable amount, and that amount should not be increased for 3 months or 30 days after all appeals processes have been exhausted, whichever comes later.",
