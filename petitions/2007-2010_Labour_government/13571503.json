        "action": "introduce a mandatory license to keep 'any' animal which can be revoked in the case of neglect or mistreatment.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "According to the RSPCA the mistreatment of animals, often amounting to torture (including the current popularity of dog fighting), is increasing year on year and there is little deterent. People are obtaining animals and abondoning them as well as allowing them to breed with little thought about where they will end up. Generous people of the public are contributing more and more money to pay for these animals as they fill rescue centres thoughout the country.\n\nI propose a system whereby anyone wanting to keep an animal must first apply for a license. The RSPCA should then have the power to investigate anyone suspected of owning an animal without license or mistreating an animal and revoke their license where appropriate. This should then be subject to legal action.",
