If your child isn\u2019t being bullied at School from the School bully, there education is being interrupted by disobedient children, who constantly disrupt the class. The Teacher tells the parents' still nothing changes. These children get older and turn into the yobs of society today, all because this attention for bad behaviour was neglected to be nipped in the bud at an early age. The Teachers\u2019 job is hard enough with out this type of behaviour.  The government needs to make is compulsory for misbehaving children\u2019s parents to have parental lessons, so the decent children of today\u2019s society don\u2019t end up involved with this type of behaviour and be lead astray.",
