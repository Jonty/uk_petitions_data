            "background": "Most remaining UK Territory is small but strategically significant. Diplomatic effort and expense has to be deployed to keep these or maintain them. As part of the EU the issue of Head of State is less of a problem and is therefore more easy to maintain. The Terriory becomes more independent as part of the EU but in the eyes of the EU is still part of the UK. The French adopted this approach with some success. The UK should adopt this wheeze. These areas then can get EU grants and benefit from the internal market so no more banana wars with the US and South America. It saves us Tax, gets rid of the 'do we want a Queen issue' as a focal point and would stop US invasions or putting torture victims there like Grenada and Bermuda. The US might not take the UK seriously but they do try to avoid EU condemnation as it might impact on trade. If not why not please, it would keep our new EU super diplomat busy. They do not need to be part of the 'UK' but just included in our Territory within our EU membership.",
