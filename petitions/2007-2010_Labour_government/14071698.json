        "background": "I find it incredibly sexist towards males and females that childrens toys or adult gadgets are advertised as being \"boys toys\" or \"girls toys\". There is no such thing. Males and females should not be conditioned at a young age to play with toys that are only considered fit for either one or the other gender. Of course there is no rule to say your child cannot play with any toy but society and advertising creates a conditioning in males and females as adults, that started from a young age, and this forces us into \"gender type\" roles. There is no harm at all in having a massive sign saying \"toys\" instead of \"boys toys\" and \"girls toys\". Adverts should be showing boys and girls playing with dolls, playing with cars, playing house etc etc. This is a simple rule to put in place and would not cost a thing to correct. It may not seem a big deal but it really is if you think about it. It really is conditioning from a young age that affects being an adult.",
