        "background": "The BBC claims that there is very little talent to be found in Scotland and has therefore announced less funding for the Scottish branch. Considering that the BBC recognizes the programme \"Two Pints of Larger & A Packet Of Crisps\" as the cream of British talent is a complete farce. There is talent in Scotland but the BBC doesn't give us a chance. GIVE US THE MONEY & WE'LL GIVE YOU THE TALENT!!",
