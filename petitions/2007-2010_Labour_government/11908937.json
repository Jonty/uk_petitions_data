            "background": "At my school all the children get offered free music lessons on a wide variety of instruments, in addition to this we then have clubs were musicians can play together. My family would not have been able to afford for me to have piano, cello and guitar lessons, and it has taught me patience, a good work ethic and i have made lots of freinds through music.  I beleive it would teach kids valuable lessons in life and could give kids with not much money a chance to try music out, some kids may be very talented. I think this would benefit so many people and it would boost kids confidence, patience, the ethic that practicing and working hard has results, uncover new skills, help kids make friends, give them a constructive way to vent their feelings, and a way to have lots of fun.. I think this would be so worthwhile and could even reduce youth crime.  SO join the petition, give the youth of today real chance to prove themselves against all the odds!",
