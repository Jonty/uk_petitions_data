I am desperate to return to england.  \nSouth africa is crime filled and dangerous.  Ifear for my life as well as my loved ones.  I have tried despeately to find work, but have been declined \ndue to affirimative action.\nWe live in a caravan park, that my cousin pays for or we would be destitute. I long to return to england, and have my british passport.\nI have asked a family member to email you this plea as we have no access to a computer.  her name is Gaylyn Bedingfield.\nI have read that british citizens from Zimbabwe  have been flown home.  We are in the same boat,  we get a food donation once a month if there are any left. \nMy wife and I would be so grateful if we were shown the same mercy as the Zimbabwe citizens.\nI pray for assistance.\nI will do england proud.\nPlease forward this to the appropriate people.\n  \nSincerely\nSimon Healey.  CELL 0796085762\n \nPassport number70....\nDOB.  FEB 9TH 1960.\n \nMANY thanks and in desperation.",
