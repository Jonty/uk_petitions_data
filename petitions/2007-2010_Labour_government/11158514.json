        "background": "Every year, Government Departments issue thousands of tenders for marketing, advertising, print and web projects. Usually - these tenders are won by the same companies again and again. Therefore - I would request that if the tendering process is just an exercise - simply stop putting projects out to tender. The cost to companies and agencies trying to get a foothold in the Government Sector is staggering with often weeks spent researching, costing and producing work that no matter how good it is - will never be accepted. The criteria for is often so vague that Departments can and do simply award the work to the agencies they 'like' as opposed to those that proudce the right solution. Therefore - I would request that you review the current tendering procedures and stop wastig agency time when projects are more often than not - 'pre-awarded'.",
