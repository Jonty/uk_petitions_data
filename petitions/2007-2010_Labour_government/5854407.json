            "background": "Almost everything you buy today from a computer to a video recorder, DVD player, has a stand by mode which just drains electricity day in day out when it is doing absolutely nothing.  Some popular satellite set top boxes even have a red light to tell you that they are off.\n\nThis is an utter waste of Energy and producer of carbon emissions.  Manufacturers are aware of the problem but in the competitive climate no one will be the first to do it.\n\nOnly the government can act to put a stop to this.\n\nThe off button should mean off.  There should be absolutely no electricity used when the appliance is off.\n\nSome things may need a timer in which case they should use a small rechargeable battery but having a standby mode simply for the sake of allowing you to switch the TV on by remote control in inexcusable.\n\nThis practice should be outlawed immediately.",
