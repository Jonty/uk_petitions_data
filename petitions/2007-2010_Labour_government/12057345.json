        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We fully believe that Woolworths could have been saved. Deloitte (the administrators) made more money out of 'winding down' the 99 year old retail chain which is disgraceful. During these difficult economical times, the government is going to have to step in to save traditional British names before it's too late. \n\nWe are asking for the government to investigate the way the company was closed down, and to find out if, even if some money had to be lost in the short-term, the company could have been saved by it's administrators and government funding. Having this volume of people in unemployment is going to cost the government much more long-term anyway.\n\nWhy should an administration company make more money closing down Britain's biggest retail name than saving it? These issues all need to be looked at.\n\nIndividual Woolworths stores were making profit. In the right hands, it could easilly have been saved.",
