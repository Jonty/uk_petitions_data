        "background": "Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm is a silent stealth killer, that can lie dormant for many years, with no symptoms to alert us to the life threatening danger lurking just round the corner, which attacks and kills without warning, with no respect for gender, (further information on Google).\nOver 75% of people with an AAA, never reach the medical help that might possibly save their lives, for they die \u201cen route\u201d, leaving behind a tragic legacy of loss, grief, devastation and bewilderment. Even the small percentage of those who receive emergency medical help, rarely survive.\nWe must therefore put in place an identification and prevention programme, for both men and women over the age of 50, by way of routine screening, so that the diagnosis of a possible AAA can be made early enough for preventative measures to be taken. \nWe owe it to ourselves and our loved ones to take charge of our own health, by being given both the choice and the tools to do so.\nPlease join your voice with mine.",
