We have flowers for Ireland, Scotland and England but Wales is represented by a few random bits of greenery supposedly a leek. I want a daffodil!\n\nWhat's wrong with the daffodil? If they wanted to use flowers for a badge we have a perfectly respectable flower that would be instantly recognisable and improve the symmetry. If they insist that the leek is our national symbol then give us a proper leek not bits of leaf curled around and English rose.\nI think we should demand the daffodil what a silly way to alienate a nation from a new national institution, especially one which is desperately proud of the money it has spent on curtains and carpets this year.",
