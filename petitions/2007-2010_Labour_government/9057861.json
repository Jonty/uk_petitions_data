            "background": "Hail and well met denizens of the night. Alex Lester aka The Darklord is deserving of a Sony award for his contributions to The Nights. He has created his own country of Boloxnia, he has also amused and educated us with the story of The Sock. His catchphrases are many and can be seen all over the country on the backs of vehicles. 'Slap My Top' Boloxnia or Bust and Yiptahootie. For those with little or no knowledge of The Darklord you should go to his page on radio 2. Click on shows A - Z and educate yourselves. You may think this is trivial but after reading his U.S blog and the rest of his pages and listening to his show, you will agree and SIGN THIS PETITION. Thank you and Shake Your Tail Sausage.",
