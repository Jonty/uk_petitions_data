        "background": "I believe taxi drivers should be fined for creating a nusiance (particularly late at night) by blasting there horns to signal to there waiting passengers that they have arrived to collect them. I find this a totally absurd practice, as the passengers will have already phoned to request a taxi and should therefore be ready and waiting for the taxi to arrive. If they are not waiting, the driver would wait a couple of minutes before leaving.",
