            "background": "British values and morals should be taught in every school in Britain as a compulsory part of the curriculum. Up until and including the eleventh year of schooling (Fifth year of seconday education) every school should teach British morals and values, both modern and historical for at least one hour per fortnight.\n\nWe advocate that pupils should be actively taught what, in this day and age, they are being told to forget.\n\nPlease note - This act should not be confused with Fascism or Nazism. We are not advocating brainwashing any more than Religious Education is considered brainwashing.",
