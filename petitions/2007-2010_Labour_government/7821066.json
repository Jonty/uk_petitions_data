            "background": "Female Jelly Wrestling is one of the most physically demanding sports in the world in which Britain excels at. If this sport was brought to the 2012 Olympics, Britain would be seen as a world leader in the promotion of this underrated sport.  Bringing it to the Olympics would also help to improve TV viewing figures in the critical post-pub closing time slot as there aren't enough jelly covered, bikini-clad female Olympic athletes.",
