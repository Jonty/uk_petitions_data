        "background": "Disabled parking bays are for blue badge holders only and anyone who parks their car in a disabled bay and is not displaying a blue badge should be fined \u00a31000 and have 3 points on their license.\nThis legislation should apply to any parking space that is marked as for disabled and include disabled bays in privately owned car parks such as supermarket and retail park car parks.\nIt is an offence for anyone other than the blue badge holder to use a blue badge. The maximum fine if someone is convicted is \u00a31,000. So why shouldn't this apply to the misuse of disabled parking bays too?",
