            "background": "As a consequence of devolution the Parliament of Scotland and the Assemblies of Wales and NI have powers to detrmine legislation on Health; Education; Transport and Prisons.  Devolution has provided no such powers to the people of England and this anomily means that MP's from these areas of Britain continue to exercise votes on exclusively English matters.  There is growing dissatisfaction in England in respect of this democratic deficit.  Only MP's acountable for exclusively English matters should be able to vote on English only issues to restore the democratic balance lost by the neglect of England in the act of devolution.",
