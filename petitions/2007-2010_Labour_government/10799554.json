And of course there is the issue of lessening suffering which, in my view, is even more important.  \n\nNot all conditions can be seen by the patient; for instance some years ago I myself had a mole on my back which - naturally - I was unable to see. I  had noticed (felt) a spot higher up but when I asked my G.P. to look at it she was far less concerned about that than about the mole of which I was completely unaware; upon investigation it proved not to be malignant but what stage might it have reached if I hadn't asked my G.P. to look at the spot?  I imagine many people have had similar experiences.",
