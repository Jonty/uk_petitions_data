        "background": "I would like the town of Wootton Bassett to be bestowed with the right to be The Royal Town of Wootton Bassett.  I myself live in The Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield which was bestowed upon us in 1528 by King Henry VIII and I feel that Wootton Bassett deserves this honour more than ever.  They welcome all people into their community, when our armed services come back, when they have made the ultimate sacrifice, with open arms.  They as a community, with every cortege from RAF Lyneham, line the streets even though they probably don't know the servicemen and women passing by. They stop businesses, provide comfort and stand for the British people that cannot be there themselves and as a nation.  I think it is our duty to honour this town as a Royal Town just as the way we honour the wives and partners with the Elizabeth Cross.",
