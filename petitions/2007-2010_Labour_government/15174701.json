            "background": "Anyone aged 16 or under at the end of 2010 should in theory never have smoked a cigarette. Therefore I would request the government to ban these children from ever being allowed to smoke or buy cigarettes. This law would protect our children and slowly bring in a total ban on smoking over and extended period, adults that already smoke would not be affected or their rights prejudiced. This law would mean millions of children would never take up smoking in the first place and the system would be easy to police with people suspected of being born after 1993 having to show id in order to buy cigarettes.\n\nPlease support this petition to protect our children.",
