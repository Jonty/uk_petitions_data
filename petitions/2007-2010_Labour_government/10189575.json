        "background": "Police officers pay is the same no matter what job they do or what hours they work. An officer who sits behind a desk Monday to Friday 9 till 5 is on the same pay as an officer who works nights and weekends. Surely this is not right, and clearly you the government agree. You pay police staff shift allowance. So come on Prime Minister think of the money you'll save paying the pen pushes less. I cannot rely on the Police Federation to assist in this request because as you well know they sit behind a desk Monday to Friday. Obviously you cannot reduce officers pay but what you can do is bring in a two tier pay rise system until the balance is fair, oh and just think you may get these pen pushes back on the streets.",
