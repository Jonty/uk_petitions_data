        "background": "Since 2003, there has been a Group known locally in the Fens of East Anglia, as the Wisbech & March Bramley Line, that was formed in order to not only reopen, but run as a Heritage Line for tourists to the area, the now redundant freight line between the two towns.\n\nWith no chance of retaining any connection to the main line, or access to the Main station at March, we would like to cross petition the one calling for the reopening the line from Wisbech through to London. This is due to the fact there are FAR from enough who commute from Wisbech to London on a daily basis to make it a viable proposition.\n\nThe 'Bramley Line' Group have some very dedicated members working very hard on a weekly basis in order to get this line reopened. As well as this, Membership is increasing weekly in order to do this and lot more than there are commuters.",
