        "background": "The best interests of the British people especially the indiginous population require a review should confirm (or otherwise) the interpretation of the statements in the Koran Sura 3:118 and make such conclusions public and; if upheld; \n+ require that all issues of the Koran are of an edited version in which the offensive statements are deleted; \n+ prohibit actions of all proselytising Muslims and Islamic institutions which do not publicly renounce the said offensive statement; \n+ undertake a national campaign that encourages Muslims to denounce said tenet in the Koran.\nThe government is implored to face facts and not avoid addressing this issue on ground of muslim sensitivities which are inconsistent with the greater interest of the British population and it's heritage of free speech and toleration (and thus required of imported religions in particular Islamic schools, madrasas and communities). \nThe English Bill of Rights 1689 2nd Oath 2nd para is also breached by subversive accomodations made to the Islamic religion.\nThis is a political/legislative facing petition - not a religious one.",
