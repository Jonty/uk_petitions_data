        "background": "Eastbourne is to lose its maternity unit and it is to be encompassed within the Hastings hospital.  Eastbourne is a rapidly growing area and the loss of this facility will cause problems for expectant mothers & families.  The Prime Minister stated that he wanted to offer choice for people regarding the NHS but he obviously isn't because it is closing and local authorities are happy for it to close. He is authorising the closure of this vital service to the community.  It creates a totally unnecessary long journey that in this day and age of \"global warming\" & \"climate change\" which the Govt force upon us we should not have to put up with this silly taxing journey. It must not be allowed to happen and the local MP but also take more action and stop this withdrawl of this vital service.  It is another example of Britain in the throes of closing down.",
