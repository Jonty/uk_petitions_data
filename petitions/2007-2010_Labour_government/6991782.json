We were told that it was so that each of the 3 Nations could deal with their own issues. However before devolution there weren't any issues exclusive to Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. \n\nIt was and still is possible for a united British people to deal with all issues together - after all isn't that the spirit behind unity?",
