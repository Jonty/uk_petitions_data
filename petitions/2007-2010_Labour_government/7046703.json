            "background": "At present there is no formal funding, such as a student loan, available to students wishing to undertake a postgraduate course. Unless an applicant can secure funding, from either the institute or external organisation, they must pay for the cost of tuition themselves. CDLs are an unrealistic solution as they must be repaid almost immediatly after course completion. With the increase in bachelor degrees being obtained, most employment firms now request a masters or PhD. Funding is available for PGCEs, so why not for other postgraduate courses?",
