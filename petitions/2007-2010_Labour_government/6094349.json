            "background": "The tower that has been recently approved that is to be built at 20 Fenchurch Street will be a blot on London's skyline. The tower has been hastily designed, and has no similarities with any towers in the surrounding area. The lack of consideration to integrate this tower into the surrounding area has created a monstrosity that will be looked down upon in the future as the tower blocks/council estates are looked down upon today. I propose the tower be blocked and an inquiry launched into its approval.",
