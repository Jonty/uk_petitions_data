            "background": "The Departments for Health, Work and Pensions, and Communities and Local Government, should be merged to form the Department For Health, Welfare, and Communities. This will assist the streamlining of delivery from \"top down\", and assist in keeping the cost of providing health and welfare services down. \n\nThe \"Local Government\" section of the DCLG should be moved to fit within the existing Ministry of Justice, to keep all governance and democracy related policy in one department. Again - this should help in directing and providing policy, and keeping costs lower.",
