It is essential that the hoard remains intact within the UK, preferably at museums local to the hoard\u2019s discovery. At the very least, an export ban should be imposed without delay, to ensure the hoard is not sold to overseas buyers.\n\nThe hoard represents the single biggest discovery of Anglo Saxon artefacts, and thus represents an invaluable national treasure and testimony to our Anglo Saxon heritage.",
