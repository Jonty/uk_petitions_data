            "background": "In the UK today it is the choice of the consumer to 'opt-out' of telemarketing calls by signing up to the TPS scheme (other schemes are available). Should a company contact a consumer who is signed up to this scheme, the company can be prosecuted for breaching the consumers rights. However there is no such legislation to protect people from telemarketing calls that are made internationally, meaning calls made on behalf of UK companys but by an international call centre are not breaching these regulations. This often means these companies can call a household as many times as they wish. (which some people could call harrasment) but without breaking any laws or regulations. \n\nCurrently the attitude of the phone providers is to 'put up' with these calls - this is wrong. something needs to be done. Surely it is our right to have peace and quiet in our own homes!",
