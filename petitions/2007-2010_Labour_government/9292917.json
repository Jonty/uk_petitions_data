        "background": "Councils are spending more than ever to build cycle lanes in towns. Cyclists also cause congestion and huge tailbacks as cars sometimes can't pass them. Why should motorists pay for cyclists facilities when we already pay a disgustingly huge amount of tax ourselves? Everyone should pay for congestion, why punish a select few?",
