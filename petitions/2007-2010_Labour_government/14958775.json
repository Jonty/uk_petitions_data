            "background": "I recently worked in a business that housed slot machines; anyone could walk in off the street and gamble.  This 'casino' was open from 9am until 9pm.  I saw hundreds of people, many of whom confessed to being on benefits, pensions, or to having low incomes, come as it opened and play until close.  This was clearly a sign of addiction, yet the staff could not intervene.  These people were in denial over their addictions, despite being there for up to 70 hours a week when they had the funds.  The self-exclusion policy clearly did not work.  The only way to prevent these people from losing hundreds of pounds a week of money they cannot afford is to reduce to legal opening hours of such places.  There is no need for people to be able to gamble at 9 am.  I demand that the government re-evaluate their current policy on slot-machines, regardless of any tax revenue gained. These shops encourage gambling addiction by providing food and drink, and by allowing opportunistic gamblers who happen to be passing on the street.  Shorter opening hours and a denial of food and drink supply (so that people could reconsider during their breaks to get refreshment), should be implemented by law.",
