            "background": "Authors, publishers and record companies don't get a cent from the second-hand sales of books and records. Why should artists get extra income from a ticket for which they have already been paid? If they  feel they didn't earn enough from it in the first place, they should have set a higher face value on the ticket. If this levy goes ahead, it paves the way for a new tax to appear on all second hand goods. Stop this before it starts.",
