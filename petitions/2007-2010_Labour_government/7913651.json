        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Video games have recently became a scapegoat for anyone who wishes to call for a ban. I propose that there are stricter controls on who games are sold to, The same as DVDs and Cinema tickets (i.e. proof of age required, even if parent is buying for child, like a parent buying a child alcohol). This would prevent parents buying games with an adult rating of 18+ for thier children.",
