            "background": "Preventing the Territorial Army (TA) from training for six months will jeopardise the entire future of the TA. \n\nRecruitment will cease, interest will be lost, skills will decay and TA soldiers will find other activities to fill their time. Retention has always been key to manning the TA, and a steady diet of training throughout the year has long been recognised as a vital part of retention.\n\nIn terms of the UK defence budget the expected saving will be tiny, yet the long term damage huge.",
