Since the County Council took over all roundabouts for sponsorship they've replaced the flowers with perennials which, though cheaper to maintain, are drab by comparison.  We want the PM to write to the County and Borough Councils asking them to work together, as our Government wants Councils to do, to bring Loughborough back to its former glory.",
