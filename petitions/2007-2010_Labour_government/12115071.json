            "background": "I believe that Gordon Brown should call an early general election as I feel that he no longer commands the views and respects of the British public. After numerous scandals with the labour party, I do not believe that Gordon Brown and the Labour Party have the trust of the British Public and as such I believe it is in the best interests of the country to call an early general election. Thank you.",
