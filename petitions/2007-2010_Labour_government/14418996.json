        "background": "I want to see a better care service provided to old age pensioners who live alone.  This month an elderly couple died and their bodies were not found for five whole days.  I have experience with one man who tragically dies in 2008.  I feel that social services refused to listen to his cry for help and he was left abandoned in a single room.  This should not have happened and it is a disgrace that our social services stood by and let a man died the way he did, when it was quite blantant that he was in need of some serious help.\n\nI live in Harrow and I feel that their DWP is mistreating its pensioners and those with disabilities.  I run a cleaning business, which you can see from my website www.rubyandsons.com and I personally would like funding to provide as much of a service as possible to all the elderly people living firstly in my area then gradually expanding.\n\nNo only this but I have been in contact with many keen workers from overseas, who hold lots of experience and would like to ask if I could apply for a license through the Home Office or whichever rhelm necessary to bring people over for a limited period of time.",
