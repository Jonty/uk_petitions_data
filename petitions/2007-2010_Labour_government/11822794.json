        "background": "We are English and proud of it.  Since devolution, we have struggled to define what is English, and this process is continually being undermined by poor immigration policies, the massive influx of labour from within Europe and a lack of definition of what it means to be English.  We want to rediscover our identity and discover once again our pride in being English instead of continually feeling like we must apologise for it.  We want to give our children an identity to be proud of, and take our rightful place alongside the Scots, the Welsh and the Irish as proud British people.  We can begin to do this by acknowledging St George's day as being a Bank Holiday.",
