There is enough tax on tobacco as it is without smokers having to pay extra and go through the hassle of aquiring one of these licences. It is ridiculous that our lives are being interfered with as it is. We have been told about the dangers, accepted them, now it is time to leave people alone to make up their own minds. What is the overall point of this anyway??",
