            "background": "We wish to prevent the Premier League from playing league games abroad. This is the continuing, killing off of the English game by greedy clubs who have forgotten who made them what they are. (The Fans)\n\nFootball clubs are already over stretched with the amount of games the have to play (well that is what they keep saying) now they want to play 39 league games a season and travel thousands of miles to do.\n\nJust who exactly would bid to stage see Derby play Middlesboro (no offence to these two clubs), Dubai. I do not think so. Only the big club stand to make any real money from this and they will continue to tighten their grip on our game, killing it for good and seeing the creation of a super league.\n\nThe Fans will refuse to attend games if this plan goes ahead, until it is reversed.",
