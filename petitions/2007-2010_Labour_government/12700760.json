Dating websites do not currently have to implement any anti fraud systems. This makes it incredibly easy for scammers to monetise stolen card details through CNP transactions.  Dating sites are not currently required to implement anti phishing scams which costs the UK millions of pounds every year making dating websites without these measures a haven for scammers.",
