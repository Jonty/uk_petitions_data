This needs to be done sooner rather than later.\n\nFor those of us that live on a hill or away from the flood areas, we should be grateful for that and count our blessings, but as a nation we need too support our own.  \"Charity starts at Home\"\n\nWe did this for the Tsunami victims why not our own people?\n\nWe cannot wait for the authorities to act on this we need to help them now!\n\nBanks need to act straight away so that the nation can put its hand in its pockets.\n\nTV appeals should have been set up to aid these people not just as a reporting tool",
