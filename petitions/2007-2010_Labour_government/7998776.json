            "background": "I have recently learned that the Shooting Stadium which is to be built at Woolwich Barracks for the 2012 Olympic Games is to be dismantled after the gamers have finished.\n\nI would request that the current Goverment takes action to reconsider this ill conceived idea and that this Stadium should be retained for future use.    To date, the British shooting teams have always performed exceedingly well in competions of this kind and it is untenable to consider dismantling this complex when it could well be used, not only to host international competions but also as a training ground to bring on future generations of competion shooters.",
