            "background": "The BBC and other media in the UK have given horribly biased 'interviews' to the BNP when at all, with such underhand tricks as shining camera lights directly in the faces of the interviewee when he attempts to answer questions posed. I have joined the BNP as a reaction to the loony left tendencies & disinformation of the day, and am certainly not a bigot or a hating racist, having had the most wonderful hospitality from different races the world over in years of travelling. I have found the BNP to be made up of a broad mixture of reasonable persons, with the one overriding credo of not hating anyone, and would rather prevent racial and political tension by making slow, planned and psychologically acceptable changes rather than by having suddenly in the UK droves of persons from other cultures and religions who want us to change to their ways. \n\nFree Speech is the root of democracy: Without education and debate we are nothing. \n\nThis is not an advert for the BNP but I make an example of disinformation/suppression I have witnessed, hoping that an honest point be made to any potential signatory of this petition.",
