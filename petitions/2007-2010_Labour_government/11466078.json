        "background": "It is a well known fact that it is extremely difficult for even the most talented bands to move forward and become sucessful. I urge the Prime Minister to enter new legislation to enable bands to earn and declare a small amount of money without it affecting any benefit they recieve or their tax band.\n\nThis is because bands have expenses which rarely get met by the fee they recieve, including recording material, producing CD's and travelling costs, along with food and equipment costs.\n\nIf bands do get paid for shows, they either get taxed on this money or it affects their benefit, which means that they end up losing the money twice if they declare it, which means that alot of bands are not declaring the money for fear of this fact.\n\nIf the government introduced protection for bands to earn a set amount before they could get taxed or it affecting benefits, it would encourage more bands to declare their earnings and become.\n\nMaybe the bands could fill in a form which shows the maximum they can earn per member without it affecting them.",
