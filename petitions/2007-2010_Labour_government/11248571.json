            "background": "There is no monument to the sacrifices made by Bomber Command Aircrew in WW2 in this country. There exists only one, in Holland. If it was not for the huge sacrifices made by young men from all countries of the Commonwealth and America, the Nazi war machine would have been functioning unrestricted. We remember the brave Fighter Pilots who dared impossible odds to prevent and invasion of Britain, however equally brave were the men who night after night bombed targets in Germany. They rightly deserve our remembrance.",
