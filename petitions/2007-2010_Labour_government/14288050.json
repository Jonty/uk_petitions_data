        "action": "Ban supermarkets selling alcohol to ensure the general consumption of alcohol is supervised in licensed premises",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Supermarkets sell alcohol to over 18's However they cannot guarantee who is going to consume it. Licensed premises sell alcohol to over 18's but they can guarantee that the person consuming it is over 18 and also that the quantity they consume is commensurate with their ability to handle it and their behaviour at the time. Supermarkets could sell a case of beer to an over 18 but the beer could be consumed at home without an adults knowledge. It is therefore highly irresponsible to sell alcohol in supermarkets and this must stop to save Britain from a terrible downward spiral of excessive alcohol consumption.",
