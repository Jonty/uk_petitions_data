            "background": "As a self employed bricklayer, I have been working on sites building new homes for 10 years. Over the last 6-7 yrs, the prices we tradesmen are paid have not increased, though the cost of living and other peoples wages have. Even as house prices doubled there was no increase, but now, as there is a slight fall in house prices, prices are dropping for tradesmen everywhere, as firms are making millions in profit.",
