        "background": "This consultancy is wholly owned by the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and Senior Managers (SOLACE). It is used almost exclusively by Local Authorities to headhunt Chief Executives and Senior Mangers in Local Government who pays it a \u00a320,000 fee for each consultancy. The overwhelming majority of UK Councils are its clients. Since 2003 salary levels for senior managers in Local Government have risen by 30% per annum. This Consultancy is clearly not operating in the interests\n of the taxpayer, and, this blatant conflict of interest is contibuting to an unsustainable rise in salaries and index-linked pensions for Council Officers, and, is a major contributor to the excessive rises in Council Taxes.",
