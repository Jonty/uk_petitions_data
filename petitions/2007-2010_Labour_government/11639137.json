It is used almost exclusively by Local Authorities to headhunt Chief Executives and Senior Mangers in Local Government who pays it a \u00a320,000 fee for each consultancy. The overwhelming majority of UK Councils are its clients. Since 2003 salary levels for senior managers in Local Government have risen by 30% per annum. This Consultancy is clearly not operating in the interests\n of the taxpayer, and, this blatant conflict of interest is contibuting to an unsustainable rise in salaries and index-linked pensions for Council Officers, and, is a major contributor to the excessive rises in Council Taxes.",
