Openly publishing all details of outgoings by government departments should be a condition of having to pay income tax. Each local and central government agency should have a watchdog which analyses and publishes all details of accounts and spending. The public should be fully informed of details of such things as mp's expenses, overseas bank accounts, all job roles that are held by civil servants, all building maitenance and decoration etc. The pulic should be given the opportunity to provide an input as to whether these outgoings are necessary.",
