        "action": "urge the broadcasting regulator OFCOM to tighten the rules over the possible identification of children whose parents feature in DNA paternity test TV programmes such as \u201cThe Jeremy Kyle Show\u201d.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "ITV says its current policy \u201cis that no children of school age are the subject of DNA tests and particular care is taken in relation to children of pre-school age, with children over the age of 18 months being involved only in exceptional cases\u201d.\n\nThis means that programmes such as \u201cThe Jeremy Kyle Show\u201d subject babies up to the age of 18 months (as well as older children in \u201cexceptional cases\u201d) to paternity tests on daytime television.  By identifying the parents, the broadcaster is identifying the children involved.\n\nThis could lead to huge problems for these children.  Their parents' arguments and the DNA testing on TV make them a matter of public record.  The chances of the children discovering what happened are high.  Others can remember the programme or have recorded it leading to bullying or humiliation for the child.\n\nAn example of this kind of Jeremy Kyle Show was titled \u201cBrother, I\u2019ll Prove I\u2019m the Father of Your Ex-Girlfriend\u2019s Baby\u201d.\n\nOFCOM must tighten its guidelines so NO young people of any age can be identified from such programmes.",
