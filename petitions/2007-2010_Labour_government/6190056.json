        "background": "Each case should be considered on its merits; above all it should NOT be taken for granted that the parents staying together is better for the children's emotional welfare.  My own parents had a VERY bad relationship in which they alternated \"not speaking\" with frightening rows; my father sometimes had to go away at which times the atmosphere at home was MUCH calmer and my mother much less irritable.  I often wished they'd separate; I realised that this would be traumatic for a while but surely not as emotionally damaging as living with this relationship which, apart from anything else, put me off entering into a marital or cohabiting relationship.  I have been happily married for over 30 years; I would have missed that, as a result of witnessing my parents' relationship, if my husband had lacked the patience and understanding to persuade me otherwise.  I realise that my own situation is unique, as everyone's is, but I imagine most people whose parents had a similar \"relationship\" would have been damaged in one way or another.  The alleged damage caused by divorce/separation is more noticeable because they are public issues; no one knows what happens in private.",
