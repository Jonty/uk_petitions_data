        "background": "The people of Zimbabwe are dying....now.  Under Robert Mugabe's rule the health and well-being of his people have dropped dramatically, which is as much an abuse of human rights as arbitrary arrest and torture.  \n\nZimbabwe has the world\u2019s shortest life expectancy\u201437 years for men and 34 for women and has the greatest percentage of orphans.\n\nHow can we 'liberate' Iraq yet stand by and do nothing as thousands die of abuse and neglect and millions are starving.\n\nIt is time to make history and stand beside the people of Zimbabwe in their time of need.\n\nWe call upon Mr Brown and the British Government to do everything possible to remove Mr Mugabe from power and to deliver aid to the Zimbabwean people right now in their suffering.",
