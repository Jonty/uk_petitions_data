            "background": "There is a taxi company in my village which has its own tracking device which allows the operator to know where a cab driver is at whatever point of journey, now the taxis in my town centre are not like that, i have been in a taxi before where the driver has tried to drive off with me in the cab and i know on many occasions where it has happened to other people whilst being on their own, i often find this case only happening with the black cabs in the town centre but it is quite disturbing.  The question to be asked is `What percentage would it drop if the tracking device was brought in with regards to rape and abuse`",
