        "background": "Raising the legal age to buy alchol will not benefit people in any way, but simply make the matter of 'underage drinking' worse. As an 18 year old myself, i have seen the problems of underage drinking. Raising the age will not stop this, but simply leave us with more underage drinkers. At eighteen years of age you are legally allowed to vote-a huge responsibility, get married, another major adult decision. If the government entrusts such major responsibilities in our age category for these things, surely one is responsible enough to drink. It appears yet again, the youth will suffer. Generations have lived happily with the legal age of eighteen, so why change now? It seems the government is attempting to replicate american ideas.",
