            "action": "provide recycling facilities throughout England for all commonly manufactured plastics (e.g. PP, PET, HDPE, LDPE etc), and ban the use of polystyrene for food packaging (e.g. take away food)",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "These plastics should be recycled as they are going into our waste stream and causing land fill sites to become full and the seas to become polluted (e.g. the north pacific gyre), this in turn returns to our tables via seafood and drinking water. As well as waste this non-recycled plastic is produced at huge economic and ecological cost and produces a great deal of green house gases to produce, this could be largely reduced through recycling. Polystyrene cannot be recyclied and again cannot break down naturally causing this material to surive in our waste streams and seas almost permanantly in some form.",
