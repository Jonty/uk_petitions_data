            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Caterham Sevens and similar kit cars often have no provision for a full size number plate, and as such come under scrutiny from the police when owners use stick-on nose mounted number plates, or smaller ones without the correct spacing. Using a full size plate means dangerous edges protruding from the frontal impact area of a car, which could result in extra injury if involved in a collision with a pedestrian, or animal.\nBecause the plates are also attached with double sided tape or velcro, a risk is posed to other motorists should this method of attachment fail.\nWe the undersigned propose that special dispensation is given to such cars to allow them to run legally on the roads of the UK without such a hazard on the front of the car, similar to that given to motorbikes.",
