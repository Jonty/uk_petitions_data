        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "because of the damage he has done to the house of commons. by doing everything to stop publication of MP's expenses he failed to follow the mood of the people. he showed the speaker is an obstacle to democracy. so the speaker's authority is broken and will be devolved outside the commons. when the commons loses power, democracy, in the form of accountability, is lost. he has failed to carry out his primary duty which is to lead and keep relevant the house of commons. he should hang his head in shame. instead of serving his country he has only served entrenched interests and his own prejudices. the speaker will now turn inevitably into a ceremonial figure. one more check on the executive has been lost. michael martin has done his electorate a great disservice. he must not be rewarded for his abject failure to sustain the historic power and dignity of his office. and if people such as fred (the shred) goodwin suffer opprobrium for inflated pensions, etc, michael (mick) martin should not receive his 1.4 million pension without opprobium either. it certainly should not come with a gold-plated peerage.",
