        "background": "We want the paedophiles to pay for therapy, treatment and medical bills for the children and babies they abuse.\n \n \nWe do not want to pay out of our wages for a paedophile to get help and treatment inside prison. When the victims in most cases get no therapy and help. \n \nWho do you support; is the question I would like an answer from our government. At the moment it appears to be the abuser, how has this been allowed to happen?\n \nNo matter what therapy you give an abuser they will not change their ways and if they can convince you they can, just remember how they made children trust them with their lies.\n \nAt this present time the only people who get therapy are the survivors who can afford to pay private. \nYes, there are some places on the NHS for the lucky few, normally its having to wait years to get the help. \n \nThe paedophile should pay for their crime by getting help for the victim and paying for the treatment. \n \nThe people who need the help are the survivors, the children and babies who have been abused. Don't waste your money on a person who commits such a heinous vile crime to a child. Keep them locked up for the rest of their natural lives, never to hurt another again.",
