            "action": "urge British food manufacturers to reduce palm oil in their products and label any products containing palm oil as 'palm oil', not 'vegetable oil'",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "32 million tonnes of palm oil is currently being produced worldwide and this amount is set to increase dramatically in the near future.\n\nTropical forests in the far east are being decimated to grow palm oil.  Some food manufacturing firms claim to use sustainably-produced palm oil, but to do so the tropical forest has already been felled in huge areas and will not re-grow.\n\nIf this level of production does not fall, orang-utan, Sumatran rhino and asian tigers are at risk of extinction in the wild.  WWF and Durrell Conservation Trust are working hard to conserve the rainforest, but the UK government and British food manufacturers should play their part.\n\nPalm oil is being brought in huge quantities to the UK, increasing our carbon footprint, when there are plentiful wholesome alternatives on our own doorstep - butter and sunflower oil. Butter, in moderate quantities, is better for our health as it does not contain as much 'bad' cholesterol as palm oil - and it tastes better!",
