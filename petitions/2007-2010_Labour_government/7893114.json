        "background": "It seems ridiculous that there are thousands of words of european legislation governing the height, position and wattage of headlamps but none on the maximum speed. Who needs a road legal car that can exceed 200mph in a country with a 70mph limit? Normal drivers are not skilled or trained to drive at these sort of speeds and the all too common resulting accidents are too often lethal to both the vehicle occupants and others. The legislation would also have to cover vehicle modifications but this is not insurmountable.",
