            "background": "It is unnecessary to have people take liquids in 100ml quantities. If a terrorist wanted to create a liquid bomb to blow up a plane, he could simply bring on completely legal amounts and make up the bomb on the plane. Therefore, the only way to completely stop liquid bombs is to completely ban liquids. However, this is not a very good idea as it would only create more delays at an airport where the security is already very tight. I therefore propose that liquids be completely allowed on planes, as it is impossible to stop the bombs without a complete ban.",
