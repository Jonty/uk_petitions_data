            "background": "Allow people who may not be able to work to stay on Benefit long term if they do more than 25 hours voluntary work. This could be of major help to a lot of charities which at present have to rely on Retired people for a work force. This would bring in fresh ideas and energy for the charity.\n\nBy doing this work the unemployed will gain skills and confidence to go out and look for work. It benefits the community in many ways by keeping people off the streets, improved services and environment, charities and voluntary organisations are made stronger and can help the community more. Your natural environment and nature can be helped and preserved.",
