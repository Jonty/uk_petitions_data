        "background": "In recent years the Seagull population has reached epic proportions in coastal towns up and down the country. \n\nChildren are being attacked whilst walking with their parents and people eating are mobbed by Seagulls. \n\nBin bags are ripped open and food is taken from shop entrances.\n\nThey've also been known to attack other smaller birds and their eggs and can be extremely territorial, even towards Humans. \n\nSigns saying 'Do not feed the Seagulls' clearly aren't working and by stopping people feeding the Seagulls may make them even more likely to attack others with food in desperation.\n\nThese birds were designed to live on the Seas and since moving into our towns and villages have become an absolute menace.\n\nPlease take action to force local governments and councils to actively cull the Seagull population in Britain for the Health and Safety of the populace.",
