            "background": "As petrol prices have fallen recently with the reduction in the cost per barrel of crude oil, the gap between the price of petrol and diesel has actually grown (in my area from 13/14p per litre to 16p).\n\nI think that this reflects the oil companies belief that as more and more consumers buy diesel-powered vehicles to reduce emissions (and road tax) they are easy victims.\n\nWhat other explanation is there for diesel now being expensive than petrol, when it used to be cheaper? Has the cost of producing diesel suddenly jumped? I don't think so!",
