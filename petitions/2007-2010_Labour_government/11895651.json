        "background": "GM has asked for up to $3.3bn (\u00a32.3bn) from governments across Europe, claiming 300,000 jobs are at risk. Roughly 5,000 staff are employed by Vauxhall in the UK with plants at Ellesmere Port and Luton.\n\nThe German government has said it is unsure if it will lend the money as so far they don't see vauxhall/opel as having a suistainable future. This is despite the fact that the Insignia was voted Car of the Year 2009. The british government must act now with or with out the support of the german government to prevent these jobs being lost from a company that can still perform. at the end of 2007 vauxhall's market share was up 1.62 percent at 14.95",
