            "background": "Mehpedrone is not currently legal for human consumption but it is common knowledge that Mephedrone is used by people as a recreational drug. However, due to it's illegality the drug is not regulated or monitored and therefore consumers have no guarantee in regards to how pure or strong their Mehpedrone is. If the substance was legalised it could be properly regulated and tested; like alcohol. Furthermore it would decrease the involvement of organised crime with the drug.",
