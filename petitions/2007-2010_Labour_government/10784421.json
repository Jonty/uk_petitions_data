            "background": "if i was caught with a knife on me, the police would do nothing about it, but if i used it they would. my question is, why wont they do anything about people who are caught with knifes on them, even if they havnt been used, why do the have that knife on them in the first place? we need to tell people that if you are caught with a knife you will face a punishment. we might aswell tell people that we dont care about what they do to each other. and just by telling people doesnt help, i mean really just because your told not to do something doesnt mean you wont do it, for example we are told not to smoke because its bad for us, and yet more than half of the  peole in the U.K smoke. we need to show these people just what will happen to them! and just because your scared doesnt mean it gives you the right to carry a knife, it makes you just as bad as them!",
