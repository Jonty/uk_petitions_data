            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I wish to request the Government to help to finance the new National DAB services of Premier Christian Radio which started in September 2009. This station has Christian love and guidance for listeners from all walks of life, regardless of race, religion or personal circumstances. The station does not attract advertisers like the big commercial stations do, and now listeners are being asked to help fund the station's new National DAB running costs of \u00a3100,000 a month. Ordinary listeners are doing their best to contribute what they can, despite many being disabled and in various difficult financial circumstances. The station also has plans, finances permitting, to launch a new service to enable mobile phone  users to listen to Premier Radio wherever they are, especially the younger generation. The station has a very broad appeal especially to families, and is not a 'churchy' type sounding station. I would like to see Premier Christian Radio possibly given a grant from the BBC licence fee and also an allocation from the National Lottery to enable them to stay on DAB Radio where they can continue their excellent work. Premier Brown, please help Premier Radio!",
