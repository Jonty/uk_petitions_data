            "background": "Mr Martin has consistently abused his position as speaker. He has shown a remarkable degree of incompetance in his dealings in the House, his financial dealings leave much to be desired, he is not trusted by many; and this latest episode involving the search of Mr Green's private House of Commons office and files comes as no surprise. Nor does it that he tried to firmly put the blame for this on his staff instead of taking responsibility himself. He must go.",
