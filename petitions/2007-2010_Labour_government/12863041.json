            "background": "We the undersigned support the notion mooted by Ed Balls to ban members from joining the teaching profession. We find it reprehensible in the extreme that anyone who has willingly joined a political party holding the bigoted views, including extreme racism, homophobia, class prejudice, Islamophobia and sexism, that the BNP holds, should be allowed in the classroom. The BNP also have substantial links to extreme rightwing neo-nazi terror groups such as Combat18,and has a history of violence toward ethinc minorities, LGBT groups, trade unionists and other groups. We therefore feel that anyone supporting the BNP cannot be allowed to teach especially as such views contradict many of the precepts of the school curriculum.",
