Too many people rely on benefit instead of getting out there and finding work.  A lot of people would come off benefits if they had to paint wheelchairs all day or help in old folk homes or sew mail bags etc.  Surely all these people would benefit the uk in a huge way if they were all given SOMETHING to do for their hand outs.",
