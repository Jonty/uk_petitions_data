        "action": "Give politicians dormitories in existing government buildings doing away with the need to buy a second home in London",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The government own buildings in London, many are not used.  Politicians claim the need to have a property in London which we, the taxpayer, have to pay for.  Why is it necessary to buy, at great expense, a property in London when all they need is a place to eat and sleep when not working?  Does it need to be an overpriced one in the most expensive property market in the country when many buildings could be converted to dormitories?  It could be close to Westminster, which they claim to be vital, a walking distance to the houses of parliament.  Two birds with one stone there as it\u2019s cost effective and environmentally friendly.  No one denies the need to have a place in their constituency and one near the centre of government but why does it need to cost so much?  It works for university students, academics and scientists.  So I suggest halls of residence for the members, who feel such a sense of civic duty they go to London to serve us.  They could even have a subsidised canteen to feed them as they work for us.  May I add I am writing this with immense restraint with regards to a system that seems to be self serving and rather free with all our hard earned cash.  Is luxury accommodation needed to serve the public?",
