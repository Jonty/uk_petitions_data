            "background": "In london, free bus travel is provided for children in possesion of a bus pass issued to them. If they forget this, they must pay full fare; a very reasonable request. The equivalent in West Yorkshire is a bus pass that costs \u00a32.50 to buy and only entitles children to half fare. I propose that a scheme should be set up in West Yorkshire, similar to the one in London, to provide children with this service. This difference could be seen as discrimination against the north of England. If you agree with this proposition, please sign the petition.",
