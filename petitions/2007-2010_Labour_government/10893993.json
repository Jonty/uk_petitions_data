            "background": "The government's dealings with Iceland with regards to the collapse of Icelandic banks has been heavy-handed, aggressive and completely disproportionate to its dealings with similar US and UK banks. \nIt is clear that the Prime Minister views Iceland as a small, easy target, and a chance to play tough, but the use of anti-terror legislation to freeze Icelandic assets is inappropriate and aggressive. We call on Gordon Brown to deal constructively and fairly with this small nation as he does with the superpower US.",
