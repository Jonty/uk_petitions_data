There are no plans for a fly over like the one at Whiddon Down (a few miles down the road) this will cut off the villages of Tedburn St. Mary, Pathfinder Village, Holcome Burnell and the golf course. Visitors and residents will either got to travel to Exeter (7 miles) or Whiddon Down (about 4 miles) to get back to Tedburn. All passing trade for businesses and pubs will be lost.",
