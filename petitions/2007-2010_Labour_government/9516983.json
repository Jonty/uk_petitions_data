            "background": "i want to see tighter controls on immigration. If an immigrant or aslyum seeker commits a crime in our country of which they are convicted in a court of law, they should be removed to their country of nationality regardless of thier immigration status in Britain. If they have a visa it should be revoked. If they are granted aslyum the right should be taken away if they commit a crime. No other country would allow a foreign national to behave in such a way, so why should we. Lets stand up and be counted!! lets preserve or country that we're proud of!",
