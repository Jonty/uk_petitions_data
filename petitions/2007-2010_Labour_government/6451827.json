        "action": "significantly reduce the cost of selected fruit and vegetables through subsidy, to make them affordable to everyone and enable them to access the NHS 5 a day",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Funds that are being put into other areas in order to promote healthy living and consumption of food by the NHS could be put into subsidising fruit and vegetables purchased in some supermarkets, in much the same way public transport fees are streamlined and subsidised by local authorities. This way with more people eating fruit and vegetables and less illnesses occuring as a result of poor diet the economy can be boosted by the populus having less days of illness and making less of a strain on the NHS' economic resources. Those who sign the petition advocate that the government needs to do more to help people get their '5 a day'.",
