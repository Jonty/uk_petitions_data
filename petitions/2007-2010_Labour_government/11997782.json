            "background": "The car scrappage scheme is a terrible idea. Older cars are greener for the environment as they are recycled even though newer cars might not kick out as much CO2. The government is offering \u00a32000 to scrap old cars, this means many classic cars will be destroyed which were once part of automotive history and all cars won't be sold for less then the scrappage value, this might also cause many poorer families to not be able to afford a motorcar.",
