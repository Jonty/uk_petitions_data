Political Parties in the UK no longer represent the people of the UK but exist for the sole purpose of grabbing power for a small number of people.\n\nIn summary, make Political Parties illegal. Please.\n\nFailing this please can we have an extra box on ballot papers from now on that says \u201cI have no desire to vote for any of the candidates listed but I don't want to be counted as not caring\u201d.\n\nPlease Note: Before you ban this petition on the grounds that it contains party political references that I have nothing against any particular party I've come to dislike them all :-)",
