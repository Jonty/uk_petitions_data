Some owners, however, modify their vehicles by virtue of fitting exhaust pipes (\"silencers\") or sub-woofers (fitted in the boot) that are subsequently driven on the streets and emit more noise than allowable.\nMotor vehicles are merely machines that serve a specific purpose and impact on Private life must be proportionate: The Right is satisfied with the free availability and choice of vehicles; wilful modification (away from manufacturers design and fitting) lessen this Right in comparison to residents' Right to Private Life in houses near roads.",
