            "background": "After undergoing an emergency Heart Transplant in 1994 at the age of 22, I find it incredible that there is no support for major organ transplant recipients or official recognition by government that we have now become disabled. Whilst being thankful for being alive and saved by a gift of life; our immune systems are now weakened by immuno-suppressants that make it dangerously easy for us to pick up infections and we have to attend regular health checks for the rest of our lives. Claiming DLA can become a battle, a mortgage becomes a far off fantasy, Life Insurance is largly denied to us and Holiday Insurance is akin to looking for the Holy Grail. I would like the Prime Minister, who at the moment supports Organ Donation, to have in place a fund or award that can be called upon by a tiny but ignored minority of younger recipients that have just started out in life, with nothing.",
