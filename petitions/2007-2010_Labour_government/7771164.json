        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The undersigned believe that there are currently insufficient procedures in place to prevent and punish drivers who consistently ignore speed limits and present a danger to themselves and other motorists.\n\nWe feel that too many offenders are being let off with what amounts to a slap on the wrist, only to return to the roads and continue to drive dangerously.\n\nWe also feel that there is an inadequate police presence on the roads, which simply encourages offenders to speed without fear of repercussions.\n\nIt is our wish that once police presence has been improved to an effective level, those drivers caught flagrantly breaking the law are stripped of their license for an extended period and forced to retake their test at a later date in order to qualify for a new one. Other offences, such as 'tailgating' and attempting to race other drivers, should also be met with harsher punishments.",
