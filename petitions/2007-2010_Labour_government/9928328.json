            "background": "It has long been voiced by many British motorsport fans that the quality of Forumla One broadcasts has been deeply hurt by the commentary provided by James Allen and his incredibly biased, partisan and at times juvenile attitude to the global sport.\n\nThis partition hereby asks that the British Broadcasting Corporation does not consider the application of Mr. James Allen for the position of lead commentator/journalist on the BBC F1 coverage that will commence in 2009.\n\n\nFor the good of F1 motorsport in Britain, its fans, and for the quality of broadcasting in the future, please look further afield to those more suited to a globally aware and non-partisan fanbase who wish to enjoy motorsport in its purest form.",
