        "background": "We must readdress the regulations introduced by Postcomm to ensure that Royal Mail is cmpeting on a level playing field with private compavies. Government should insist that those companies also provide those high cost , low profit services rather than selectively compete in the most lucrative sectors whilst capping Royal Mail's charges and reducing their ability to compete. That is the main driver behind the current CWU strike action.",
