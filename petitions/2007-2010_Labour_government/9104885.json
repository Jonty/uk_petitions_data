        "background": "Recent news has shown that there maybe MP's claiming expenses on items that have nothing to do with their day to day duties as a Member of Parliament and therefore something needs to be done about this. In any working environment if you are claiming money back from the organisation that pays your wages you have to submit receipts to show what you have spent the money on. The same rules do not seem apply to MP's who claim expenses from the Government (our tax's). MP's totted up \u00a387.6m expenses claim bill (BBC News 25th Oct 2007) in the 2006/2007 financial year. That's an average of \u00a3135,600 an MP on top of their \u00a360,277 basic salary. We propose to make sure that the Tax Payers money is not mis-spent that all MP's should submit receipts for all expenses over \u00a325.00 regardless of circumstances.",
