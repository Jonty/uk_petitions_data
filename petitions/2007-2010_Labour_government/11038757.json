            "background": "Several countries overseas have found that, by changing lighted road signs and traffic lights from the usual tungsten bulbs to Light Emitting Diodes they have experienced approximately 60% reduction in energy usuage with no reduction in luminous standard.\n  Such a move in Britain would necessitate a parliamentary order to the effect that - so long as more than 70% of the LEDs are lit that lamp would be deemed effective in order to avoid loop-hole lawyers trying to get clients off because 8 out of 40 LEDs were not lit",
