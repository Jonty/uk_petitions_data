The IFA (Institute of Field Archaeologists) does its best to act as a governing body by setting working standards. It is not, however, a requirement for practicing field archaeologists and archaeological organisations to join the IFA. The result is that poor working standards can be evident thus undermining our protection of the countries archaeological resource.",
