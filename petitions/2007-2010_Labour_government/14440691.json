            "background": "As the decision of the house of lords saying tht the OFT cannot assess whether bank charges are unfair.\n\ncan you tell me who can?\n\ni see that all banks have reduced the charges to about \u00a35 at time, is this not in itself showing customers that they were unfair and should the law not state that all previous charges should be returned to customers.\n\nsince the government pays benenfits in to the banks is it not the case that the charges effect the low paid and those who recieve their benefits are liable to these unfair and over inflated charges that the banks impose. will you legislate and make them return any costs of charges greater than \u00a35 and making sure the legislation is retrospective.\n\nWas it not the banking crisis that put us all into this harsh economic downturn for them taking high risks, now i see that these risk takers will be getting a high bonus.\n\ni hope that you have taken messures that we the public who bailed them out get a good return on the money we lent them during this crisis.",
