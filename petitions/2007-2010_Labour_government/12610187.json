            "background": "I fail to understand why any council needs to use an 0845 or an 0870 number to provide services locally. What is the difficulty in using the local 'std' code number? For the most part the councils are interested only in providing an efficient revenue collecting service. When it comes to actually providing a service to the public they have the attitude of giving as little as possible or making as much money from providing a service as is possible. Extract from the unsuspecting public whatever they can get away with. Using an 0845 number to contact a local council being one such example of the extortionate ways they have of squeezing the last drop of blood from the very people they are inherently supposed to be 'serving'.",
