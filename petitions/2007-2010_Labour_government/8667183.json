        "background": "The Avon & Somerset Police had a generous support settlement this year and are carrying forward savings from last year as well, so why are they asking for 4.86% this year? The Police are claiming they need this excessive rise in their precept for ICT/Technology investment, even though they are about to enter Southwest One where these very same investments and savings are already being claimed as benefits? Are they front loading the business case in order to profit the private sector?",
