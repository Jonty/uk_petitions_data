            "background": "The administration is seeking to cut the number of people claiming incapacity benefit but penalising poorly people in need of a sick note is not ethical. Making sick people have to mess around even more is counterproductive. GP's have not complained about issuing sick notes all these years, they are professionally trained, well paid, and should be able to deal with this. I see no reason to change what is a decent scheme.",
