Even if you are involved in an accident that was not your fault, insurance companies are still within their right to penalise you upon renewal. \n\nIt is our belief that the proliferation of uninsured drivers is in part because of the extortionate fees insurance companies charge, and can get away with.\n\nI.e an 18 year old new driver, with no convictions, claims or accidents, can still expect to pay upwards of \u00a31000pa for a vehicle with an engine size of less than 1.4 litres.",
