Well why don\u2019t we just give everyone living in deprived areas a pot of gold? It won\u2019t work will it? So let's introduce a real plan. Give people a financial incentive to give-up their weapons for high-street store vouchers. Vouchers are a way to stop people spending any money given to them on more weapons and even drugs.",
