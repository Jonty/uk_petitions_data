            "background": "Danny Fernandes aged 20 died at Headstone Lane Station on the 24th January 2009. The station needs to be locked up completely after the last train has arrived at the platform and everybody is off the train. There also needs to be more security on the train platform because if something happens to anybody if it\u2019s by accident or on purpose the CCTV cameras will see it all but can\u2019t predict what is going to happen, but could be stopped if there security on the train platforms and other members of the public could report if somebody was acting suspicious then something could be done about it. Since January 2009, two other people have tried to jump in front of a train and the mortality rate for train accidents will increase and more family and friend grief for those who have lost a love one because of a train accident.\n\nWe need to stop it now!\nIf you believe in this cause please sign my petition and help make a difference\n\nThank You it would be very muchly appreciated if you could sign this for such a good cause",
