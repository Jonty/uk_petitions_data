            "background": "The Health and Safety at Work Act says 'it shall be the duty of every employer to ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare of all their employees. Under the act, should an employee suffer a physical injury at work that causes them to be absent, the employer is required to report that under the Riddor requirements. However this is not the case for a mental illnesses brought on by stress, bullying or other event within a workplace. Indeed, this is specifically excluded from these requirements. A fact that I believe to be fundamentally wrong, as an injury, is still an injury. Such illnesses can be equally damaging to an individual and, can have a long-term impact on their well-being and/or ability to work.  I therefore petition for a change of the wording of the HSW Act to include a clause requiring the reporting of employee absence due to mental illness/injury. Thereby ensuring the identification of employer failing in their duty of care.",
