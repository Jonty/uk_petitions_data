She asked her husband in 2007 for a divorce after suffering domestic abuse. Since then Rocio has worked for the minium wage and has never claimed any benefits of any kind. She pays her mortgage and council tax and everything else that needs to be paid. \nRocio applied for permanant residence in the UK under EU rules, which state she must have five continous years of being a solvent citizen. She has complied with all this but has been refused permant residence. Please sign the petition to show your support for this wonderful lady and her children to remain in this country as a permanant resident.",
