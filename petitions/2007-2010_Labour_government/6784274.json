            "background": "The airline tax that we as crew are paying is making it not worthwhile to go to work for some trips! Would it be possible to reduce this tax for airline employees who commute from overseas and the UK or offer us some sort of tax rebate! This tax is intended to cut out unnecessary travel and is not so bad on holiday makers making a few trips per year but when we are paying the tax on a weekly basis to get to work for our own airline, travel which is necessary, I think concessions could be made! It should also be noted that we travel on a standby basis and are filling seats which would otherwise fly empty on the same aircraft consuming the same amount of fuel wheteher we are accepted for travel or not.",
