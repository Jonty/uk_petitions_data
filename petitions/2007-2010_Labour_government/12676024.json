        "background": "We have 650 odd Mps mostly claiming over 100,000 pounds each in expenses including office and staff costs plus their salaries plus ministers wages plus the army of civil servants and consultants in the rest of government. There is the overheads of all the government buildings to house these people. Then we have regional assemblies, county councils, local councils, QUANGOs plus devolved parliaments all requiring wages, expenses and overheads.  On top of all this we have the European Parliament were the costs are well documented. This lot added together is ridiculous to say the least . It makes you wonder how with all these people running things we have ended up in the mess we are.",
