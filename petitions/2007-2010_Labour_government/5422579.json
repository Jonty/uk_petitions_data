            "action": "introduce a bill to parliament that requires cyclists to possess liability insurance when travelling on the public highway.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "If a motorist drives a vehicle on the public highway, the law states that they must have insurance. Cyclists do not have to pay a insurance premium for the use of the highway.\n\nIf (for example) a cyclist was responsible for a collision, the motorist has to pay the excess fee for the repair and is placed at fault for the collision by the insurance company - even if innocent. The motorist may also lose their no claims bonus.\n\nBecause of the way this system works, the motorist is financially penalised for doing no wrong. If a claim against the cyclist is left to the motorist to pursue, a civil claim through the courts is required - at more cost.\n\nInsurance companies should pursue claims against guilty parties, instead of financially penalising the innocent.\n\nLiability insurance for cyclists would reduce the financial burden placed upon themselves (cyclists) should a insurance claim be necessary.",
