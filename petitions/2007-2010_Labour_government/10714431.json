        "background": "This is something a recent petition has called for. While not wishing to minimise the suffering of the POWs the Iraqi civilians are hardly responsible for it, and neither do they have any control over what the Japanese government does, so why should reparations for THEIR suffering be delayed?  Two wrongs don't make a right; and the suffering of the Iraqi civilians is no less important than that of the Allied POWs.",
