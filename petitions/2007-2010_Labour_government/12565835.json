        "background": "Elected officials act as our representatives and are therefore put in a special position of trust. MPs insist that anyone else in such a position of trust is \"presumed guilty\" and must prove themselves innocent of any crime to their employers. Elected officials are employed by us. MPs, councillors, MSPs, etc.  deal with extremely sensitive cases where members of the public would be very vulnerable to any criminal or deviant behaviour by our elected representatives. Therefore, they above everyone else should be subject to the same presumption of presumed \"guilty\" until \"proven innocent\". Therefore, we call upon the prime minister to apply the same standard of \u201cguilty\u201d until \u201cproven innocent\u201d to elected officials as our elected officials seem to apply to everyone else and ask that all elected officials should be subject to Enhanced Criminal Records checks  and have their DNA taken and compared with all known criminal cases, and the results published so that the public who have to deal with MPs can have absolute confidence in their integrity.",
