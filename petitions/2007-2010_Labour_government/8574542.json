            "background": "The current tax law for redundancy only allows up to \u00a330,000 to be paid tax free, anything above this amount is taxed.  \u00a330k may sound high but redundancy payouts are frequently used to reduce the size of mortgages which are now far higher than the \u00a330k limit or they are used as a buffer until new, often lower paid, work can be found.  In a similar way to Inheritance Tax, Redundancy Tax is very unfair as the government is taking money away from hard working people with no real justification at a time when they can least afford it.",
