        "background": "I for one am sick to death of constantly reading of normal, law abiding citizens of this country being assaulted and victimised by so called 'Gangs Of Youths' who hang around streets in menacing groups causing mayhem, dis-order and distress to the normal, law abiding people of this country. Why should we put up with the softly softly approach that the current governmental policies have created. We are the victims, we are the ones who have to suffer because the police are rendered powerless to deal with these 'young anti-social yobs' in the apropriate manner. We need some sort of firm legislation to remove such 'Gangs' from the streets - There should be no more 'No Go Areas', No more old folk being intimidated, No more mindless vandalism of public property, No more 'Getting P**sed every night' on the streets and in the parks !! We need action now because this situation will only get worse if no action is taken - How many lives will have to be sacrificed like there was in Warrington last week (10/08/07), We can all see it but why isn't anything done about it ??? Please support this petition before it is too late. Thank You.",
