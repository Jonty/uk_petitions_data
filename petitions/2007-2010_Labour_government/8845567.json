It is considered to be an overlapping benefit ( what rubbish!) When I became 60 I could carry on claiming carers allowance or claim my pension which was - for me- almost the same. I claim the carers allowance. If I did not look after my husband I would be able to claim my pension. Why can t I, and other older carers get some recognition for the money we save the government.",
