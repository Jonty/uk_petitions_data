            "background": "We call upon the Government to scrap plans to introduce legislation banning deactivated firearms. Not only are these historic items, but the Home Office's own experts have stated that a ban would be unnecessary, unfair and unproductive, and that the solution is to address the social root-causes of gun crime.\nThe Home Office's own statistics show that reactivated firearms of the type to which the proposed ban would apply (pre-95 deactivation) were used in only 4 out of 11,084 offences (0.03%).\nLive handguns are already banned, the act of reactivating a deactivated firearm is already banned, and acquiring live replacement parts to reactivate a deactivated gun (namely the barrel, breechblock and firing pin) are already banned. Anyone who has access to these (illegal) components has already gained access to all of the parts necessary to make a live firearm.\nThe only people the proposed ban on deactivated firearms would penalise are genuine collectors and historical re-enactors who have no intention of breaking the law.",
