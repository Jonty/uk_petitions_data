        "background": "With the selection process for high/secondary schools, children with older siblings should be given priority to chosen to attend the same school as them. My friend has 3 children attending 3 different high schools in the city. It has caused a lot of practical problems for both her and the kids. For example, have different school holidays, parents evenings on the same dates. It would be less stressful if all her children could attend the same school.",
