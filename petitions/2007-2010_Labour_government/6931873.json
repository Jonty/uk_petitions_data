        "background": "By comparison to many other European Countries, Britain has fewer public holidays and none at all for a period of some three months between the August public holiday and Christmas.  Moreover, Britain does not have a \"National\" day.  So what better way to celebrate our Nation than to have a National Remembrance Holiday falling on the second Monday in November each year to reinforce Remembrance Sunday which falls on the second Sunday in November?  Such a holiday will serve to emphasise our commemoration of The Fallen who gave their lives to save Britain and also the on-going importance of the survival of our Nation.  The National Remembrance Holiday will further serve to break that period between late summer and Christmas when there is currently no public holiday.",
