            "background": "I wish to have a blanket ban, on children being driven to school between 8am and 9am and between 3pm and 4pm being picked up. This stupid practice makes kids lazy and snarles up the local roads in rush hour. Most parents seem to see it as the easy option to jump in the car. There is the school bus or local buses, get and use them.",
