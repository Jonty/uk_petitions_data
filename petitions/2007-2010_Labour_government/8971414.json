In a rural location with no bus/rail services I am reliant on a car to look after her, take her to the doctors shop etc. MY husband needs a car for work but we only run a second car to look after my mother who lives 5 miles away. Some recognition of voluntary carers in the form of car tax exemption would be appreciated.NB when we replace the second car it will be with one that attracts less duty but as I cannot earn a living we cannot save up for a new one!",
