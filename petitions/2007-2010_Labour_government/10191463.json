Motion detector light switches are not only a green option they could save a small fortune on the buildings owners energy bill and cut their CO2 output. The switches work by automatically switching off the lights if there has been no movement in the office for a set amount of time. Say 20 minutes. Switching off the lights will also reduce light pollution and for once in my life I maybe able to see the stars in a city. Wouldn't that be beautiful?",
