            "background": "A new high-speed rail service will be available in Kent from Dec 2009.  The ticket prices for this service will be substantially higher than the normal rail fare.  The slower services are to be reduced in frequency (with the same fare, no reduction) forcing customers onto this high-speed service, a service which very few will be able to afford and which is less convenient as it travels to St. Pancras.  The new high-speed service fares must be the same as normal service fares.",
