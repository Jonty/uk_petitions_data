If smokers and people who eat fast food are to be refused access to NHS treatment, then the government should remove all tax on cigarettes and unhealthy food.  I don't see that happening somehow.  And how long until this escalates, so that drinkers, drivers, or those with mental health conditions such as eating disorders or self-injury are also refused treatment, because their illnesses/injuries are \"self-inflicted\".  This is a ridiculous and unfair move by a government already taking the nanny state too far.",
