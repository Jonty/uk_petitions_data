It then either hangs up on you as there was no customer service operative available when you answered (even though they rang you) or you get an automated message about a competition draw, becoming debt free, accident claims, etc...\n\nThis is absurd! How are companies legally allowed to  interupt our lives with such annoyances?\n\nSales calls were annoying enough as it was, now they don't even have the decency to ring themselves, they have machines to do it!\n\nThis practice should be outlawed.",
