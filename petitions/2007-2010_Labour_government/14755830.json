I find it disgraceful that after conflicts such as the Gulf the Falklands, Bosnia and Afghanistan we can allow these brave loyal individuals to be just shut out in the cold, literally. This country is better then that, these people need our help and they need it now. They served for our country so its time country repay them.",
