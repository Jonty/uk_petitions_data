The Tory members were in the majority and therefore they should have been in a position to force a vote.  They represent the people, they were in the majority (through total lack of interest on the part of Labour) therefore whomsoever is in the the majority at that point in time should, by law, be able to call the shots!  The House of Commons has retrograded to nothing more than a talking shop and this atmosphere has to be reversed by the removal of the certainty that nothing can happen while they are not there.",
