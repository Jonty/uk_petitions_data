The uniform/dress of the speaker has been eroded by recent speakers but in particularly by Speaker Bercow.\n\nThe dress sets him apart from MPs help maintains authority in the house. It is also a tradition that need not be stopped for the sake of doing so.\n\nFor the substantial remuneration the speaker is awarded he should be prepared to go to some inconvenience even if he does not like/enjoy wearing the traditional dress.",
