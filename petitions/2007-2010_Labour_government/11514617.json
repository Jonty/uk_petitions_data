They then get into all sorts of difficulties..eg. shark loans etc.; The idea is a radical method to repay loans with out effecting benifits; employment; pensions etc.; Loans made availble are repaid by 'loan work'. 60 hours of 'loan work' would repay \u00a3400 at \u00a35.73 an hour.; 'Loan work' would not effect benifits; pensions or employment.; Providers of 'loan work' could be given bounties or sweetners if permanent work is a result.",
