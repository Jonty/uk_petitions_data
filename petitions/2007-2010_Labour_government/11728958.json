It is a basic freedom and without it women will always be subjugated and considered to be \"lesser\" simply because they are censored.  \nWomen's breasts are biologically no more sex organs than are men's. In principle, women may be as interested in men's exposed breasts as men are in women's. \nLaws and social pressures prohibiting women to be barebreasted are a form of unjust discrimination.\nEither let both men and women have the right to be topfree, or make the law also cover men.",
