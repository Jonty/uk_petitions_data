            "background": "Dependants and UK Based Civillians based overseas under the care of the army have only one police force to turn to for help: the Royal Military Police. The RMP's are soldiers themselves and due to the nauture of their training when joining the army they work as a team watching the 'backs' of their fellow soldiers. Therefore, when a soldier does something wrong and a civillian wishes to report him for it, trying to get the police to take action against a fellow soldier is more difficult than it should be.",
