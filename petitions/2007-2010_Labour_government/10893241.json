        "action": "Abolish Council Tax in England and replace with a local sales tax",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Liberal Democrats came up with the policy of scrapping council tax and introducing a local income tax. My proposal is to take this idea one step further where a local sales tax would replace the Council tax. This would mean that if a family could afford to buy more they would have to pay more tax. This tax would save the local authorities court fees for non payers and all citizens would pay for their local amenities rather than just home owners. This proposal would benifit Pensioners, home owners and would hit the fat cats of the country.",
