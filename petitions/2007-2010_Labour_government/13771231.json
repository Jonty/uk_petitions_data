            "background": "The unemployed and particularly welfare claimants are frequently misrepresented and demonised by society at large. The community work many do voluntarily is often ignored and I feel programmes such as New Deal is counterproductive in its current form as it treats claimants like cattle, forcing them to do effectively unpaid work and engage in pointless and soul destroying excercises. Too many, though not all, staff in New Deal Centres openly talk down to and bully claimants in a way that would not be tolerated with other minority groups. I request that the government, where possible, ensures that welfare claimants are treated equally and that their views and concerns are properly heard.",
