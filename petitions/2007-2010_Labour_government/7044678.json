            "background": "The terms common assault and common assault by battery are terms you would expect to be associated with violence, but the way the laws are at the moment they seem to be bypassing common sense.  If you were to blow in some ones face you would be arrested for common assault, if you were to poke or prod somebody you would be arrested for common assault by battery, where as people committing actual battery get let off leniently. The law needs to be looked at and re-evaluated and any instance\u2019s of a prod or poke to another person should have all aspects looked at, i.e was it provoked or was it a joke that got a bit boisterous.",
