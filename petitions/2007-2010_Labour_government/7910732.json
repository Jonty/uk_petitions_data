            "background": "Arreton is a village on the Isle of Wight. Over the last year the local Conservative Council has spent \u00a31.5 million making Arreton a school for the 21st century. Under the council's school reorganisation plan it has decreed that Arreton Primary will close. The Children's Plan talks about safe play areas, healthy schools and that the school should sit at the heart of the community. It wants schools to be zero carbon. Arreton School has Enhanced Healthy School's status; its playing fields are the only safe play area in the village. It has environmentally friendly heating, lighting etc. It has a purpose built nursery providing care from 0 - 5 years and an after school club. The pre-school and reception are linked so that the foundation curriculum is seamless. Many of the schools that the council propose to keep open have none of these benefits. Pupils that attend Arreton come from a wide area, mainly because of the excellent provision and parental choice - another national requirement. Parents have moved children to our school because their current school was unable to provide provision for disabled children. We believe that the life skills that we instil in pupils is second to none.",
