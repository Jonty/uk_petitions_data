            "background": "Personnel of the Police, Fire and Ambulance Services put their health & lives on the line every day to protect and serve the general public of Great Britain. They are regularly subject to sickening assualts/obstruction of their duties. It is with this in mind that I think punishments and sentences on all people who physically assault/obstruct personnel of the emergency services should be increased. There should be a higher minimum sentence for any physical assault/obstruction on emergency service personnel. Assault/Obstrution to emergency service workers should also include damage to emergency vehicles.",
