            "action": "Instruct Reading Borough Council to remove the Castle Hill Priority Lane system and replace it with a road design that people understand, appears in the Highway Code, is approved by Rospa, suitably risk assessed but also assists in the movement of traffic.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In Reading, A4 Bath Road at Castle Hill, is a priority lane for traffic travelling certain directions at certain times. There is a problem, people fail to read the signs on entering the lane, and as witnessed and others have been involved in, there are incidents of collisions, near misses, side swipes, road rage, using the lane when not supposed to etc. I was hit by a lorry here, due to narrow East bound lane and the centre priority lane, a lorry was too wide and too long to safely negotiate the lane sliced the side of my car open, pulling the wing off. The road signs on entering the zone are an essay of poor English and are vague, they rely on drivers entering the zone knowing what to do, on drivers being able to read the sign, to see the sign once you are under it or to read English! What RBC need to do is to seek the opinion of locals and users to see how they feel, they need to get assistance from Rospa whom can carry out a risk assessment and the effect they have. Please fill out this petition as a message to Reading BC through the Number 10 Website Petition to force the Borough to seriously reconsider the design of the road layout and impact to the people of Reading.",
