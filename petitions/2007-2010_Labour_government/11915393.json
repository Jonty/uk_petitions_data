I think that this is a wondeful idea, but you have rejected it.  Why not allow e-petitioners to decide whether it is a good idea or not?  And, in another e-petition I asked for better cross-party collaboration.  This idea was also rejected.  Again, why not allow the great British public to share their feelings on this matter?  If there is enough support for an idea then surely it should be pursued and the government should put effort into trying to overcome any obstacles to implementation.",
