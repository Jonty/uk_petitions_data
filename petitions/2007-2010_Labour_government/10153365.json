            "background": "It's blindingly obvious that petrol prices NEED to be lowered nationally. In addition to this, I believe it would be highly beneficial if the government introduced a petrol allowance for those who heavily depend on their cars, e.g. for work, for people not near public transport, or caring for a relative, especially for those on a low income. This would help to lower the stress caused by the ever rising prices in this country (and if stress is lower, NHS bills are likely to be too!), and be a huge help to those who are dependent on their cars.\n\n(OR, with the money they'd save in admin costs setting up this, just LOWER TAX ON FUEL!!)",
