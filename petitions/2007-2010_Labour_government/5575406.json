        "background": "Too many people are going to university studying \"easy degrees\" with only 6 hours a week as apposed to engineering and science degrees which can occupy 20+ hours a week. Teachers who require a degree will take the easy option of drama/media degrees just to get a job which leaves a gap in our education system for science. Where will our country be in 10 years time? we already have a shortage of math and physics teachers, our education system is slipping!",
