            "background": "The London Underground Metropolitan Line is unique that it was colluded into the Underground network, when the line was always designed as a commuter surburban line and rolling stock has always been designed for the needs of journies over 30 minutes into central London. The proposed new rolling stock for the metropolitan line is for tube stock trains, with less seats, more standing and no overhead baggage areas. This may be sufficient for the short stop circle and hammersmith and city lines, but is not sufficient for the metropolitan line, which should be introduced with new 8 carriage Overground Trains to Surburban capacity. At the same time, the Metropolitan Line should be re-instated to Aylesbury.",
