            "background": "Currently all cigarettes sold in the UK state the amounts of Tar, Nicotine & Carbon Monoxide (CO) on them. It is not feasible to ban cigarettes entirely but it is in the interests of the individual and the Health Service to reduce the harmful effects of smoking.Therefore it is requested that the following new limits be introduced; Nicotine no more than 1mg, Tar no more than 1 mg & Carbon Monoxide no moren than 1mg; in any cigarette sold in the Uk as of 01 Jan 2009. The implementation date allows for a gradual reduction in the interim and allows the tobacco companies (and smokers) to phase in the new levels.",
