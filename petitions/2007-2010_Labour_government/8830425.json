            "background": "The police do not have sufficient resources to monitor and enforce good driving standards. The number of cars has increased dramatically and unfortunately the standard of driving has dropped. Introduce a system where selected ordinary people with advanced driving knowlege (and a clean licence) are given training so that they can report poor/dangerous driving. If three or more Marshals report a vehicle within say six months, the police would then investigate and take appropriate action to correct/punish  the offender.",
