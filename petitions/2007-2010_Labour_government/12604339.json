        "background": "Your GP can at present strike you from their patient list simply by stating that there has been a patient Doctor relationship breakdown. They do not have to answer to anyone if you choose to question their decision.If you complain to the PCT the PCT have no power to insist the GP gives an explanation as to their actions.The Doctor could simply strike you off because he/she simply doesn't like you or for example if you were costing the practice too much money by way of treatments etc. You are deemed guilty of whatever the Doctor cites as the reason without any form of redress.",
