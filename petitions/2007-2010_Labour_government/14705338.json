            "background": "we the undersigned do petition the prime minister to ensure that the uk air sea rescue organisation remains in british hands. the colour scheme does not really matter,but are traditionally recognised. what is of concern is the cut from 40 to 24 aircraft and the whole re-organisation of the force with mixed crews . our boys do an excellent job now and their experience gained in this role stands them in good stead when posted to new units.thereby broadening skill and expertise of the services as a whole. privatisation is not the way. what we want is crews in uniform prepared to do our bidding forming an esprie de corps and  creating pride and high morale. there are rumours that this could be juggled with the timing of the general election, but 2012 is the date mentioned for aircraft changes.",
