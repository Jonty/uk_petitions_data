            "background": "Redbridge Council has just changed their criteria from Critial and Substantial to Critical and Greater Substantial.  Those that are deemed to fall into the lesser substantial will suffer as a result of the change and might not qualify for any care. This will put an enormous strain on carers and their families.  Service Users receiving care packages will be reviewed and could fall into the lesser substantial category.  It is vital that Redbridge Council receives more funding from the Government and other funding sources in order to protect the elderly and vulnerable people in our society.",
