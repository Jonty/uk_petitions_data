I feel that the Prime Minister should consider a new British bank holiday ,on the monday nearest to the day of his death, or a specially recognised day on the exact date of his death every year, so that the whole of the country can remember the king of pop, the  man who changed music forever and so his soul can live with us through the rest of our lives.",
