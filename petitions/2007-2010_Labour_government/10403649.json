            "action": "speedily instruct the Higher Education Funding Council of England, as representative of the Elected Government of the Day, to immediately investigate the current \u201cDestruction\u201d of the BEAVERS RETREAT at The London School of Economics & Political Science, Old Building, Houghton Street, as a much loved social venue of long established benefit to the LSE\u2019s current & future staff, students, alumni and its extended community and a unique place to \u201cmake a difference\u201d to the world we live in.  We FURTHER REQUEST that the PM publicly support of the right of the LSE Environmental Initiatives Network alongside other alumni groups to seek an IMMEDIATE HALT of all work on the demolition of the Beavers Retreat (affectionately named after the schools own industrious mascot), pending the outcome of a proper and urgent investigation of this controversial \u201cdecision\u201d by the Council of the LSE.  We further implore the PRIME MINISTER to \u201csign this petition today\u201d and to urge others to do same with the practical sense of urgency required before it is too late to prevent this misguided travesty. What chance of  \u201cSaving the Planet\u201d if no-one can save the \u201cBeavers Retreat\u201d at the LSE?",

            "background": "We note the failure to publicise this decision or to engage in any consultation since the decision was taken in April.  This contravenes the schools stated policies to engage and be transparent and ethical in its decision making.\n\nThe Beavers Retreat is a civilised traditional space that has a special place in the affections of almost all alumni.  It is noted for its selection of real draught ales and the occasional warm fire.\n\nThe principle of \u201crenovation over destruction\u201d, of re-use, repair and recycle in that order, was not followed under the schools environmental policy.\n \nWe note the significant sums of money raised from Alumni are being used in part to fund an act of vandalism disrespecting the schools heritage.\n\nWe urge the Governing Council of the LSE to reverse the closure of the BR and its 32 year history serving staff, students and alumni of the school and allow this investigation to proceed in order to protect the schools international reputation.",
