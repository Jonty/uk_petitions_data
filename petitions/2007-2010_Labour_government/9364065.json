            "background": "Soaring fuel prices, erratic weather and growing demand for biofuels \u2014 is pushing global food prices up dramatically. But in Western coutnries, most of the cost of purchases from the supermarket shelves is spent on packaging. What about encouraging the food industry to stop canning and use re - useable plastic contained ? Single yoghurts in packs of six are the worst  ! And why can't margarine be despatched in paper ? or tinned tomatoes in cardboard (similar to fruit juice ?) The petitioner is kindly requesting that the P.M. introduces a review of food display and distribution, before the poor pay even more.",
