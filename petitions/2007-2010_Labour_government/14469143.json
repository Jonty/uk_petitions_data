            "background": "Promoters are making lots of money promoting organised 'pub crawls' where they target young people (students) and actively encourage them to drink to excess. Their 'events' leave a trail of vomit and litter in our cities and participants can end up so drunk they have no idea what they are doing and can harm themselves or others, outrage public decency, etc.The promoters take no responsibility for the consequences both on the young people who participate, and on the tax payers who have to foot the clean up and policing bills following these events. This petition is that such irresponsible events should be banned by law.",
