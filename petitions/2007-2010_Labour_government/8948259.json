            "background": "It is common nowadays for companies to advertise promotional offers which involve something that is free.  For example, kitchen companies often advertise free fitting, or maybe free sink or taps.  These offers are however dishonest, as it is easy for the company to increase the price of the advertised product so as to cover the cost of the supposedly free gift.\n\nThis practice should be made illegal.  Nothing should be advertised as free, except where this can be reasonably justified.",
