            "background": "In the last couple of months, information was leaked pertaining to the alleged behind closed doors discussions about smearing General Richard Dannatt as soon as he retired. Despite the obvious pathetic nature of these plans, and their public exposure, the 'government' has today commenced its campaign. I call on Gordon Brown and his entire government to start acting like leaders not petulant schoolboys, and start focussing on Britain's problems. If not, then call an election so we the public can have our say on your performance.",
