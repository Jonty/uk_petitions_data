            "background": "Currently it is very unfair. Large\norganisations contribute to their employee's pensions. Small organisations do not as there is no legal obligation and little union pressure.  The law should be changed so that every employer should have to make at least a modest\ncontribution.  This is the main reason why many people end up with no pension\nother than the State Pension which is quite inadequate on its own.  This would\nsave the government money in income support for the retired and ignificantly\nreduce the misery of the elderly. It would cost the government nothing.  The\nsmaller organisations may not be too pleased but surely they would have some\nconcern for the future of their loyal employees without whom they could not\noperate.",
