        "background": "The working British public are consistently paying for non British people and illegal immigrants to walk into our hospitals and be given free healthcare.  Despite this some hospitals are refusing to provide life saving/prolonging drugs to British patients due to the fact that they are too costly!  NHS cards with fingerprint identity will not only act as an id but also provide health care for the people that actually pay for the healthcare system. Anyone without a NHS card will have to pre pay for treatment and if they cannot then any debt should fall to their own country's government. I pay \u00a3130 a month national insurance, I have no children, and I've had no operations so why should I pay to provide healthcare to the rest of Europe.",
