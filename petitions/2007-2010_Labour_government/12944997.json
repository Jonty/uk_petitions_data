        "background": "The government has broken the covenant between the nation and its troops: it continues to ask extraordinary feats of its men and women and yet it will not provide them with the tools to carry out their work.\nForcing our soldiers to use roads to travel incurs unnecessary and wasteful loss of British soldiers' lives. Our troops should at least be delivered to the battlefield in as much safety as possible to give them the greatest chance of successfully carrying out their work.\nThe government is at present openly and blatantly neglecting its duty to protect our troops, and must take whatever action is necessary to reassess its priorities and redirect more funding towards this need.\nThe solution is not to cut other defence projects \u2013 history teaches us that if we want peace, we should prepare for war, with the unprovoked invasion of Kuwait and the Falkland Islands being two obvious recent examples.\nWe need more funding for defence.",
