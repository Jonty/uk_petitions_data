            "background": "Life In The U.K Test is very informative and helpful to become a better citizen. However it is discriminatory because only non-EU citizens are required to take it. Before its introduction people have always managed to intergrate in the british society.The fact that its purpose is not intergration but barring people from other nationationalities from settling in the UK is evident because EU citizens can be equally ignorant but are exempt.I have worked with Polish citizens who could not read an english newspaper.Even U.K citizens can fail the test. To prove my theory select 100 people whose lineage has been in the U.K since the 1st century to take the test.Some will definitely fail. U.K is in danger of becoming a PHARISEE  and SCRIBE nation imposing on others burdens which even itself cannot keep.",
