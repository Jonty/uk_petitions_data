        "background": "Broadband and mobile phone contracts are always classed as \"unlimited\" but a fair usage policy (FUP) applied which then sets limits. eg my phone has \"unlimited texts\" but the FUP states only 3000 per month, same with unlimited internet FUP states 20Gb per month. Clearly these cannot be unlimited if a FUP sets limits.\n\nThe government should therefore ban the use of FUPs as caveats for \"unlimited\" services.",
