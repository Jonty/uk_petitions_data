        "background": "Every organisation, business, and family in this country, is having to make adjustments in their budgets/spending habits as a result of the current economic climate.\nHearing Local Authorities even discuss the possibility of increases, and worst still above inflation increases reflects a complete lack of respect and understanding of the communities they serve.\nI believe that the government should therefore insist on a minimum of a one year freeze, and they, like all other members of our country, should cut  their cloth to fit.",
