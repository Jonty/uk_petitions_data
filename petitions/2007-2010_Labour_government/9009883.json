        "background": "The Vehicle road tax system is designed to encourage more fuel efficient and greener vehicles, yet if you run your vehicle on Bio-diesel you will see no relief on tax as your vehicle is still able to run fossil fuels. We demand a review of this system as the use of Bio-diesel is not only environmentally friendly, but lower costs can help boost our economy significantly. It has been documented that Volkswagen environmental awareness division, note that biodiesel reduces engine wear as it has better lubricity than that of today's diesel fuels. It has Low SO2 (Sulphur)content\nand contains fewer aromatic hydrocarbons. Biodisel reduces Particulate emissions by around 50% in comparison to fossil fuel. It is completely Biodegradable, non toxic to humans, and can be easily processed using waste cooking oils as a source meaning more recycling of the products we already use.",
