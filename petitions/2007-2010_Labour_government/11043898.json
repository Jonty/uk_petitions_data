        "action": "change the law on buying and selling property so that once an offer is made and accepted a party is liaible for any costs incurred by the other party if one party pulls out of the sale or purchase of their own accord",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "At present in England, sales of properties are not legally binding until written contracts are exchanged. This can take 10-12 weeks from an offer being accepted.During this time the buyer has to spend a considerable amount of money on surveys, legal fees, mortgage fees etc. If the seller then decides to pull out of the agreement for whatever reason it leaves the buyer out of pocket. A better system would be that if either buyer or seller pulls out after having agreed a price then they are responsible for any costs the other party has incurred. It would also stop any unprofessional tactics from estate agents trying to inflate the price.",
