            "background": "My son applied for EMA at the end of August and it is now the middle of January and we are waiting for our first payment. Despite over 30 phone calls, letters and faxes we just keep getting excuses for the delay. EMA is supposed  to encourage children to choose further education. My son after spending 2 years at college was due to sign on unemployment but as we all know there are no jobs so we talked our son into doing another year at college in the hope that there may be more jobs in a years time but if he had signed unemployed at least he would have had some money and at least we would not have had to spend the last 4 months having to fund his bus travel and meals. Every time i phone the EMA they never look at your file and just start to go through a list of reasons why you have not been paid. If you ask to speak to the manager they try all ways to avoid this. The manager is always in a meeting, out of the office or on holiday. My sons course will have ended before we get a payment. This is not a one off, we have this problem every year and we know we are not alone as there are others in his class who have also not been given a payment. It is disgusting!",
