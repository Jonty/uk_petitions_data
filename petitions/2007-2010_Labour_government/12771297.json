            "background": "I believe that as a large percentage of the population do not bother to vote then any result cannot be representative of the British public. As well as the candidates there should also be an option to abstain. If the abstainers total more than one third of the population then another election should be held.\nThere should be more ways to vote. Every person on the electoral roll should be sent a unique voting code. They would then be able to vote via email/postal vote/ballot box or text message using their unique code. \nFor those people who do not vote a fine should be levied unless there are exceptional circumstances. \nThe British public should be encouraged to feel that they do make a difference.\nI love this country and want to make it Great once again.",
