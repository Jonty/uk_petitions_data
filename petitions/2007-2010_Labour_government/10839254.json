            "background": "We, the undersigned are concerned about the rapid disappearance of funfairs, theme parks and piers from our coastal resorts. We are asking the government to make financial concessions and funds available via the National Lottery and the Department of culture Media and Sport to encourage and assist local authorities in the preservation of these attractions for the general public to enjoy, as they are part of out heritage. \nIn recent years, on the North West Coast alone has lost traditional theme parks such as Southport Pleasureland and Ocean Beach, Rhyl, which have closed resulting in the demolition of classic rides many of which were the last of their kind in the UK.   We  have also lost some of our historic seaside piers due to neglect caused by lack of funding.\nThis has a detrimental effect on tourism and will eventually cause local businesses and shops to close resulting in further decline. We hope the government will consider these views and  secure the future of our seaside resorts for future generations to enjoy.",
