            "background": "Rule Britannia is a song that is known and loved in all four corners and countries of the United Kingdom. By keeping God save the Queen as a royal anthem we can keep our heritage to the crown as we do now. But Rule Britannia is song that makes people proud to be English, Scottish, Welsh, Irish and ofcourse British. Rule Britannia may be more appealing to those against monarchy or that don't believe in God or simply to those that love the song.\n\nIf you want to see Rule Britannia as the British national anthem and God save the Queen as the British royal anthem then please sign this petition, thank you.",
