It is time to show real respect for the elders of our society.\n\nwww.matureandmultitalented.com is sending this epetition to  agencies and organisations working with this age group. Our mission is to make lifetimes of experience available to a world that needs it, and to see that experience being valued and properly supported and sought. So sign up here in support of making the state pension tax exempt.",
