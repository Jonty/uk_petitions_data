            "background": "Even though atmospheric carbon dioxide continues to accumulate - it's up about 4 percent since 1998 - the global mean temperature has not increased for ten years. That raises some obvious questions about the theory that CO2 is the cause of climate change. To burden people with extra tax on the strength of dubious science which is now being discredited is wholly unjust.",
