I have witnessed the acutely embarrassing scene many times of Ugandan citizens queuing outside the UK High Commission for a visa to come to the UK. The High Commission charge \u00a3100  non-refundable application fee and refuse 95% of applications.This brings a tidy \u00a310,000 income per day from an average 100 applicants. Funding the entire embassy and all its activities from the sweat of poor Africans.Applications are denied on the flimsiest of excuses and appeals are only considered by some non-de script office in London. Totally inaccessible to the average African. The system is demeaning and inhuman and harks back to the 'superior' colonial era. It should stop.",
