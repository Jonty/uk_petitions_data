            "background": "A lot of people in this country suffer from Renal Failure (Kidney Failure). However when applying for disability money they are refused time and time again. \n\nThis petition is aimed to make kidney failure an automatic disability. Kidney failure in itself is a very disabling thing, your body cannot get rid of toxins and you stop passing urine so you have a build up of fluid. \n\nIt also causes anemia and hypertension. You are often weak and breathless and can barely do easy day to day tasks.",
