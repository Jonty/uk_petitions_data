            "background": "The media always concentrates on the \"Youth\" of today, a collective term that showers negativity over all of Britain's teenagers.\n\nTragedy needs to be reported, this is true, but why does this country forget to reward those who don't cause upset? How is any young person supposed to feel safe in a world where the media is telling them that they are \"youths\" who should be given Asbos?\n\nThis country has the highest level of young offenders, but perhaps they would not feel the need if they could get recognition for positive actions, rather than negative.\n\nThis petition asks the Prime Minister to rethink ideas such as the \"Buzz Off\" campaign - which causes distress to innocent children more often than those it targets whilst adults feel nothing - or warnings such as ASBOs. Instead, it requests new award schemes, challenges and competitions to allow the \"Youths\" to reclaim their right to be the bright future of the country!",
