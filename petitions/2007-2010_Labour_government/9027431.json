        "background": "Why Ban Pornography?\n\n1) It affects every viewer negatively, regardless of creed, gender or age, and leads to progressive addiction & compulsive behavioural problems which can ruin the lives of sufferers & families.\n\n2) It feeds lust & leaves viewers craving more & more to achieve same highs. It enslaves people to their cravings & opens doors to anger, abuse, violence, hatred, lying, envy, compulsiveness & selfishness. \n\n3) It sexualizes viewer's mindset & warps/perverts their perspective so sex is unnaturally elevated in their mind. Porn is stamped into a viewer's brain with the aid of hormones released during arousal, so even if one stops looking at porn, past images can remain for years or a lifetime. \n\n4) Looking at porn damages family relationships & increases chance of children finding the material. It can also cause sexual frustration, lying, affairs, debt, violence & irrational thinking, which all affect the sufferer\u2019s family.",
