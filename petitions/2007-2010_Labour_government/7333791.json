If these CD\u2019s are going to be misused, then this could happen at anytime, so how long do we have to keep checking?  I am very worried about this and feel the Government should be held accountable and compensate us for what is in effect, criminal incompetence.  Nationwide were fined \u00a3980,000 for the loss of a laptop, so it should be that the Government are fined for it\u2019s incompetence, and the money divided among the families, on top of Child Benefit.",
