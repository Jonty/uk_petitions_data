            "background": "The fiasco of the Durban conference for human rights looks to be repeated this April in Geneva. The UN's Human Rights Commission is preparing a\nstatement that singles out Israel and Zionism for \nextraordinary villification.  Ironically, the chair of the UN Human Rights Commission is Algeria and other \"model\" guardians of human rights, such as \nIran, Cuba, Egypt and others.  They focus their entire energy and a ton of vitriol on Israel - a democratic country under constant threat.  The tone of the conference is blatantly antisemitic. Britain should not lend legitimacy to this hostility fest, and should withdraw from this conference immediately.",
