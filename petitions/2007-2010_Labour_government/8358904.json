            "background": "On top of the ridiculous numbers of new houses proposed for this rural shire under the West Midlands Regional Spatial Strategy, Baroness Andrews has now asked for \"options which could deliver [even] higher housing numbers\". Furthermore, it seems the development of eco-towns at Throckmorton and Long Marston would be IN ADDITION to and will not count towards the county's huge allocation of new-build housing.\n\nOf course new housing is needed, but it is the sheer scale and rapidity of the proposed urbanisation that is wrong.\n\nWe the undersigned don't like it, don't think it is needed, don't believe it should be imposed upon us by Whitehall and don't want it.",
