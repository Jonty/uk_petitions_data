            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Enough is enough!\n\nSince October 2007 when the price breached the \u00a31 a litre mark prices have steadily risen. Petrol is now around \u00a31.20 a litre and diesel \u00a31.30...20% and 30% rises in 6 months?!\n\nWe've had enough and the government has raked in enough!!!\n\nScrapping the VAT on Petrol and diesel would enable a retail price of around \u00a31 per litre for petrol with over half still going to governments coffers. A reduction of a further 10p in duty would bring diesel in line and give our transport industry a much needed competitive edge (the inducstry is in a vital cog in our economy surely?).\n\nDuty has not discouraged car use (the lack of affordable reliable public transport has) so the argument of taxing fuel as a deterrent is a complete red herring.\n\nWe already pay tax on our meagre salaries!!! And we get hit twice with the cost of transport affecting household good prices.\n\nAs a necessity, it is a disgrace that gas and electircity carry any taxation at all. Taxation on fuel causes fuel poverty. VAT on fuel should be scrapped now and a harder line taken with the energy companies with a maximum mark up on wholesale prices enforced.\n\nAre you listening No 10??",
