            "background": "Tesco has recently bought a retail premises on the road on which I live. It replaces a furniture shop that has been there for some time, and even though the owner has been happy to sell the shop to the company, after they made him 'an offer he couldn't refuse' there are more serious considerations to take into account.\n\nTesco is one of the world's largest retailers and this developement shows how they have, again, used their immense power and money to infiltrate another neighbourhood and undermine its identity. Tesco doesn't care about how its presence affects local communities and about the independent businesses it stands to replaces.\n\nAccording to Tesco's own website, there are already 19 Tesco stores within a 3 mile radius of my home. This includes a huge 24hr supermarket in Brent Cross, as well as the high street Express and Metro stores in Hampstead and Kilburn. There is no corner of the retail market that Tesco wants to leave out and this is killing small businesses.",
