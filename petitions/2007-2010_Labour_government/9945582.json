            "background": "Currently, ltd companies are the only employers eligible to participate in the Government's excellent Childcare voucher scheme.  Many small businesses with employees are Sole Traders.  In many cases, these businesses are no different in terms of what they contribute to the economy to ltd companies, but they have been excluded from being able to offer their employees the right to offset their salaries against nursery / school fees. They and their employees have been unfairly missed out.",
