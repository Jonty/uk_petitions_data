            "background": "There are many people in the UK who have a relatively low opinion of the current crop of politicians in all political parties, and therefore feel compelled to spoil their ballot paper at an election. This, however, has no material effect on the election, meaning such voters are disenfranchised. One approach to prevent said disenfranchisement would be to introduce 'reopen nominations' onto ballot papers; if 'reopen nominations' (or 'Ron' for short) won a constituency, political parties would  then be forced to select alternative candidates in the effected constituency rather than those presented in the initial election.",
