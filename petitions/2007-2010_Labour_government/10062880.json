            "background": "Discontinue making state payments of our taxes for the purpose of religious education:  No child should be indoctrinated into any religious beliefs as occurs in many cases within our schools and with the support of our elected government by its involvement financially and otherwise. This must be an abuse of their freedom to make up their own minds at a more mature age when first having been told about the basic beliefs of the various religions, and the reason why some people do not hold these beliefs. I do not see that it is socially healthy or fair to all those of no religion, and certainly not with the money from those of us who are in no way religious. If we are to claim to be a truly secular country then let us start to be one...Religion should be something that is partaken of as in joining any other purely social activity outside of both schools and the states jurisdiction. I believe the above strikes a cord with very many uncommitted parents to religion and the public as a whole.",
