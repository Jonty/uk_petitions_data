        "background": "Most people in the uk subscribe to one form of digital media be it Sky or virgin as we are not satisfied with the quality of programming on terrestrial television. Even though we pay a premium for this service we are forced to pay for a television license costing \u00a3145.50 for a colour T.V or \u00a345.50 for a black and White television. This is compulsory as we are forced to pay this regardless of our viewing preferences and also are threatened with fines in excess of \u00a31000. Bring the license fees to a reasonable level or scrap it all together. We the people have spoken.",
