            "background": "Flight departures and arrivals should only be allowed from the City Airport on Mondays - Fridays. There is sufficient capacity at the other four London Airports to meet any weekend demand. \n\nFlights should be restricted to the Thames Gateway to minimise the impact on the local communities. Accident statistics show that over 53% of flight accidents are within 10km of the airport, with over 20% during takeoff. The Government should not be taking risks with the lives of the local communities and transport infrastructure. A route that follows the Thames river and estuary would reduce this risk.\n\nPermitted noise and pollution levels should be reduced year on year to take advantage of all the latest technology advances.",
