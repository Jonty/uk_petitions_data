        "background": "As we hear constantly about traffic congestion, there seems an enormous amount of HGV's and large vehicles on the road during the morning and evening rush hour periods.  I suggest all HGV's and large vehicles should be banned from using the road between the hours of 7am to 9am and 4pm to 6pm.  I am sick to death of driving to and from work every day, along 60mph roads and being stuck behind a lorry doing 35-40mph and being unable to overtake due to solid white lines.  The Highway Code says they should pull over where possible to allow faster moving vehicles to pass, but they would rather tootle along at their own pace, ignoring the huge amount of traffic behind them.  Lorry drivers - SHOW SOME RESPECT TO OTHER ROAD USERS.",
