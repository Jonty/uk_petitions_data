            "background": "A growing body of research evidence shows that increases in the number of patients cared for by each nurse leads to increases in hospital-acquired infections, pressure ulcers, malnutritition, dehydration and patient mortality. This also leads to increased levels of stress, demoralisation and \"burn-out\" among nurses.\n\nWe therefore feel it is vital to tackle the understaffing of hospital wards. The government should set statutory minimum nurse:patient ratios, with penalties for NHS Trusts that fail to achieve these ratios.",
