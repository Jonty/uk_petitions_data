            "background": "In the current GCSE curriculum, there is a subject known as ICT. In this course, you learn how to use basic applications such as Microsoft Office, and several components of the Adobe Suite. Whilst this is all well and good, this course does not really teach practical COMPUTING skills more than it teaching office skills. I believe this to be very misleading. In its place, I believe that the existing course should be renamed to \"GCSE Office and Marketing\" and a new course created, where practical computing skills, such a programming in several languages, computer assembly and repair skills etc. are taught. This course should also be available at the GCE (A-Level) tier of education.\n\nTheir are many areas where this knowledge could be practically applied, even if it were not followed as a final career path. For example, the expansion and further development of the BitTorrent Protocol and Linux and to build Web Browser Plugins. Whilst I have only named a few, there are many possible applications for these skills, such as Programming for a wide variety of items, such as Operating Systems and Computer Games programming.",
