            "background": "This petition is about removing all of the fools the constantly complain about everything and anything! Those that want smoking banned everywhere, alcohol completely banned, those who want 500% tax on fuel and fatty foods, the ones that think that health and safety means you should wear safety goggles when playing conkers and that there is such no thing as an accident. The ones that cannot just let others make choices about their own lives and feel that they have to poke their noses into other peoples business.\n\nI suggest they are removed from the UK and are forced to live in a communist country, or possibly a dictatorship.\n\nWhere they will have no rights and have to keep their winging little traps shut.",
