        "background": "I would like to see the historic Woodbridge Airfield in Suffolk re-opened for civil flying.\n\nIt is famous for its wide runway which, along with the one at the former RAF base at Manston, was originally constructed to assist damaged aircraft to land on their return from raids over Germany.\n\nWoodbridge was used by the RAF during World War II, and by the United States Air Force during the Cold War, being the primary home for the 79th Fighter Squadron and squadrons of the 81st Fighter Wing under various designations from 1951 to 1993. For many years the 81st Fighter Wing also operated nearby RAF Bentwaters, with Bentwaters and Woodbridge being known as the \"Twin Bases\".\n\nIt would be a real boost to the local economy and tourism if the airfield were re-opened.",
