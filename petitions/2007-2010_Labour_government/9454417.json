            "background": "Apart from the chinese, the rest of the world knows that Tibet is a free independant nation, therfore the visit by the leader of the Tibeten people should be classified as a state visit with the PM meeting his holiness the Dalai Lama at 10 Downing St, and not Lambeth palace..\n\nMr Brown, in the 1950's we shamed ourselves by not assisting the free people of Tibet when the chinese invaded, this has been a stain on our country ever since, and we have compounded this shame by trading with the chinese as if nothing is wrong with their regime.. DID WE LEARN NOTHING FROM WWII?? Please do not relegate this visit to a meeting of a spiritual leader, this is a state visit and should be treated as such, if the chinese are offended then that is not really a bad thing? Did we worry about offending the nazi's? the chinese treat the Tibeten people as bad as the nazi's treated the Europeans that they occupied.. Please do not shame us more!!!!!",
