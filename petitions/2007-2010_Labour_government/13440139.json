            "background": "The BNP believes and promotes the view that only \"natural\" Britons whose families and ancestors have historically resided in the United Kingdom should be allowed to live in this country. They spread the view that \"non-natural\" Britons are inferior and should be forced to emigrate from the country. This is in contravention to laws against inciting racial hatred and therefore they should be banned on these grounds. Also their view ignores the fact that many \"non-natural\" Britons were brought against their will to these shores as slaves. It is wrong to express the view that we should evict their descendants from this country.",
