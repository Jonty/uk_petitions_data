        "background": "The new Volkswagen Polo advert features a cute dog singing along to 'I'm a man' by Spencer Davies Group. This advert is genius and one of the best car adverts ever made. Yet the Advertisement Standards Agency has received so many complaints from some viewers that the ad has been taken off air.  \nAny dog owner would tell you that dogs cannot sing and it is rather obvious that the dog in the ad is computer-generated.  No animal has been harmed in any shape or form to make this advert. Please, bring it back, it is the most hilarious advert and it is most fun to watch on our tv screens! Let the Polo dog be the television star once again!",
