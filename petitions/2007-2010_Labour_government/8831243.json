        "background": "Whilst we support the right of non-smoking staff and inpatients to be protected from second-hand smoke, we are concerned about the restrictions because:\n\nThey promote inequality and infringe on human rights.  Unlike other service users, those detained under the Mental Health Act do not have the freedom to leave hospital grounds, or in some cases hospital buildings, to have a cigarette.\n\nSome NHS Trusts have ignored the Smoke-free NHS Guidelines by not providing secure outdoor areas where inpatients can smoke or by banning smoking on hospital grounds, effectively forcing inpatients to quit.\n\nMany inpatients feel that smoking is one of the few choices still available to them, in an environment where their choices are severely limited.\n\nInpatients are being forced to quit or reduce their smoking at a particularly vulnerable and stressful time, and many are finding this damaging to their mental health.\n\nFor inpatients, especially those in long-stay units, the ward they live on is effectively their home.  Other places considered to be homes under the Regulations, such as prisons, are exempt from the restrictions and mental health inpatient units should be included in this.",
