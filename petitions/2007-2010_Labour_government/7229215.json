        "action": "change the law to remove British Airways exemption from paying VAT on aircraft fuel AND to remove aircraft fuel costs from the list of business activity which can be charged against running costs to reduce the tax liability of the business.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Every time a business charges its running costs against its tax bill, the taxpayer is subsidising the activity of that business.  It has recently been declared that British Airways is running empty aeroplanes across the Atlantic.  It can afford to do this because it can charge the cost to the taxpayer.  This has to be stopped - let them pay VAT on aircraft fuel and remove the item from what may be charged as running costs of the business.  This will reduce the cost to the taxpayer while at the same time making British Airways properly fund its pollution of the atmosphere.",
