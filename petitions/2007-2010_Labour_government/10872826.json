This will help the man on the street, but importantly, also suport the banks from the bottom, stoping a flood of reposesed property forcing down house prices. If the banks know there mortgage book is supported then they be more inclined to lend to new borowers, who will be willing to buy homes if they feel there investment wont be reposesed if they become unemployed.",
