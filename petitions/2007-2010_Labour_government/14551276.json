Negative stereotyping and discrimination towards 'ginger' people in the media contributes to this.\n\nThe question is this; replace this negative abusive comment 'Oi *** ginger' with anything to do with race, religion or sex, and it is a punishable offence. Why on earth is it seen as 'ok' to be abusive towards redheads?\n\nPlease, would the Prime Minister and MPs rally to stop this. And do something to change British negative views towards red haired people.",
