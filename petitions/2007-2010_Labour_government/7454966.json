Barnwell PO is at the heart of a triving community and is used not only by the residents of the village, but my residents of at least 22 surrounding villages and numerous local businesses.\n\nBarnwell PO is open at convenient times, easy parking, friendly staff and most of all needed in our community.\n\nA lot of people in Barnwell and the surrounding area are solely reliant of the Post Office, with a serve lack of public transport in the village, many elderly people can not get to the local town and as such the Post Office is an absolute necissity in the village.  \n\nDue to the ease of parking and extremely convenient hours of Barnwell Post Office, it is utilised by numerous local businesses.\n\nSTOP THE CLOSURE OF BARNWELL POST OFFICE AND HELP SAVE THE HEART OF A COMMUNITY",
