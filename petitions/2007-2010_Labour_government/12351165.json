        "background": "The country is in disarray because of the moral vacuum and appalling policies of the current government.  We have a leader who realizes himself that nobody would have elected him as even in the early days he `bottled out' of putting his popularity to the test.  However, even though most of us would not have voted for a party with Gordon Brown as a leader, few could have imagined just how disastrous his leadership would be.  Surely even he can see that it is time to go.  We wish him a long, quiet and invisible retirement.\n\n(This is not covered in other petitions that are currently running, as the above is more general.)",
