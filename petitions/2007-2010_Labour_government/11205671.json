            "background": "We urge government to drastically reduce the court fee for care proceedings so as to remove any impediment for local authorities to issue care proceedings.\nWe believe that\n* Local Authorities are driven by budgetary restrictions and targets.\n* Child Welfare is paramount\n* Decisions to remove children from abusive adults should be taken without the disincentive of money.\n* The Court fee in any event is passing from one government department to another.\n* The case of Baby P is an example of what may happen in the future if the law is not changed.\n* Justice is starved of resources and is no longer an equal partner to Health and Education as previously was the case.",
