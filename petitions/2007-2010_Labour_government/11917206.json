            "background": "We ask the PM to end the culture surrounding 08 and premium rate phone numbers.\nWE ask him to legislate and end the fact that in addition to paying line rental, and phone fees based upon time called, that we as consumers also pay companies money for 08 numbers.\nWe ask that this practise should be ended as we pay enough for telephones and its immoral and wrong for companies to make money from our phone calls.\nThis is different to other petitions asking that 08 numbers be given either alternative 01/02 numbers, and stopping public services benefitting from 08 numbers, we ask this practise of companies making money from 08 numbers be ceased altogether.\nIt is outrageous we have to pay a company to telephone them.\nThe reason is that they fix the system by providing long queueing systems engineered to keep you waiting whilst they make money from your call.\nThis practise URGENTLY needs to stop.\nIt isn't as simply as paying for time to speak to someone, they engineer a long wait.\nPlease do something about this.",
