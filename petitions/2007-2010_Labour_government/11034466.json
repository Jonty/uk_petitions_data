On rememberance day, when I put the poppy on my shirt, I feel that I and this country should be doing so much more for every single solider or a member of the armed services who have or will serve our nation. I petition to you to increase their pay, increase the awarness within local communities to respect the army profession and to do more medically, emotionally and to support all injured soilders that have returned from war. These are not only my wishes and hopes but wishes and hopes of a nation of families who have know those who serve us. Please take the time to consider my wish. Thank you from me and our Heros.",
