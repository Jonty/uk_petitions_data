            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I live in a part of Hampshire that has always had a poor terrestrial TV signal. On analogue there is no Channel 5. Channel 4 looks like a snow storm. Teletext is intermittent. Freeview gives BBC channels only except in bad weather when a further small selection can sometimes be received. Despite this abysmal service and numerous complaints from locals to the authorities, we are expected to pay for a full TV license. The excuse given is that the regulations relate to ownership of the TV set. The government should reform licensing so as to create a direct correlation betwen the fee and the standard of transmission. Commercial pressures will then ensure an improvement in the signal.",
