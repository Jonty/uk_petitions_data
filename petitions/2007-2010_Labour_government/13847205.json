Scientists shouldn't be dismissed when their conclusions are seen as politically dangerous; instead, they should be recognised as a much-needed source of impartiality within the realm of governance. \n\nIf there's valid evidence surrounding a change in drugs policy, this should be upheld as an opportunity to minimise health risks and improve education to the general population. \n\nWe therefore petition the Prime Minister to do everything within his power to reinstate David Nutt, and apologise for this overtly political manoeuvre.",
