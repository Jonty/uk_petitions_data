        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The new formula for (CSA CMEC) calculations has now been in place since April 2006. Non-resident parents  still being assessed under the 'old rules' have experienced a long and avoidable delay in assessment under the 'new rules: currently a delay of 6 years more than long enough to honour an election manifesto promise. The continued use of both the 'old rules' and 'new rules' is unfair because it inevitably results in different levels of assessment for cases having identical financial circumstances. Those non-resident parents who are responsibly paying the CSA's assessment under the 'old rules', which have long been recognised as unfair, are believe it or not still bearing the financial burden and related misery being levied daily under the 'old rules', which may well be alleviated by assessment under the 'new rules' We call upon the Minister concerned to do the right thing and instruct the CSA CMEC to bring in the new simplified and fairer method of assessmnet for all cases with immediate effect.",
