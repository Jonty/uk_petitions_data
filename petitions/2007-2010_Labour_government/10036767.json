            "background": "With the shocking mass-strandings of dolphins on the Cornish coast on 9th June 2008, the issue of the potential dangers of modern sonar has again been highlighted.\n\nThe question must be asked as to whether strong modern sonar equipment is causing harm to sea life - particularly cetaceans.  There are many instances that suggest it is.\n\nWhales and dolphins rely on their own form of sonar for much of their existence.  The system is highly developed and highly sensitive.  It is obvious, therefore, that extreme intensities of artificial sonar within their environment are likely to interfere with the natural mechanisms of the animals.\n\nNot only is it likely to cause confusion, but more importantly, severe pain and suffering as well\u2026 enough to drive the creatures - in extreme panic - into shallow waters to die.\n\nIt is, therefore, vitally important that the proper research is conducted to determine the type and degree of effects that man-made sonar cause.\n\nAs technology advances, it is imperative that sonar development carries the safety of sea life and non-interference within the underwater environment as its highest priority.\n\nPlease add you name to this petition.  Action MUST be taken.",
