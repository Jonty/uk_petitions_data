When people make private investments it is their decision and their decision alone if that investment becomes bad then that is their issue. The taxpayer does not provide any relief for the small corner shop if they go out of business so why should speculative shareholders be entitled to taxpayers money. This \"Bail Out\" would be selfish and reward speculators who gambled and lost that is they way of the free market.",
