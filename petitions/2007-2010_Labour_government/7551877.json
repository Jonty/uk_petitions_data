            "background": "The Swedish Model is an attempt to suppress the oldest profession by criminalising the client only. This is in breach of the basic requirements of sexual equality.\nResults have shown that prohibition drives the industry further underground into a area of greatly increased risks to sex workers. This is unacceptable.\nThe Swedish Model would also be extremely difficult and costly to enforce in the UK, and would divert resources from the prevention of trafficking.\nMost workers in the industry favour decriminalisation of their profession, and that is seen as the basis for constructive legislation.",
