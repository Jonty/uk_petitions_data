            "background": "The Austrian School of Economics has pointed out for a long time that the income tax discourages investment, saving and hard work.\n\nAfter all what is the point of working your backside off if the government will decide how much you get to keep? Also they want to make sure they can fund all their social experiments for you to support people who do not know and have never met.\n\nAbolishing the income tax would shorten government revenue. But that is good news. People will no longer have to fund a growing welfare state, pre-emptive wars and bank bailouts that they don't agree with.\n\nIf the government truly believes in economic freedom, they will heed this petition.",
