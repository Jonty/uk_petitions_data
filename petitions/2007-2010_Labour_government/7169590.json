        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Just look in any Estate Agents or local free newspaper, there is an abundance of houses, bungalows and flats for sale! It is the excessive prices that make them unaffordable for many, especially first time buyers. Freezing prices from rising would achieve four things: 1.Wages would gradually catch up due to other inflation. 2.There should be little negative equity as residential property prices would be unlikely to drop considerably. 3.More homes would be kept below any Inheritance Tax threshold. 4.Less need to build low cost housing which is likely to become the sub-standard blighted housing of the future as a lot of '60s estates and tower blocks are now.\nThe only exception should be if people make home improvements that increase the value of their homes in proportion.\nI have signed petitions against 'buy to let', please do the same.",
