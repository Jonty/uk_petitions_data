        "background": "I am an (Indian) MBA student at the University of Northampton and planning to do my research study later. As a part of my study I had visited one warehouse in this area and really shocked when I saw the working conditions of the employees there. They are treated as machines and most of them are uneducated, unable to communicate with the \u2018in-charge\u2019. They can\u2019t even go for a glass of water when they are \u2018on\u2019 work. \nIn another company, the \u2018bosses\u2019treat the workers with high rate of discrimination. They say 'go home\u2019 even at 4 am (even to girls) very frequently to Asian (students) with no reason or less reasons just to push 'their' people in without considering the hassles of going back at that hour. It is very painful to see and experience the elements of racism in England in this hi-tech era in its crude and most inhuman shape.\nWould you please look into the matter by its deserving seriousness and take a corrective action against this modern cannibalism? Otherwise it will remain as a callus stigma on the beautiful face of the Kingdom.",
