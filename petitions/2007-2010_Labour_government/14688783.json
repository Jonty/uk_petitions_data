        "background": "On 11 Feb it was announced that a new system to police politician's expenses was going to cost \u00a36 million (6 x more than any expenses repaid). \nThis seems to be unnecessary and a simpler system (e.g. publishing expenses for public scrutiny with clear rules) will be better and cheaper. \nPoliticians will then police themselves at virtually no cost, knowing that any excess claims will be openly published.",
