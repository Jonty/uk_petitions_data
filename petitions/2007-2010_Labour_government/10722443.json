            "background": "We recently received an email from the embassy informing all British subjects in Zimbabwe that our basic rights to protection in case of emergency (detailed in the front of our passports) have been removed. The reason stated was because there are \"just too many\" of us. This is despite the heightened violence in Zimbabwe, and in view of the fact that we are racially discriminated against here. However, the British government spends vast amounts of money on re-identification for released criminals, hospital fees for terrorists and giving benefits to those who are too lazy to work. I'm sure Mugabe and his regime are delighted to know that they are now free to do with us what they like. Let us be given back our basic rights!",
