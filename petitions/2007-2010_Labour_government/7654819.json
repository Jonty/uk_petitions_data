The government need to increase funding in this area to make up for the cut and ensure that they are using our tax money to give oppurtunity in terms of career paths and audience access to all!\n\nThe Arts, always under funded, are increasingly becoming elistist pursuits. We need funding for theatre, dance, music and literature, so that all are given the oppurtunity to create and view work made. So that all have access to our rich cultural heritage.\nFeed our souls. Save the Arts.",
