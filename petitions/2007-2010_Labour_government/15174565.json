        "action": "Ban the use of cremation and promote burial in the ground or burial at sea.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In this age of global warming and declining fish stocks, doesn't it make sense to ban cremation, thereby negating the introduction of large quantities of CO2 into the atmosphere.  Promoting burial at sea would also provide a rich food source for all aquatic creatures which we have, for thousands of years, feasted upon.\n\nBut whether we are buried in the ground, or buried at sea, we are re-entering the food chain, rather than being a further cause of global warming.",
