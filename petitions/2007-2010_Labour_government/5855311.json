        "action": "concede that the UK, and the world, will fail to achieve any dramatic reductions in CO2 emmissions, and that the best thing to do about climate change is to plan and prepare for the consequences.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Three points:\n\n1) The UK's contribution to the planets CO2 emissions are very small.\n\n2) Even with the best efforts of government and public, the UK is only likely to achieve a very small reduction in its emmissions.\n\n3) If the UK does manage to dramatically reduce its carbon emissions, it will be at huge cost to public and industry, involving sacrifices both financial and in terms of lifestyle for everybody.  Massive developing populations such as China and India meanwhile, will continue to progress and to emit CO2 on a massive scale.\n\nIn short, the governments proposed tactics on climate change are too much pain for so little gain.  Lets just focus on preparing for both the negative and positive consequences of what is happening to our slice of the planet.\n\nWe must stop wasting massive resources trying to achieve the impossible.",
