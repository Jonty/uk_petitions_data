            "background": "Although mothers are aware of the benefits of breast feeding some are actually unable to breast feed and some chose not to. Mothers should be given freedom of choice and be given information to support their decision. This is currently not happening and mum's are left scared and sometimes depressed due to lack of professional support.\nThis petition is asking for a change in legislation making it possible for health care officials to provide the help and advice needed by mothers to support 'their' choice when it comes to feeding their children - whether that be by breast or bottle.",
