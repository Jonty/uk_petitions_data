            "background": "I have to travel a large number of miles to get into work each day; the increased revenue the government is earning from fuel tax is exemplifying the rising fuel cost problem.  Working is not an option for me or millions of others in the country.  The only benefactors from the price rises are the treasury office and the multi billion dollar oil companies.\n\nAs David Smith points out in an article in the Sunday times,\n\n\"If prices stay close to present levels, the Treasury will be \u00a36 billion better off this year.\"\n\nMr Smith then goes onto point out,\n\"As each 1p-a-litre cut in duty costs \u00a3500m, that windfall would allow a 12p per-litre cut. But let\u2019s not be greedy: 10 is a number with topical resonance, so let\u2019s have a 10p cut in petrol and diesel duty right now. Environmentalists shouldn\u2019t complain because forecourt prices will still be up on last year, but we\u2019ll all be happier..... .\"",
