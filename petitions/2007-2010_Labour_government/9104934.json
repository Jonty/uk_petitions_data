            "background": "Since George Bush Snr came to power, Britain has fought more \"police actions and wars\" than ever before, not only stretching our armed services to the limit, but also our servicemen and women to exhaustion. But the loss of life suffered in \"freindly fire\" incidents by gung-ho US Pilots who shoot first then ask who it was, is the worst on record. Bush Jnr (Dubya) has since compounded the problem enourmously. Our present predicament of terrorist activity in this country, after nearly 40 years of IRA problems, is a direct result of the USA's involment and full support and armament of Israel over many years, in which the USA have lately involved Britain due to the special relationship. It's now time to abolish this relationship and say no to the US and no to Israels deplorable antics against the native population of palestine.",
