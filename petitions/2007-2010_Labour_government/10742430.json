        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Anyone applying for a British passport must have their application and photographs countersigned by a \u2018professional\u2019 person who has known them for over two years and to whom they are not related. For most people, this means their GP.\n\nGPs charge anything between \u00a320 and \u00a350 for this \u2018service\u2019 which only takes them two minutes at most to complete.\n\nAll they are signing, is that the photographs are an accurate representation of the person whose details are on the form and that to the best of their knowledge, that person lives at the address given.\n\nThat does not require a \u2018professional\u2019 person\u2019s signature. A person\u2019s next door neighbour could confirm as much.\n\nThe rule that the countersignatory must be a \u2018professional\u2019 person presupposes that anyone who is not a \u2018professional\u2019 is untrustworthy.\n\nNot only is this inherently discriminatory, it allows already well paid \u2018professionals\u2019 to charge what amounts to a tax in order for them to write their name on a form.\n\nWe therefore petition the Prime Minister to abolish the discriminatory rule that a \u2018professional\u2019 person must countersign passport applications and allow anyone to do so.",
