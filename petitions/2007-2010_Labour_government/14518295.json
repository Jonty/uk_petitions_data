            "background": "We the people of this country are sick of false promises and lies and being told that reviews will be done when nothing ever is. 17 years ago after that beautiful boy James Bulger was killed we was told this would not happen again and tough messures will be but in place. This fostered Edlington two got charged with GBH only and got a minimum of 5 years. We would like a review of this as this is not taking a tough stance against this and we want them to not be able to get new ids and we deserve to know the monsters names. Enough is enough, we will not go away and be quiet we will push for this as this is what the goverment promised us. Justice is what we deserve.",
