        "background": "Where drunkenness leads to accidents, there are already ample regulations to punish the irresponsible and these should be used rigorously.\nHowever, regulations designed for drivers on motorways should not be extended to offshore sailors. To try and prevent cold helmsmen from enjoying a well earned tipple at sea is ludicrous and unnecessary bureaucratic nonsense. It is also unenforceable - adding yet another law to the long list of those everyone ignores - and thereby destroys respect for the law.",
