        "background": "We believe we should be proud of being English and living in England.\nWe are not saying we are better than other cultures; in fact we are all proud of the diversity of cultures in England.\nWhat we are saying is that our English heritage, history and culture should not be pushed aside and forgotten.\nWhich is what is happening. Something has to be done so that we do not loose what we have worked so hard to have. If children in schools are taught more about Englands history then there is more chance it will be looked on as a positive thing.",
