            "background": "The prison buildings in the UK are from a bygone age of Victorian design and are outdated and outmoded. The concept of locking up people in a cell for 23 hours of 24 every day does not reform prisoners as the Victorians thought it would and the UK is still using that design and philosophy which is known not to be effective. New prison design and process is required.",
