            "background": "In some cases, adoption is not in the best interests of the adopted person. On reaching adulthood, they should have the right to reject the adoption order and have it legally revoked.\n\nThis should not confer any legal rights or responsibilities on either the child or birth parents beyond the recognition of the parent-child relationship on legal documents, eg to have the birth parents names on the adopted person's marriage and death certificates. It should remove all rights and responsibilities between the adoptive parents and adopted person.",
