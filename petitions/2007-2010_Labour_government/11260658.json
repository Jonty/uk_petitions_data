            "background": "Many businesses are now making the vast majority of their UK based employees redundant and moving their work offshore to call centres across the world for commercial reasons.Some businesses who have done this in the past have lived to regret it finding that customer frustration has lead to their customer based reducing, and hence the cost savings are outweighed by the loss of revenue. We are in an economic minefield at the moment. We cannot afford for so many jobs to go abroad even in more affluent times. Please carry out a review to look at keeping a compulsary % of work onshore in the U.K. or we will have most of the country claiming benefits before long. Our residents are highly trained an knowledgeable in their work - we should use this to our advantage rather than selling them down the road.",
