            "background": "I believe that by banning sales of alcohol in any retail shop accessible by persons under the age of 18 years. \nThis will help in the fight against both under age drinking and binge drinking.\nIt will also take away any unfair advantage from larger stores offering hugely discounted alcohol.  This may help smaller independent and specialist shops to survive.\nI also beleive that it may even help to solve some of the problems  associated with alcohol and anti social behaviour.",
