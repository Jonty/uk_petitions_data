            "background": "Traffic is highly congested and roads are getting worse and more dangerous by the day. A high percentage of drivers are under the age of 25, there are hundreds of new, young learners every day in the U.K. Whilst the majority are probably safe and careful, some can be more irresponsible than older, more considerate drivers. After passing their test, young people often turn into 'boy racers' and drunk drivers, wasting police time and our money, as well as filling hospital A. & E.'s across the country when they have accidents. It would also encourage the use of public transport if the driving age limit was higher. (Which could be improved if used more.) Maybe if the younger generation were used to using public transport, they would be less inclined to want to drive. Last, but not least, fewer drivers would be the answer to less pollution.",
