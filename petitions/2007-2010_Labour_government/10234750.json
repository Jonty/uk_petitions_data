            "background": "I am aware that many businesses in the service industry actually steal the tips left by customers.  The tips are intended for staff, probably as a reward for good service although some people leave a tip regardless.  I do not think that any person in their right mind would want to reward the owner of a business when their intention is to reward a member of staff.  This practise is very common and is on the increase \u2013 mainly due to the advent of \u2018chip and PIN\u2019.  If you add a tip electronically when paying by card it does not go to staff - just the owner.  If you actually speak to waitresses in a restaurant or barmen in a pub, they will tell you they are warned by their bosses not to say anything to customers about this.  This is an absolute scandal and any business found employing these greedy practises should be hit where it hurts \u2013 in the pocket.  In the meantime only leave a cash tip and ensure that staff get the tip they have earned.",
