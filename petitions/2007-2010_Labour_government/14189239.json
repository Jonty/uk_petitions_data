            "background": "Home Office practice in handling applications for indefinite leave to remain and for extending current leave to remain lacks transparency and service standards are extremely poor. \nThe online appointment system and telephone booking system are understaffed or inadequate in other ways so the public cannot get response to their inquiries. The use of 0870 phone number and automated message system makes it look like a money trap. This requires an investigation too.\nA fair and transparent service should be possible as it was the case few years back. Despite lower volume of immigration, the service standards dropped significantly. Until two years ago, any such application (if there are no complications) would receive a decision within a few days. Same applications now taking over 14 weeks and in some cases years.",
