            "background": "We the undersigned, ask the government to recognise the National Dog Tattoo Register's tattooing as a legal form of identification of dogs and be allowed as an alternative to compulsory microchipping currently being considered. This is a permanent visible form of identification and does not require any special equipment for scanning. The system has been in operation for many years  now and is widely used by police forces and other security forces for their dogs.  Most council dog wardens are also aware of the scheme.  Unlike microchips, the tattoo cannot be lost within the body.  It is a recognised form of identification with the Kennel Club of UK in regisgtration of puppies, transfer of ownership etc.  It is unreasonable of the government to expect tattooed dogs to also be microchipped when the Tattoo Register scheme is already a comprehensive form of identification.",
