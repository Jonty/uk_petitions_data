            "background": "Micko the bull has been jailed by a Serbian court to a year's imprisonment, and yet the bull is innocent of any criminal charge.\n\nMicko is no ordinary bull, he is a prize winning bull. The poor bull is undergoing the pains of confinement because his owner, a farmer, was convicted of assault and was concerned what would happen to his bull whilst he was in custody. Therefore, he appealed to the judge to send his bull to prison as well.\n\nMicko the bull deserves justice. He should be freed immediately.",
