This is a great problem for Europe. \n\nWomen and children are  being oppressed and this needs to be stopped.\n\nI feel that alot needs to be changed in the united kingdom. The muslims are taking over.\n\nThis is discriminating the british people who want one law for all. Equal rights have to be heard and not swept under the carpet.",
