            "background": "In my small town of Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire there is a massive problem with not only illict drug misuse but also prescription drug misuse. This is probably a problem everywhere in the UK. G.Ps are overprescribing these highly addictive and dangerous drugs, such as diazepam(valium), temazepam etc to people who then sell them on the street. Or they are prescribed to known drug addicts. Two weeks is the maximum these drugs should be prescribed for due to their highly addictive properties. There are many sites on the internet(typically American)where all you need is a credit/debit card NOT a prescription to purchase large quantities of these drugs. Much tighter restrictions need to made on the prescribing and purchase of these drugs. Please sign this petition to raise awareness of this growing problem that is going to turn into a national epidemic. Is it not bad enough that crack and smack is ruining our kids, brothers, sisters, friends etc lives without drugs prescibed by our 'caring' G.Ps adding to it?",
