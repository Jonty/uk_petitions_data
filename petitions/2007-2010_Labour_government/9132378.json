        "background": "Charging full rates on empty properties from April 1 2008 is hugely onerous as by definition, empty properties do not attract income!  The three or six month exemption periods are too short to encourage tenants, especially in the current economic climate.  The timing of this tax could not therefore be worse.  Properties that have already been vacant for the three or six months at 1 April 2008 will immediately attract the full rate, as the tax is retrospective.",
