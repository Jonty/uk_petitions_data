            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The DWP pays the mortgage in arrears and at varying rates which then results in the mortgage companies writing to homeowners stating that they are in arrears and applying late payment charges of 40.00 a month to the accounts as well as sending out people to visit the homeowner to find out what the problem is in terms of the mortgage payments ( for which there is a seperate charge added), despite the fact that the mortgage companies know that the payments are being made by the DWP. How is it that the Government has supported them making money in this way for so long. This then leads to repossessions as well.Does this not push homeowners into social housing and cause people to live in further poverty.",
