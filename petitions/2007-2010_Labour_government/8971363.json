            "background": "whenever you go to the jobcentreplus website to search for a job it asks for what you are looking for. You tell it butcher and it comes up with things like home media sales consultant, no good if you want butcher.\nAlso you tell it you want jobs in london it gives you liverpool, glasgow and york (a little too far for my travelcard i think).\nso I ask the government if they really want people to get jobs and if they can sack the people responsible for this system as they obviously do not grab the basics. the system needs someone to program the search database so it actually searches for what you want this might actualy show people the jobs so they can apply for them, makes sense to me..",
