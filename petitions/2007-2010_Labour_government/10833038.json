            "background": "We the people believe that immigration is currently far too high, and for the benefit of our Country, should be reduced to match emigration.\nEngland, currently the most densely populated of Europe's major countries, will reach a population of over 70 million by 2050 if immigration is sustained as it is today, something that nobody wants.\nThe arguments for immigration are flawed, sure we have an ageing population, but when the immigrants grow old and retire, we'll have far more pensioners than we would have had to pay for and take care of.\nAlso the finacial benefits are meagre, equivilent to a mars bar per person, per month, is that really worth destroying the social fabric of our Country and concreting over our Countrydide for? Not to mention how difficult it will be to match enviomental commitments with such a population rise.",
