            "background": "I request that Prime minster Directs the department for social security and exchequer to reduce Dole or Jobseekers allowance by 50 Pence per week.\n\nThis would be a negligble difference but this money, some 1.5 MILLION pounds per week could immediately be used to provide extra helicopters to our troops, it would immediately provide funds to use private contractors to perform the maintenance and modifications  needed to use post Iraq helicopters in Afghanistan.\n\nWhy favour this over extra tax? tax will take 6-12 months to filter through our financial system, the funds for next weeks jobseekers payments are already in the governments hands, these boys need this money now. \n\nIf nothing else do this now and pay it back in 1 year by raising Jobseekers by 50p over today's level.",
