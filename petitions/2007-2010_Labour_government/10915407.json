            "background": "The announcement by the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith to create a database recording all mobile phone and internet activity is completely distasteful. \n\nThe citizens of the UK should be allowed to go about their business without being monitored and recorded by default. \n\nThe records the Home Secretary wants to keep are in existence and accessible when there are grounds to believe a crime has been committed. There has been no argument put forward that can justify the expense to duplicate these records and infringe on privacy of citizens.\n\nTo create a database, held by the Government, keeping records of a citizens activity is not required and is open to potential abuse.\n\nThis plan goes against our right to privacy as citizens of the UK.",
