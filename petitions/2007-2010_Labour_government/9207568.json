            "background": "It seems that the rights of people to possess animals are often considered of more importance than the rights of animals to be free from suffering and fear.  An example of this would be the recent case where approx 30 of the Amersham ponies and donkeys were returned to the Gray family despite the well publicised cruelty and neglect that these animals suffered.  The judge in this case said the family considered these animals to be pets.  There is something fundamentally wrong with the decision to return any animal to such a situation. If reason prevails, they will be banned from keeping animals for life.",
