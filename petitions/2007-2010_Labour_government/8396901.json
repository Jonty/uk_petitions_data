            "background": "my petition is to legalise cannabis,i understand the physical and mental effects it has on health,but so do many other things in life.I am aware that there are a very high amount of users in the uk frm young to old.I belive it should only be for use at home not in a public place,as for driving whilst under the influence of cannabis it should be a zero tollerance approach.I do not see a problem with the use of cannabis apart frm mental health issuies but users should not be intitled to free nhs treatment paid for by non-users.i hope to succed in this and hope many people sign the petition!many thanks.",
