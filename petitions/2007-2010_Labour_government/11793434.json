            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The Skylon design aims to take off from a specially strengthened runway, fly into low earth orbit, re-enter the atmosphere, and land back on the runway like a conventional aeroplane, whilst being fully reusable. Further, it aims to do this with a higher payload fraction than any existing multi-stage vehicle.\n\nThe initial estimated cost of a launch is conservatively estimated to be $40 million (in 1995 prices). This would be expected to drop at higher launch rates. The launch crew size is to be 200 and the turnaround time 2 days. \n\nThe Skylon is designed for low cost, to use largely present day materials and to represent a low development risk. The ultimate estimated cost of launching a Skylon vehicle was estimated to be as low as $5 to $10 million in 1995.\n\nThe aircraft was initially intended to be unmanned and to carry only standard aerocontainers, but it was intended that up to 60 passengers could be carried in a purpose built container once the vehicle was certified. It is likely that the vehicle would be economic for space tourism.",
