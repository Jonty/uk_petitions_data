            "background": "All people should be allowed to drive between the ages of 16 - 70 in the UK.\n \nThere is now free transportation on trains/buses for old people so the licence should be removed/handed in at the age of 70! This would allow the working people to use the roads - reduce traffic on the highway - lower the amount of fumes that harm children in cities. The \"Old Driver\" often goes along extra slow causing a hazard and is very unaware of the modern traffic conditions.",
