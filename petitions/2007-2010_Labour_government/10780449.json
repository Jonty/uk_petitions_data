        "background": "My friends have children under 5 and are having a nightmare getting their children following the rules for passport photos such as keeping mouth shut, able to sit up straight without the help from parents and keeping their eyes open. Plus babies can change a lot in their first 5 years than in any other 5 years in their lives. I think the govt either need to relax the rules or scrap the idea of children under 5 having their own passports and put their details on a parent's passport. My friends have relatives abroad, so need their children to have passports",
