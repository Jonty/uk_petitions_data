            "background": "Cancer patients need to keep warm due to the treatment they receive, as it is much harder than normal when on chemotherapy.  This means during the winter the heating needs to be on throughout the  whole day. This puts an unbearable financial strain on families when often they are trying to manage on benefits and carers have had to give up work to care for a loved one.  I believe that cancer patients should be entitled to a winter heating allowance, regardless of their age, inline with pensioners.",
