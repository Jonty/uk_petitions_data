            "background": "After the shocking video footage of a man convicted of travelling over 120mph on his bike with his 14 year old son on the back, is it time for legislation to protect pillion riders?\n\nPillion riders have a big impact on the handling of a motorcycle. If there was legislation to require pillion riders to undergo a course covering handling behavior and safety, giving them a license, this will help to cut down on accidents involving motorbikes.\n\nA license could:\n\nImprove handling of motorbikes with pillion passengers and improve their safety.\n\nHave an age restriction of say, 16. \n\nRequire all mortorcyclists to wear the correct protective clothing in addition to a crash helmet.",
