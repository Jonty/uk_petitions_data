        "background": "Please save Buttershaw High School Swimming Pool. This swimming pool has the potential to save life, keep people in the community fit and healthy. Plus giving five schools exercise once a week. Gerry Sutcliffe MP (Minister Of Sport) says on his website \"What else should be done to tackle obesity\" I think he's got it wrong to close and demolish Buttershaw Community Pool, especially when there is nothing dangerously wrong with it. Our aim is to keep this pool open until another one can be built, so at least Buttershaw have a pool to use. If this pool is allowed to be demolished, that will be the end for Buttershaw having there own pool!!. Which is what happened to Thornton baths seven years ago. The council promised to build a new pool to \"shut everybody up\", guess what?, they are still waiting.",
