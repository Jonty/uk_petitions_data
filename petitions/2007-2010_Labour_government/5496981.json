            "background": "My partner has recently visited an NHS dentist to have some work carried out following her recent pregnancy. This work involved a root canal filling. We were told that on the NHS the dentist could not use a 'rotary drill' and he would have to use hand files which would have a lower chance of success. The primary reason for not using the rotary drill was cited by the dentist as cost as the NHS will not cover the full cost of the treatment. \nIn addition to this, we are of the impression that there is a lot of pressure to have teeth extracted instead of repaired as this is again the cheapest option both to the dentist and the NHS.\nIt is unacceptable in the 21st century to have a two tier health system with Dickensian procedures being used in order to cut costs.\nIt is also unacceptable that after contributing to the long term prosperity of the UK by having a child, a new mother is denied the best possible treatment to a condition that is a frequent after effect of pregnancy/early motherhood.",
