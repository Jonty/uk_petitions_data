            "background": "The need for better access to funding for postgraduate courses in particular those of very low income families to enable opportunity. Times have moved forth whereby low income individuals can have access to higher education but I personnally believe that it is still extremely difficult to finance postgraduate courses especially within the subject of 'Law'...this is hindering many talented individuals from achieving their potential due to lack of finance/funding and conseuqently still discriminating those from a 'low income' background.",
