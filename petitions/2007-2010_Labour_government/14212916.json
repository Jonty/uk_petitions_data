            "background": "RAF Cottesore has 5 operational hangers, fully maintained married quarters and is used as an emergency runway for East Midlands Airport. It is also used by all military bases in the area for its dental and health care facilities. This includes a physio and rehab programme for serving personel. Wittering has limited facilities of this nature, only has 1 operational hanger, has no married quarters and a much shorter runway. The proposed move to RAF Wittering of 4 harrier squadrons in ludicrous as they do not have the facilities to hold or maintain the equipment. Closing down Cottesmore and moving to Wittering to save money will not work as millions will have to be spent enlarging and upgrading Wittering to be able to cope. Wittering has no married quarters of its own as these were sold off in years gone by. All married personel from Wittering have accomodation at Cottesmore and commute to Wittering daily. A more logical approach would be to close Wittering and merge the 2 bases. This would have limited effect on the ecconomy of the area and would cost alot less to put into action as Cottesmore is already fully equiped to take on the extra equipment.",
