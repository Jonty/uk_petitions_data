            "background": "Many benefit agents dont actually take into account what is left from earnings to pay to keep a family and a home. for example someone earns \u00a32000 in a month wow thats a lot...but out of that is \u00a31500 of business bills(not debts, just bills), so in effect the real earnings are \u00a3500 but they dont see it like that. how can someone live on that much....they cant, but are seen to be able to by benefit agents, and the council.example, i personally can not claim for anything, nothing, not even milk tokens but yet we struggle to pay the rent every month and for the last 3 years have been taken to court by the council to pay the whole outstanding amount of council tax plus the court costs, which has also gone to baliffs after the court ruling.so i would like the govt. to make all enquiries to all benefit people to be accessed on a 1 to 1 basis taking into account the personal circumstances of that families situation as an individual not as a whole.",
