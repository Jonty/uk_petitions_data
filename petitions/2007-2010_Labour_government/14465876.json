            "background": "In recent years the country has seen a rise in the number of car-jacking incidents with a number tragically resulting in the loss of life. Even the opportunist makes a conscious decision of a willingness to steal long before any theft so all these crimes have a degree of premeditation.\n\nIn terms of penalties as car-jacking (theft of a car from its owner regardless of whether the owner is in the vehicle or simple close by but attempting to prevent the theft either by direct intervention or a simple act of trying to call the police) has led to loss of life it should carry a minimum sentence recommendation consummate with murder /attempted murder. \n\nSuch sentencing should be irrespective as of any other charges brought relating to the act including those of violent acts against individual victims of the crime.\n\nA clear signal needs to be sent out to criminals that car-jacking is a crime that will not be tolerated and that offenders will be removed from society for a lengthy period of rehabilitation.",
