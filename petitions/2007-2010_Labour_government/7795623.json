            "background": "One of the most popular comedians on TV today, Harry Hill is perhaps best know for his 'TV Burp' programme.\n\nWhile most comedians only appeal to the adult audience these days, Harry is happy to ensure his shows are for family viewing, and that is a rare thing these days.\n\nWhen not astounding us with his comedy, he has also found time to pen several books, undertake charity work, and to develop his unique look!\n\nWe believe that he should be recognised for his contribution to comedy and entertainment, and for his services to broadcasting over the last 15 years.",
