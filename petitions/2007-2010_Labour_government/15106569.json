        "background": "The UK has waited too long for true high speed rail. We welcome the recently released High Speed Two rail plans, but a service start date of 2027 is already becoming a national joke. Instead of letting the WCML reach breaking point before opening the new line, the government should take a more ambitious policy, promoting growth and giving people the rail service they deserve.\n\nThe government should take whatever steps are needed (including any necessary reform of planning regulations) to build the London to Birmingham section of HS2 before the end of this decade and the remaining lines to Yorkshire and Scotland as soon as possible thereafter.",
