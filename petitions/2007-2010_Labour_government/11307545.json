        "background": "As many of you all know, the funding for transgendered support is very low. This means transsexual women and men have to wait up to three years before they are even considered for their first appointment to see a gender specialist.\n\nGender dysphoria, believe it or not, is just as serious as cancer or heart disease, as all three medical conditions can end up killing the patient if it is not sorted soon enough.\n\nWe want the government to open their eyes and see that this is a big problem and is also a danger to whomever suffers from this condition! We need more funding and more support!",
