        "background": "Recent reports have suggested that the Formula One British Grand Prix, to be held at Donington Park in 2010, may not go ahead due to financial problems being suffered by the race promoter. We urge the Prime Minister to pledge his support to the Grand Prix at Donington and to do all in his power to ensure that the race takes place as planned in June 2010.\n\nWe also request that the Prime Minister dismiss attempts by the British Racing Drivers' Club to secure Government assistance for the race at Silverstone. The BRDC have shown indifference towards keeping the Grand Prix for well over ten years and deserve only condemnation for the threat their apathy now poses to British motorsport.",
