            "background": "Parliament should sell off existing  second homes for MPs and buy blocks of flats - ideally run down, unwanted blocks in a deprived London borough (such as Tower Hamlets or Hackney). This would solve the problem of living in London and would also focus MPs attention on the plight of our inner cities. As the money spent on their area raises it to acceptable levels the MP's block should then be moved to another area in need of investment (Southwark or Newham for instance) and so on, until the whole of London is a city to be proud of.",
