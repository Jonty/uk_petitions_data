            "background": "Low level crime and disorder now rarely attract Police attention. The level increases until murder is now almost an everyday occurrence. Ages of thugs and street gangs are becoming younger and over probably 2 generations they have inherited a lack of respect for anyone or anything. Disaffected and disconnected from civilised society in which they have no stake, they see nothing to lose by acts of unprovoked violence, theft, robbery, and even murder. They make no useful contribution to society yet we keep them by all manner of social benefits. At the same time we see our public services run down due to financial constraints. Our military services are stretched to breaking point which is grossly unfair to them and if the trend continues they will eventually cease ro be effective. It is time to reintroduce some form of National Service which would have several positive effects. It would remove from the streets the growing menace of lawlessness. It would harness a significant force for neglected public and military service. It would teach discipline and self respect - from which comes respect for others.",
