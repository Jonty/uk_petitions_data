        "background": "Andover Birth centre is a 24 hour five-bedded NHS, Midwife led maternity centre staffed by an experienced & enthusiastic team of Midwives and Maternity Health Care Assistant which has been there for over 30 years.\nThe Health aurthority are trying to close the Birth Centre due to 'staff-shortages', to begin with temporarily but most people believe it will not be re-opened.\nAndover already has a high birth rate and the council are continuing to build thousands more houses in the area leaving all mums-to-be with a journey to winchester hospital for the birth of their baby - turning the experience into a very stressful event with a forced hospital birth rather than the birth of their choice in  a relaxing  comfortable envirnoment staffed by wonderful and caring staff.\nABC dont just deliver 200-300 babies at the birth centre,but also saw nearly 4000 women there last year. \nMany women have highlighted lots of worries if the birth centre closes - having a midwife awake and available 24 hours a day for quick labours? Women have been promised a service now it will be removed with no notice at all!\nAndover Birth Centre needs our help to show how important it really is to Hampshire.",
