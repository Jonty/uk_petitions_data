        "background": "The staff in the NHS are being badly affected as the NHS is restructured. The Trusts are saying this change is necessary to improve patient services but the reality is that it is a system to save money, the biggest overhead being staff and their costs. Consultations are being held but staff are not always being given the full facts and are having to make decisions without full information on NHS and non NHS organisations that may employ them, which will have a knock on effect on their pay, terms and conditions of sevice and pensions. NHS Staff have already been bruised by Agenda for Change (AfC) and now they are being punished for any pay benefits they have gained through this process as AfC has cost too much. The re-structuring taking place across the NHS is really about how fewer services can be delivered for the least amount of money whilst cutting staff numbers in the process or down grading them to save money. This should be stopped and the methods employed in the NHS for the process of restructuring challenged.",
