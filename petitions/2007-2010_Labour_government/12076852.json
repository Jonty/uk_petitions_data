            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The aim is to ensure freeholders/leasehold landlords be members of an accredited scheme and show verifiable accounts going back at least five years. To ensure no-one with criminal convictions can buy leasehold properties. To have a minimum period of 10 years as a reputable freeholder/landlord before managing larger properties (of two or more lease units or a to-be determined value ratio - whichever is greater.)\n\nThis will ensure genuine and reputable people wanting to become freeholders/landlords of leasehold properties and shall prevent inexperienced, unqualified, unscrupulous people purchasing the freehold of leasehold properties, so preventing the massive abuses prevalent in leasehold.\n\nThere shall be no claw-back on ground rents or service charges, for a purpose of supporting an accredited scheme or any training and gaining qualifications.\n\nWe hope this will be adopted by government in order to begin to seriously address the problems faced by the country?s three million leaseholders.",
