            "background": "As many segments of the UK teenage population seem to believe school is both optional and undesirable, I advocate, in cases where truancy is both persistent and frequent, sending the child to a boarding school instead. In this way they would have no choice about whether or not to attend their lessons, and we may even end up with a future population we can be proud of, rather than disgusted with as seems to be the case currently.",
