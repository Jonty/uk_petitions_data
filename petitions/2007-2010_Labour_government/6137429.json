        "background": "Since 1997 tax has risen astronomically.\n\nThe best measure of how much we are taxed, is to see how much the country makes, and how much of that is taken away by the government through taxtation. This is what that looks like:\n\nYear vs. Tax as % of GDP -\n\n1999: 37.1%\n2001: 39%\n2005: 41.9%\n\nNote: GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product. It's usually assumed to be the best way of stating how much a country makes in a year (like your wage, but nationally). The government has taken a greater and great sum of that over the past 8 years. \n\nIt's not their money. It's ours. Tell them to give it back! We worked hard for it, and WE would be better spending it than them!",
