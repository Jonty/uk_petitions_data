This is what that looks like:\n\nYear vs. Tax as % of GDP -\n\n1999: 37.1%\n2001: 39%\n2005: 41.9%\n\nNote: GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product. It's usually assumed to be the best way of stating how much a country makes in a year (like your wage, but nationally). The government has taken a greater and great sum of that over the past 8 years. \n\nIt's not their money. It's ours. Tell them to give it back! We worked hard for it, and WE would be better spending it than them!",
