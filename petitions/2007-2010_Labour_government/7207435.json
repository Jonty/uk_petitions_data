Rather than upgrading one stadium to host the Commonwealth Games, the successful 2014 bid intends to spend public money upgrading two stadia: Celtic Park (to host the opening ceremony) and Hampden Stadium (to host the main athletics events and also the closing ceremony). This petition calls on the Prime Minister to intervene and prevent this profligacy from occurring by insisting that the opening and closing ceremonies be held at the athletics venue, Hampden Stadium.",
