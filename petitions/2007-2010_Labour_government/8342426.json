Yet they are happy to fine employers \u00a310,000 if they get it wrong.\n\nAs government seem unable to control who comes into this country and fails to remove those who shouldn't be here, they should take responsibility for working status.\n\nIt is very simple to do - all that needs done is for government to check employment status BEFORE issuing an NI number, give it an expiry date, and provide a simple on-line system for providing the expiry date on entering a name and NI number.",
