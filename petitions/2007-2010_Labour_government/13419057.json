            "background": "In the UK, like all countries we constantly need more electricity to power all our homes and devices. To help generate electricity I believe we can use a resource that we already have in abundance. This abundance is prisoners, as we have many overfilled prisons. These prisoners could be put to work winding a handle (like they had to years ago) to fill a reasonable quota of electricity. The electric generated could then either be connected to the national grid, or connected to a local network.",
