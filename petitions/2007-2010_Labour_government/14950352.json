Here are the facts which support Crouch's right to be selected:\n\n1. Crouch\u2019s England goal record is 20 in 37 internationals. He\u2019s been on the winning side on 24 occasions.\n\n2. Of his 37 caps, only 17 have been starts, two of which came in the opening games of the 2006 World Cup finals in Germany.\n\n3. England have won 12 of the previous 13 matches in which Crouch has scored. \n\n4. He has now scored six goals in his past five England appearances.",
