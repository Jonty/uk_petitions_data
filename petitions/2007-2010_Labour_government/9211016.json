An MP called for Commons Speaker Michael Martin to quit over the Parliamentary expenses row - the first to make such public criticism.\n\nThe petitioner is calling on the P.M. to explain the purpose of this kind of public humiliation, name and shame of government figures - who benefits from the destruction of personality, the ruination of professional careers and defamation of character ? Can I perhaps suggest that one of reasons that you all appear to look so perplexed on the front bench about why your policies aren't working is that you change your staff constantly between health and defence !?",
