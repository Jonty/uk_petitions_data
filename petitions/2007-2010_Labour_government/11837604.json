        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In 2008 the Local Housing  Allowance (LHA) system was introduced to replace the Housing Benefit system (HB) of claiming financial support towards the rent paid to private sector landlords. Against all sense of logic this legislation introduced a system that stops Landlord Direct payments and this section of the legislation is having a devastating effect on  private sector Landlords. Landlords are loosing vast sums of rent from tenants who  spend the rent before it reaches the landlord,.  The benefits of the (LHA) system as a whole are debateable, but to create a system that places undue financial stress and  pressure on claimants who have no desire to be placed into this position is absolutely ludicrous. The system may stay in place, but must have Landlord direct payments reinstated into the system not only to protect Landlords from the financial abuse that they are receiving at present, but also to protect tenants who are being evicted due to rental arrears.",
