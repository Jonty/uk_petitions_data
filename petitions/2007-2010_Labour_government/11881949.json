            "background": "On hearing that my local hospital (Blackburn) has now got a voice recording of some Pakistani language in the lift, I was shocked and horrified. As well as numerous signs that are not in English. I am English, I speak English, I was born and brought up in England. I have pride in our history and how we became to be England and the UK. If I go to France I expect to speak French, if I go to Germany I expect to speak German as with any other country. If imegrants want to live and work in the UK then they learn English. They play the racist card, I am no racist but becuase I want to speak out against our language and culture being undermind by imagrants, I am classed by some as a racist. If you agree with my frustration on how this country its langauge and culture is being lost to the high influx of imagrants then please sign bellow",
