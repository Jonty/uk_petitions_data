            "background": "With airlines talking about charging for more and more services some are considering charges for use of their toilets in flight. I feel that such a charge is not acceptable on many grounds, disability, illness, etc. If you need to use a toilet whilst airborne you have no alternative. The government should pass a law stating that all airlines that operate in UK airspace must allow passengers to use the toilet facilities free of charge.",
