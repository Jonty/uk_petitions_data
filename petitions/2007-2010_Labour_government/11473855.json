            "background": "Single supplements should be scrapped. They are a 'tax' on those who are single, widowed, on business trips or those simply want a few days away on their own. Many single people want to go on holiday, but with the single supplement, can make the cost of the holiday very expensive. On a few occassions, I have found that it's cheaper for a couple to stay in a hotel for a fortnight away than a single person! Plus what makes things even worse, single people pay a single supplement and for the majority of the time, their room is a single room, which is pokey and always next to a stairwell or lift shaft - making it noisy!\n\nSingle people need their holidays as well!",
