One is on my road and hoards of kids are dropped off, by what I can only describe as parents who are unaware/don't consider of health and safety concerns. There are no fire exits (and the madrasa is upstairs), no risk assesment etc., Religious education should be run from a religious establishment, not from a back street, where health and safety has not even been considered, or the needs of local residents in terms of parking and noise. Let those who need/want/are told to get religious education do it in an appropraite place. There are mosques in most towns.",
