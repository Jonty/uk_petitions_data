        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In October 2007 whilst diving the wreck of SMS Konig in Scapa Flow a good friend & fellow diver Martin Voordouw of the Netherlands was lost inside the wreck. Despite the immediate efforts of other divers & of the RNLI & RAF who carried out an extensive surface search he was not recovered.\n\nThe police called in a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) to examine the outside of the wreck & later used a smaller ROV which had limited success in examining the inside. As I understand the situation no police divers examined the wreck. At first it was thought that Royal Navy divers would be called in but I now understand that they are no longer involved in civilian search & recovery. The police divers are highly trained & very experienced but they do not, in general, get involved in search or recovery in the sea.\n\nCan we please ask HMG to either create a professional organisation dedicated to the task of recovering divers lost underwater at sea OR, if it is felt that the numbers of incidents around the British Isles does not warrant such an organisation, to get the European Union to create such an organisation. In doing so HMG should consult with the BS-AC, PADI, SS-AC & other sports diving groups.",
