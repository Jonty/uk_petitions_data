            "background": "The Government has set targets so that local authorities have to reduce the amount of people that it accepts as homeless- instead they now apply  an easier option and find people intentionally homeless- this enables a local authority not to help a person or their family with housing. Having no accommodation can have a negative impact on health and education of children and families especially.\nThe number of households that became homeless (accepted by local authorities as owed the main homelessness duty in England) between April 2007 and June 2007 was 18 per cent lower than the same period in 2006 and the lowest quarterly value since the early 1980s. This continues a downward trend which began in 2003. Cited communities website  accessed 20.10.2007\n\nDo we really believe this- that people are less homeless now than they were in 2003 despite the fact that we are a growing and aging population or does this have something to do with the fact that local authorities accept people less because they are finding them intentionally homeless instead, therefore they are not \u2018accepted\u2019 and owed a duty?",
