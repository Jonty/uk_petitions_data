The football association are inconsistent and don't give the same punishment to the so called top teams in the English league. Luton Town fc has been given very harsh treatment. The Football association should be helping these sort of clubs not giving them massive punishments that can ultimatly end in Luton Town Fc folding. \n\nHere is a link of the story: http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_3802512,00.html",
