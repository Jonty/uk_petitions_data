        "background": "Richard Scudamore from the Premier League Association has proposed playing an additional Premership football fixture overseas by 2010, adding to the number of FA league games played each season and adding to the cost for fans wishing to see these games. The motive is to generate \"appearance money\" for about 20 Premiership clubs which will go to the owners of these clubs at the fans expense. We urge the Prime Minister to oppose this move and to regulate Premiership football, FA domestic and Cup fixtures and ensure they remain played at the stadia of the clubs involved, enabling fans in the UK to attend and support their teams.",
