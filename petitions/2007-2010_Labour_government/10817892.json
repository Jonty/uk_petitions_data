            "background": "Marcham C of E Primary School in Marcham, Oxfordshire, will be over-subscribed for the September 2009 intake. Before we even apply to our local school, parents in the Western and Southern parts of the village know they will be rejected unless something is done to enable their choice to mean something. In reality the local school is the only choice we would wish to make. We call upon the Prime Minister to advocate support for rural parents who wish their children to be educated within their community. In particular we wish Marcham School (an Ofsted rated 'Very Good' school) to be supported to expand and meet local demand so Marcham children can be educated within their thriving community.",
