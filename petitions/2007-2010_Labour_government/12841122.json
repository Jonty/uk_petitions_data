            "background": "I would like to see more accountability for overseas drivers who cause accidents in this country, in particular lorry drivers.  On the M25 alone they cause almost half of the accidents through so called sideswiping due to the 'blind spot' issue.  At the very least I would like to see an enforcement of the use of Fresnel lenses, which are designed to overcome this, before being allowed to enter this country, due to EU law these cannot at the moment be enforced.  Currently the Police are unable to pursue overseas drivers even if they admit fault as current legislation does not allow it and insurers are also not interested.",
