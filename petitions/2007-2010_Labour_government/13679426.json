            "background": "In this commercial world, companies often use cheaper methods of packaging such as plastics and cellophane to wrap food and other items. This causes dangerous chemicals such as(DEHA: diethylhexyl adipate and bisphenol A) to be close to food items. There are numerous studies showing the side effects and links to cancers with foods wrapped in plastics containing these. Also the government should look to tighten legislation as to the amount of packaging allowed on any item sold. Once a paper bag sufficed, now a vacuum packed cellophane wrapped layer doubel the size of the contents is the norm. This is both wasteful to our resources and a con to the consumer. Act now sign the petition and help stop chemicals in food, landfills filling up and yourselves being ripped off.",
