            "background": "When labour was voted into power in the last general elections Tony Blair abducated his position soon afterwards. Instead of calling another general election so the people of the United Kingdom could vote for a leader they could trust and follow, the position went to Gordon Brown. By not calling a general election Gordon Brown is showing that he is little better than a Tyrant - even if he doesnt partake in mass murder or the usual tyrannical activities - his people still suffer  while he and his Mps etc line their pockets with taxpayers money.\nWe ask Gordon Brown to call another General election and to bring democracy back to the UK!!!!!!!",
