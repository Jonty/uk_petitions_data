            "background": "The trade in Polar Bear skins is currently outlawed in the US under The Marine Mammal Act. However, the UK has no such ban and as such Polar Bear skin rugs can be bought legally over the internet from Canadian companies and sent to individuals who want one of these on the living room floor. Recent estimates of Polar Bear numbers in the wild is that there are currently 25,000 left with around 60% of them in Canada. These rugs complete with head, teeth and claws sell for between \u00a35000 - \u00a36500. These beautiful animals have become a symbolic icon of conservation yet the UK Government seem unwilling to change the law to outlaw importation. If US Congress can do it then why can't HM Government?",
