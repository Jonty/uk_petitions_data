            "background": "Cannabis is the most illegal used drug in britian. 54% of the general public use this and it is a proven fact that cannabis has less effects than drink does, no-one commits murder while high on cannabis people kill others when intoxicated with alcohol. Also think of the tax that the goverment could benefit from this, medical use for individuals with cronic back pain and arthritis etc, and the tourist rate would certainly be on the increase.\n\nI also thought there was a human right called the right to choice ? why is therefore taken away when it comes to drugs?",
