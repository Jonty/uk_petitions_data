In fact the M1 curves around them as you drive past them. For years these have been a welcome site to people driving on the M1.\n\nThe owners (Eon owners of Powergen) have gone against public opinion and decided to put profits before the wishes of the people of Yorkshire. Of course if you are a customer of the firm (as in gas and electricity) you may think wise to change to a different supplier to show your protest.",
