As all the staff take cigarette breaks, they leave me to serve breakfasts and look after all guests, yet complain when I have 5 minutes to eat my breakfast.\nYet, I am on \u00a33.30 an hour, and they are on \u00a35.52 minimum.\nI feel I work harder than they do, yet they get a lot more pay, and I find this unfair.\nI would like to see a minimum wage for under 16s to be increased, and the minimum wage for under 21s to be raised fairly near to, if not equal to that of the over 21s.",
