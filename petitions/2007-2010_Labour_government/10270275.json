            "background": "The South African government currently treats Zimbabwean refugees as economic migrants, consequently these refugees are subject to arbitrary deportation.  Granting temporary status would give the refugees sanctuary from the Zimbabwean regime and also give legal protection to the many thousands of refugees currently in South Africa who are yet to be deported.  The current system employed is inefficient and patchy in execution and inhumane in nature.",
