Upon election to office a minister of parliament should be assigned a dormitory at the said halls of residence, and upon exit from public service the minister should vacate his dormitory. \n\nThis system of allocated domitories which impose no cost on the occupants are sufficient to allow ministers to do their duties without incurring expenses should they wish to stay away from home. \n\nThis system also paves the way to eliminating expenses claimed by ministers for accomodation, furniture, carpets, lighting, kitchen taps, garden gnomes, and of course bath plugs.",
