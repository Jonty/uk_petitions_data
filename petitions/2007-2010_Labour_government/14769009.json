The stadium was in the now massive Olympic Park, close to the new Olympic Stadium.  Speedway is a family sport. Fans travel all over the UK to follow their team.  Speedway in the Olympic Stadium or in an area within the Olympic Park would allow people from the length and breadth of Britain to use a legacy of the 2012 Olympic Games.  Let\u2019s be able to use the fantastic amenities that will be available in or around the Olympic Stadium, for speedway fans to once again to be able to watch speedway and be able to say \n'Let\u2019s make it a date, Friday at eight\u2019",
