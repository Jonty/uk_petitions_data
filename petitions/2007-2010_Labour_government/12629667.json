            "background": "Increasingly I hear MP's saying that they have refused large payrises in the past for political reasons and voted to increase their allowances with the intention of using them to 'top up' their living costs instead. I don't think that it would be reasonable for MP's to now have these allowances replaced by a huge payrise, especially as their pay has actually outstripped that of Civil Servants (and other workers) - In 1984 an MP earned \u00a316,106, roughly equivalent to a Grade 8 Civil Servant. Today a Grade 8 Civil Servant earns approximately \u00a340,000 and an MP earns \u00a364,766",
