        "background": "Throughout the existence of the UEFA Champion's League the football league, in their wisdom, have scheduled football league games to be played on the same night. This then in turn affects the attendances at these league games, with many supporters deciding to stay at home and watch the Champion's League games on television. Surely with many Football League clubs suffering financial difficulties it would make sense to schedule the games when more people are likely to attend. We, therefore, ask the Prime Minister to speak to the Football League and advise them not to schedule midweek League games on the same night as Champion's League matches.",
