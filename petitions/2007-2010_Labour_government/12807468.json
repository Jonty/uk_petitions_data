            "background": "Please take the time to read below, and sign this petition if you support the need for Britain to maintain its Trident nuclear defence system, and renew the system when required in the near future. Unfortunately, the current world situation forces the need to maintain this system, to deter attack and/or nuclear proliferation by rouge states. Disarmament should be the ultimate goal, however is not wise under the current climate. We sincerely hope that these weapons will never have to be used, however, we recognise that for now at least, maintaining the system is the only safe option, no matter how unfavourable this may be. A powerful deterrent against potential sophisticated enemies, is far better than having to commit troops to war.",
