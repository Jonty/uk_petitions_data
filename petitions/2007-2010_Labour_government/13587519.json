            "background": "Animal testing is a waste of tax payers money and is nothing but mindless torture I have study'd animal testing for 10 years, we can now re create and regenerate skin cells yet we test on animals which costs more money, also do you realise that no matter what you are testing the way in which it manifest's itself in an animal is completely different to that of a human.people do not know about animal testing and what is done to the animals and how they are kept, their is awareness for everything else why not this?, it shocks me that there are pointless experiments being done, how is this happening this experiment wasn't even required by law people wouldn't stand for it if they only opened their blind eyes to what\u2019s going on.",
