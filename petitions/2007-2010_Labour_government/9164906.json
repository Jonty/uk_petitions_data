If you cant pay up front for your oil - \u00a3500.00 per delivery for 3 mths - then you get no oil, which means sitting in sub zero tempretures with no heating or hot water. We have no energy watchdog acting on our behalf. i petition for Low income families with children to get a fuel allowance OR make oil companies work the same as gas/electric companies setting up a scheme to help low income families, where they cannot refuse you oil if you cannot afford \u00a3500 up front.",
