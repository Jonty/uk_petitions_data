            "background": "Everday the drivers of the 86 bus service towards stratford are asked to drive into the St.Edwards Car park to pick up children. This used to be a good system, it prevented children from having to wait on the main road for a bus and as a result prevented accidents. Buses used to come in between 3.30 and 4.00 now it is rare for any come in at all. The break down of this service has lead children to believe Cars are better than public transport, there-by polluting the environment further.",
