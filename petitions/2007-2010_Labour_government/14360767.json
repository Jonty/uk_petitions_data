            "background": "There is a growing problem with female dogs being stolen so that they can be bred with.\n\nMany responsible owners have their dogs neutered and with a male dog it is perfectly visable to see that he has been done. Therefore the risk of that dog being stolen for breeding is reduced.\n\nHowever, it is not visable that a female dog has been neutered and we are proposing that a very small tattoo located in the inner thigh would help to protect bitches from being stolen for breeding purposes.\n\nIt is an effective way of protecting our pets and urge you to consider making this law.",
