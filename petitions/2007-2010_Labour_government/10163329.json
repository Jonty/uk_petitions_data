            "background": "The protection of the marine environment is important to many. Both environmentalsits and fishermen agree that our seas need to be better regulated and conservation should be actively encouraged. \n\nWe feel that when an area closure is imposed on fishermen, they should be compensated in line with their loss of earnings. \n\nIt is our belief that the only way for fishermen to be accepting of area closures is to ensure that their livelihoods do not suffer; compensation and fuel subsidies when areas are closed should be a must for the fishermen of our country.",
