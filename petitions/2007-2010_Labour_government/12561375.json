            "background": "Britain has developed communities of people whose grandparents, parents and children have never worked and do not ever intend to work as long as the state will pay. It would be fair to allow anyone who has built up enough work credits to receive job seekers allowance for 6 months no questions asked. However after 6 months everyone not on disability allowance needs to earn their benefits through satisfactory attendance of government approved training programmes or community work projects.  This would benefit the local community, plus provide motivation and hopefully less time to plan and commit crime and may empower people to find new work or set up their own businesses with the skills learnt. A win win situation.",
