        "background": "Mortgage providers are unwilling to give mortgages to flats and other properties with leaseholds with under 70 years left. This is really unfair and especially the potential buyers will not outlive the lease. I do understand if the lease is shorter than the mortgage repayment period then the mortgage providers naturally will refuse an application for a mortgage. But 70 years or less, is a joke!",
