            "background": "Triangle, a leading South African gay rights organisation, revealed that a 86% of black lesbians from the Western Cape said they lived in fear of sexual assault.\n\nEudy Simelane was a star of South Africa's Banyana Banyana national female football squad.  She  was a voracious equality rights campaigner and one of the first women to live openly as a lesbian in Kwa Thema.  Since her rape and murder violence against lesbian women in South Africa has continued to rise.\n\nA report by NGO ActionAid, backed by the South African Human Rights Commission, condemns the culture of impunity around these crimes, which are going unrecognised by the state and unpunished by the legal system.\n\nThese rapes have been occurring in schools, where pupils as young as 11 are educated in a culture where \"corrective rape\" is deemed normal to turn lesbians into heterosexuals.\n\nThis is appalling.  We urge the Prime Minister Gordon Brown to put pressure on the South African government to ensure these heinous crimes against equality and humanity to not continue ignoring and thereby tacitly supporting the rapes of all women and children, particularly those identified as lesbians, in South Africa.",
