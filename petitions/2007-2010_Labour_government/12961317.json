It is paid for under the guise of National Insurance Contributions! which are increased on a regular basis.!!\nThe government has already stated that the elderly should not pay for their care, so why are they forced to sell their houses?\nIF SCOTLAND CAN IMPLEMENT AND FUND FREE HEALTH CARE THEN SO SHOULD ENGLAND.
