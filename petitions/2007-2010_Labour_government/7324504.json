            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The original idea of GAMSAT was to provide an aptitude test for Graduates to take and pass so that they may study Medicine and qualify as Doctors on the fast track course of 4 years instead of 5 and so boost the numbers of qualifying Doctors available.However passing the GAMSAT test itself does not qualify you automatically for interview.You must also pass GAMSAT to a higher level which each University enforces in addition.This level varies from University to University.This in my view corrupts the Goverments original purpose of the GAMSAT test and recruitment of potential Doctors.Passing the exam itself should be sufficient to obtain an interview.In addition the Universities also apply their own and different requirements of either a 2.2 or 2.1 degree.My point is that there should be fairness and uniformity of entry/interview requirements for Graduates applying for Medicine via GAMSAT ie a 2.2 Degree and a GAMSAT score of 55 section ii,55 section i or iii and a minimum of 50 in the other section or similar fair mark.",
