        "background": "Still, even in the 21st century, fish are being given away as prizes to the general public. Even the fish's welfare does not even come into the picture, when its tossed into a bag, and taken home to someone, who probably doesn't even know what they are doing. A fishes welfare is far more important than somones happiness in winning a prize. Afterall, Its NOT 'just a fish' its a living creature, which deserves the optimum care it needs.",
