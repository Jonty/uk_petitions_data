            "background": "Since Mr. Brown has come into office, he has formed a policy to place the Union Jack flag on public buildings as an alternative to the flag of St. George. Perhaps this is reasonable in a number of cases despite the widespread view against it which I have personally experienced. However, the St. George's flag on the roof of Twickenham Rugby Stadium has also been replaced and it is considered by many as disrespectful as Twickenham is the home of ENGLISH rugby... not Scottish, Welsh or Irish rugby.",
