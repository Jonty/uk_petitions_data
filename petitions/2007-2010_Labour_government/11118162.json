            "background": "The current financial crisis has been caused by large banks lending unwisely. In good times larger banks can make supernormal profits. In bad times, because of their size, they have to bailed out by the taxpayer.\n\nWe propose that only a nationalised bank can undertake fractional reserve lending in the UK. Other financial services organisations can still operate if they back-up their loans with their own reserves or by loans from the nationalised bank. Currently, some lenders work on this basis and there is no reason that a financial services market can survive on this basis.\n\nAny profits made by the national bank on lending could be used to offset taxation.",
