A minimum of 10 years each - AND this included the term for raping a 2 year old girl!!!!  This Government AND British Justice System are a disgrace. I am totally embarrased by the decision! Social Services, Doctors, Carers - all should be ashamed of themselves, STOP blaming others and CHANGE The system! Bring in the American Justice System. If there was the tiniest shred of deterrent in this Country, it might help!",
