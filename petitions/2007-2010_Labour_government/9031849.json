            "background": "This petition is for all parents, and adults, who would like to protect children from the inappropriate content currently being shown on all British Television channels, in both programming and adverts.\n\nIt will not affect any adults viewing options but will give parents a greater amount of control over what their children view.\n\nIt will not cost any Television Licence payer any extra money and could provide viewers with more choice following the 2012 Analogue switch off.\n\nThe technology is already in place to allow this, and now that we are going digital parents should be given the option to protect their children from the adult programming, and adverts, currently being shown every day on all British digital television channels.\n\nAny parent who wishes to protect their children, or any viewer who is fed up of the amount of nudity on television, and shows like My Penis and Everyone Else\u2019s, or would like the option of no longer being forced to fund the BBC please sign this petition.\n\nThank you",
