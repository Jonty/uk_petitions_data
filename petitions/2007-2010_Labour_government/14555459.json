            "background": "Today, Gordon Brown committed to giving millions of pounds of British taxpayers' money to members of the Taliban in order to try and persuade them to give up their terrorist activities. We the undersigned find this propoal to be an absolute insult not just to the brave service personnel who have already lost their lives in Afghanistan, and their families, but it is an insult to the taxpaying British public who will once again see their hard earned money being used to fund active terrorists in Afghanistan with no guarantee that the money will be misused. This proposal is an insult to all right-minded people of the United Kingdom and we call on the Government to withhold all funding to Afghan terrorists, whether active or passive.",
