        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The BFPO system is only open to MoD serving personel. There are many UK based civilians who are contractors working abroad supporting the MoD for long lengths of time. Allowing UK based contractors who work abroad to use the BFPO system will allow them to have a lifeline back to the UK. A charge could be made for this service to each person or the contractors company and would add valuable funds to the BFPO system.\nIt is not fair to punish UK civilians working on MoD sites (who dont work directly for MoD), as it causes financial and personal implications.",
