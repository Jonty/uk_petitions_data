            "background": "The public perception of the police has been damaged by their propensity to withold information and not put forward suspects from within their ranks when they are being investigated. In recent cases, most alarmingly the Stockwell shooting, and the G20 death the police have shown a tendancy to lie and withold the truth. Even when an investigation takes place it is never truely independant and always appears to be a whitewash. They are not above the law. The police have to be seen both carrying out the law and subject to it if people are to have faith in them.",
