At the rate things are going, we'd soon have none of these anti social louts left here and into the bargain have plenty of people who are willing to pick grapes and bag potatoes. Everybody wins.\n\nJeremy Kyle might lose guests for his show but could change the format slightly and have Polish workers on to argue about pickled foods and vodka.",
