            "background": "Paper Tax Discs should be abolished. The DVLA know who is taxed and who isn't via their database. Having to display a paper disc in the window of a car is both unecessary and wasteful of paper. Fixed Penalties for not displaying a Tax disc even though Road Tax has been paid in full is ridiculous and is simply another tax. People fall foul of this when they haven't received the Tax disc in time or it has detached from the windscreen from no fault of their own. This archaic system should be changed immediately.",
