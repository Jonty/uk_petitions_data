            "background": "A colicky baby cries in excess of 3 hours a day. When you have a colicky baby you are told to wait until they outgrow the problem. Thats it. Meanwhile you are stuck trying to console the inconsolable baby. This can lead to many issues including Post Natal Depression, Family breakdowns, Stress, anxiety and in servre cases child abuse.\nWe the undersigned believe when a colicky baby is diagonosed the health visitor should visit more often and that the community post natal teams should hand out leaflets on things parent can try.\nAlthough there is no cure for colic some things do help ease the hours of crying. A leaflet outling theories (ie: gastro colic reflux, 'fourth trimester' syndrome, lactose intolerance..)and things you can try will enable the parents to do something proactive and may help prevent some of the problems above.",
