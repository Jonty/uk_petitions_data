            "background": "English football is currently suffering due to the lack of opportunity for young English players. Football should be forced to operate under the same restrictions that apply to cricket. Our top players should not be sat on the bench week after week while other national teams benefit from our competitions. This will then give the English game a chance to rejuvenate itself and allow us to win the world cup at Wembley in 2018.",
