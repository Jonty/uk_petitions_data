            "background": "The sexual entertainment industry by requiring their employees to have unprotected penetrative sex, vaginal, anal and oral, whist being filmed and the films being made available to the public contravenes the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. It is illegal under this act for an employer to require an employee to pass bodily fluids, semen, vaginal fluids or urine, from one employee to another. This illegality, and the sexual abuse that is involved in it, can be greatly reduced by the Government using the resources it currently has available.\n1) \tThe Health and Safety Executive should carry out regular investigations and inspections of this industry and bring those who break the law to court.\n2)\tThe British Board of Film Classification should stop certifying films for public distribution which depict unprotected sexual intercourse, whether the films are made in the UK or abroad. It should also withdraw its certification of all films currently in circulation.\n3)\tThe Advertising Standards Authority should scrutinise all adverts of the Sexual Entertainment Industry and ban the use of those which promote films that have required employees to have unprotected sex.",
