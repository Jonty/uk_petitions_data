            "background": "Since it is now widely acknowledged that the current government has no effective control or good governance over ministerial department functions (e.g. HMRC and data loss, declining educational standards compared to other Western European countries, high crime rates, a confused set of health policies, poor control over immigration, U-turns in pension policies, taking the country to war on false evidence and destroying a country), the government should consider putting out to competitive tender entire ministries to private organisations. \n\nThis seems to be a model espoused by this government in Health, Education and Defence, IT e.t.c and so this would be a logical step and cannot be much worse than the current state of affairs.",
