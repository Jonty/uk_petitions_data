The public inquiry inspector agreed with this assesment.\n\nThe DCLG states that the expansion affecting the environment will \"likely to be very small\". Considering the added air pollution from cars and planes, this is a complete and utter mistruth.\n\nThe DCLG also ignores the Communities (which it is meant to serve) that will be destroyed by this disasterous move.\n\nThe DCLG is really the Department Against Communities and Local Government.",
