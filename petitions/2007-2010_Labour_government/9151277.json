            "background": "In light of the evidence produced by the Healthcare Commission in its report on the 'ROLE AND MANAGEMENT OF COMMUNITY FIRST RESPONDERS'( 15 DEC 2007), it is absolutely clear that there is no national standards, monitoring or clear strategy in place to ensure that the important role that volunteer responders play,, in supporting their local ambulance service trust and their communities, is common across the UK. We petition the government to put into place a proper support structure which standarises training, the function and role and the recognition of their partnership in saving lives and reducing the NHS cost of giving care in the communies.",
