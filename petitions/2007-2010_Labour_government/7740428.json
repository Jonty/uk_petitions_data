I don't mind their company either despite Andy not being able to hold his scotch.  Actually he's not a bad bloke for a pom even if i never hear the end of it when England actually beats us at something.\n\nWe have a new little baby girl who is just dying to meet them.  She has heard all about the Dales from the UK.\n\nSo please MR Brown, with respect we ask that you would send this sorely missed couple back to us.  We would also ask that despite being just a wee bit humerous, that you post our petition as it is written here in good faith.\n\nREADERS & PROSTECTIVE VOTERS - We ask that you support our petition and send these Dales back to us (in chains like our forefathers if need be).",
