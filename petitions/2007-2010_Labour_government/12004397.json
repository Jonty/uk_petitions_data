            "background": "The Government is planning to increase the cost of duty on Alcohol. This is on the advice of cheif medical advisors to the Government to curb binge drinking at home, the bars & supermarkets. This is just another example of another tax grab as they are also discussing a new tax on fast food & chocolate. We the working class work damn hard all week if you are lucky to have a job, so if we want to indulge we should be able to without the nanny state sticking their out of touch rich noses in. \nThe effects of this will also be damaging to the pub trade as the smoking ban has killed off many pubs. New Labour should be very cautious as the general election is not far away. Come on let us enjoy ourselves like all of the MP's do courtesy of the taxpayer.\nMP's can smoke in the their bar in the house of commons, They also have free lavish banquets, they also stagger around their bar steaming drunk & They don't face the prospect of getting mugged or knifed on the way home by an illegal criminal immigrant. Can we have that life too!!!! \nSo if you think that Labour have gone too far sign up.",
