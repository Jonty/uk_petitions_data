            "background": "This is such a no-brainer; but apparently discussions have been ongoing for almost ten years!\n\nIf you arrive at the 2nd Severn River Bridge (on the M4) without cash, you'd expect to be able to pay by debit/credit card or at least have an ATM which you can take cash out of to pay the toll.\n\nI petition for the PM to propose changes to the Severn Bridges Act 1992 to allow for this payment method and future methods.(Internet payments in a similar fashion to the London Congestion charge scheme.) This is the current excuse used by toll booth operators for why they cannot accept payment.\n\nInstead of paying \u00a35.40, I now have to pay \u00a310.80, or \u00a390 if I don't pay within 7 days. Absolutely absurd!\n\nBetter still; abolish the toll as was promised when the first bridge was built!",
