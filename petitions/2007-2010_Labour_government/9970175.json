        "background": "There is no place for rudeness in a parliamentary democracy. The petitioner is calling on the P.M. to encourage MP's to keep to discussion topics as part of new debating rules measures - possibly even introducing timed interspersions (in our house, we use an egg timer !), so they actually do the job they are paid for - represent their constituents and vote on issues of local, national and international concern. Not only can spectators hardly hear, anyway, but it just makes grown up , professional people look silly. What about introducing IT voting technology (details of an NRDC report forwarded to web team) - it is poverty, disease, illiteracy and injustice that are the \"fights\" - please encourage parliamentarians to view these issues more problem - solvingly - from two sides of the political spectrum rather than make enemies of each other.",
