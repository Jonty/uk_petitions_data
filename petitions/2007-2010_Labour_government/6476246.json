We would not have to worry about stretching out\nforces to far, or become involved with\nother Countries battles. We have been\nan Empire once, be satisfied and face\nup to it, those days of Sabre-rattling\nand sending a Gun-boat up the river are\nover. Lets look after after our own now. With the best now equipment for our use only and not breaking our kit\nand Armed Forces in someone elses back\nyard. Lets be ready for anything in our\nown back yard on the grounds of cost and knowing the British are being protected.",
