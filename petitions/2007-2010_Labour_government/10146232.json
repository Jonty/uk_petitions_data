            "background": "There are numerous metal fences alongside most city roads, including roundabouts, road junctions and surrounding park areas, which are in very poor condition,usually rusty, an eye sore and not a pleasing site for local people to live with. The answer is to utilise  the large prision population to merely wire brush and paint these fences. Local councils either do not have the budget to undertake such projects, or the vision or the will. This would allow prisoners to also feel they are contributing back into society.",
