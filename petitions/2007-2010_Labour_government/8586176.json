            "background": "It has become apparent in recent years that we face a growing problem with Islamic extremism, among other forms of terrorism. \n\nWe need to change the way such people are dealt with and the punishments that can be used. \n\nPeople who willingly try to commit atrocities are traitors and need to be dealt with accordingly; there should be a clear message that terrorism will not be tolerated; that the consequences of involvement are great. \n\nWe can discourage people from participating in terrorism and supporting Jihad by using other social methods to stop disaffection and segregation, but if we fail we can exclude them from our society.\n\nThere is little point in putting terrorists and their supporters in prison, as this will not change their warped views, and when released they may continue with conduct not conducive to citizenship or residency in the UK.\n\nAnd so we call for the right to exile people who wish to destabilise our nation, and put a permanent ban on their return to the UK.",
