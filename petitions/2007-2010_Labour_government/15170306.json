The situation with Chief drug adviser David Nutt is a good example of what is wrong with the current system. Our society has created experts and those with an understanding of issues yet we allow them to be undermined and over-ruled by random people who've reached their positions through the skill of being popular. We the undersigned would like to see those experts, such as Dr Nutt, given the power to put their expert views into practice directly.",
