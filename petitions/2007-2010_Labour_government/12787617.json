        "background": "When you order goods online from overseas, it is currently impossible to pay your customs duty in advance. If your goods are stopped you are charged an unavoidable 'handling fee' by Royal Mail or Parcelforce. It would be better to be able to declare and pay for your imported goods online, in advance, and then provide a 'fee paid' code for your online seller to include in their customs declaration. This would make customs fees more transparent and maybe even make paying your customs upfront a better option than hoping your parcel won't get stopped.",
