        "background": "The recent 'Jezza for PM' was always destined to fall on fallow ground. It was unrealistic and fantastic. The creator seems to be an honourable chap with good intentions, but living in somewhat of a fantasy world. My petition will ultimately see fruition; for Jeremy is going to be a Sir before last he draws breath. He is - and is surely destined forever - to be a National Treasure. His Knighthood should be speeded to it's natural end by my petition, and I implore the British nation to see that Jeremy gets his just desserts by naming yourselves - one and all - as devotees of our beloved JC. Thank you for the time you have taken to read this, and I shall, as will Jeremy, stand or fall (though Jezza will have to kneel to receive his Knighthood), by your support or the lack thereof. My final appeal for signatorees to my petition is thus. Our great country has always strived to honour strong, innovative and inspirational role models. JC fits that bill. Let us not kid ourselves; Jezza's knighthood is going to happen. Make it sooner rather than later. For the good of the nation put your name to my SirJezza petition.",
