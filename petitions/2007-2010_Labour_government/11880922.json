            "background": "The  establishment of the United Nations after World War 2 was supposed to ensure that the horrors of the holocaust could never again be repeated. Genocide however has continued across the globe due in large part to the vetoing powers of the five permanent members of the U.N. security council made up of The United Kingdom, The United States,China,Russia and France who time and again have put their own interests ahead of saving the lives of innocent people. The terrible crimes of the past in Cambodia,Rwanda,Iraq,and the current situation in Darfur (to name but a few) will continue, and go unpunished unless the security council is reformed and the U.N. fights for the peace and justice for all nations and not just the intrests of the Five permenent members of the security council.",
