            "background": "Gary McKinnon has Aspergers. Just like us he had an itch...just like us he had to scratch it, his condition makes him do that and yet the Home Secretary supports his extradition for openly hacking the US Govt and Nasa computers. This man has a condition which creates obsessive behaviour, affects his ability to interact normally with people and requires a strict regime within which to live (See WWW.NAS.ORG.UK for more info on this condition). Extraditing him will severly harm his health. This petition is to request that the Home Secretary's actions in failing to intervent are reviewed and revoked.",
