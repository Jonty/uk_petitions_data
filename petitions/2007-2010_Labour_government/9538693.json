        "action": "address the disproportionate trend between European countries' MRSA infection rates. Superbugs don't only speak one language - so answer why Britain suffers more from this infectious disease than European partners. PM, please urge British health authorities to learn lessons from European models.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In ND, the risk of contracting MRSA is 1 - 5%, in the UK it's 45%. As a G8 country, this is a shocking inditement on how govt listens to it's professional epidemiologists and the responsiveness of health services to trends. Since presumably, MRSA supabugs don't come in different coloured political rosettes, speak different languages and behave in a different way in one hospital on either side of te Eastern block, the petitioner is calling on the P.M. to address what other European countries are doing that Britain is not ? Help nurses to help patients (which, let's face it, could be any one us) and identify best practices.",
