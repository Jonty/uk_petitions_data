            "background": "Did you know of the secret plan to record all YOUR PERSONAL telephone calls, internet sites and e-mail by Britain's intelligence services? No! That\u2019s due to the document, being classified as 'restricted'. Thanks to a leak we now know the truth. The plan is to record to a database Every single telephone call made and received by every member of the UK public, this includes private telephone coversations, emails sent and received and every web page looked at, with the aim to store the information for seven years at a vast government-run 'data warehouse', a super computer will hold the information. They are right now seeking powers to seize all records of telephone calls (landline or mobile), emails and internet connections made by every person in the UK. This is NO JOKE; The document has the backing of MI5, MI6, GCHQ, Customs & Excise and the Association of Chief Police Officers, and claims that the Home Office - which would attempt to make the recommendations law - is sympathetic to its cause, it will cost millions of pounds, and is condemned by politicians and campaigners as a sinister expansion of 'Big Brother' state powers and a fundamental attack on the public's right to privacy.",
