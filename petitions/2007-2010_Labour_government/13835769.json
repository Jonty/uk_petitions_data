        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "BT fasten their telephone cables to electricity poles in North Yorkshire and elsewhere, yet refuse to allow others to fasten cables to their poles and underground ducts.\nThis policy is restricting the development and installation of fibre cable networks in areas which BT are unable or unwilling to provide an NGA ( Next Generation Access) broadband service from 5Mb up to 1000 Mb or indeed any broadband service.\n\nThis would be a major factor in solving the Digital Divide problem for Digital Britain.\nPlease sign this petition. Thank you.",
