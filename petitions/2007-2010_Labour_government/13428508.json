            "background": "As some may already know, there is a proposed 'Broadband Tax' within the UK. It is said that the government will earn \u00a3175Million/Year from this tax, and this means a rough \u00a34 increase on your broadband bill, Ontop of VAT. \n\nThis proposal is to void the proposed tax, as this will cause immediate issues, especially in the current economic crisis. The internet is supposed to be a free and creative place, and we already pay the bill for our broadband, why should we have to pay anymore just because the government wants some money.\n\nPlease sign the petition if you also do not want the proposed Broadband Tax to be implemented.\n\nThankyou.",
