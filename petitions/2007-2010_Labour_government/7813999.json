            "background": "Car hire companies employ immoral tactics to cheat customers. Return a car with a small scratch or a chipped windscreen and they will debit your credit card for up to \u00a31,000. They will send endless emails asking for customer details even though this information is readily available on their own computer. \nFill up your tank 5mls from their depot and they will charge you \u00a350 for the fuel used to drive that 5 miles. There are no ethical car hire companies - they all rip off their customers. Even emails to their CEO (Alamo and Budget in particular) do not receive the courtesy of a reply.",
