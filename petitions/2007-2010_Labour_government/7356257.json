            "background": "When I was growing up, my fondest memories were riding on routemasters to Harrods and Oxford Circus. My brother was almost born on a Routmaster to the West End. Sadly because they have been taken away, we can no longer have these wonderful buses around. These buses were part of London history. Every tourist took pictures of routemasters. We need to bring them back. London does'nt look the same without them. I love how they look and let's be honest they smell better than the new ones too. \nPlease bring them back. It is not the same going through London and not seeing Routemasters. We should be given good reasons as to why they are gone. The only ones we have left are the 9 and 15. If you are going to make new ones then get rid of the bendy buses as they catch fire. But please don't change the red colour bring it back looking exactly the same.This may seem a nonsense petition but routemasters are thought of in a happy light when remembered. Bring back routemasters and London will blossom",
