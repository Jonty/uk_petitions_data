        "background": "My family and I, who are white, Christian (CofE) and British-born and extremely conscious of the sanctity of human life, believe that Israel is an arrogant and 'gung-ho' organisation that is currently demonstrating a woeful disregard for basic human values. The Israeli state started as a terrorist organisation in the 1940's (costing many British lives) and it is now showing its true colours, in all their neo-nazi nastiness. They must be stopped immediately, for humanitarian reasons at least, at all costs.",
