            "background": "It is clear to me that because of all the health and safety rules schools are scared of taking kids out of schools on trips because of all the rules. Plus if a group of children are taken out for a trip and one has a cut or gets a scraped knee then the parents will sue the school and I think this because I who does GCSE geography was not allowed to go to Iceland to see the amount of power that Plate Tectonics have by creating mountains but they wern't becasue the school was scared of the health and safety rules. So I say loosen the health and safety rules! So we are remembering about Plate Tectonics and mountains more because we went on that trip.",
