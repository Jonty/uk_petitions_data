        "background": "Whilst many funeral services are exempt from VAT, the supply and erection of a headstone is still subject to standard VAT. The charity my wife and I set up following the death of our son in 2005, offers financial support to people living in Huddersfield and Mirfield who have lost a child. Much of this help is with headstone costs. The cost of a headstone is further augmented by the standard VAT rate being applied.",
