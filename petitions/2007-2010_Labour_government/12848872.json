            "background": "We feel that it is the Government's duty to protect children and by allowing adults to get away with child abuse when more than one person is suspected but guilt can't be proven, is not doing enough to protect these vulnerable people.  We feel that an overhaul in the charges and sentencing  that can be used is well overdue. When there are 2 or more people present at the time the abuse occurs there should be charges available and stiffer sentencing to stop this from happening or punish appropriately.  In the case of Child A in Manchester both suspects were able to walk free from court due to this technicality and this shouldn't be allowed to occur, there is no way that one would have not known the other was inflicting this catastrophic abuse, so they are both guilty of allowing harm to occur.  We need to start thinking of the victims human rights and not the criminal's.",
