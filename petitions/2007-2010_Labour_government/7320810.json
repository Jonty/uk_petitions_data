            "background": "The Chancellor believes the disks have not fallen into the wrong hands....he would say that, wouldn't he!\nThis security lapse will represent a permanent risk to public financial security and identity integrity. Even if the disks are 'found' and returned there can be no certainty about where they have been in the meanwhile, and the risk that the data has been compromised is real. \nWe have no confidence in the suggestion that this security failure represents no risk, and we call on the government to do at least the following:\n1. To put in place and fund a programme to replace ALL bank account numbers, NI numbers, child benefit numbers, and any other alterable numbers, with new numbers. This will invalidate the value of the lost information, which will almost certainly eventually fall into the wrong hands.\n2. To indemnify all citizens from the risk that they suffer damage or loss as a result of the loss of these disks.",
