            "background": "In 2009 the Irish government outlined plans to lower the drink-driving level from 80mg to 50mg per 100ml of blood. \n\nA lower limit of 20mg for learner drivers and people who drive for work would also be introduced.\n\nTransport Minister Noel Dempsey says the plans are backed by medical evidence and will save lives. \nAnyone found to have between 50mg and 80mg of alcohol would not lose their license under the proposals, but would receive a fine and penalty points.\n\nBritain is in the minority of countries in Europe that have an 80mg limit, with other countries having much more stringent limits.\n\nThe Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) has also called for a 50mg limit in the past, arguing that drivers are two to two-and-a-half times more likely to be involved in an accident and six times more likely to be in a fatal crash with between 50mg and 80mg of alcohol when compared to none.",
