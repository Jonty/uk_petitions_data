        "action": "ask the Chancellor to raise Income Tax to 25% basic and 50% higher and cut Council Tax.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is impossible to keep a proper level of public spending and a contingency to cover for example natural disaster relief, financial crises, the Olympics, and tackling the consequences of climate change without either wrecking the economy by reckless borrowing, by cutting back on other public services, or through charges and stealth taxes. Council Tax in particular has risen to outrageous levels few pensioners or the low-paid should have to pay, by heaping more and more Government responsibility onto councils in order to get a good spin on Income Tax.\n\nIncome Tax is simple, easy and cheap to enforce, progressive and fair. All statutory obligations of local authorities (such as Police, Fire, Schools and Social Services) should be paid for out of Income Tax, and Council Tax only raised for extras voted for at local elections.\n\nBy raising Income Tax this way, many other charges can be dropped or simplified further saving on administration costs.",
