        "action": "allow gay men to return to court to have their convictions quashed for engaging in consensual gay sex by amending the Criminal Procedure Rules.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Gay men convicted of engaging in consensual adult sex with other men still face discrimination based on those old convictions despite the gross indecency law being repealed in 2003. That old law only targeted gay men: gender and sexual orientation discrimination. The law was repealed when the government lost its case in the European Court of Human Rights. Those old convictions remain in place to this day to be used to discriminate despite the law being swept away. To finally put an end to 118 years of the prohibition of gay sex and the residual issues flowing from the repeal of the gross indecency law, we ask the government to change the rules to allow these men to return to court despite the passage of time to have those convictions quashed (or allow them to apply for a pardon). And amend the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 so that these convictions never have to be disclosed under any circumstances.",
