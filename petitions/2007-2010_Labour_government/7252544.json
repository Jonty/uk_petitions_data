            "background": "In addition to talking on a mobile phone or smoking there are hundreds of other actions made by drivers everyday which result in them taking their hands off the steering wheel and/or eyes off the road, such as - Eating, drinking, tuning the radio, opening a window, talking to another passenger, controlling children and/or pets, changing gear, turning lights on or off, adjusting the mirrors, doing their make-up, checking in the mirrors, finding a CD in the glove box, adjusting the SatNav.  The only logical conclusion therefore to prevent any further driving with distractions is to ban all aspects of driving and therefore ban driving itself.",
