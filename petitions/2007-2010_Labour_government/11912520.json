            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Drivers of Emergency Vehicles have found that WigWags are one of the most effective methods of making progress through traffic. Historically two groups of emergency crews have been unable to use any form of emergency equipment on thier personal vehicles, these are Retained Firefighters and R.N.L.I. crew members. The prime reason for the exclusion is the risk of misuse and this is understandable.WigWags are little different from flashing headlights using exsisting controls they merely free the driver from the task and allows full concentration on driving safely. Crews are increasingly being delayed on route to a call especially in tourist areas and this device would greatly assist them at no cost to govenment or the public purse. We are not seeking any other changes to exclude crews from Driving Standards or the requirements of the Road Traffic Act.",
