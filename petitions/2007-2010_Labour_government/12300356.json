            "background": "we have not been supplied with bins\nbecause the council give black bags instead,this has caused alot of damage to our health.\nwe put out black bags, the rubbish is picked up, but the night before cats, mice, and rats go through bin bags, massively creating a waste disposle area with terrible odour. we have had terrible pest infestation due to this, we have complained to local council, they have done nothing practically other than give poison, but this has not resolved anything.\nall this has been down to rubbish been scattered every where by rats and mice. we have used plastic bins on our own expense but rats have eaten threw even the plastic bins.\nwe cannot afford the green pedal bin which some boroughs have given to residents, but not in birmingham. our environment has been ruened, our children cannot play safe without the thought of a rat comming near or dirty pavement.\nthe worst is this has lead to mice/rat infestation in our homes. with children it is un hygienic and terrible for health. the smell does not go away for weeks.\nwe ask the prime minister to help and provide better practicl funding for bins and disposing rubbish and the solution to get rid of mice/rat infestation.",
