            "background": "Broadband is today not a luxury, but an essential component of everyday social, leisure and business life.\n\nSlow broadband data transfer rates are common, especially in more rural areas.  Complaints about this invariably results in dismissive responses that refer the complainant either to BT, or the internet service provider (ISP), depending on where the complaint is initially sent.  \n\nThis is an entirely unacceptable situation and is hindering the ability of businesses in the UK, who depend on rapid telecommunications, to compete successfully on the national and global markets.\n\nHer Majesty's Government should investigate, without delay, means of regulating the telecomms. industry such that cases of broadband slowness are effectively addressed, not dismissed.",
