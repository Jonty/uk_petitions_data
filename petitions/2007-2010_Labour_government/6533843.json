            "background": "In the United States people who have not committed a crime and who have not been in a mental institution can carry a pistol for self defence, defence of home and defence of others. In these days of extreme violence in our inner cities, with the police budget stretched to the limit, providing minimal services, particularly in outlying and troublesome areas, the public - as in Northern Ireland - must be allowed to protect themselves. Criminals carry machine guns, assault rifles and grenades. The police turn up only after a crime has been committed or after somebody has been murdered by a criminal. Let us bring back the ability of the public to defend themselves and let us allow them to own the tools with which to defend themselves against todays well-armed and ruthless crimunals.",
