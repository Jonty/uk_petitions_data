            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Remove the council tax and replace it with a \u201cnational\u201d tax credit (NTC) initially starting at \u00a31 each per week (which can be linked/adjusted with the overall economy) where everyone pays the same including those on benefit, this will mean everyone who contributes can also claim DHSS benefit as and when needed, credit only payable if you have paid in and have residence in this country and fulfilled the initial 12 month leading in period.  Its affect would be minimal on low wage earners and will stop other people already getting DHSS benefit/credit help for nothing, and also others from coming here and using our nation\u2019s recourses on the cheap, if they leave the country and come back they start again from scratch. As there are more than 70 million people in this country and there are thousands not paying anything into the system at all for community costs it has to make sense, more importantly it will also give people a better sense of responsibility and fair play.",
