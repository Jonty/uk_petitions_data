            "background": "Mortgages.co.uk are following up their first petition with a second round of pressure on the Government, by petitioning the Prime Minister to force mortgage lenders to pass on 100% of interest rate cuts to borrowers. \n\nMaking lenders pass on cuts is the duty of politicians to their electorate. Politicians should be beholden to the consumer. The aim of this overdue legislation would be to reduce monthly costs for homeowners, lower arrears and repossessions, and avoid the impact of recession.\n\nThis bill would bring equality to the mortgage market, both during this economic crisis and into the future. Lenders would be unable to hide behind wholesale funding costs and consumers would be given vital assistance. \n\nIf the Bank of England is providing the liquidity that keeps these businesses afloat, which in turn comes from the tax payer, both the Bank and the consumer should have a say over how lenders structure their products.",
