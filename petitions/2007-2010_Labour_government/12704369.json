            "background": "Many UK citizens, currently living in Spain are unable to obtain healthcare. This is because the recipricol agreement is that healthcare will only be paid for a maximum of two years. There is \"freedom of movement\" within the EU so why is it that after paying into the NHS for many years there is not \"freedom of healthcare benefits\". At this time of economic crisis it is virtually impossible for British citizens to find work in other Member States and many are living below the poverty line.",
