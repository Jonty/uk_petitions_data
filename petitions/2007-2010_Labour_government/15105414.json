        "background": "There are legal and moral reasons to object to the trade in arms with Isreal. For example, the import and export of arms between the UK (or any EU country) is in contravention of the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, yet many countries including the UK are increasingly trading in arms with Isreal. An example of a moral objection; is it right to trade in arms with a country which is illegally occupying another in contravention to UN resolutions and fails in its humanitarian obligations to the occupied.",
