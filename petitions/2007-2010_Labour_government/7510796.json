            "background": "Have you ever been caught driving at 32mph in a 30mph zone ar 3am but still been given the same penalty as someone who has been caught travelling at 40mph in the same area at 3.15 when the schools are finishing? How can this be justice? \n\nIn other countries speeding penalties are not just judged on simply weather you were speeding or not but they also take into account the speed you were doing, the time of day, basically how much of an impact your speeding was having on the area and members of the public because really although speeding is speeding its no where near as dangerous doing 32mph past a school at 3am as it is doing 40mph past a school at 3.15pm and i think all this sbould be taken into account before deciding on a penalty. \nIn Germany they have no penalty points system, german drivers are fined an ammount that is decided on speed, time of day and area the offence was committed in, in serious cases drivers are given a driving ban for again a period of time determined by the offence. I say the UK should adopt a similar kind of structure to its driving penalty policies.",
