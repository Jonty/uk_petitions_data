This information allows consumers informed choice.\n\nWhy is it not the same in retail clothing?\n\nWe at Rapanui are campaigning for the freedom of information and ultimately complete transparency in the retail clothing sector.\n\nWe are there as a model; open, candid information on every aspect of the clothing manufacture PLC - a fresh approach to combat greenwash in a market saturated with catchphrases i.e. 'organic' 'sustainable'.\n\nIt can be done. clothing is one step to a sustainable future, culture change is the answer and substituting the \u00a32 t-shirt for an ethically produced one is one step to a sustainable future. \n\n62 million steps is a lot of movement. \n\nGet involved",
