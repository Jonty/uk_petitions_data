This is not the case for bereaved MPs spouses who can remarry without penalty. So how can successive governments conveniently hide behind the so-called military covenant to which they clearly pay less than lip service?\nI spent 28 years in the Royal Navy and whilst I love my wife very much, I do not wish her to spend her last years alone should I die first. Why should she lose the pension I have paid for to look after her in her old age? This fundamental inequality wants fixing now.",
