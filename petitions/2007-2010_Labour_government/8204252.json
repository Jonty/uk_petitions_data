            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The governmen recognises that Home Education extends beyond the age of 16; Child Benefit and Tax Credits are available for home educated youngsters over the age of 16 still in full-time education,e.g. studying for GCSEs or A Levels. Why then are these young people not entitled to the EMA?\nMany home educated young people choose not to go to college. In some cases, Colleges have such strict admissions policies that youngsters cannot go to college anyway.Therefore,these young people are responsible for their own registration (at an examination centre)AND exam fees as well as the usual resources needed to study. Multiply this by 3 or 4 subjects and these soon  add up.\n The idea of not allowing their children to do these exams is unthinkable for most families, including those on a low income.\nYoung people who are not taking GCSEs or A Levels alsohave education expenses.\nAny young person for whom Child Benefit is still being paid should therefore automatically be entitled to receive the E.M.A. If home education is recognised by one Government Department then it ought to be recognised by all.",
