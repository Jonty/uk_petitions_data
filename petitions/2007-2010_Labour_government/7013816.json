I\nhave followed his career essentially all my adult life and it would be\nhard to convey how much pleasure his music has given me. Some time ago Eric Clapton was given a CBE. I don't believe that this is adequate recognition of his contributions to his art. A knighthood is certainly more appropriate!",
