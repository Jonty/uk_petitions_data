            "background": "Fuel duty is currently around 52p/litre. This would be much like a VAT holiday, but for fuel duty. And maybe for longer, to help companies that rely on fuel to make a living (logistics, etc..) and to stop more and more companies going bust because they have no money.\nMaybe if you're feeling generous, scrap VAT on fuel for the same length of time (or permanently). It's unfair to be taxing us twice. Motorists need to buy petrol/diesel to go to work, to make money, to make companies money, to keep the country on it's feet. You are effectively punishing the country by imposing more and more fuel duty on us. Stop it. Leave us alone. Go put more tax on cigarettes and alcohol.",
