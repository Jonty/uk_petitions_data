            "background": "Many festivals are ruined or closed due to licensing conditions that severely limit noise levels reaching outside the festival's site. Kenwood House has been forced to cancel its summer concerts due to restrictions in licensing conditions after a handful of locals complained about noise pollution. Glastonbury has also been affected, with sound systems needing to be turned down after just 13 complaints from the local village. The enjoyment of hundreds of thousands should not be ruined by the complaints of a handful of people. These people should note that in these situations, noise pollution is only a problem for them over a couple of days a year. Live and let live. Let the masses have a good time!",
