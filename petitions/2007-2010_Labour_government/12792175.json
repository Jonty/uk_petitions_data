            "background": "Since bus conductors have been taken off busses, there has been a noticeable rise in the level of crime and abuse suffered by both passengers and drivers.  Re-introducing bus conductors would not only make it easier for the driver, but would deter people from making other people's journey uncomfortable.  It would also make it easier to deal with people who do disrupt the service.  In addition, bus conductors can monitor the top deck on double-decker busses, whereas the driver cannot as he must concentrate on driving the bus.  Bus conductors worked brilliantly on the busses before, and it seems frankly illogical that they have been removed.",
