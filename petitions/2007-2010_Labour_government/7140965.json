The band, the show, that sporting event that you simply MUST see is, sold out withing minutes of the tickets being made available, either on the phone, or internet. \n\nHowever, within hours, sometimes considerably less time the tickets appear for, double, triple, sometimes even more, above the original face value. Leaving genuine fans, little or no choice.\n\nThe undersigned here believe that this is nothing more than legalised \"touting\" and the auction sites should be prevented for re-selling the tickets for anything above face value.",
