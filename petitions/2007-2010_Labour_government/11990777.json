            "background": "Its time we got off the means testing band wagon and really looked at what we are doing as a society.\nMeans testing people's gross earnings as their ability to pay is a joke. Just because you may have studied for years worked hard, never claimed a penny, finally you get a good job, then what happens your outgoings increase. Hello! Means testing of gross income is completely unfair to middle income earners in what is supposed to be a just society. I'm afraid its only just to the top and the bottom ends not the middle. I agree that everyone should pay their way not just the middle income earners.",
