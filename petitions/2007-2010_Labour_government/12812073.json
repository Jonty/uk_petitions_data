            "background": "Newspaper reports suggest that the Airline BMI informed its  female crew that \u201cIt is expected that female crew members will walk behind their male counterparts in public areas such as airports no matter what rank.\u201d It was reported that BMI  also informed its female crew members that they must wear the Islamic Abaya and headscarf.  Cabin crew member Lisa Ashton was dismissed for refusing to accept these demands\n\nThe Saudi Embassy confirms that thereis no requirement for females to walk behind the men in Saudi and there is no\nrequirement for Western females to wear the abaya, only a request to dress conservatively. No other international airlines contacted that operate into Saudi were reported to impose the same\nAlleged discriminatory demands on its female staff as BMI.",
