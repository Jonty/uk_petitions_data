        "background": "What cost is a life? Why are we allowing private healthcare companies to profit from patient's suffering. Especially as private firms often charge more for the same service than the local NHS. The NHS should be free at the point of need, not charged in an internal or external market. Private firms take out profit, whilst the NHS trains the next generation to become better professionals.",
