            "background": "This petition has been set up by residents of a small, once-quiet cul-de-sac in Rochdale. Without our knowledge or consent a private company has set up a care home in a vacant property on our street, to house 10-18 year olds with severe behavioural problems. They are currently not required to apply for planning permission to set up operations. The homes in question are regulated by Ofsted, but this body do not seem to be required to take the surrounding locality/demographics of these homes into account. The fact that there a very high number of young, vulnerable children in the vicinity of this home does not seem to matter. Now we are faced with having teenagers who could have drug or alcohol problems in close proximity to where our children play out. Neighbours of similar care homes in various regions of the country have had to endure problems such as property damage, arson and suicide. This is NOT the fault of the children in care, but they need to be looked after in more suitable locations, and care in the community can only happen with the CONSENT of that community. This is a NATIONAL problem - if you have a vacant house on your street this could happen to YOU and YOUR FAMILY. Please help!",
