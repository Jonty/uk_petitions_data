            "background": "I would expect the head of an army, in representing his troops' interests, to voice concern about poor morale among troops and the strain placed on resources by operations in Iraq and Afghanistan - because that is precisely what war does - and why they are fighting for peace. Like many people, I am appalled at Sir Richard Danatt's reports of the need for improvements in accommodation, pay and medical services.\nIn the spirit of good governance, reports like this need not be leaked - in order for an organisation as substantital as the British army to  address disillusionment with conditions for soldiers. But I would find it more helpful, if the military leaders could suggest perhaps what the general public can do practically to help. Therefore, the petitioner is calling on the P.M. to perhaps commission a professional writer to design a leaflet to give some kind of \"Home Front\" support for our boys. Move away from the military media politicising to real life solutions - As well as ask not (only) what they can do for our country ... but what can the country can do for them !",
