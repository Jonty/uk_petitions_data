It started out by banning sausage rolls, then chips, then burgers and now it has got to the ridiculas point of banning tomato sauce, Whats going to be next? Most children now have to eat the same food every lunch time, and are not allowed to have sauce with whatever they are eating. Let us eat what we want, its our lives, not the governments and definatly not Jamie Olivers!!!",
