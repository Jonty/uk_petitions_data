            "background": "I am totally opposed to the idea of warning motorists of the location of ANY speed cameras; if this information is provided it is obvious (to me anyway) that drivers will reduce their speed as they approach the cameras, and until they are past, and will then speed up again.  If motorists were responsible enough to drive at safe speeds throughout their journeys these cameras would not be needed; since, however, many consider the speed of their journey, or - even more selfishly - the thrill of speed, to be more important than the safety of other road users (especially pedestrians) their existence, and lack of information on their whereabouts, is vital.",
