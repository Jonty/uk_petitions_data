        "background": "Canterbury City Council want to restrict people to keeping their dogs on leads, or at the worst ban them completely along the beach and promenade. Locations, such as the coast from Whitstable to Herne Bay are excellent locations walk dogs, and banning dogs from the beach, or keeping them on leads will result in dog walkers having almost no-where for them to let their dogs roam freely",
