        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The rationale for parent+child spaces is that doors must be opened wide to safely get children into and out of cars.\nThis can be done without being close to the shop entrance, and the extra exercise in walking across might help fight obesity.\nThe added advantage is that other drivers won't want to use these spaces and parents will stop whining about the spaces being misused.",
