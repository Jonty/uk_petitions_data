DEFRA decided not to award medals posthumously which I feel is an unsult to the families of these wonderful ladies.HIlary Benn was quoted in the Times on line saying \"The women worked tirelessly for the benefit of the nation and deserved to be recognised\" Whether these ladies are still alive or not, they still deserve recognition. Surely families should be given to option to apply for these medals should they wish to.As is the case regarding the Bevan Boys.",
