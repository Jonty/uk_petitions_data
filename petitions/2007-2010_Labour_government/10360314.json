The current transformation of research universities into industry style R&D centres is disappointing; by applying pressure on scientists to demonstrate commercial applications, the joy of discovery for its own sake is lost.\n\nWe petition the prime minister to consider minimising government interference in academia, so that Britain can remain at the forefront of 'revolutionary' discoveries instead of dull 'evolutionary' science.",
