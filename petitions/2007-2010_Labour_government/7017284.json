        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Sir, we feel that the proposal to allow motorway traffic to use the hard shoulder during congestion is extremely dangerous and should not be considered. By allowing this to happen, confusion will occur and accident rates will increase. This will also hinder access by the emergency services and increasing the time to attend incidents, thus increasing the time any casualties will have to endure before professional help arrives. We propose that this system has the potential to increase the already growing fatality rate on Britain\u2019s roads.",
