        "background": "We are too accomodating to those that were born in other countries. The most important thing is to ensure that we protect those that were born in this country before we start to contemplate looking after others (most of which have deluded themselves that it would be good to come here). We need to be tough on imigration into the UK. We should only allow those who can contribute to the wealth of the country. There are other places to go which are en route to the UK for asylum seekers. We should stop spending abroad and concentrate on investing in the UK. We need to compulsory purchase back the utility companies which have been sold to the French and Spanish etc. We need to invest, protect and nurture our own citizens.",
