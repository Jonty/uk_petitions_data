            "background": "With the current length of time a terrorist suspect can be held without charge (28 days) already being the longest in the free world, we the undersigned believe it is crucial the government abandon any  plans to extend it further. \n\nWhile there is no evidence for an extension to be necessary, there is plenty of evidence that extensions will further alienate British Muslims, many of whom feel the measures are aimed solely at them, from society and may indeed make society more dangerous, rather than more safe.\n\nIn the case of the time limit being in danger of running out (something yet to happen in 12 major counter-terrorism operations according to Sir Ian Blair), a judicial process, as suggested by Lib Dem peer Lord Carlile, allowing the police to appeal for an extension would be a far more favourable alternative, giving the system more independence and transparency.\n\nSincerly,\n\nThe Undersigned",
