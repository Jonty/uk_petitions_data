            "background": "For three or so years now my wife and I have both recieved the Tax Credit Renewal Pack which contains a hefty 35 page booklet which is destined for the bin. We earn far in excess of the maximum salary that would return us any tax credits and therefore I would like the Tax departments to talk to each other and identify families who do not qualify for tax credits and save the country millions in wasted paper, postage and ultimatley tax payers monies. There must be simplier methods which may place more emphasis on the individuals to follow up their tax credit awards following a statement of the Annual Review. Other areas of government make it a chore to follow procedures so why does HM Revenue & Customs have to be different and unusally make it easy butvery wasteful of resources considering the carbon footprints we are trying to irradicate?\n\nI'm a project manager in IT and believe it is possible to incorporate some artificial intelligence / business rules to prevent this waste of resources. I'm sure if someone is entitled to receive tax credits they will know the system without constant annual reviews.",
