            "background": "At weekends, and to a lesser extent during the week, Richmond Park in Surrey is plagued by aggressive cyclists obviously taking part in races or time trials. This results in many confrontations with innocent motorists who pay, by way of road fund licence, insurance tax and petrol duty, to use the park, whether it be to drive through the park or to drive to car parks to use the park as it is meant to be used. These cyclists appear to be of the impression that they have sole right to use the road never slowing down for pedestrians and forgetting that pedestrians always have right of way on any public road resulting in many confrontations with pedestrians young and old. These lycra clad, geurilla cyclists should be removed forthwith returning the park to the average person, including law abiding leisure cyclists.",
