            "background": "The Civil Service Sports Club Plymouth has had a rugby & 2 Soccer pitches plus a  cricket pitch and Bowling Greens for decades (started 1936).  These pitches were used to capacity right up to the moment of enforced closure by the Civil Service Sports Council in London two years ago. Bowling greens were used morning noon and night in season, soccer rugby and cricket was played to capacity consistent with the care of the pitches by Pete.\n Now Plymouth City Council (PCC) wants to emasculate the Club by building on the rugby pitch and all the bowling greens. They argue disingenuously that membership and demand had declined in the club. That may have been true in the club as a whole, if drink drive laws inhibited bar takes, but demand for bowling, bowls, rugby, cricket, soccer far outstripped demand. \nLet sports fields  stay as sports fields. Let any Councillor by name tell us that there is such a plethora of sports pitches available in Plymouth that they can build on them willy nilly.",
