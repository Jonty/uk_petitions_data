            "background": "It is not uncommon to see chip and baker vans outside schools at break and lunch times, as well as fast food and other retailers within an easy 1 minute walk from school.\n\nAll food outlets should be banned within a one mile radius of schools. If this is not seen as practical, then they should be restricted from selling to school children within school hours (this includes a hour before and after school)\n\nThis would force children to either eat school meals and snacks; or bring in their own, hopefully healthy food.",
