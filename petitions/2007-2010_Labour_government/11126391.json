            "background": "The price of fuel has recently decreased, providing much relief to drivers and other fuel users alike. However, the price differential percentage between petrol and diesel has increased. I am asking that the reason for this price difference is reviewed and the oil companies are approached as to whether this is necessary. \n\nThe fact that limited supply given the increase in demand may be true, but equally the increase in diesel usage may well be offset by the increase in diesel efficiency, for example.\n\nI believe that the haulage companies and other diesel users would at least like reassurance from the government that the price difference has been noted.",
