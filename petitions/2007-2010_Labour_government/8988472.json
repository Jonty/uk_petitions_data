I have spent over \u00a38k in 4 years to see my children on a regular basis, the courts keep giving me toothless access orders that my ex ignores at will as she has no personal price to pay unless I go back to court at my own expense. As the CSA take a large lump of my wage + the loans taken out to pay to go to court for the access order she is ignoring she knows I can\u2019t afford to take her back to court. What I would like to see is a clause where 'the CSA will return monies taken from the non residential parent for the period where the residential parent is refusing to honour access orders granted by the courts. Save for where the resident parent fears for their safety or that of the children. In such events the monies would be \"held over\" until the resident parent has shown grounds for this fear to a court. Subject to the court\u2019s decision the monies would be paid to the rightful recipient'.",
