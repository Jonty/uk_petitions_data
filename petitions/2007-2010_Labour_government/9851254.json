            "background": "The fat and lazy have had it too easy for the past few decades; let's be honest, we've been living in absolute decadence, relying on our cars to drive us 1 mile down the road to get to work, and drop the kids half a mile down the other way.\n\nI understand, those living in the country or who have disabilities will require careful dispostion, indeed I'd propose decreasing THEIR Fuel Duty substantially.\n\nMy issue is with the army of rotting couch potatoes who use there car for everything and anything, at the expense of our health.  Taxing the bejesus out of those who don't NEED cars would be a good start.\n\nPlease note, I am in no way a sandal wearing Guardianista, nor a flag waving socialist, just a p*ssed-off commuter.\n\nI trust a large number of you agree with me.",
