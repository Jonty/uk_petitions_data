        "background": "There are too many troops injured both physically and mentally whilst serving their country.\nThey are given the basic healthcare we all get, and while the NHS does its best, it is not acceptable that these servicemen and women are not getting the proper care associated with combat injuries.\nThey should be entitled to private health care funded by the government, which would enable them to get the correct treatment needed, in the quickest time and in a clean environment.\nThis healthcare should also extend to any treatment needed once they are fit enough to leave hospital, i.e. physio or any other outpatient care needed.\nThey should also be given access to properly trained counsellors, able to deal with the mental, or emotional problems that may arise during or after tours of duty.\nThese people put their lives on the line to keep us safe, the very least they deserve is to know if the worst happens, they can come home to the highest level of care they can have.",
