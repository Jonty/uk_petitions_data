Mark Everall. \nListed 132 failures against this dept., 2 children were murdered, another died of a heroin overdose whilst in the care of these people yet NO ONE was held accountable or reprimanded for these terrible failings. \nIn the past year alone 144 compliants have been made against this dept. yet still nothing gets rectified or gets changed This needs to be brought to the attention of the prime minister and every one and anyone who may be in a position to do something to help as some of the  people employed by this department believe that they are above the law . Most of these persons are not registered on the G.C.S.S. as this is not a requirement here on the Isle Of Man . I believe as do many others that this dept has and continues to fail the people in the Isle Of Man.",
