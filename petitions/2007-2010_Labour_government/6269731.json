            "background": "Tim Henman has spent most of his life trying to be the best at the sport he loves.  He began his professional tennis career in 1993.  Since then he has reached grand slam semi finals on no less than 6 occassions.  Having won 11 tour titles, including a Masters Series event, the success he has bought back to British tennis is unparamount, reaching a rank high of no.4 in the world.  In the 1996 Summer Olympics Tim Henman won a silver medal for his country, playing in doubles with Neil Broad.\nFor the most part of his career he has also represented Great Britain in the Davis Cup, and fittingly, this is where he will end his career, in a Davis Cup tie against croatia at Wimbledon on the 23rd September.\nTim Henman has given his life to the sport he loves and to his country, it is now time he is rewarded for his efforts.  \nThanks Tim",
