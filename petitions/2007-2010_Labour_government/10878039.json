            "background": "We all know bankers have been paid huge bonuses over the last few years.  Now the whole banking system has collapsed and the UK is going into a recession, people are loosing their jobs, house prices are falling fast and no-one can get a mortgage.  Rather than the banking industry paying for its own mistakes the taxpayer is bailing them out to the tune of \u00a32000 per tax payer, most people who mess up to that extent at work would loose their jobs and not be paid a huge bonus and golden handshake.  Now is the time for the bankers who were paid huge bonuses to shoulder their share of the problems they have created and pay a retrospective windfall tax.",
