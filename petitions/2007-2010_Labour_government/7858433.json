Because there is absolutely no reason whatsoever for any law abiding person to have in their possession an open bladed knife, or gun on the pretence of 'self defence'. These offensive, and deadly weapons can be,and will be if the occassion arises, used 'intentionaly' to harm, and possibly kill, whether they used for self defence or offence. Craft and Stanley knives could also be included if carried in the wrong environment.",
