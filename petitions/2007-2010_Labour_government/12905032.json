            "background": "In these days where we are expecting people to become greener and more conscious about the use of our planet's resources. It seems appalling that to buy a electronic download of a particular book is more expensive than purchasing the equivalent paperback. This is because currently, electronic books are not zero rated as ordinary books are. I request that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor bring this matter to the attention of HMRC since it penalises people who do not want to chop down trees to read their favourite authors.",
