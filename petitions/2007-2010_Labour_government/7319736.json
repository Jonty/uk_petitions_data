        "background": "The current income threshold for WTC to a single person seems to be around \u00a311700pa.  Increase this limit substantially so that single, low earning people, who will pay more tax when the 10% tax band is scrapped, will not be worse off.  Such people are effectively subsidising those with much higher incomes.",
