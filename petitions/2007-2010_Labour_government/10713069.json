            "background": "On 08/08/2008 the US/Israeli backed Georgian government forces attacked the Russian enclave of South Ossetia. According to the AP and Reuters on 09/08/2008, an estimated 1,500 people died in the onslaught and 30,000 more fled across the Russian border. Large swathes of the city were reduced to rubble. Georgia cut off the water supply to the city.\n\nThe Foreign secretary has damaged relations with Russia and embarrassed the citizens of United Kingdon with his hostility and rhetoric following Russia's unavoidable action to protect its own citizens.\n\nThere are numerous examples of the UK invading sovereign territory to protect its own citizens, humanitarian interests or 'strategic' interests. Therefore to complain about Russia doing the same is hypocrisy.\n\nAs with the Kosovan independence of Serbia, the majority of South Ossetians and Abkhazians no longer want to be associated with Georgia and should now be recognised as independent states. I would ask that the UK government provide its full support to this proposition.",
