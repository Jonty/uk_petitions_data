        "background": "To cut down on the rising Anti Social Behaviour problems, I feel strongly that we should make it illegal for under 21's to congregate and drink on the streets with more than a caution or removing the drink being the punishment. We should have Zero Tolerance with parents being held responsible.  With a fine for first offence which is not mean tested if the family is on benefits and maybe parental curfews to ensure the anti social behaviour child is supervised and not left home alone.",
