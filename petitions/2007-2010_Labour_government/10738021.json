        "background": "The Government's failure to make available cash rebates to UK households struggling with soaring energy bills, in favour of implementing energy-saving measures should be affirmed with full access for all households to the WarmFront and similar insulation and central heating grants which have been distributed freely to those claiming a range of benefits, including Job Seeker's Allowance and those over the age of 60, i.e. those most likely to be contributing the most to energy usage whilst contributing the least to Government tax revenue, as well as those with children under 16 and claiming tax credits.",
