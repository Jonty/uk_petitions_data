        "background": "Dee Caffari has just sailed into the record books yet again. She has twice sailed non stop around the world single handed. The first time was a few months after finishing the Global Challenge yacht race as a skipper with a crew of 18, and then modifying the same yacht for a single handed circumnavigation against the prevailing winds and tides, Westbound. Now having completed the Vendee Globe (Eastbound) race in less than 100 days (that in itself is a remarkable achievement, only 15 sailors have achieved this). Not only has Dee Caffari become a double circumnavigator, but she is the only woman to have achieved this and one of only four people to have gone both ways around the world solo non-stop. She is one of the UK's leading yachtswomen and an example to all. As an island nation and a nation that should be proud of its sailing heritage I believe she more then merits an honour befitting this achievement and would like to see her being made a Dame by Her Majesty the Queen in this years Birthday Honours.",
