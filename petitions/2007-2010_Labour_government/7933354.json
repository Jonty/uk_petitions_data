        "background": "The cost of heating a home and running a motor car continues to soar and the average family can not continue to pay the excessive prices the oil/ Utilites companies charge at the point of sale.  \n  There seems to be a cartel in place so that these companies can continue to pass on any rise in the cost of the raw matrials to the consumer.\n  Surely this is only to protect their own profits.\n\nThe rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.\n  The Poorest will never be able to get off state hand outs/benifits when the basic cost of living continues to rise year on year.  \nWe pay the higest rates for petrol/gas/water/electric than the rest of europe for what reason?",
