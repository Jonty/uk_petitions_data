        "background": "While it is understood that Mrs Thatcher was the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, nevertheless the people hold that despite the massive significance of her being the first female PM, she should not receive a State Funeral. We hold that State Funerals are for those figures who attract admiration from all quarters of the population - figures such as Winston Churchill. Margaret Thatcher is not such a figure - we hold that over half of the British population would be against her receiving a state funeral. We beg the Prime Minister to recognise that the People, his political masters, would be against a state funeral.",
