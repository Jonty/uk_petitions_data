            "background": "As it stands, councils are allowed to allocate places to schools that are just under 3 miles (even if there are 4 schools closer) without providing free bus passes or considering if there is sufficient public transport. \n\nThis places parents with little alternative but to drive their children to school. It is unreasonable, in this day and age, to expect a child to spend 50 minutes to walk to school. That is not \"walking distance\". \n\nIf we are to reduce the amount of cars on the road, we must look into ensuring there is safe, frequent public transportation to schools.\n\nI feel by not providing this service, we are turning our children into stressed out commuters.",
