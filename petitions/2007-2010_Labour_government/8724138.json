            "background": "Citizenship is now taught in schools, so hopefully in the longer term there will be more willingness/time availability for more people to do work in the community, making more social, sporting, and self-development opportunities available for everyone while working to reduce fear and loneliness in our communities. However in the meantime the government could encourage: more employers to support their staff in community and self-development endeavours; those in positions of community leadership to raise standards to encourage more good citizens to join their ranks and hence be able to offer more to their community; and to make opportunities more affordable to those in financial need. The end result would be a happier, healthier, less stressed nation, with fewer lonely people, that could well achieve far more.",
