            "background": "Damilola Ajagbonna, 19, is what many would call a model citizen. Since arriving in Britain eight years ago he has worked through playground ridicule to pass 13 GCSE's (2 A* Grades), be appointed adviser to Unicef on youth issues (at the age of 17), been a volunteer researcher at the think tank Demos, played a prominent role in the Childrens Rights Alliance, and passed A-levels in English, drama and Biology, before being offered a place at a Cambridge university. The trouble is according to the government, he is not a 'citizen,' as he was six weeks late claiming British citizenship under immigration rules for children. it must be remembered he was 11 at this point. please stand up and fight for Damilola.",
