            "background": "The device is indiscriminate and affects young people whether or not they are involved in criminal activity. It demonises all youths and causes further divisions within society. The devices are often placed in areas young people need to visit or wait at such as stations, shops and bus stops which results in pain for those congregating legitamately. This is extreme discrimination against a large group of people on grounds of age and would never have been considered if it had affected ethnic minorities. It should thus be banned immediately.",
