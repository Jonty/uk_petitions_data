I myself do not have a criminal record however two members of my immediate family do. On the first occasion I applied to my local police force's cadet scheme and was rejected, most recently I applied to their Special Constabulary and passed all my exams and interview and yet when it came to the security check stage I was yet again rejected. I am sure I am not the only person this is happening to. Let's stop holding people accountable for others actions.",
