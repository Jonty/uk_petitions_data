I am home schooled and it is extremely difficult to do when there is no support (financial or otherwise) from the government, I have decided to pursue a career in performing arts however I cannot do any of the Arts GCSE's unless I go into college with other much older students and I don\u2019t wish to do this! It would be good to have some support as it was the horrendous bullying in a state school that was the reason I left.",
