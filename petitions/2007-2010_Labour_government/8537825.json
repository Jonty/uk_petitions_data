            "background": "Crow Edge already has full visibility of a 13 turbine windfarm to the east and last year Barnsley Council passed an application for another wind farm to the west of crow edge. This has led to more applications, Blackstone edge being one of them.  This is an area of beautiful pennine scenery and we feel that it is being spoilt.  We are a small community and although we managed to get over 500 letters against the last application Barnsley council ignored them and gave planning consent.\nPlease help give a small community a big voice!",
