        "background": "Royal Mail are looking at closing Bilston Delivery Office and moving the staff to Tipton. This would mean that staff would have to travel at least 5 miles 2 to 3 times extra a day to attend work and return to the office and return any undelivered mail back to Tipton. Customers could be asked to travel to Tipton to collect any items of mail that can't be delivered if they are out. Bearing in mind that the Tipton Office is not on a bus route from Bilston this would be a poorly thought out proposal and would completely inconvenience both staff and customers.\nThis petition urges Royal Mail to re-think their plans and leave Bilston Delivery Office in it's rightful home Bilston. \"God's Country\"",
