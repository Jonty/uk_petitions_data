            "background": "The BBC has been far too slow to apologise for, and even slower to take decisive action in response to, the despicable conduct of Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross in making offensive phone calls to an elderly man.  The BBC\u2019s current position is ridiculous: they say that they are \u201cconducting an investigation\u201d into something that would take any reasonable manager no more than half an hour to get to the bottom of.\n\nThis embarrassing episode could have been brought to an end a long time ago if the Director-General, Mark Thompson, had taken swift action to suspend Brand and Ross and the relevant producers, summarily dismiss them, and offer a genuine apology.  The matter would then have been closed.  As it is, the Director-General\u2019s decision simply to go into hiding and do nothing, hoping that the affair would blow over without his having to take any action at all, has seriously damaged the standing of the Corporation which was once one of the most respected institutions in the world.\n\nWe therefore ask that the Prime Minister remove the Director-General forthwith and appoint as is replacement someone who will refocus the BBC on its public service mission.",
