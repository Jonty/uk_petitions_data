            "background": "I would like to see the smoking ban completley abolished and give owners of premises the freedom of choice they once had. The blanket ban is an invasion of busnesses and private lives, if we put forward a blanket ban on drinking alcohol in all public places and workplaces i think the pm would have something to say about that.\nIf we want to smoke let us it can be enjoyable if not abused and is an older way of life than drinking alcohol.",
