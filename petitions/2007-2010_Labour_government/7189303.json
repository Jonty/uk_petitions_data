            "background": "To overcome the possible threat of staff from a business copying details read by the eye when they are in possession of a customer\u2019s credit/debit card, I call for it to be made illegal for staff taking a card for payment to place the card out of sight of the customer.\n\nA credit/debit card should not be taken away for use as security such as for a bar tab when at a restaurant but swiped with a payment of \u00a30 at the start to register and full payment made later.\n\nBusinesses should be prepared to take the risk of having to track down non-payers rather than compromising the security of the customer\u2019s identity. Customers shouldn\u2019t have to have their security compromised for the security of the business. An Individual\u2019s security comes before that of a business and is no excuse to keep hold of the customer\u2019s card.\n\nIn general, it should be made illegal for all businesses taking payments to take a credit/debit card out of view of the customer as this will help prevent card details from being copied.",
