            "background": "Government should be encouraging many more exchange visits by schoolchildren and many more exchanges of workers. This would be enjoyable for those involved and would help combat national prejudices and resentments,suspicion etc. Like it or not we are a constituent part of an emerging European 'United states'. It's time to stop fighting it and decide to enjoy it ! Also I would ask you to make the learning of European languages compulsory in secondary schools. This seems non-essential but would aid the process of integration and good relations with our fellow member states.  Join me in looking forward - not back !",
