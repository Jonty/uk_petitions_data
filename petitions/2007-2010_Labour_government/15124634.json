            "background": "Having a pistol in public could help save lives because If (god forbid) there was a mass shooting and no one had a gun, how many people would die than if someone had a gun to stop him. Having a gun will save lives more than take them. This will make England safer and how many people will die if someone stops him befor  he can kill plus kids have always been intrestid in guns and if there dad got a gun but stored it in the top cobbred and sad that that is dangers and deadly they would be more tempted than if there dad showed them it and tort them gun safty it wouldn't bother them. So having a gun could save more lives than if you didn't have a gun.",
