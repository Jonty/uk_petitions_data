They should expect a better rate of pay to meet the demands of the job without the added stress of worrying about trying to pay rent or a mortgage. Most Social Workers in Children's services go into situations that Police will not go into alone yet the public expect social care staff to do it. It's about time this government started to realise just what social workers do. So we the under signed ask for a better rate of pay rise than 2.4%",
