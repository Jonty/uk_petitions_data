        "action": "make it illegal to buy or sell fat burners over the counter without a prescription",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "fat burners are readily available at most high street so called health food shops and in chemists generally without prescription and usually with very little or no advice on side effects. some of the side effects range from insomnia, convulsions, high blood pressure, palpitations, renal failure, heart attack and death. there are many other side effects from these products which are not apparent for the purchaser who often buy these diet supplements because of the pressures of our current society that think skinny is best. these fat burners offer a quick and easy way to lose body fat but fail to alert people wanting to lose their weight of the serious side of taking them. in 2003 an athlete died from taking these fat burner supplements. i urge the prime minister to ban the selling of these over the counter supplements and demand that they are only given on prescription once a relevant medical check has been made.",
