            "background": "Driving is a privilege, not a right and privileges can and must be removed when appropriate.\nThe reason for this punishment is that the life of a person has been taken and a suitable punishment must be given. Imprisonment not only punishes the person who committed the crime but also of their family who are more often than not innocent parties. When the imprisonment is over the person can then drive again and carry on as normal. Never being able to drive again will be a constant reminder of their crime probably reinforced by those that it effects.\n\nDriving whilst banned should carry a severe sentence of incarceration and destruction of any vehicle they are diving as a deterrent.",
