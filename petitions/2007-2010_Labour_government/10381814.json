            "background": "We the undersigned protest against the closure of the Shoebury branch of Barclays Bank.  Shoebury is rapidly losing its community services, of which our bank is one.  It's the only nearby free cashpoint for those without transport, other than ASDA's which is not convenient if you don't drive.  Thorpe Bay is not easily accessible for those without transport, and even for those that do have transport, the parking is a nightmare and parking is not free.\n\nWe have lost the West Rd. Post Office, which gave the Barclays bank more visitors, and now you intend to deprive us further.  I fail to understand how Barclays can say that they are aiming to provide the best service for their customers, when they're in the process ofd removing that service for so many.  Elderly, single parents, local small businesses, working people who don't have the time to get to Southend or Thorpe Bay, the list is endless.  Please stop of the closure of our bank!",
