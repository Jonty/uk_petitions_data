            "background": "Rumour has it that 6 Music will be dropped by the BBC in response to pressure from several parties with vested interest. As the cuts are supposedly to support quality and not quantity then the proposed axeing makes no sense. 6 Music is the one channel that promotes the vast and unique catalogue of live music that the BBC has built up since formation. A catalogue that is the envy of the world and should be heard by current a future generations",
