            "background": "Why is there no 5 day travelcard option available? Other cities across Europe offer a 5 day travelcard option, why should Londoners need to pay for a 7 day travelcard when we don't use the 2 remaining days? Most people work from Monday-Friday meaning Saturday and Sunday are not used. But even so, even if I worked Saturday to Wednesday a 5 day travelcard still applies.\n\nFor example:\n\nZone 1 - 3 (7 Day) = \u00a327.40\nZone 1 - 3 (If buying a daily travelcard for 5 days) = \u00a339\n\nThis is a rip off, and the argument that  the 7 day travelcard is cheaper than buying 5 single day travelcards is rubbish, the fact is we don't need 7 days, we only need 5 so offer 5 and a lower rate. Why is it not possible?\n\nPlease sign this petition if you believe there should be an option of a 5 day travelcard. Please send this to your friends, the more signatures the more power we have to change this pointless travelcard fare system.\n\nThank you\n\nJosef Dunne",
