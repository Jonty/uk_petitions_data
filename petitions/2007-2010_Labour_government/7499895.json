            "background": "The PM should dismiss Meredydd Hughes - Chief Constable of South Yorkshire for a flagrant disregard of the laws of the road. He was caught driving at 90mph in a 60mph limit. His views on speeding in his role of chair of roads policing at the Association of Chief Police Officers were unforgiving. He said 'the public is not just composed of drivers... - not just 'petrol heads' who want to go as fast as they like' in an public awareness film about the dangers of speeding. It seems that he is quite happy to decide how fast he can drive himself without regard for the safety of other road users or the law which he has been tasked to uphold. We are entering an era where government officials and public servants believe they are above the law and will not take responsibility for their own actions.",
