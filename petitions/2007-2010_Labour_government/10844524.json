            "background": "Why did then Chancellor Gordon Brown sell 415 tonnes of British gold in 1999 when the gold price was so low? In light of the current mess, was this a financially prudent move for the UK? \n\nThis sale needs to be explained because it has cost the country billions in losses, plus the loss of our bullion, leaving us in a very vulnerable position. \n\nI would like to know if the badly timed bullion sale by Brown had anything to do with the investment bank Goldman Sachs having a 1,000 tonne short position in the market at that time? Was British gold sold off in order to keep the price down and save Goldman Sachs from not being able to cover their position?",
