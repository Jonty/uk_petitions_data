            "background": "Increasing the age limit to 21, would make it a lot less likely that someone\nunder the age of 18, could obtain alcohol and drink it.\nI am not calling for pubs and clubs to stop serving alcohol to 18 year olds.  They do have at least kind some supervision if the landlords, management and staff manage their premises correctly. \nI feel if this is made law, it will go a long way towards reclaiming our puplic places such as parks, from drunken underage drinkers in the evening and night time.\nOne Sunday morning in the future I hope to be able to walk over my local park and find that it is not littered with broken bottles and empty beer cans.",
