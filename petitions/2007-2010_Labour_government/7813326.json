This extra New Year  Day would reciprocate for the February 29th \u201cleap day\u201d for which currently there is no recognition for salaried workers either in extra day\u2019s  pay or extra day\u2019s holiday.",

            "background": "February 29th \u201cLeap day\u201d is a tradition decreed by Pope Gregory in 1582 to reform the Julian calendar introduced in 45 B.C.  For those people on annual salaries it works out as just an extra day\u2019s work for no extra pay or holiday.\n\nFor a worker on an annual salary of \u00a320k this extra leap day\u2019s work every fourth year can equate to a calculated potential loss of \u00a354. An extra day Public Holiday in the UK would reciprocate for this potential loss and serve to fairly equate the number of paid days in every year. \n\nThe proposal is that the extra day of February 29th in every leap year is recognised by an extra New Year Day's Public Holiday on January 2nd. Many businesses and industries traditionally close over this festive period and therefore this extra day would have little trading significance whilst leisure, entertainment, travel and tourism would actually benefit.",
