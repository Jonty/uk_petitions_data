            "background": "Two-thirds of gambling firms have failed to contribute to a fund to help addicts, it has been reported. The petitioner is calling for stricter regulatory controls - please legislate on opening times and access - my local betting shop is situated next to a school !   \n\nThe Responsibility in Gambling Trust told the BBC it has reached its target of \u00a33.5 million but is concerned that many firms have not made a donation.\nThe industry donations fund research into problem gambling and also treatment services for gambling addicts including education about how to gamble sensibly.\n\nWe the undersigned agree with the UK govt initiative, pioneered by Culture Secretary Andy Burnham that licensed gambling operators would face a statutory levy unless they came up with more cash for the trust.",
