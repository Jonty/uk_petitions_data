            "background": "As present the funding available to postgraduates is much higher than undergradutes.  Where students are opting for undergraduate courses, there should be parity with postgraduates for the access to funding, particularly for mature students opting for career change.  If we want to encourage more people into priority subjects then maximum funding should be available to all courses leading ultimately to the same qualification / career.",
