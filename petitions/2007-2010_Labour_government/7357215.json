        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In the last 41 years, England's football team have appeared in only one international final which was won in controversial fashion (and lest we forget was at home too). The game in England has been in decline ever since with the team becoming perennial underachievers; never more apparent than the latest Euro 2008 debacle. Contrast this with England Rugby's three World Cup appearances in 20 years; one of which was won in spectacular fashion. England has also been very successful throughout the history of the 5 and 6 Nations tournaments and is the leading country for producing winners of the Heineken Cup (Bath, Northampton, Leicester [x2]and Wasps [x2]) in its 12-year history; last season 3 of the 4 semi-finalists and the eventual winner all came from England. The English public should therefore be given the opportunity to decide what its preferred national game is, and not have football foisted upon it.",
