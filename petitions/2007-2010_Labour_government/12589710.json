            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This petition is designed to help make all MPs directly accountable for their actions. Many of the electorate believe that a great abuse of the system has occured. Many MPs have yet to apologise and this is unacceptable. In order to hold these MPs to greater scrutiny parliament should be dissolved in order to allow the electorate to decide if their use of the expenses system was appropriate or not. The credibility of the British democratic system has taken a serious hit from these revelations. The only way to truely gain back any sense of trust is to allow the electorate a chance to judge the actions of their representative immediately. In order to achieve this change I implore you to sign this petition. A signature will not guarentee change but it is a chance for you to exercise direct influence over the way this country is governed and that is something which is sorely lacking from the British democratic system at the moment. Exercise your right and please show your support.",
