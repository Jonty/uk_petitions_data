This would help the environment by saving trees and reducing pollution from inks etc. It would also reduce the amount of landfill.  To replace the loss of advertising a monthly National or Regional publication containing all the special offers and new products could be made available at council offices and libraries.  Also a website with the same information could be made available so that a person knows where to look when they decide that they want to buy something.",
