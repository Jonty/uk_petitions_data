            "background": "The Pheonix Centre is a community centre located on Batley Road Alverthorpe it offers a number of resources and opportunities to the local community the main one being Batley Road Playgroup which is a offstead registered nursery setting for 2-4 year olds it runs as a charity and the cost for children to attend is non profit making many of the staff are volenteers and have over a 100 years of experience in the childcare enviroment. \nAs the nursery works with very low ratios of nursery staff to children its like one big family allowing children to learn and develope through play.Recently Wakefield council have closed the Pheonix Centre after a long battle to keep it open and the council promising to do so this was told to the staff on the same day as they were finally given a low rate 5 year lease lol please see http://www.wakefieldexpress.co.uk/news/Council-boots-Wakefield-kids39-group.5292548.jp",
