            "background": "At present cold weather payments are only paid to people in receipt of job seekers allowance and income support. Especially in the recent cold weather people have been forced to pay more to heat their homes. It is important for disabled people to keep warm without having to make a choice between food or heat. The system pays for heroin addicts & alcoholics to keep warm & get free prescriptions, this is unfair to those who are unable to work through no fault of their own due to illness & disability. This inequity needs to be addressed quickly, before more people die.",
