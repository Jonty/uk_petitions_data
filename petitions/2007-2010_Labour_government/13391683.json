        "background": "As a cat lover & owner  , I have been aware of the dangers of Lillies to cats for some time & would never have lillies in my garden or home . However my cats & others roam in quite a few  gardens in the neighbourhood & I believe there to be many cat lovers or owners who are completely unaware of these dangers .\nSadly one of my friends cats had to be PTS due to Lilly poisoning earlier this week & his suffering was agonising ! despite vets treatment . & she was fully aware of the dangers & making neighbours aware . Absolutely tragic !!!!\n\nI am petitioning to make it compulsory for all Garden centres , Florists or any other retailer of Lillies & other plants dangerous to cats or other animals , whether in bouquets , fully grown plants or bulbs to put or give a warning as to the danger of these popular plants to cats . & what with Christmas coming up , might I also point out that Poinsettas are also extremely poisonous !\n\nPlease sign my petition to prevent the loss of more beloved cats to this horrifying death !\n\nThank you for reading .",
