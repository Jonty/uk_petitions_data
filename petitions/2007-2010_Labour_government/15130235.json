            "background": "The new rail link  will cause \"irreversible damage\" to many areas deemed Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).\n\nWe oppose the routing of the new high speed rail line through the heart of the Chilterns.\n\nThe rail link is of no economic benefit to the Chiltern / Aylesbury Area especially as there is no intermediate station within Buckinghamshire.\n\nLeader of Buckinghamshire County Council, David Shakespeare, said: 'It's ironic that HS2 will give Buckinghamshire all the environmental disadvantages while promoting economic benefits elsewhere. Our residents won't benefit as the trains will pass through the county without stopping, simply leaving Buckinghamshire with huge damage to our environment and Green Belt.'\n\n\nWe implore the Prime Minister to rethink the proposals at the earliest available opportunity and not to destroy this beautiful part of the country.",
