            "background": "Over prescription of Medication occurs for many reasons, patients having medication to which they have some adverse reaction to which is evident within a few hours or days yet they have been issued with sufficient for four weeks, or those with repeat prescription forms being issued with items they have not requested. Pharmacist are unable to take these items back into stock, even when this occurs in error despite that error being bought to their immediate attention before the items have left their premises. Pharmacists used to collect over prescribed medication for dispersal to the third world but even this has now ceased and these items inevitably end up in land-fill sites as there is no alternative for their disposal. The Government frequently lays the blame for over prescription firmly at the door of the health professionals and demands they take action to reduce incidents. \nHowever over prescription occurs it is wasteful and costly and the Heath Minister must implement a secure process by which these items are taken back into stock at Pharmacies.",
