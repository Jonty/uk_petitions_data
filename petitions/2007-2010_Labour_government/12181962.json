        "background": "Ticket prices for football matches have now risen to the extent that many average football fans have been priced out. To now deny these fans the opportunity to watch their national team play is unbelievable. Putting the national game on channels such as setanta, where an expensive suscription is needed further pushes football into the realm of those with sufficient funds. But this goes beyond the realm of simply money. Football and sport has been a great part of British culture and patriotism for generations and denying the vast majority of the British public the opportunity to watch the national game in simply immoral.",
