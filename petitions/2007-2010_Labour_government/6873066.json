        "background": "In the current climate the current trend of downsizing our armed forces is beyond belief.\nOur navy is all but gone, and our army and airforce is hugely overstretched.\nIt is of great importance to be able to defend our nation and our territories and as things stand we are not even able to mass a task force the size needed to retake the falkland islands!.\nWe need to not only reinstate decommissioned ships and boost our navy but to at least be able to form TWO task forces, this is something that is by far beyond us as things stand and is undermining our ability to cope with ANY renewed threat from rougue nations.",
