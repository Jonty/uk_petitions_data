            "background": "For the past 6 years the Food Standards Agency has been working hard to help UK Consumers reduce their intake of salt. As we are always reminded, higher levels of salt intake leads to higher blood pressure which can then lead to higher risk of heart disease and stroke. A great deal of focus has been on food production processes in order to reduce salt levels at source of production. However, when consumers in this country dine out they are automatically presented with salt to use with their meal. It\u2019s good practice nowadays to present consumers with healthier options yet the norm in eating places is to place the unhealthy option straight in peoples\u2019 faces. I believe that salt should be removed from dining tables and dining areas in general, and only made available to diners upon request (in same way that diners often do at present when asking for miscellaneous condiments). This would further reduce our salt intake, support the Food Standard Agency\u2019s strategy on salt reduction, and contribute to healthier eating in public.",
