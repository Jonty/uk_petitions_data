            "background": "Dear sir,\nBefore the Reformation, this law of this country had a respect for the Seal of the Confessional, however, as the law stands there is no privilege which can be applied to communications between a penitent and a member of the clergy. Indeed on occasion members of the clergy have been committed for contempt of court as a result of not answering questions relating to the confessional.\n\nWe the undersigned humbly beg that it be made illegal for a member of the clergy of any denomination or creed to be compelled by any official involved in the process of law (eg police officers, magistrates or judges) to reveal information that they may have gained by means of any sort of religious confession in the same way that communications between one's lawyer or attorney is privileged.\n\nSuch an act would allow for a fuller freedom of religion and would safeguard the ethical duties of a member of the clergy to keep information gained during a religious confession absolutely confidential. It would also recognise the practical reality that members of the clergy who do their job properly do not disclose such information even at the risk of their own liberty.",
