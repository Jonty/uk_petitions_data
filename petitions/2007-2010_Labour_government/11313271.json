            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Two greatest threats facing the UK at the moment are obesity and global warming, both of which can be dealt with by reducing meat consumption. \n\nMeat is well known to be a significant cause of obesity due to its high content of saturated fat, the large amount of salt used in its preparation and the numerous carcinogens created when it is cooked, all which impact heavily on the health of the people in the UK. This 'meat rich' diet is costing billions of pounds each year in health care.\n\nRegarding global warming, the UN report \"Livestock's Long Shadow,\" lists livestock production as one of the greatest single contributors to global warming, larger than the entire transport industry. Livestock contributes substantially to the release of Methane (CH4) and Nitrous Oxide (N2O) into the atmosphere, which have a far greater global warming potential than CO2. \n\nPlease encourage all UK citizens to eat less meat to help solve the problems of global warming and human obesity.",
