        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I would like to petition the government to change the way stamp duty is charged on the sale of houses.  There should be an option to spend part or all of the stamp duty on energy improvements to the home to reduce emissions.  This will mean that each time a house changes hands it will become more energy efficient.  This can be linked into the new HIPs pack.  This will mean items like smart meters and efficient boilers/air source heat pumps could be implemented quicker.  It would mean an initial reduction in stamp duty received but should mean that the country is more efficient and hence have more money to spend on consumables.  We would also, as a country, be less dependant on fuel.",
