        "background": "I think that it is about time that Social Services, Police etc take into consideration that young children need listening to.  It is all too easy to try and blame what children, especially young children say onto their environment or over hearing adults talking.  However this is not always the case.  Especially in my case it seems that it is far less work for all involved to point the finger at the main care giver than to actually look into what the children are saying.  Give the young children a voice too, they maybe small and hard to understand but they still count and they are the ones who need protecting the most, because they cannot protect themselves.  People rely on Social Services to help and it is about time that they started doing just that and looking out for the little ones who cant be understood very well, and not only the children they can understand easily!",
