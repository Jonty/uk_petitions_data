            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The recently increased security measures at UK airports are clearly of necessity.  However, many thousands of people passing through UK airport security are already security-cleared by the British government and are (one assumes) of no threat to air security.  A fast-track system for such people to pass through airport security when embarking on domestic UK flights would lessen the burden on airport security staff and shrink the significant lines of people waiting, particularly at peak times.  Such people could be told clearly what items are prohibited from aircraft cabins and then be subject to less comprehensive search.",
