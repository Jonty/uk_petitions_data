            "background": "Gordon Brown has said he plans to reduce the mimimum wage for Northern Ireland and other regions within the UK and raise other areas like London. I believe that this is the start of creating an underclass of citizenship within the British Isles and can only lead to its future break up. If this is to be prevented then it is important that certain rights, like that of the mimimum wage, are kept as unilaterial laws.",
