            "background": "Honours are for honourable men and woman who have done great service to this country. Tony Blair has been economical with the truth and that is putting it very mildly and has taken us into two wars which has cost the lives of too many of our superb servicemen and woman. How many of our injured servicemen and woman did he visit, how many bereaved families did he contact, whilst making money on his after dinner speaking and other interests.\nHonour, integrity, loyalty and courage come in abundance with our service people. This man has no concept of what these qualities are.\nUnder no circumstances should this man receive any honours.",
