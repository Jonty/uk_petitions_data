            "background": "The Government has given in to pressure from the ignorant tabloid newspapers and banned anyone from becoming a Police Community Support Officer under the age of 18 years. Some forces, including the British Transport Police, West Midlands Police, and Thames Valley Police currently recruit 16 and 17 year old PCSO's as long as they can demonstrate they have the required skills to perform the job correctly.\n\nThis will now have to stop because of new Government rules. Serving 16 and 17 year old PCSO's are clearly doing a good job and liasing with anti social youths in a manner most older officers cannot. \n\nPlease stop being ageist and remove the new rule. No one should be treated differently on the grounds of age AS LONG AS they can prove they are as capable as anybody else.",
