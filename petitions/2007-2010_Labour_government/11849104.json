        "background": "The number of people receiving treatment for eating disorders is estimated at 90,000, and many have not been diagnosed. The prevalence total for people diagnosed and undiagnosed with an eating disorder in the UK is 1.15 million. (Beat 2000) Young people in age group 14 \u2013 25 are most at risk of developing this type of illness. This includes a large proportion of the student population. (UK Eating Disorder Statistics 2004 provided by Disordered Eating) These people may be influenced by unrealistic representations of \u2018beauty\u2019 in the media. \n\nThe Government should fulfill their ethical responsibility to combat the promotion of mental illness, in particular eating disorders, through the media. More funding and awareness is drastically required to ensure that unrealistic images of \u2018the perfect bodies\u2019 are no longer impacting on the young people of Britain. The Government should consider following the example of the French Government\u2019s legislation surrounding extreme skinniness in the media, to ensure that cases of eating disorders in the UK decreases.",
