            "background": "A restoration of confidence in the political apparatus is hereby called for. This includes, but is not exhaustive of, a requirement to create checks and balances for those Crown Servants who wield power in the name of the people. At present the government of the day can change the UK Constitution on a whim. All UK Citizens with suffrage may be equal on Election Day but between Parliaments the abuse of power is evident: be it through laws that are seen to erode civil liberty; the abuse of Parliament\u2019s gift out of the public purse of Mortgage payments, etc; the use and misuse of the Royal Prerogative by servants of the Crown; and, patronage etc. For example can Ministers who sit as Legislators be free of conflicts of time and interests?  \nThis apparent conflict has the unfortunate dimension of legislators who are seen to unethically abuse Parliament\u2019s generous gift out of the public purse. Further with the apparent erosion of common law rights, freedoms and liberties by Acts of Parliament, the use of the Royal Prerogatives and other rules it is time to establish an entrenched and inviolable law that can be interpreted by our new Supreme Court acordingly.",
