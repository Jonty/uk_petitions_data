            "background": "Every year, thousands of people are forced to hand over hundreds of pounds to clampers because they have inadvertently parked on private land.  They can legally be blocked in by clampers and then be forced to travel to a compound to collect their vehicle.  Additional fees can then be charged for towing and storage.  It is our contention that owners of private land who do not wish cars to park there can employ suitable alternative methods to protect their property.  We also note that clamping is not legal in Scotland.  Most people regard clamping as little more than legalised extortion or robbery and would happily see private clamping firms driven out of business.",
