            "background": "Under the new proposed laws for dogs that are out of control in public places,we urge The Prime Minister to treat each dog regardless of it's breed or size equally.\nToo many dog breeds are being wrongly labelled as aggressive because they have fallen into the wrong hands and for this reason,we urge you to penalise the owner and not the dog.\nWe would like you to consider imposing a lifetime ban(dog ownership)to repeat offenders as certain breeds of dogs are wrongly labelled as aggressive.\nNo dog is born aggressive but unfortunately some breeds of dogs namely Rottweilers and Staffordshire Bull Terriers are a status symbol for anti-social people, when they are in fact Loyal,affectionate and gentle with children.\nWe ask you treat all cases from a chihuahua to a rottweiler with the same seriousness.",
