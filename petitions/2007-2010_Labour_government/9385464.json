            "background": "The Treasury has abolished the exemption from higher road-tax rates for cars that emit more than 225g of CO2 per km and were registered between March 2001 and March 2006. \n\nTens of thousands of cars will now be taxed extra by up to \u00a3245 a year. This will hit those on modest incomes the hardest including people who bought their cars several years ago, when people knew less about the consequences of CO 2 emissions.\n\nThe Chancellor failed to make clear that cars resisted between March 01 and 06 would loose exemption from this change.\n\nOn top of this extra tax burden, many families will find the value of their car has been reduced suddenly by up to 70% and will be unable sell their cars even though they are in good working order and no more than seven years old.\n\nTax changes should be fair, clear and allow people to make long term decisions without worrying that the whim of government may change long term plans.",
