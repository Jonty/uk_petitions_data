If we were given money off coupons or vouchers for the old packaging at the supermarket, recycling centres or even from the councils.All Councils across Britain are making money by collecting our recycling bins but we do not receive anything back for helping them recycle. We all need to do our bit to recycle to cut down how much waste is sent to the landfill sites across Britain. Please sign this petition so that the Prime Minister can act now.",
