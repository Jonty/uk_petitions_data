Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has\".\nMargaret Mead.\n\n\"Nothing we can do can change the past, but everything we do changes the future\". \nAshleigh Brilliant.\n\nWe need to send out a formidable message that hate crimes can not, and will not be tolerated in a civilised society - ours.\n\nBegin with appropriate sentencing for the perpretrators as a deterrent.\nIt's imperative we forge towards quelling these abhorrent crimes, the solution needs to be everyone's problem and our Government needs to lead the way. People learn by example.\n\nPlease sign.",
