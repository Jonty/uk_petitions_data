In the national interest, Gordon Brown should rise above party politics and give the beleaguered Alistair Darling - who might be competent under 'normal' circumstances but appears utterly out of his depth in the current crisis - alternative employment and invite, nay beseech the wise, experienced, judicious and thoroughly respected Vince Cable to take over the reins at the Treasury. In doing so, Mr Brown would do a huge service to the nation and immeasurably improve his own standing.",
