        "background": "The Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS) has been implemented in the UK since the 1st of November.  This scheme requires non-EU and Swiss graduate students applying to study the sciences and mathematics in the UK, fill in a form including details of family background.  This is then to be vetted and approved by UK security services before students can apply for Visas.\nThis scheme was not put to public debate and ignores the fact that academic sciences are in the public domain.  It also selectively biases against non-EU students even though terrorists are just as likely to come from within the EU.  We the undersigned demand that this policy is put to public debate and if found wanting be stopped.",
