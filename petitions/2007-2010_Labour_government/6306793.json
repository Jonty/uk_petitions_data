            "background": "This will limit the scope for the London Stock Exchange to be regulated by alternative financial regulations should it be taken over by a foreign company. It will ensure the London Stock Exchange remains under British ownership as it always has been. This would be a win-win situation since the LSE is demonstrating outstanding performance, reflected in the dividends, which would then be available for Government expenditure. The element of prestige is particularly significant given the increasing dependence of the UK economy on the financial services sector and the prominent position of London compared with Wall Street or Frankfurt. Keep the LSE British for strategic reasons.",
