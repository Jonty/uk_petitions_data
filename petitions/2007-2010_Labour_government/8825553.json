            "background": "We call for clarity, consistency and equity of approach & application with regard to the \"Special Rules\" Review & DLA Applications generally. That the emphasis on \"mobility criteria\" (for Personal Care/Mobility components at Higher Rate) needs broadening. To include mental issues, side effects of therapy. That when ill, some disabled people\u2019s lack of mobility can be for reasons other than physical (limb related) impairments i.e. blackout, diarrhea, etc. Acknowledge that age, sexual orientation & discrimination suffered by certain social groups are additional barriers to employment. Leaving them unable to rejoin the work force. Before the implications & limitations of there disabilities are considered. That denial or an adverse review is causing extreme poverty. That where no cure exists, a condition i.e HIV can still be  terminal & not chronic. That a general model for assessing unique situations is delivering unfair and fallible decisions for those less able to challenge the system i.e. the most vulnerable.",
