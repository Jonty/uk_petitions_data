        "background": "The railways in the UK are awful. Even the \"High Speed\" westcoast mainline is slow. \n\nWhy can't we have the same standard of High Speed Railways that the French have. The TGV system is exceptionally fast and would reduce the need for internal flights and long distance car journeys.\n\nI propose tha government starts right away in investing in longterm public transport solutions to supliment their expectation on people using it!\n\nThis would cost a lot of money, but in the longrun it would revolutionise the way people are able to travel in this country.",
