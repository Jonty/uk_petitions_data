            "background": "It must be very easy, and satisfying to the moral ego, for men to issue diktats on abortion, and on women's \"duty\" to continue pregnancy, knowing that, by the very nature of such things, they themselves will never experience pregnancy except vicariously.  Until such time (if it ever happens) that this situation changes it is only fair for the decision on whether or not to continue any pregnancy to be made by the woman.  Even if the man takes full responsibility for the product of a continued pregnancy - and how many do no matter what they promised in an attempt to persuade the woman to continue the pregnancy?! - they still can't go through the birth which is usually extremely painful.  The ONLY function anti-choice men have in this debate is for each of them to ensure that he himself is never responsible for an unwanted pregnancy.",
