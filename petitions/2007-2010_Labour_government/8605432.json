        "action": "Halt the sex discrimination regarding genital circumcision and prosecute the doctors in breach of their ethical code.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Firstly, for some time now female circumcision has been illegal in this country and has even been re named genital mutilation. The comparable surgical procedure for males is not afforded the same legislation or renaming. In fact, in response to a petition on this site by Benjamin Wood in an attempt to ban circumcision in under 18's, the Government replied that the NHS should offer this procedure to prevent the potential inherent morbidity and mortality that may be caused by this procedure being performed outside the NHS. Surely the same could be argued about female circumcision/genital mutilation. I believe this may be construed as sexual discrimination against the male population as the Government appear to place a higher value on female genitalia than that of males.\nSecondly, I believe that doctors operated under the ethical principle of first do no harm. Given the documented evidence regarding the harm that may be caused by male genital mutilation, I would strongly argue that they are in breach of this code.",
