            "background": "Rescind the guidance issued in Home Office Circular 46/2004, Annex C. This guidance to Police Authorities gave them the green light to drastically reduce the injury award pensions payable to disabled former police officers when they reach the age of 65. \nThe Home Office guidance is, I believe, contrary to the intentions and spirit of the Police (Injury Benefit) Regulations 1987, which was to provide a minimum income guarantee for life. The Home Office guidance is being applied retrospectively to disabled officers who were unaware that they might face a huge reduction in their pensions at age 65. Many former officers will lose thousands of pounds a year and may have to sell their homes and posessions in order to survive. These brave men and women have already been deprived of their most precious possession - their health - in the line of duty whilst protecting the public and ensuring the rule of law.",
