            "background": "Renting a property should not be the pain it is at the moment, as a Renter myself I am fed up of Landlords feel that they can dictate how you should use the property that you are paying them handsomely to occupy.\n\nI believe that a landlord should only be able to demand that the property is in the same condition at the end of a tenancy as when the tenancy began. I feel it is unfair that they can impose silly restrictions i.e. No Pets. I feel that this is an infringement of ones human rights, I think that as owning becomes further and further away from the average person the tenant MUST be given more rights and freedom during a tenancy.",
