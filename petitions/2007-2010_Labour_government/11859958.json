            "background": "Whatever the offence that has caused Life Peers to receive a custodial sentence in this country, then their peerage should be revoked.  There cannot be any reason why a criminal should have the title of Lord or Lady, and this should be made perfectly clear at the time of being made a member of the House of Lords.\n\nIt is also not in this country's interest to allow Lords & Ladies of The Realm the right to exercise their powers in the running of this country when they have a criminal conviction. Indeed they should be expelled from the House of Lords immediately and stripped of all titles and powers.\n\nApart from the disgrace they bring to our political constitution, they could also be deemed a threat to our national security if they are allowed to remain within the Houses of Parliament.",
