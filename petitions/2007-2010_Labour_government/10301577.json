You have shown no mercy to anyone - quite happy to carry on taxing us to the hilt in fuel, road duty and personal taxes.\n\nYour government had the opportunity to show that they cared by removing the second homes allowance as well as the daily allowance... You are all grossly overpaid and certainly underworked - we see no evidence of you helping us out of this mire. You are all on the take.\n\nAs you are supposed to be working for us, we are now telling you that we have NO CONFIDENCE in you and it is now TIME FOR YOU TO GO!!!",
