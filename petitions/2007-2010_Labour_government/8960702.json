            "action": "introduce legislation prohibiting the demolition of any building built before 1914",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The 20th century saw the destruction of Britain's architectural heritage on a remarkable scale - a process that culminated in the misguided urban development of the 1960s. Thankfully, attitudes have changed significantly within the last 20 years, and comparatively few older buildings continue to be demolished. Despite the listed buildings system, demolition of pre-1914 buildings still occurs ocassionally, with adverse consequences for local environment, and usually with huge opposition. We feel that it is necessary to enshrine the prevailing attitude to architectural heritage in law. It is not acceptable that the buildings in which our ancestors lived and worked are simply tossed aside, in favour of the monotony of modern architecture, which often does not harmonise with the surrounding environment. 1914 is a suitable dividing line because it represents the division between the Victorian/Edwardian period, and what can be termed the modern era. However, the dividing line is open to debate. We are blessed in Britain to have such a huge amount of historic architecture - this magnificent inheritance should remain for future generations to benefit from.",
