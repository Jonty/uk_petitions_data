            "background": "There should be a ban in nurseries and schools on grooming children that fiction is fact. It is unethical to teach children that anything is fact, unless it is actual fact, and as hard evidence to back it up. None of the major religions have a shred of hard evidence to confirm that any of their mythical or miraculous claims are fact, therefore it is dangerous to groom vulnerable young minds that they are fact... A ban on the religious grooming of children, we would wipe out religious extremists within a few generations. People should make their minds up about religion after they become adults, and not until they are over the age of consent.",
