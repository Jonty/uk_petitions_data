This should include\n\na. safe, secure, stable housing for mothers leaving prison to enable them to live with their children\n\nb. support for mothers in prison that starts in prison and is continued on release to help families to reintegrate \n\nc. information and training for people working with children (including in schools) about the support needs of children whose mothers are or have been in prison and guidance on working with mothers in prison and on release to give them and their children the support they need",
