            "background": "Earlier this year, Guy Button was sentenced to three years in prison for bringing his terminally ill father a gun so that he could commit suicide. His mother was already in a nursing home suffering from severe Alzheimer's, and his father had just been told that he did not have long to live. As he was devoted to his father and hated seeing him suffer, he duly brought the gun to his father in hospital and his father committed suicide in the hospital ward.\n\nWe believe that Guy Button does not at all deserve the incredibly harsh punishment he has been sentenced to just for carrying out his beloved father's dying wish. We have all either been taught by him at school or a music centre and he has always been a kind, funny and inspiring man. We believe that the sentence should be removed and he should be freed as we would like to be taught by him again.",
