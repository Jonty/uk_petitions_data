            "background": "I speak for many football groups who play on Gloucester Green entrance to Regents Park twice a week through the year. \n\nMy football club Leftfooters FC has been playing on this surface for over 10 years. Many other football groups play on this patch of grass and we all accommodate each other and are aware of the limits of space when the park is busy. \n\nHowever from April to August we are plagued by stuck up office workers who in some lame attempt at \u201cteam bonding\u201d descend on Gloucester Green like a plague of posh locusts and demand enormous amounts of space which encroach on all the football games being played.\n\nThey have no wish to compromise in regards to space and act as if the football players have no right to be there. \n\nHowever we are always there whether it rains, thunders, hale or snows. \n\nI implore you to do the decent thing and ask Regents Park to ban Softball from Gloucester Green or at least remove it to a side of the park which is not used for real sports 12 months of the year every year.",
