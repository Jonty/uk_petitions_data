            "background": "We have come across innapropiate groups on the social network site Facebook, which makes fun of children suffering abuse and in extreme circumstances death. We find the groups recently found on Facebook as absolutly disgusting and should be removed asap. The group called 'The Baby P Joke Group' has been reported to Facebook management on numerous occasions by an ever growing list of facebook members with nothing done or the page removed. These types of groups should not be allowed, It is very  upsetting for the people recieving this unwanted attention, \n\nPlease sign this petition in support and make Facebook Managment remove this Group and any pages in smiliar nature",
