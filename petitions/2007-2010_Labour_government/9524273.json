            "background": "I have witnessed the patients in wards suffering from the high temprature because of the heating even in the summer in the Wets Middlesex Hospital. No staff knows how to tegulate and to who they have to contact to regulate the heating. One of the staffs said that if she knew it, I would have come in uniform. Specially new born babies are suffering a lot. The agonies of mothers are great. It seems that it is very impossible to raise the issue at the relevant people. I spoke to few staff in the hospital. They look at me reduculed. Some had sympathy. Few staff said that it was common in all over NHS. I kndly request every one who is concerned about the heating system in the NHS, to raise it by signing this petition to change the heating system not only West Middlesex Hospital but oll over the NHS in the country. Thank you.",
