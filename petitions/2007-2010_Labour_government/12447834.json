            "background": "This Govenment has no shame in taxing private sector employees to the hilt whilst talking about its own \"prudence\". Yet MPs are entitled to 'Gold Plated' Final salary pension schemes that are not capped unlike private sector schemes and not funded. Make them convert these schemes to money purchase and tax them at the higher rate if they so qualify. Surely the Government should put its own house in order before going after higher rate payers who are trying to be sensible and save for retirement because they know they will get virtually nothing from the state pension scheme. This Government is both financially and morally bankrupt.",
