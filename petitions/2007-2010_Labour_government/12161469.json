I believe that the true offenders are the people who drive Much to fast and are a danger to everyone else.\n\nIf the penalties where staggered to reflect the severity of the offense such as a minor fine for upto five miles per hour over the limit maybe five or ten pounds and no points. then introduce points penalties and more severe fines for being ten or more miles per hour over the limit.",
