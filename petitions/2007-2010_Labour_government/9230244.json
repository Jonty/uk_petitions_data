        "background": "I think, by supporting bio fuels we create another problem that we need to address. That problem is the deforrestation of the Amazon. The Amaozn is being destroyed and the people who create fires, increase the files around the place and therefore Marlaria will be increased and therefore more people will die. The deforrestation does not help with the global warming. It makes it worse as the burning increases the C02 in the air and the trees take in the C02 so, more C02 is being produced and no trees are absorbing it.",
