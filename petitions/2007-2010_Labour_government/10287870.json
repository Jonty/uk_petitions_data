            "background": "The BabyWorks is launching a campaign to encourage the Government to provide free educational BabyCare workshops for all parents-to-be. Parenthood can be an emotional rollercoaster, exhausting, overwhelming and exciting.  At The BabyWorks we believe that due to an overload of books, information and advice in the market many parents lack the skills and confidence to make their own decisions and care for their new baby. Free workshops would readdress that balance and give parents-to-be the skills and knowledge to cope with confidence during the first 12 weeks of their new baby\u2019s life.  In addition, to this The BabyWorks is also petitioning \u2018Dad\u2019s Only\u2019 workshops, to encourage fathers to take an active role in their newborn\u2019s life thus relieving some of the pressure from mum\u2019s shoulders.",
