        "background": "Madeleine Beth McCann disappeared from Praia da Luz on the 3.5.07. In July 2008 the case was archived by the Attorney General, we ask the Home Office/Ministry of Justice to help the McCann's find their daughter and whoever is responsible by liaising with Portugal with a view to getting the case re-opened in Portugal and by offering the Attorney General any legal assistance that they may require from the UK as Madeleine is a British Citizen. \n\nMadeleine's father has stated that no official authority is looking for his daughter due to the archiving of the case, which must be causing them great upset and distress, therefore we need to help in getting the authorities actively searching and re-investigating the disappearance of Madeleine both in the UK and Portugal so that Madeleine can be found and reunited with her family. \n\nThe perpetrator of this heinous crime is still at large and needs to be brought to justice and therefore we turn to our Government to help to ensure the perpetrator is caught and another life is not put at risk due to the archiving of the case.",
