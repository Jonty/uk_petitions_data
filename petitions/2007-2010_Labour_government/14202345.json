            "background": "Munir Hussain's home was burgled by 3 men, one a \"career criminal\". Mr Hussian and his family were tied up, but he managed to escape and with his brother, Tokeer, chased the burglars and caught one. In the heat of the moment, they beat him with a cricket bat, a pole and a hockey stick. The burglar sustained brain damage and a fractured skull.\nMunir was jailed for 30 months and Tokeer for 39 months for GBH with intent. I believe that the brothers responded to extreme provocation and their convictions should be quashed, as every person should have the right to protect their homes, property and family by any and all means necessary.",
