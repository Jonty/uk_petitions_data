            "background": "There have been a few news stories where people have been persecuted for displaying Golliwog dolls in their windows.  A Golliwog is a soft toy which used to have a place in British society - it's part of our history not a soft-toy of hatred.\n\nIn one case a mother got in trouble because her daughter displayed the doll in her window. She got visited by the police!!\n\nIf the Golliwog is a symbol of hatred then so too should be any/all religious idols.  I have no faith so when I see a religious idol on display it offends me - can I then tell the police and have them get the owners to take it down?  What about Action Man - he's racist against white people because he looks like a football hooligan, let's make him a symbol of hatred too.\n\nA hatred rule should be a universal rule - not discriminatory.\n\nStop picking on the Golliwog.",
