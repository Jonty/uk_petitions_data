            "background": "Dear Sir,I like many thousands of others in the UK would like the death sentence brought back.28years ago my Mother was brutaly murdered,as like so many other families i know the devastating effects on other family members for the rest of their lives.A major decision like this SHOULD go to a public referendum,I do realise this could be political suicide for any MP,but it should be considered on neccessity and not gut reaction.With the aid of DNA profiling there need never be any miscarriage of Justice,and the Victims as well as their families would in view get justice as justice is meant to be.There are always going to be those who will commit murder whatever the penalty,But i realy do think a lot of would be offenders would think twice knowing the ultimate deterant was in force.As for Paedophiles you can lock them up for 15years, but as soon as they are released they start to look for their next victim,if these victims survive the mental scaring will last forever,therefore rehabilitation is not i repeat not a viable option.As like a mad dog,they dont get a second chance.MPs,Judges,High Profile police officers are cushioned from major crime just joe blogs public again.",
