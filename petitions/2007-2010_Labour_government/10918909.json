            "background": "Please stop the Bank known as RBS from stealing our money and threatening our clients and collecting our money (which is not thiers to collect) Since the termination of our contract with them they have been unable due to the turmoil return our debtors ledger and issue the cheque for the sums due to us. They continue to plague our clients and we have been in contact with them daily to no avail. Since I have contributed to the rights issue and throught the taxation system I object to this bank being in existance at all.\nWe also have a letter about a \u00a3160,000 VAT refund dated 1st October which has not been paid despite the daily contact we have with the VAT office. This is a despicable situation, why should rich UK government need to borrow \u00a3160,000 from a small struggling company for 8 months without paying any interest.",
