            "background": "With the huge rise in numbers of mobility scooters/ disability buggies on our roads, pavements & in public places the time has arrived to define their status properly (motor vehicle? wheelchair?) & introduce controls over their riders. At the very least 3rd party liability insurance should be considered as a compulsary requirement & some form of rider training mandatory. Reckless & careless use of such buggies is currently not legislated for & many people are being injured with no form of recourse available against bad riders. Whilst no one wishes to see less able people house bound the sheer volume of \"buggy traffic\" has now reached levels where, for safetys sake, sensible legislation is necessary.",
