If I go anywhere during the day, I can't get parked. It's high time the PM introduced heavy fines to such people. 4X4 drivers & women with children are by far the worst abusers.\nSometimes I can't even keep a hospital appointment because all the spaces are used.\n  I couldn't get into hospital recently to visit my young daughter because the last space was taken up by a woman with two kids who were perfectly healthy",
