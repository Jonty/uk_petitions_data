        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I would like to see the government pay full childcare costs for working parents regardless of their marital status. I am sick of seeing working parents struggling to make ends meet because of high childcare costs. For example I earn just above the minimum wage and my husband has to work over 60 hours a week so we can pay the mortgage and bills, we get less than 50% towards childcare. If the government paid 100% childcare costs there would be no excuse for mums and dads not to work, employment would increase, the government would save payments to people on benefits. Parents would be able to afford to live comfortably rather than counting every penny. Please sign the petition today if you are fed up of working hard for nothing, parents need to be more than just parents,please help more parents get back to work today and sign the petition.",
