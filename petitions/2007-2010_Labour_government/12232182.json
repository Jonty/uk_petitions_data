        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I believe that saying the word unlimited and then limiting it (or enforcing a 'Fair Usage Policy') is disgraceful. Imagine if the NHS said 'free care to everyone' (as they do) and then charged people to be admitted to hospitals. It's the same principal.\n\nMobile networks and broadband operators do the same. Mobile networks for instance say you can have 'x' amount of minutes and unlimited texts (on some price plans). In fact, the amount of texts perceived by the operators that people would not possibly exceed is 3000 per month. However, many people I have encountered tell me that they are getting billed extra because they have exceeded their unlimited amount of texts. Now, I'm not overly smart, but to me, that sounds like an impossibility to exceed an unlimited allowance.\n\nIf you believe that this is a shambles as I do, please, sign up to this petition so we can get something done about it.\n\nThank you.",
