            "background": "Bio fuels have been researched by Petro-Chemical companies as an alternative fuel for the use in cars, lorries, home & industrial since the late 1970's. It has now reached a point where we can all use it directly replacing Petrol or Diesel without changing or affecting our vehicles. This is not a \"New age hippy\" fuel, but is 100% viable now and should be in production as soon as possible. Currently, very little has been done to push the mass production of this \"Carbon Neutral\" and CHEAPER fuel due to the government taxing depleting amounts of already expensive, dirty fossil fuels by 70%. Now the government wants an additional \u00a3400-1000 per year for larger engine cars as road tax! Surely, they should give tax breaks to Bio Fuel users and be pushing the production of Bio Fuels grown at home in the UK by our Farmers, on mass. It should be at the pumps now!",
