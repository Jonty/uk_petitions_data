        "background": "The A1 and A19 in the North East of England are not sufficient to deal with traffic flow. This is reducing investment in the area and is detrimental to development. It is also restricting access further North. It is high time the North East received the same level of investment in roads as other areas of the country. We need more than 1 or 2 lane A roads - we need a proper motorway.",
