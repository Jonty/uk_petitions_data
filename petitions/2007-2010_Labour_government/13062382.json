        "background": "Choice is not an issue, alcohol is a killer, a drain on resources, a money pit for this country. If I hadn't had the option to buy alcohol in a supermarket, a bar, at the age of 18(legally), I would not have had to rely on the generosity of state assistance to continue to aid me in trying to recover from alcoholism. I am sure that many a member of the house and the public would agree that the legal age for the purchase and consumption of alcohol must be raised. Money from tax does not equal money for treatment, most cases start at an early age, make it harder to access the substance",
