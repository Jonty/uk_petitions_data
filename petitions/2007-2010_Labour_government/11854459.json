        "background": "The UKCAT test taken for prospective medical/veterinary/ dental students is just to hard. 100's of people have complained, via chat-rooms etc, stating there to vague and to difficult. For example the majority of students applying for medical school will not have studied Maths A-Level or Physics A-Level, yet they put ridiculously complex equations and graphs in that need to be deciphered in a 2min period. The current time constraint for the test is 40 questions in 20mins, this is to short a time to complete a vital test accuratly and many people only finish half the test. I understand that the test is designed to be challenging, but no test should be that demanding and stressful whilst still currently doing your A-Levels. There are Sample questions of current UKCAT's on there web site, try them and you will understand!",
