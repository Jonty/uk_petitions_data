They are not taught how to cook meals from scratch or how to bake,instead they are shown how to fry some mince/chicken,open a jar or packet,and  boil some spaghetti!  \n\nThere is concern about obesity in children so why is there not a bigger drive to teach them how to cook healthy and nutritious food in school.",
