            "background": "In previous petitions; government responses to immigration petitions focus on the illegal immigrants as the biggest problem.  They fail to recognize that the number of LEGAL immigrants are far too high thus taking jobs and benefits and reducing the importance of using the English language in the UK. All immigration should be halted until a realistic immigration control policy can be made, for example \"two out one in\" until a population of 50 million, then a  \"one out one in\" policy. I believe this will help create a healthy sustainable population level in the UK.",
