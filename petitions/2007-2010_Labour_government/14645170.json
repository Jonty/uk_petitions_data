Now, Bank of England's base rate is about 0.5% & interest rates for credit cards about 18%. Over THIRTY TIMES bigger! Usury laws should restrict the maximum interest rate to TEN times the interest rate, or 10% above the base rate,or 2% whichever is LOWER.\nThe usury law in 1800's was a fixed %, which failed to change with interest rates.",
