        "background": "There are plans for people needing to apply for passports (even renewing) has to attend to an interview for their next passport. Unless the passport holder has let their passport expire, or loses it should attend the interviews. It will cost a lot of money and inconvience for people. As they probably have to book a day's leave (knowing the govt the interviews won't happen on weekends) to travel up to 200 miles. I have been on passports since I was 9 months old (I am in my late 20s) and I don't seem why should I attend such a pointless interview.",
