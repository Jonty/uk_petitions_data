Unless the passport holder has let their passport expire, or loses it should attend the interviews. It will cost a lot of money and inconvience for people. As they probably have to book a day's leave (knowing the govt the interviews won't happen on weekends) to travel up to 200 miles. I have been on passports since I was 9 months old (I am in my late 20s) and I don't seem why should I attend such a pointless interview.",
