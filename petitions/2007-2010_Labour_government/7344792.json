This has been recognised by the regulator who is to make rulings around the use of 0845 and 0870 numbers. However companies are now able to use the more expensive numbers 0871 for their points of contact. This should be outlawed and is bordering on theft when left on hold for long periods of time. These numbers are to be re-classified as premium rate numbers. Legislate so that companies must use 01, 02 or the new 03 number which were put in place for this purpose.",
