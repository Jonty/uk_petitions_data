Do you really want 60 million people asking for green tax refunds when the truth is uncovered?? Yet another big hole in the UK treasury funds.\n\nIt's time for real action against all of this hype NOW. Let's get all the huggers off the Gov't payroll and put that money into something useful...maybe invest in water based transport methods....oh no, that would bring the world economy to it's knees.\n\nStop penalising the motorists, instead provide a transportation network to rival the rest of the world. It's time to WAKE up.",
