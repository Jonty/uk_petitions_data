            "background": "The Government quite rightly has brought forward the funding of building programmes for Housing ,Schools and Hospitals, worth many billions of pounds, in order to combat \nsome of the effects of the credit crunch on the economy.\nIn the names of Fairness and Justice to Pensioners we urge the Government to bring forward, as a start, the link of the State Pension to Average Earnings, from  the promise of 2012 to commence on January 1st, 2009\nThe funding is available now  from the Insurance Fund.\nThis measure would not only support Pensioners through the now acknowledged impending recession, and the current fuel poverty that exists for many pensioners, but would also help to combat the credit crunch  as Pensioners spend directly with local businesses for essential services and goods.",
