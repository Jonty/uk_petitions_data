            "action": "follow Sweden's lead regarding Uganda's proposed Anti-Homosexuality Bill with a stated, unequivocal commitment to revoke Britain's \u00a370m a year development aid with immediate effect should the proposed bill be implemented, or if any increased criminalisation or persecution of homosexuality and/or non-normative gender identity is politically implemented or sanctioned in its stead.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "After initial international criticism drove Uganda's President to call for a review, Uganda's Anti-homosexuality Bill once again looks set to be passed imminently.\n\nThe bill proposes life imprisonment for anyone convicted of having same-sex relations and imposes the death penalty for \u201cserial offenders\u201d. NGOs working to prevent the spread of HIV could be imprisoned for up to 7 years for \u201cpromoting homosexuality\u201d. Members of the public face up to three years in jail if they fail to report homosexual activity to the police within 24 hours.\n\nUgandan gay rights activists believe that a huge global response will cause the Ugandan government to ditch the the proposed law, rather than face becoming internationally isolated.\n\nIn light of this enormous threat to the lives and liberty of innocent people within Uganda, we feel Britain is obliged to show its commitment to human rights and fundamental decency by bringing to bear the utmost political pressure available.",
