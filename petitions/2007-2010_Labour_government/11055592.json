        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Empty property rates financially penalise owners who would like to let or sell but are prevented from doing so by local or national economic conditions. The charge of rates on empty properties should be tied to redevelopment. Local councils should be able to amend their planning framework to provide a development brief for alternative use. No rates would be payable until this is done. Empty property rates would become payable 3 months later. The owner can submit a planning application for redevelopment, whilst under consideration no rates would be payable. Upon the decision being granted and on the assumption it is approved the owner will have 6 months to commence development and a further two years to complete (unless otherwise agreed with the council). Failure to comply with the time limits will result in a charge to empty rates. In this example owners of industrial property in an industrial designated area will not be liable for empty property rates. This can be applied to all class uses. This proposal provides incentives to both owners and planning authorities to redevelop otherwise derelict areas.",
