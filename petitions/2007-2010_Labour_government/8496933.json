            "background": "It has unfortunately come to my notice that there are a great number of dodgy ringtone companies making a fortune out of unsuspecting mobile phone users, by offering free ringtones to them. \nThe obvious catch to this is that to get the free ringtone you automatically sign up for extortionate charges for paid for ringtones, which are automatically taken through the mobile phone suppliers billing.\nThis is not noticed until your mobile phone bill comes in and by then it is a huge amount of hassle to get the monies refunded, and maybe a county court summons eyc.\nThere are a lot of websites on the net complaining bitterly about this, and I believe it is time for the government to restrict these companies and put down specific laws to prohibit this type of scam, by forcing these companies to get a proper signed contract with people who do actually want new ringtones on their phones.\nThis may take longer for the people to receive the ringtones themselves, but it will also save the unsuspecting public from being charged for ringtones they do not know they have requested.",
