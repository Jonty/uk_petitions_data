            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This song by the heavily patriotic heavy metal band Judas Priest is an ideal example of what a national anthem should be, choosing to give its alliance to England rather than the Monarchy or Religion. Therefore, I feel it is appropriate as a modern national anthem, far more so than the outdated \"God Save the Queen\". England may still be considered a Protestant country; however, given the huge amount of cultural diversity it contains in this modern day, it seems inappropriate to gather together under the Christian God, who is declared to have appointed the Monarchy. Just as France's \"La Marseillaise\" or Italy's \"Il Canto Degli Italiani\" ally themselves to the countries in question, rather than a particular institution such as government or religion, so should our anthem.\n\nThe heavy metal band Judas Priest have always declared themselves firm patriots, lovers of England and everything it stands for. Therefore, \"The Red, White and Blue\" is a wonderful choice, declaring the citizens of Englands' love for their country.",
