            "background": "I have been a victim of an attack on my property in that the front wall equalling the boundary wall was shortened by my previous neighbour.  It was concealed by hedges and I was unaware of what he had done.  It happened in 1990.  I ran a new fence and lost a whole metre of land to next door.  They are arguing that the land belongs to them now.  My house is destroyed with them, it is a nightmare.  Adverse Posession Law must be changed - it actually encourages theft of peoples land.",
