            "background": "Some councils have recently started to cut down on spending and energy allowance by turning off street lights at night. Rather than turning off the street lights that make it easier and safer for people to walk around at night, the lights in building that are vacated at night could be turned off instead. Such buildings include council buildings, shops, banks, etc.\n\nThere is no reason why lights in these buildings need to be left on while the buildings are empty overnight - the total amount of energy used by the number of lights in such buildings up and down the country must be astronomical.\n\nPlease help cut Britain's carbon footprint by turning off unnecessary building lights.",
