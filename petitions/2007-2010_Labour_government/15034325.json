        "action": "Reallocate the provision of Radio Aids for deaf children and adults to the health service instead of education budgets.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Hearing aids and cochlear implants are important for deaf people, they are often inadequate in noisy places. Radio Aids are loaned by education services to school children, but must be set up with hearing aid (NHS), causing children to go back and forth (missing school) for problems with their systems. \n\nIn many areas Radio aids cannot be taken home, forcing parents to pay again (thousands of pounds), or exclude deaf children from non-school activities, cutting them off from social skills and language. The excuses do not hold up, as children manage to bring NHS hearing aids to school each day from home. \n\nAt 16 children must return Radio Aids and get new funding. For adults they are funded by Access to Work, but you must already have a job, and without this interview tool it is hard to get work. \n\nRadio Aids should be loaned on request by services all children and adults have access to, so they can use them at any time according to their communication support needs.",
