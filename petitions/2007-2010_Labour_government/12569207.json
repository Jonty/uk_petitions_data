            "background": "An action group has been formed by local residents, supported by local MP Shahid Malik, to save the Denby Dale nursery school, which could be closed or privatised as part of a review by Kirklees council. Parents are worried that if Denby Dale closes children will not have access to the same high-quality provision and that lower income families may not be able to find an alternative private provider\n\nPlease keep our nursery open as a council-run facility with high-quality pre-school teaching.\n\nThe recent Ofsted report said it was a good nursery with some outstanding features which provide an excellent stepping stone to primary school.\n\nWhy risk the devaluation of excellent facilities?\n\nLEARN NOT EARN",
