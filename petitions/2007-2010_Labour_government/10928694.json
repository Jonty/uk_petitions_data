            "background": "The rates should be capped at a maximum of 5% above The Bank of Englands base interest rate. This would allow credit card companies to remain competitive, but not at the misery and expense of the public who often have no alternative but to use credit cards to purchase items that are desperately needed. The rates should be introduced immediately and should be backdated.This would lessen the financial burden being faced by the public in our current economic climate whilst at the same time giving the public the opportunity to utilise borrowing at a sensible realistic interest rate.This in turn may help stimulate growth that is required to fend off a recession.This decision would favour both the rich and poor, and would be across all parties.The only cost would be to the credit card companies, but this surely is morally correct when most have benefited from the governments bail out.Some credit cards have interest rates of more than thirty per cent, whilst the majority are just below 20 per cent.This is so unfair during this 'credit crunch'.",
