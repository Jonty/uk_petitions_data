            "background": "My petition is to request an investigation into the way credit card companies operate.\n\nOver the past 6 months I have had financial difficulties due to being made redundant and not getting a P45 for 4 months, I was unable to take advantage of the payment protection on my card and as a result my account fell behind.\n\nNow I am working again I am trying to catch up but because credit card companies set payment due dates to the 15th of the month, your payments are always late, so they charge \u00a312, then because my account is overdrawn, I am charged another \u00a312. Now when I make payments I am also told it take 4 days to reach them, I have handled payments to other accounts before, both local and international, and I know it does not take 4 days for money to reach any account, so why do credit card companies claim that it takes 4 days.\n\nThis is unfair as we are being charged interest on our accounts already and these extra charges and the time it takes before companies allocate funds to your account is just an easy way to make more money from customers.",
