            "background": "No one - I repeat, no one - questions the need to order 232 multirole fighters. What I and other signatories ask you to do is to cancel the order for the remaining EF-2000s and order cheaper fighters, because one EF-2000 costs $137 million, and they've been delivered a decade later than American 5th generation fighters, and are not stealth. There are several alternatives, including (but not only) F-15s, F-22s, F-35s and Rafale fighters; whichever of them would be chosen would have been better and cheaper. EF-2000s are so expensive that the Italians cannot afford them anymore.",
