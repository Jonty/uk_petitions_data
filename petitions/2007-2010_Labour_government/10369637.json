        "background": "SMEs drive growth and innovation in the UK and often support schools and charities. Unfortunately hundreds of SMEs are being targeted by unfair sales practices and organised scams operating nationwide from within the UK. An example is rogue publishing houses, who attempt to deceive/coerce/harass SMEs into making payments for sponsored literature for schools, preying upon charitable intention. Such scams have been known since before 2005, but perpetrators are still able to harass and abuse employees/owners of SMEs with impunity for months after formal complaints about them have been made to police and trading standards.\n\nAction should be taken to ensure that the time between initial complaint and closure is reported and reduced. Nationwide coordination between police, Consumer Direct and trading standards should be made more transparent to complainants, and both the responsibility and duty to investigate/prosecute clearly delegated at operational and ministerial level.",
