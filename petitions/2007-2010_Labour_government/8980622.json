            "background": "Constant changes and reviews in what should be taught in schools and how it should be taught can make it very difficult for staff to keep up to date with current expectations. Teachers time can be taken up with familiarising themselves with new recommendations when they should be focusing on the children in their care and how best to provide for them. Due to a variety of reasons, new research etc. changes may truly be necessary, but they should be considered carefully and not implemented unless deemed crucial. Constant changes also create difficulties for student teachers.",
