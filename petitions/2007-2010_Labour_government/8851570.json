        "action": "Provide education for children with autism in specialist schools funded and controlled by central government as LEAs have not the finance nor the expertise.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The whole policy of inclusion for autism is floored, inclusion generally is now being frowned upon as the needs for specialist education is increasing far beyond LEAs available funding. The 'statutory requirement' of LEAs to provide suitable education is a nonsense and the government know this. Autism is a bigger threat to our society over the next 20 - 30 years than cancer or heart disease. With proper intervention now, there is a greater chance that people with autism can have a brighter future and be less of a burden on society in the future. Stop wasting money on phony wars and the Olympics and deal with the genuine problems many families are having to contend with. We are now governed by people in 'ivory towers' with generous expense accounts. Get out there and see what is going on around the country in the real world before it is too late.",
