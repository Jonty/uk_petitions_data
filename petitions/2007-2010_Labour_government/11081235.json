        "background": "Anyone who kills a person through driving with no license should get a mandatory manslaughter charge.\n\nTo determine a manslaughter charge it has to be determined that a pre-meditated act has occurred. \n\nThe legal and the dictionary definition of pre-meditated is: \"intentional, conscious, contrived, willful; deliberate & planned\" \n\nWhen a person gets in a car with no license, are they not doing all the above definitions, they are endangering every other road user/pedestrian, cyclist etc. with the full knowledge that they are not capable or licensed to drive, that they have no valid insurance and that they are breaking the law.\n\nEach person that gets pulled over for driving without a license should get a mandatory prison Sentence.\n\nWe are wanting your names to form a petition to send to the government. Too many people are getting killed on our roads, everyday in the papers and on the news you can count at least 5 deaths by dangerous drivers.\n\nLETS STOP IT NOW.",
