            "background": "Pubs are closing everywhere yet alcohol sales increase year on year - for the supermarket and local corner shop etc..\nThis is because pubs are charged so much more tax than shops, which funny enough happens to be the point of sale for teens. Take this away or make it harder for kids to get it. Fines for shop keepers selling alcohol to kids are far to low. Those convicted of selling to under age twice should be imprisoned.",
