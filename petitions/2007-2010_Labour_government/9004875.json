            "background": "The proposed new CO2 emissions based car tax is a crude and blunt instrument, penalising \u2018low mileage\u2019 4x4 drivers, performance cars and most cars over 2.0 litres.\n\nAll vehicles of all classes have a role to play and should not be prematurely scrapped, devalued or owners suffer losses on the used car market.  This is a cynical tax \u2013 and has nothing to do with \u2018green\u2019 issues, or encourage car drivers to use alternative means \u2013 it\u2019s really a tax on those who are proud to work for a living.\n\nLets take two \u2018used\u2019 cars worth about \u00a38K - a small car say a Fiat Grande Punto which produces 139 CO2 g/km, compared to a Nissan Terrano at 260 CO g/km \u2013 but if the Punto drives twice the distance they will pollute more \u2013 yet they will be paying \u00a3330 less in car tax \u2013 how mad is that!\n\nIf the tax was genuine for \u2018eco\u2019 reasons, then they would encouraging all drivers to do less driving in all vehicles and offer incentives \u2013 hitting us with a big stick is not the answer. We are calling on the Chancellor to think again regarding the 2009 tax banding of cars and offer rebates for low mileage users.",
