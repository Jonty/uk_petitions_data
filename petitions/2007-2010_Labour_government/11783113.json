        "background": "The government needs to take steps to ensure that sat nav systems are used safely and to prosecute drivers who obscure their vision with sat nav screens, thus endangering themselves and other road users.  The current trend to fix large sat nav screens on car windscreens is potentially more dangerous that the use of mobile phones whilst driving, but no action seems to be being taken to stop this dangerous practice",
