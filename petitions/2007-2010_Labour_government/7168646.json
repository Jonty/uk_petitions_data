            "background": "This country has lost too many brave personnel in the so called war on terror, without the Prime Minister bothering to attend the return of those who died carrying out their duty. This is not a petition about the wrongs and rights of going into Iraq and Afghanistan. It is to get the Prime Minister to recognise that many young men and women have lost their lives in these theatres of combat. This has left behind mourning parents, spouses and children. I am not aware of any occasion where the Prime Minister (either Gordon Brown or Tony Blair)has been in attendance at RAF Brize Norton to pay their respects to the fallen and their families when they are returned.\nIf you feel strongly about this please sign my petition.",
