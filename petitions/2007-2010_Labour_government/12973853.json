            "background": "It is patently obvious, and backed up by top brass, who have taken the unprecedented step of saying so in public, that our troops have been wilfully undersupplied by this liar Brown. it is plain they lack helicopters, and were sent 700 men not the 2000 required and asked for, yet he still has the gall to lie barefaced to the commons that they are perfectly adequately supplied. only the next day Jock Stirrup had to present a list of urgent requirements to 10 downing street direct. Brown is bankrupt both morally and in purse, and his glowing words of fullsome praise for our troops do not hide the fact he is a liar and his actions are to my mind treasonous to the brave armed forces  of this nation, whom he has starved of cash and equipment, directly causing unecessary fatalities and maimings, and he should be summarily charged with treason as a result.",
