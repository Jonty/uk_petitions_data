        "background": "Mesothelioma is a cancer that affects the external linings of the lungs and in the UK the condition is invariably caused by exposure to asbestos.  There is no cure and the condition is invariably fatal.  The current annual number of deaths due to mesothelioma is over 2000 and it is predicted to continue to rise to 2500 per annum by 2011 and 2015.  In the overwhelming majority of cases, the victim\u2019s exposure to asbestos dust has occurred in circumstances in which the employer would be liable to pay compensation.\n\nHowever in a high proportion of cases the employer responsible, has ceased trading.  Although it would be liable to pay compensation, compensation can only be obtained if the relevant insurer can be identified.  In a significant number of cases this is not possible.\n\nIf the requirements to retain insurance certificates is removed it will make it even more difficult for victims of mesothelioma and other occupational diseases to recover compensation from their former employers.",
