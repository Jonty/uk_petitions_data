            "background": "Local residents have been shocked by the closure of the Ice Experience in Norwich, Norfolk's only ice skating rink. Thousands of people from across Norfolk and Suffolk use this rink for recreational skating, educational skating, Ice Hockey and Ice Dancing. With the closure of the rink, the nearest ice skating facility is now two hours away. High school students were using the rink as part of their GCSE's, Norfolk\u2019s only Ice Hockey team the 'Norwich North Stars' now have no training ground for their constantly growing club, and British medal winning dance team Ice Candy are also left with no place to train plus many others. There are thousands of people across the county benefiting from this rink and after spending thousands of pounds on equipment and lessons, they are unable to use the facility. Please sign this petition to help show the government the need and benefit of an ice rink facility in Norwich.",
