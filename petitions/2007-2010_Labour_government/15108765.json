        "background": "The publication by Google Street view of pictures of every street and every home in the UK is an invasion of personal and communal privacy and should not be done without the consent of the occupants and local inhabitants.  It also presents a significant security risk insofar as it is now possible to scan a large number of locations very easily in order to assess ease of illegal access.  This petition calls on the government to enact legislation to make this kind of bulk, non-consensual information sharing in structured on-line information repositories illegal by default unless otherwise approved on a case by case basis in the courts.",
