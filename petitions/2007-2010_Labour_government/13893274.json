            "background": "This petition asks the PM to take action to ensure that the law on murder does not allow defendents to use their partner's infidelity as an excuse for killing them.  Historically, the law of provocation has permitted that \"she slept with someone else\" be available as a defence, allowing sympathetic sentencing to men who have killed their female partner.  \n\nThe government have tried to remove this dated excuse from the law and have stated that they are concerned to ensure that so-called \"honour\" killers should not be able to find sympathy in our courts.  \n\nThe House of Lords has amended the  Bill to remove this important clause.  We ask that the PM ensures that it is reinstated.",
