            "background": "In February this year, I married a girl from Peru.  After this, we were told by the UK Home Ofice that we needed to apply for a visa to allow her to remain in the country.  When we did this (at a cost of \u00a3335), the Home Office said that my wife didn't have a current valid visa snd would have to return to her country.  So, because of their error, she had to leave me.\n\nShe moved back 3 weeks ago and i have struggled to cope since then due to my health problems.  My wife will be away for what could be about a year whilst she saves enough money to return.",
