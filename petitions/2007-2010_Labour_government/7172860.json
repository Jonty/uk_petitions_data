            "background": "Supermarkets are part of the problem of global capatalism and as such have a huge negative impact on the environment.  Much discussion has been going on about the excessive packaging supermarkets use in the products they sell but very little seems to have happened; one of the main reasons we suspect is the negative effect this will have on their bottom lines.  We believe we need to forcibly shift the onus for the disposal of excessive packaging away from the consumer and onto the supermarkets who will then have to pay for its disposal.  By carrying out this course of action we believe the supermarkets will then bring influence to bear on their suppliers to be more eco-friendly and go some significant way to reducing the amount of waste currently going to landfill.",
