        "background": "We must obtain more INDEPENDANT data regarding the effectiveness of culling Badgers, specifically culled in an attempt to eradicate TB within cattle.  It seems to be clear that Badger's do spread TB within cattle, BUT in some cases, culling can INCREASE or simply MOVE the problem to another area.   We urge the Prime Minister to commission additional INDEPENDANT research and provide some form of financial settlement to our farming community, financed partly/fully by banning any MASS cull.  We also want to explore vaccinating our cattle and the consequence of badger removal on our DELICATE eco-system.  In short we demand that you the Prime Minister, must save our Badger's.",
