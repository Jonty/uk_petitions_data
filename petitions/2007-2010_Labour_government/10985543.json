I find the packaging nigh-on impossible to open without resorting to scissors, which unsurprisingly I don't always have with me. When it is opened, it is razor sharp and many serious hand injuries like tendon cuts have occured. \n\nThere are alternative anti-theft measures that can be used, and that are less harmful, and less frustrating.\n\nI implore the people of this country to beg of the Prime Minister to fix this horrid wrong.",
