Otherwise the birds will be frozen overnight. And for them to go into in the daytime aswell if they wish to. Also some extra food to eat and water available (unfrozen). The park or nature reserve could employ a park keeper or park ranger to make sure that all the ducks, swans and geese are all warm, dry and sheltered and comfortable for the night and provide the extra food and water made available to them. The birds could use this shelter all year round both day and night.",
