            "background": "Women who care for our Children, Disabled and Elderly have been underpaid for a number of decades. They have a right to equal pay. \n\nOur Councils have decided to lower the pay of Refuse Collectors, jobs mainly dominated by men.  These men have done nothing to deserve this, it is not their fault. \n\nThey have worked hard for a wage to provide for their families. At present, many hundreds are on strike trying to defend their livelihoods. \n\nIt is unjust to ask them to take pay cuts rather than increasing the pay of the Dinner Ladies, Carers and Cleaners employed in our schools, care and nursing homes. \n\nThey deserve better, as do the children, the disabled and elderly they look after. We deserve better. \n\nWe must not aspire to low pay this is against our traditions based on a belief in fairness and justice. It goes against our work ethic and what makes us great.  \n\nWe request the Prime Minister to consider our Petition and intervene to defend them - the men and women who deserve better pay but not lower pay.",
