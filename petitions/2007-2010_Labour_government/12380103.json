At birth she was given a grant from the government to open a Child Trust Fund. We have added to this fund at every opportunity, christmas/birthday money from relatives and friends, funds raised from selling old toys and clothes on ebay etc. THIS IS COMPLETELY HER MONEY FOR HER FUTURE,  and this year the value of her investments has gone down by \u00a3450.00 Why is it fair that a child aged under 5 should have her future penalised in such a way? How many other children's futures will be blighted by the mismanagement of the country's finances? Please petition the governement now to raise CTF values back to that which they stood at before the banking fiasco's and the resulting slump.",
