        "background": "Is it any wonder that we have a mountain of personal debt when we can open a bank account at 16 without having the slightest clue what it means to save? \n\nIt seems a no-brainer that personal finance lessons - such as how to manage debt, how mortgage and pensions work, the need for financial protection, how to save and invest your money \u2013 should be taught at an early age. In reality the way we learn is usually through bitter experience. It shouldn\u2019t be this way.\n\nThe place to start must be educating the next generation of Brits, before the shroud of financial mismanagement envelops the potential bankruptees of the future.\n\nSo, what is the current policy on personal finance education? Beyond a very vague statement from the department of education that \u201cthe subject is touched on\u201d, there is no coordinated plan of educational action for now or for the future.\n\nThis is a glaring hole in our education system and our economic future. At present there seems to be no will to fix it. We need personal finance lessons in schools. It\u2019s time to change the status quo.",
