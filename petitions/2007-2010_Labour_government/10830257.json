            "background": "At present free school meals are only available for children whose parent or parents work less than 16 hours a week.  This results in a situation where a parent working 15 hours a week earning up to \u00a315,575 can claim free school meals, but a parent working more than 16 hours, with income including tax credits of less than \u00a312,000, is unable to claim free school meals. Surely entitlement to free school meals should be based on income not the number of hours worked.",
