            "background": "This law needs to change. Why does someone, who has got behind the wheel of a car intoxicated, deserve to keep driving untill their appearnce in court?! There should be an instant BAN on anyone who has been arrested at the roadside for drink driving. Currently the law states that you can continue to drive up till your court appearence, then you will recieve a ban. A new law should be introduced to BAN drink drivers immediately, the length should then be determined by the court. In my eyes this should be a ban for life.",
