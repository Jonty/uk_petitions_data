        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Lorries often slow to around 40mph on hills on motorways thereby effectively blocking two lanes as they try to overtake each other and creating tail backs on the outside lane. By using, as in France, the hard shoulder in selected areas, such problems are overcome, especially on two lane motorways where in this county the whole road is blocked for miles.",
