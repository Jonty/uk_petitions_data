            "background": "In the past, the local authority or benevolent individuals built fountains to provide drinking water to the public. Nowadays there are just a handful in a few parks. Most do not work.\n\nPlease either encourage or enact legislation to get councils to install drinking fountains in parks, streets, villages and town centres.\n\nThis would ensure that we are all get the water we need, when we need it outside. This would make a significant contribution to the nation's health and well-being. It would significantly reduce the environmental degradation and the landfill/processing costs of plastic water bottles which, for most of us, are now the only source of drinking water when outside.",
