Everyone can be free to express an opinion, but when issuing a 'fact' that fact needs to be honest and a fair representation of how things really are to the best of their knowledge. Anyone can opt not to answer a question. Knowingly misleading the public is a serious matter, undermines confidence in our democracy and anyone found guilty of this should be barred from office.",
