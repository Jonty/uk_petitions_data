            "background": "Subject: Effectively Fixing the Global Financial System\n(My comments about the actual credit crunch)\n\nDear Mr. PM Brown,\n\nAt the heart of the actual financial system crisis are the structured financial products like Credit Default Swaps CDS, and other products which have lead to the actual credit trust \ndislocations worldwide.\nAs long the as financial institutions have to perform on these bad risk spreading contracts, the global financial system will continue to be severely compromised.\nThese contracts have been used to pass on bad credit risks to others parties creating the distrust banks have now with each other.\nThe only way to effectively finish the crisis is to have these contracts made illegal and void by the governments of the G-8 countries.\nDoing so will lead to the situation where every financial institution \non the globe becomes responsible again to bear their own risks instead of trying to insure these risks through third parties, as is the rule now.\n\nTHIS IS THE ONE AND ONLY RESET BUTTON TO THE CREDIT CRISIS!!!\n\nSincerely,\nCharles A. Amlinger\nEconomist, lic.rer.pol.\nSwitzerland",
