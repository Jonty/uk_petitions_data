            "background": "Recently we have heard that our school will be closed down and this is a very sad thing to happen as many generations have sent their children to this school. Being a current pupil I find it hard to think that soon people will not remember Rock Ferry High School, the teachers are amazing and can connect greatly with the pupils which is hard to find in other schools around this area. \nAt first we were told that we would be involved in the creation of a new high tech acadamy but I was recently informed that this would no longer happen and Rock Ferry High would be shut down and current pupils will have to join Park High. This means a huge loss of jobs and memories, a waste of education.",
