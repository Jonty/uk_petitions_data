            "background": "RAF Stafford was a non-flying Royal Air Force station in Stafford Staffordshire, England.\nIn April 2004 it was announced that units from RAF Stafford will be moved to RAF Wittering, effectively closing the base. However, in 2005, it emerged that the Army was considering using the base for the newly reformed 22 Signal Regiment. RAF Stafford officially ceased to be an RAF station on 31 March to become MOD Stafford in 2006.\nI would like to see Stafford Airfield re-opened for civil flying. This would be popualar with aviation enthusiasts and would boost tourism.",
