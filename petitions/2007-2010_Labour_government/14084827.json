        "background": "The National consesionary fare is set at 77p per person, and per journey for those who have a bus pass.\nSome councils have lower figures, which have resulted in these councils, including County Councils, having massive debts.\nFor example a 49p consession on a journey valued at a \u00a34 single journey leaves the respect bus operator with a debt of \u00a33.51p multiple figures , as number of journeys per calender month, will amass to \u00a3000, oooo debt to the bus company, resulting in service withdrawls in rural areas.",
