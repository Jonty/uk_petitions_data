        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is not fair for a student/learner to have to pay to resit their exams, when they have been called for jury duty, nor for them to wait up to 3 months - as in some cases - for the next available resits - which can often result in missed & failed applications.\n\nAs any full time professional is entitled to a compensation for loss of salary, so too should students, where the exact date and time of exams are planned well in advance, and without alternative.\n\nIn a situation where one is forced to pay or re-pay to learn, they are being punished, and not fulfilling a civic duty. A person with that weight on their shoulders is likely to hold a grudge, and as such not think and act as they would otherwise.\n\nGiven appropriate warning, and countersigned proof a student should be allowed to either waive their duty or be reimbursed for any costs.",
