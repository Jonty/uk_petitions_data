            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This petition is in response to the second phase of Ofcom\u2019s Public Service Broadcasting review and the regulator\u2019s agreement in principal that ITV can reduce its local and regional news commitments. Ofcom is currently consulting over these matters which would see regional television services cut from seventeen to nine.  If finally approved this would have serious consequences for communities in the UK. We believe that television news is an important feature of a democratic society and that there should be an effective alternative to the service provided by the BBC. We are calling on the government to ensure that its review of broadcasting in the UK sets out proposals which secure the future of local and regional news programming and that decisions made by Ofcom do not pre-empt this debate. This petition has been launched by the National Union of Journalists.",
