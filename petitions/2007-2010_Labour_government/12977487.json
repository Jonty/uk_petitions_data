None of them were orphaned !They were thrust into the hands of the most cruellest order of ' guardians'at Bindoon, Clontarf, Tardun and Castledare, sanctioned by the British Labour Govt of Clement Attlee. Many were to suicide following their release from these places. In 1948, a boat called the 'Empire Windrush'was to disembark 492 foreigners from Jamaica to settle here. And hence,in regular streams from Asia, Africa and elsewhere, immigrants with THEIR children were granted permission to reside in the land that the child emigrants were ejected from! I ask the PM to  APOLOGISE to those that were so badly dealt with by the British Labour Party and subsequent Govt's .    James.R.Green.",
