            "background": "Imagine 1 in 10 songs on the radio being an artist/band that have yet to have a UK top 20 album and are from the area that the radio station is broadcast. \n\nThere are thousands of bands in the UK that get no radio coverage and deserve some. Hearing a local band on the radio will increase the amounts of people going to their gigs and help the struggling pubs and venues. \n\nWe think it will do a lot more than this. It will create music scenes, a diversity in what each region listens to, bands that are well known and well heard in one area but are still very unkown in another. It will create communities again. \n\nWouldn't we like this? Wouldn't we like a slightly different scene from area to area? would this create a better community spirit? \n\nIf you think so, please sign here and spread the word. \n\nAlso, if you are or know anyone in a band there is a website recently launched hoping to get and create more gigs for you www.fillyourstage.com",
