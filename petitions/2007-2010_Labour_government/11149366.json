            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The four main themes of the march are:\n\n1. NO to a 3rd runway at Heathrow and further aviation expansion.\n2. NO new coal - no new coal power stations like Kingsnorth.\n3. NO to the expansion of agrofuels - with negative impacts on forests, the climate and world food supply.\n4. YES to a renewable energy revolution and the creation of green jobs.\n\nThis petition is to make the voices heard of all those who agree with these themes but who are unable (for financial, time or carbon footprint reasons, amongst others) to attend the march.  We all believe in the need for urgent action on local, national and international levels, and the prioritisation of the above themes in environmental debates.  Ignoring or understating any of them would prove catastrophic in our attempts to lower emissions to prevent runaway climate change and would undermine our position in international discussion (e.g., on the topic of development in China and other countries).  We stand in solidarity with the world's poorest and most vulnerable, and with future generations everywhere.  The UK led the way in the industrial revolution and now must lead the way in the Green Revolution.  The clock is ticking on the 100 months...",
