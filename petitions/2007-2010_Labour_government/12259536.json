Not really - many people are having their aspirations and dreams crushed by the social class system present in britain today, as it makes many lose hope and faith in what they can do by patronising them. The system benefits those with more money, and is therefore unfair on those who have less.\nSign this petition if you want to have a fairer society - and this can be achieved by making 'classism' a crime - just like racism.",
