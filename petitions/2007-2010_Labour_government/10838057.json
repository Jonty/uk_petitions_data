            "background": "I believe the way this country has gone to make all governmental (national and local) forms multi-lingual has increased the divide between native brits and immigrants. It says to immigrants \"don't bother to try to integrate into this country, because we want you to remain alien to our customs and language\".\n\nA multi-cultural society does not exist anywhere on this planet. Society can only thrive and grow on the basis of the underlying culture being dominent, and newcomers integrating by way of language and customs in public. If forms were only printed in English, then immigrants would be forced to learn English to claim benefits, and to integrate into the community. If we have pockets of foreign speaking peoples, then we will continue to have right-wing protests against immigration.",
