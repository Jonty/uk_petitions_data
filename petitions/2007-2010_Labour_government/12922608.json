I would also like everyone to know the postitives of living a healthy vegetarian lifestyle. \n\nCommercials on television will feature as part of my campaign.\n\nThe media advertisments will explain to people that we do not need to comsume meat as much as we do on a daily basis and could make our cities and towns better places if we increase the number of vegetarians/vegans living in our communities we could lower death rates and increase healthier minds and bodies of the people around us. \n\nBeing vegetarian Is the best thing I have ever done with my life and has opened my eyes to a whole new way of thinking. I think positivley and creatively. I am far more greatfull and respectful towards everyday things In my life. This is all because I realised the effects of being a daily comsumer of meat and decided to do something about it, from that I became a vegetarian.\n\nThank You For Listening To Me.\nMegan Millar (:",
