We allow these people to operate their extreme views. \n\nThis thing called political correctness has gone too far. Let us listen to all minorites in the United Kingdom and not just one in paticular.  \n\nI want the troops out of Afganistan and Iraq. Let us put a stop to more young life being taken away from their families. My own brother is joining up. Please answer my prayers and others out there.",
