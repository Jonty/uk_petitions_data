        "background": "Due to the deteriorating social structure in the UK,many people have become disrespecful of certain basic, citizen rights. The right to enjoy a sunny day (when it arrives !)in ones own garden, undisturbed by the actions of neighbours in relative peace & quiet is, we believe, a basic right.\nThe actions of some people involving the constant burning of rubbish & material can be very disturbing, particularly due to the amount of smoke generated by such bonfires.\nAs these people have a general disregard for anyone other than themselves, we believe that the only deterent is to introduce a penalty that is sufficiently harsh to act as a deterent. \nSuch crimes we believe, should therefore be punishable by death by public hanging.\nThe village of Lydlinch once had a public gallows sited next to the road, to act as a deterent to villains. We would like to see this ressurected to stop once and for all, the practice of lighting unnecessary bonfires.",
