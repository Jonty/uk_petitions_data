            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The recent efforts the government has made with regards to the reduction of VAT to 15% for 12 months is a good start for most of us, but more action is needed to really make a big difference. We need to think about here and now and if it means tax increases in years to come, so be it, if it means we can get the country working and get people back in work.. In Dubai the economy has gone skyward and created a new city in only a matter of a few years. We should follow this example. More money in peoples pockets, means more for inverting, stronger business', better wages and in turn more tax for the government. It makes sense...please support my petition...thank you",
