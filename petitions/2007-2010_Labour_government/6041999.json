        "background": "It is time that we stopped lorries from dangerously overtaking other lorries and causing congestion and possible road rage in other motorists who are being held up. Lorries have a speed limiter fitted that prevents them from going over 50 so why do they insist on sitting beside another lorry for miles trying to overtake. Lorries do not overtake on French roads and there is never a problem there.",
