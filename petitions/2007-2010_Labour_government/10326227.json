            "background": "Have you ever been invited to a debate held by Councils?  \n\nCouncils are making rules which are taking away peoples freedom, the very thing that our Grandfathers fought for and children died for.   My Grandfather was 12 when he went to war. \n\nI have been arguing with Manchester and Bolton Councils for over a year about new rules concerning dogs.  They have told me that it is too expensive to advertise and also that they don't have to involve experts regarding debates. Yet money is spend on unimportant things like plastic elephants in Bolton - \u00a330,000.  I have also told them that I want to take part in debates, but as yet have not been invited.\n\nI feel as though Victor Mildrew has taken charge of the country and I feel very stifled.  Democracy?\n\nIf you are like me and believe that this is wrong, that they should advertise (a free paper is delivered to homes, it could be put in there).  That debates should be available to everyone, and that decisions should be made with appropriate experts as would occur in any Court of the land.  Also that an independent party should oversea these debates and count up votes, then please sign my petition.",
