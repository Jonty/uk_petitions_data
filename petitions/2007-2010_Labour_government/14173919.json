        "background": "I am disgusted as a new parent that you can't use shop vouchers and receive points on first born baby milk,but you can use vouchers and receive points to buy second stage milk.\nIf your on a low income you get vouchers anyway from the government and shops don't refused them.\nIt doesn't make sense at all.\nSo parents are getting penalised not breast feeding their baby.\nWhat about the mothers that can't breast feed or sadly the mother has died in child birth.\nI hope you can see my point shops should accept vouchers and give out points because your not doing your kid any harm by feeding them formula milk.",
