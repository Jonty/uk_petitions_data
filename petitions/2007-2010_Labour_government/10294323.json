            "background": "It has recently come to my attention that a hormone weed killer (Aminopyralid)used by the agricultural industry to control broad leafed weeds in grassland stays active in plant matter even after it has been excreted by cattle and subsequently used unknowingly as a manure by gardeners. The resulting crops of Potatoes, Tomatoes, Peas, Beans, Carrots, Lettuce and others are failing to grow or at best stunting their growth.",
