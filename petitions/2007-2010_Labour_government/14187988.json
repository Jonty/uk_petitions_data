        "action": "stop forcing individuals and businesses to cut their CO2 emissions by artificially increasing energy costs in the unproven belief that such measures are essential to \"save the planet from catastrophe.\" These unnecessary increases in the cost of petrol, oil, electricity and gas will inevitably slow the UK and world economies down.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The theory that it is necessary to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 'save the world' is based primarily on output from computer models which, it is claimed, can predict future changes in global temperatures.  The models however are typically based on the model-makers preconceived opinions about how the various complex weather-determinants interact. None of these models have forecast the global cooling that has taken place since 1998.\n\nThose who are sceptical about computer forecasts predicting \"catastrophe\" through anthropogenic CO2 emissions are typically treated with arrogance by these forecasters.  That streak has now permeated through to the two most senior politicians concerned with enviromental decisions -- the current Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change who have labelled climate sceptics, whether scientists or concerned members of the public, as \"flat-earthers.\"",
