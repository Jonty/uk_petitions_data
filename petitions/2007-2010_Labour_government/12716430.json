            "background": "Those MP's who are announcing that they will not stand at the next election because of expenses concerns, are, I understand, doing that so that they gain substantial payments when they do eventually leave. Given the nature of their reasons for leaving, they should not be allowed to benefit financially through that. Many mp's demanded Fred Goodwin's pension should not be paid with the cry -let him sue. Perhaps the same should happen with those who have left under these circumstances i.e. announce that these end of term payments will not be made to people who have abused the expenses system and anybody who challenges will have to sue.",
