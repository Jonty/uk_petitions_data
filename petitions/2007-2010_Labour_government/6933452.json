            "background": "Chocolate is addictive, highly calorifically dense and so cheap that in UK supermarkets you can buy a entire days worth of calories as chocolate for a single pound. \n\nChocolate is inexpensive and the British public is gorging itself on it. We consume over 600,000 tonnes per year - four times more that the Italians.\n\nCurrent UK scientific consensus is that by 2050, 55% of the nation will be obese with the cost to the Health Service being 6.5Billion pounds a year where currently it is 1Billion pounds pa. A tax levy on chocolate which is a major contributor to the nations obesity would be a workable and effective way to reduce current over-consumption.\n\nas a footnote:\nWe consume around 60,000 calories of chocolate per head, per year. That equates to  around 30 days worth of calories from chocolate alone - before crisps, biscuits and fizzy drinks etc.",
