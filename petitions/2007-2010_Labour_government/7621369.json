        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Mr Haw's presence outside parliament is a vital reminder to those individuals who work inside the building of an illegal war that nobody wanted and serves no-one, save those with vested interests.\n\nInevitably, however, it must be recognised that Mr Haw is a human being, and as such cannot be expected to remain in situ twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week - he is entitled to time off just like anybody else; e.g. sickness, annual leave, etc.\n\nWe the undersigned hereby call on the Prime Minister to take up Mr Haw's duties personally whenever said Mr Haw requires some time away from his post.\n\nIncidentally, this e-petition has been drafted in all seriousness, although worded in a humorous way. I also intend it to make a very serious point about Government policy, with particular emphasis on the U.S.-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, and recent ominous sabre-rattling in Iran. An action such as this petition is calling for would enable Mr Brown to demonstrate to the country and the rest of the civilised world (and America) just where he and his Government stands on this extremely important issue. Unless he is content for us to be America's poodle, of course.",
