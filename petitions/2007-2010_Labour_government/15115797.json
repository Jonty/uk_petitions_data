        "background": "many sovereign states within the eu appear not to adhere to basic tenants of human rights/equal opportunities and often abuse  their own judicial infrastructures to the benefit of family, friends and associates.\nThis often occurs at the detriment of a third party, often being a british citizen who has relocated to an eu country to reside and pay into that countries economy either through business/taxes,property or skill.\nWhen these countries abuse the rights of british citizens blatantly and illegally, by use of a system which is not transparent , accountable or regulated independently, there should be an avenue open for obvious cases of corruption/nepotism to be addressed outside the normal agreed and accepted avenues, such as exhausting the appeals procedure of that country before being eligible to approach the eu court for breach of human rights and other rights.\nIn reality expat victims have not the time/money to follow these procedures resulting in action not being pursued.",
