We understand that the meaning of the word community is being run amok by individuals who do as they please when they please as evidenced by the murder of Miss Lancaster from Lancashire.    We demand the Prime Minister and the Government to provide the police with the means to tackle serious issues and restore the police force to a force that is respected through fear of consequence.  If individuals can't be educated to live by the law then there has to be a zero tolerance policy.  Stop giving out slaps on the wrist and rid our communities of sub-standard human beings.",

I'm fed up of reading about mindless violence by thugs who continue to fuel the decay of our wonderful nation.\n\nThere is a higher level of respect for the police in the United States.  Yes, some of it may be attributed to fear, but at least they do not procrastinate when it comes to criminal situations.\n\nThey are given the tools and the means to deal with breaches quickly.  The U.K. needs to start getting tough again and provide our police with the same no nonsense powers.  \n\nWhile not insinuating police officers should have guns, I am stating that it is time to act and regain the streets for the good citizens of the nation and their future offspring.  We have to stop the mindless violence and punish those not fit for society. \n\nTogether we can make a change.  If not for yourself, then for the countless victims of this untamed madness!",
