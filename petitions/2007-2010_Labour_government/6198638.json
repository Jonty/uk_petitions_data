        "background": "The current options on the census when it comes to faith are not adequete to express the religious beliefs of the United Kingdom. We would like to see a fairer method of calculating the numbers of each faith in the country. This has been a point of contention for the pagan community for some time and while we understand that it is next-to-impossible to include every world faith on a survey, paganism is far from one of the smallest faiths in this country. We request that either paganism be included amongst the active faiths in this country as an option, or a blank box be placed on the form for the individual to fill out their faith. Having to include your faith under 'other' is demeaning and does not serve the purpose.",
