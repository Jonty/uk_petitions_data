            "background": "It surely cannot be considered to be politically incorrect to bring Nit Nurses back into our schools to get on top of such a huge problem.  It's not against Human Rights.  Nits are gaining strength because they are not being dealt with sooner rather than later. So many of our children going back to school now are going to come out with nits.  It's time to go backwards a little in time & give in to what worked many years ago. Many parents are to busy or just don't notice or check their own childrens heads & this is how the problem of Nits has got out of control.",
