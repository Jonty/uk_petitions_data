            "action": "change the law which prevents innocent citizens, whose trial is not put before a jury because the judge deems the case to be flawed and frees them, from automatically regaining their rightful liberty and civil rights which should be afforded considering their truely innocent status.",

            "background": "At present, if a Judge sees that a miscarriage of justice has been carried out, or that a flawed case has been brought before him/her the judge is likely to 'throw the case out of Court' on day one of the trial and take it no further.\nConsequently the case is not brought before a jury and the case closed.\nThus the judge clears the innocent victim of the crime of which s/he has been falsely accused and sets her/him free. \nUnfortunately as the law stands this person remains legally guilty, as the case has not been tried by a jury.  \nIn effect the person remains \"guilty of having been falsely accused and arrested.\" Their names show up as a guilty person on legal databases.\nThis contradiction of law which only allows persons tried by jury to regain their true innocent status and regain their legal rights, would appear to be an injustice.\nWhen a person is freed after trial by jury, they are considered innocent and all rights automaticaaly returned to them. \nPlease upgrade the law to allow the same justice to be available to all innocent persons. Thank you",
