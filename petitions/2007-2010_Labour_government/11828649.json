        "background": "Constantly, on the news, people talk of how 'we', the public, will be expected pay back the money that has been handed out to banks in order for them to operate.\n\nWhy is there never any mention of THE BANKS paying back these sums of money? Why, when we have already paid that money once, are we, the taxpayer expected to repay these vast sums? In return, will the banks pay my tax bill? Will they loan me money because i am a small business owner, trying to make ends meet? Will they give me a year long payment holiday on my mortgage so i don't have to sell my home? No, they will not.",
