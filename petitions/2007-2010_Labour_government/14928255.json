            "background": "With Britain going through a Obesity crisis, & the NHS spending Billions of pounds to combat the issue.\nWhat's shocking though is the recent \"Change 4 life\" campaign seems in vein as the NHS has fast food chains right in there Hospitals.\n40 of 170 English NHS hospital trusts now has a branded fast food outlet. A further five are about to sign up chains. Most are cafes like Costa, Ritazza and Uppercrust. A few are takeaway joints such as Burger King!!.\n\nHow does the British public have a chance of fighting obesity in the future if our own NHS is selling us this High in fat/sugars/salt food which is causing the whole problem.\n\nPlease, get these chains out of our Hospitals & get healthy, Hospital ran \"cafes\" \"restaurants\" in it's place.\n\nThe independent did a review into what hospitals have these chains which you you can find on the internet.\n\nSo please, sign this petition and help.",
