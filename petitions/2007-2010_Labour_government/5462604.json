            "background": "The BBC currently produce a number of worthy comedy and sitcom programs for their bbc1 and bbc3 channels, but there is a lack of the type of classic sitcoms that we used to see throughout the 60s/70s/80s and early 1990s.\nWe need to see a comeback of programs along the lines of Porridge, are you being served, the good life, Bread, The young ones etc.\nThere is a wealth of briliant program writers out there who i am sure who would love to create new material but cant, due to the bbc's new approach to talent.\nLicense payers range in age from 18 to 80+ and currently i do not feel the bbc are catering fully for everyone.",
