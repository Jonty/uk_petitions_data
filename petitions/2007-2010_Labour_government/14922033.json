This radio station is very popular with Asians citizens of Britain who like to hear the music and news of the countries they come from. The presenters are extremely friendly. The quality of programmes is excellent. BBC Asian Network is heard not only in Britain on Internet by listeners overseas. Shutting down of BBC Asian Network will deprive British citizens of Asian origin of the programmes they enjoy.",
