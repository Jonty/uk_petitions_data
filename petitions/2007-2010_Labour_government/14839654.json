            "background": "Travelling on the M1 motorway at night returning to Leeds from London I was shocked when I saw large stretches of the motorway totally without any form of lighting or cats eye reflectors. \n\nThe use of full beam was not possible as road users on the opposite side were blinded and I could only see a small portion of the road which was illuminated by my headlights.\n\nThe combination of no cats eye reflectors and no lighting results in road users driving effectively blind at speeds up to 70mph! And then we wonder why there are numerous accidents and fatalities on our motorways every year?!",
