            "background": "There is growing resentment that all citizens of the UK will have to pay increased water bills and increased home insurance to provide for protection and reparation for properties built on flood plains and low-lying areas. If developers want the ease of building and high returns from flood plains it is only right they should be the ones to fund flood protection schemes rather those of us who chose to live in areas which are never likely to be affected by flooding. The contribution made would be a combination of a percentage of the sales price of the property together with a charge relevant to the ground area rendered inpermeable to rainwater.",
