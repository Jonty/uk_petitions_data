            "background": "The Israelis have a tried and tested security process for (El Al) flights, using many levels of personal behaviour psychological analysis, coupled with bomb-proof luggage examination enclosures within their airports.  This allows them safely to contain any incident or package without mass evacuation of the facility.  They have an impressive success rate and the costs of adopting such techniques would be far less than the proposed scanners.",
