            "background": "To setup an independent body to securely store and maintain all DNA records currently taken by the police during investigations.\nIt is important that we do not lose this valuable information but equally important that it should not be used for purposes which we are currently unaware.\nThe Police should be able to query the new DNA registrar and ask if a sample can be matched or not. \nThe DNA database should only contain the DNA record and a person\u2019s name or other unique identifier.\nIf a match is possible the Police should be provided with the unique identifier.\nThe new body will be totally responsible for the security and maintenance of these records.\n\nThis system will avoid records being held across the country with different Police Forces and remove the worry that people may have about security and the Police holding such information.\nThe system should explicitly not be used for medical or health screening services or any other service unconnected with maintaining law and order in the United Kingdom.",
