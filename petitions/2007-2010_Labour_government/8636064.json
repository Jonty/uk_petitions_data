            "background": "The teaching profession needs to be brought in line with other public sector providers in providing quality of service improvements. It cannot be equitable that teachers are paid a full annual salary for only approximately 9 months actual work, all the holidays taken into consideration. Can teachers not be utlised for community service work and voluntary work during schoolholiday periods?, or be paid pro-rata for the actual time they are at work, like other public sector employees!",
