            "background": "We as the working class get taken to the bank all angles but the biggest liberty is airlines and travel agents who think they have a right to raise the prices by on average a third during school holidays. On top of this if you take your children out of school they want to fine you this also is a liberty. When is some one going to stand in and get a average cost across the year instead of ripping the back out of us. This would be like Tesco raising there prices by on average a third at weekends as more people shop at weekends, would this be acceptable in this fair country where we have trading standards and apparently laws to stop big corperates taking advantage.",
