In fact I have sometimes made a comment after entering my name. I have noticed that another e-petition website has a comments section for people signing their petitions.\nAs I mentioned, some people make a comment without showing their names on this website. Perhaps it should be a requirement for people to give their names, then if they wish they could make a comment in the appropriate section.",
