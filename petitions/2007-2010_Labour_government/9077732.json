            "background": "A university has been given \u00a382,000 to examine the experiences of Irish homosexuals living in London. \nEssex University will study the lives of Irish lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people and why they choose to move to the city. \nThe project is being funded by the Economic and Social Research Council. \nA Taxpayers' Alliance spokesman said: \"It sounds like it's come straight out of a political correctness joke book. I'm lost for words.\"\n\nWhy are we funding the ridiculous study and who would honestly benefit from the results?\nI think the results of this petition will show the outrage of British Citizens with this waste of taxpayers money.",
