            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The United Kingdom currently gains automatic qualification to the Eurovision Song Contest due to being one of the four biggest financial contributors to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), without which the production of the Eurovision Song Contest would be impossible.\n\nIn recent years the United Kingdom\u2019s performances in the contest have been snubbed by most other European countries, receiving little or no points, despite some of the artists being musically respectable entries.\n\nIt is clear that the contest has become a political farce, with countries awarding points to neighbouring and \u201cbloc\u201d countries. Not only does the contest make a mockery of the snubbed musicians but it also allows the United Kingdom to be distanced even more from Europe.\n\nIt is evident from the results of the contest that it is no longer a musical contest and there seems little reason to fund the political charade that has become consistently disappointing and demoralising.\n\nTherefore we, the undersigned, propose the withdrawal of such a significant contribution to the EBU to warrant automatic qualification for the Eurovision song contest.",
