The Prime Minister must be concerned at the delay in his giving evidence to the Iraq Inquiry and the impression given of asymmetric treatment. He must also be concerned at the sclerotic effect that delay has on the UK\u2019s foreign and defence policy.\n\nHe was Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time of the Iraq War. The Blair government\u2019s progress was always dictated as much by the Chancellor\u2019s desire to fund certain policies as by the then Prime Minister\u2019s enthusiasm for that policy. This country would not have gone to War had the Treasury \u2013 in the person of the then Chancellor, Gordon Brown \u2013 not been prepared to pay for it.\n\nThe Prime Minister should be concerned that the Inquiry intends him to give evidence only after the forthcoming General Election. He must urge them to allow him to give evidence as soon as possible.",
