            "background": "Not necessarily financial. Male circumcision is unwanted, it is\n     needless destruction of a helpless babies sexual organ. In\n     many, if not all cases, it was performed, without asking, and\n     chance in the future to repair the damage that was done, both\n     physically and mentally. Indeed, how many of those who had it\n     done, would have chosen it, if they were  adults. Parents do\n     not have the right to give consent to surgically alter a baby,\n     indeed, playing with sex organs is child abuse, so why should\n     routine circumcision be different. There have been petitions to\n     ban this appalling practise, and not before time. However, what\n     about the victims of this abuse? So this petition calls to make\n     available surgery for genital reconstruction available to all\n     who ask for it.",
