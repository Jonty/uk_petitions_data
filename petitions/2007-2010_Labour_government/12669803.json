            "background": "I think that it is right and proper to permit the 23rd April, the day celebratory of the English, as a public holiday. I myself do not feel that said holiday would be unjust, racist (because this country is actually English, you know?), and/or crippling for industry.\n\nIt would enstill pride (not jingoism) but also awareness of what being English is all about. \n\nOverall, I doubt that Mr.Brown (arguably the worst Prime Minister of Modern Britain, I might add) shall pay any attention to this, however we're not here for not trying. \n\nSo come on guys and we can get St.George's Day made a Public Holiday!",
