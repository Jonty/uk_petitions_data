            "background": "At the moment the clocks are altered around the last week in October and then again the last week in March. This means we have dark evenings for around 4 months of the year. The proposal is to alter the clocks in mid November and then again in mid February. Darker evenings cause domestic consumers to use an extra 5% electricity, generating millions of tons of carbon dioxide. This change would also reduce the number of accidents involving children as most happen when they are on their way home from school rather than going to school. It should appease the people of Scotland who have argued that not changing the clocks would mean they would be in darkness until 10am in Mid Winter.\nThe final point is that presently there 7 weeks before Mid-Winters day and 11 weeks after, why is this?",
