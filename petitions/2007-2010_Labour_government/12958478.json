            "background": "Some Pastors open churches without any accountability. Some Pastors have serious personality disorders including narcisim and use persuasive mind control and fear to gain financially, always misleading the church members.  Members and their unfortunate children are not protected from this fraud, and join the church not knowing what it is. The serious damage is the mental health effects after membership has ceased. This is known widely in christian circles as \"spiritual abuse\". Protect the vunerable, by asking the Government to licence all Pastors. The Chruch of England has its own court but the evangelicals dont. These churches are everywhere in the UK and will use creches, schools, kids clubs to attract growth. If not for your own children, protect others, and dont judge the vunerable for getting involved. Sign this and ask No. 10 to licence those who see a church (under many guises) as an opportunity to make money.",
