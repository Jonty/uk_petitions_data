            "background": "In New Zealand, whistle blowing on waste and mismangement of public monies is achievable through their law which states that the protected disclosure act is about disclosure, in the public interest, of serious wrongdoing which includes;\n\nunlawful, corrupt or irregular use of public money or resources\n\nIf this law was passed in the UK we as a nation would no longer have to rely on audits but honest people within politics and government run departments to oversee efficiencies of the public purse.\n\nIllegitimate expense claims would become a thing of the past- those who are watched are less likely to commit an offence, what better than to have the eyes of your colleagues.",
