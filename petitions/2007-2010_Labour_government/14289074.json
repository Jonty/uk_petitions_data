        "background": "We request that the Government set up a working group to design an appropriate structure for equity markets. There are a series of measures being promulgated that will greatly affect how the UK\u2019s markets function, including the Prospectus Directive (for companies wanting to raise public money); the FSA's introduction of Standard Listings for UK companies; and confusing tax rules for CGT taper relief, SIPPs, VCTs, EIS and IHT relief. These could lead to a situation that significantly impairs the attractiveness of the UK\u2019s dedicated growth markets (AIM and PLUS-quoted), where smaller companies currently go to seek vital funds, at a time when banks are reluctant to lend to them.",
