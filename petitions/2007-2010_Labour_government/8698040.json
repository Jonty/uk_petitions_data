            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Before the liquids were limited to 100ml at airports, many passengers packed their own drinks in their hand luggage as they knew the drinks would be a rip off. Since the liquid limitations rules, I have noticed some airports have increased their prices of bottled water, fizzy drinks etc by 15-20%. This is disgusting. Passegners have no other option but to buy drinks at the airport (once passed passport control) or on the plane. It would be a lot fairer if airports and airplanes could sell their bottles of water etc at supermarket prices. Being in pressurized conditions does cause dehydration which causes DVT etc. Until the liquid restrictions are lifted (somehow I doubt this), drinks should not be charged at rip off prices.",
