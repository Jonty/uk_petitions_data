            "background": "The air ambulance as you are probably aware(or not)is funded totally by donations & charity events.\nIt is now time for the government to realise that this service needs full backing from No.10. The service they provide is second to none saving thousands of lives a year.Without this service & the hard work of all those involved then members of our families,friends & children could & would probably die.We need to recognise the service as an important part of the emergency services & petition this so called caring government to spend some of the money on a very worthwhile cause,a cause that the uk public fully backs & has had a say in where there tax money is spent.\nPlease sign this petition if you feel as strongly as i do.Hopefully you will never need the assistance of the air ambulance but as with anything in this life, You Never Know...  Thankyou",
