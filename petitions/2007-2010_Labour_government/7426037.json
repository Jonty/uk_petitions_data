            "background": "At the moment state compensation for loss of earnings whilst on jury service is limited (most severely during the first 2 weeks). These limits should be completely removed and replaced with loss of earnings compensation in full. Remember that the citizens earing the most money pay the most tax. Why should some jurors subsidise the judicial system in which solicitors, barristers and judges are earning more than they do.",
