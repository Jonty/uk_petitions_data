            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This petition is to have the VAT which is placed on motorcycle safety equipment reduced to zero. Currently all motorcycle safety equipment, that is helmets, gloves, boots, leather/Textile jackets/trousers/suits etc. are charged with 15% of VAT. \n\nShould the Prime Minister reduce the cost of any CE approved equipment by this 15% he will be encouraging motorcycle to invest in their safety by wearing more protective clothing. Where as it is the choice by some, and this petition does not seek to change the law on required apparel, to wear little more protective than a helmet , others face the financial constraints of not being ale to afford good safety equipment. \n\nThis change will help the government move towards its target of reducing serious injury and death to motorcyclists by actively encouraging the use of CE approved equipment. The reduction in VAT revenue is negligible to the financial cost sayings to both health services and emotional cost to families.\n\nProtect our skin Prime Minister.",
