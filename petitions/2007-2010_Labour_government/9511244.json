        "action": "Stop paying benefits to single non working teenage mums",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I believe that child benefits should not be given to young teenage mothers who don't work. In this day and age, having a baby is a CHOICE - but many young teenage mums try to get pregnant because they know it will get them a council house and benfits etc, so there is no deterrant for teenagers to become Mothers since it seems easier to them than getting a job or finishing school. I want the prime minister to award child benefits to parents who have waited until the right time but had a change of circumstances:e.g divorce meaning a lesser income, death of a partner, loss of job after child is born etc.\nIn conclusion, why should the taxpaying British be paying for teenage mothers who have never had any desire to work and will never stop sponging off the system, we dont get to sit at home all day - so why should we pay for them to do it?\nThis petition refers only to the practise of giving benefits to teenage mothers, it is not about the benefits given to more mature parents.",
