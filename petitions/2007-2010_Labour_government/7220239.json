            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Seven years ago, There were fuel protests and strikes to try and encourage the government to reduce or freeze fuel duty. This worked.......to an extent - Fuel duty was frozen. But prices continued to rise due to decreased output by OPEC, the growth of China and India and the global economy in general.\n\nToday we are seeing forecourt prices as high as \u00a31.19 a litre for diesel and petrol based fuels. This cannot go on. People are being priced off the road, families on low incomes cannot affaord to run a car, hauliers are going bankrupt and there is no real incentive to use public transport - high fares, poor service, overcrowding.\n\nThis petition is for everyone who believes that the current tax rate on fuel is too high (Fuel duty AND VAT on top of that). Therefore I petition the prime minister to reduce the fuel duty for road going vehicles and to bring the UK duty inline with that of the rest of the EU.",
