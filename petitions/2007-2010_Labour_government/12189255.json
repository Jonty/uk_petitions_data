        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Venues and ticket companies often do not publish the face value of tickets, or the various fees they intend to charge for tickets, until said tickets actually go on sale. Given the speed at which popular events can sell out, this does not give people a chance to make a fully informed decision prior to the tickets going on sale. It can also in the case of popular events deny them the chance to look at different ticket merchants to compare the fees charged. It is my opinion that this is unfair and results in many people paying more than they might have to if they had the ability to shop around.\n\nI am also in favour of a cap on the fees that can be charged; there is already another petition for this on the site, please find and sign it.",
