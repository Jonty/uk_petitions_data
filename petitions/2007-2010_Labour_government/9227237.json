        "background": "By abolishing the duty on fuel Britain will be able to get back to work and be more competitive in the marketplace.\nCheaper fuel = cheaper goods which will lead to increased spending and stave off any lingering fears of recession. This should come into force as soon as possible with a 20% rise in road tax and 10% rise in insurance to offset it.",
