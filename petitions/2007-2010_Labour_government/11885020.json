It has created another army of wasteful pen-pushers to create this legislation, yet another army to creat the report itself and presumably another army to check the h.i.p. has been created as demanded. The whole process is total RUBBISH and does not speed up the transaction time by one second as the purchasers solicitor has to repeat the crucial parts for his and his clients protection. So does the source of finance! REVOKE NOW!.",
