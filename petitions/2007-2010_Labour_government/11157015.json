            "background": "We, the undersigned, call on the Government to reconsider the impending price increases that will hit hardworking commuters and taxpayers from January 2009.\n\nAt a time when the economy is in recession, it is the job of Government to try and ensure people stay in their jobs and in their homes. By allowing Southeastern to raise their prices by an inflation-busting 8% (average), they will be hitting those who need money in their pockets the most. This deal (RPI +3%) was agreed in 2006 during the boom. We are now in the bust, and this deal will effectively cancel out any savings or incentives announced in the Chancellor's recent emergency budget.\n\nTo end, we ask that the formula for this fare increase is recalculated on an urgent basis, and that any rise imposed in January 2009 be in line with current inflation whilst renegotiations take place.\n\nWe want FAIR FARES ON SOUTHEASTERN!",
