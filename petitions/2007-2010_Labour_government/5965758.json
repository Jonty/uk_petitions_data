It is my contention that no matter how clean hospital floors are kept -every visitor is bringing into the buildings all kinds of filth on the bottoms of their shoes. I would like to see a check point at each entrance at which everyone has the bottoms of their shoes disinfected and are then issued with temp.sterile plastic overshoes.",
