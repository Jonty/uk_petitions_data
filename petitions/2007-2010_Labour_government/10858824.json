            "background": "The EU referendum of 1975 is still being used as a loophole by the government to justify making EU decisions on behalf of the country, despite being 30 years out of date, and hence not necessarily the will of the country today. I believe the best way to combat this sort of abuse is to place a 5 or 10 year limit on how long the results of a given referendum remain valid. After the expiry of the given time, a further referendum would be called for on any action taken to modify the EU/UK relationship. Hence this would ensure that any such action taken would reflect the will of at least most of the current voting population.",
