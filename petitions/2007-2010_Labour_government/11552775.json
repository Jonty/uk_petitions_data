        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Under the current system, a litre of petrol has levels of duty placed on it and then VAT is applied like any other good. This means that in effect people are paying tax on tax. This is unjust and unfair. Instead the duty should be applied after the VAT is applied to the undutied petrol. This should reduce the price of petrol by quite a lot.",
