A stand should be made against consumerism, and this can start by making the showing of adverts illegal. There would be licenced adverts on channels which only aired adverts. If someone wanted to buy something, they would choose to watch the advert for the product. If this brings leads to the closure of commercial station, so be it. Better this way, than having the american model of no quality TV, just lots of adverts, urging immoral, distasteful and ultimately dangerous consumerism.",
