        "action": "stop the intended switch off of analogue (VHF) radio because the alternative DAB option currently promoted by the BBC offers significantly inferior listening quality. The BBC continues to  transmit incorrect  propoganda promoting their DAB option which is inferior to other digital options available, including what is available in other European Countries. Overall, the BBC DAB is inferior to VHF sound quality. We do not need an increase in quantity of channels. Cable and satalite television has shown that more options only brings more inferior quality. We want an increase in sound quality on currently available VHF channels.  VHF is the way to go for quality even if band width is limited. Less is more in this case.",
