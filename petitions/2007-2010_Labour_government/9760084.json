            "background": "Many Taxi operators are contracted by local councils to take children, special needs and disabled adults etc to schools and centres.  The FUEL pricing at present represents an increase of over 38% on daily running costs for such contracts, yet local councils think that an average 3% increase on what you get paid is enough.\nIn August when my own contract began with my local council I was paying 13p per mile (120miles), now in June I am paying 19p/mile. This represents a daily increase of nearly \u00a38.00 on fuel, yet my council say its basically not their problem. \nWELL I THINK IT IS THEIR PROBLEM and I urge all taxi operators to suppoer this.",
