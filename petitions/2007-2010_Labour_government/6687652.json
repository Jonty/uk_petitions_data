        "background": "Terrorism has changed our lives forever.  Extremist groups attack others in the name of innocents.\nIf you think that Islam/Muslims are to blame for the terrorist actions then you are wrong.\nExtremist groups are found in all religions, Judaism, Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, etc.\nThere are many misconceptions with Islam, did you know that Muslim believe in Jesus?  Or that it is unlawful in Islam to kill/hurt someone? Or that Islam promotes peace?  Or that less than 20% of Muslims are Arabic? Or that the Qur'an states men and women are considered equal?\nRemember we all need to live in this world together, no-one owns the Earth and we should all co-exist in peace.  There are people who will challenge that, there always have been.\nWhat I'm asking is you give others a chance, learn about what you hate and at least respect those who don't.\nWhat I am asking of you by signing this petition is to at least learn about a faith before you judge the group as a whole.\n\nBy the way, I'm Christian.",
