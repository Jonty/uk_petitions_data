        "action": "do more to push the U.S goverment to recognize the detainees in Guantanamo Bay as either prisoners of war under the third geneva convention or as civilian detainees under the fourth geneva convention and to afford any such detainee the basic humane protection agreed in the convention",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "many detainees have been released without charge from Guantanamo Bay, it is possible that innocent people have been held against there will and have not been given a \"status\" such as a civilian or prisoner of war- under the geneva convention. I believe any such person should be protected from possible inhumane treatment whilst being held at Guantanamo Bay. Recognition under the geneva convention is a basic right of anyone in an armed conflict to be protected from inhumane treatment once they have been captured.Many of us in this country would be appalled if a British combatant was captured and wasnt protected under the geneva convention so why should'nt our government do more to protect others? wether an individual is an allie or an enemy makes no difference whatsover, the geneva convention applies to EVERYONE WHO IS CAPTURED during an armed conflict.",
