            "background": "A fundamental feature of democracy is that representatives of the electorate have to be elected. \n\nA recent example is that of Lord Mandelson who has not been elected and is a Government appointed Lord. Quite what CV Peter Mandelson has to be appointed as the Business Secretary is unclear. \n\nThis petition calls for all unelected peers and other ministers appointed by government to be immediately removed from office and replaced by MP's who have faced the UK electorate and won their seat in the Houses of Parliament - the birthplace of democracy. \n\nIf Peers are elected in the future - they will of course have won the democratic mandate to be appointed to govenment positions. But until that time no unelected person must represent the British people.",
