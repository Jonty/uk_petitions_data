Through his disloyal actions he cost millions of men in the UK something to do in the summer meaning they will have to spend more time with their families.  In addition there will be less special offers on beer.  This is clearly a reprehensible situation and affirmative action must be taken immediately.  Through the deterrent of execution, for what has been a foul act of treason, justice would be served.",
