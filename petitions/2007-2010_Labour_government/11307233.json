However, only a complete arms embargo will send a clear message to Israel that this government will not accept the prolonged armed conflict which is aggravating existing tensions in the region.\n \nAdditionally this will ensure that the government adheres to the UK Export Control Act of 2002 and the EU \u201cconsolidated criteria\u201d governing the export of military equipment.\n \nEqually such a stance would set a precedent showing that this government is committed to establishing peace in the region. This precedent will have a far reaching impact in terms of marginalising the ideologies of radical extremist groups.",
