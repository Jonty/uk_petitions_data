This sum prevents local independent candidates from standing for Elected Mayor but allows anyone rich enough to be able to lose such a sum still to stand. It also biasts the election towards political parties and away from independent candidates. No other local government elected position carries a deposit so why should the Elected Mayor?\nNB: This does not include the Elected Mayor of London.",
