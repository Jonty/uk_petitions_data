            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "A joint UK/US programme to build a fleet of Integral Fast Reactors that use pyro-processed nuclear waste for fuel would safely solve the problem of disposing of nuclear waste. Pyro-processing is a method of extracting the radioactive actinides from existing nuclear waste. The actinides are then burnt up in a fast reactor. The remaining waste is safe to handle after only 300 years of storage. The plutonium is not separated from the rest of the actinides so the process cannot be used to make nuclear weapons. The Integral Fast Reactor has an inherent safety advantage over existing nuclear reactors in that its reactivity reduces as it becomes hotter.\n\nMore widespread knowledge of this technology would make nuclear power more acceptable to the public thereby making it possible to massively ramp up the UK's reliance on nuclear power. This would enable the UK to meet its long-term carbon emission targets and to achieve a secure energy supply.",
