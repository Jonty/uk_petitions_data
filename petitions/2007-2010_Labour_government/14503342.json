This has been a COMPULSORY(!!) subject since Sept 2008 ( at the same time Winston Churchill was removed) . It\u2019s inclusion is supposedly justified  by experts who claim  that looking at \u2018mysteries\u2019 in history  where children have to think  about what could have happened helps to develop  analytical processes. There are plenty of far less puerile examples of \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios without having to teach and titillate young teenagers  about the mutilation of prostitutes . \n\nIF you wish to see examples of the fairly repellent teaching resources that are deemed appropriate for this aspect of your childs education simply google \"National Curriculum Ripper\" some of the material is billed as  \u201cgruesome and disturbing Power Point presentation -not for the squeamish- ideal for average year 10-11 pupils.\u201d These presentations include photos of the murdered womens faces and descriptions of the mutilations.",
