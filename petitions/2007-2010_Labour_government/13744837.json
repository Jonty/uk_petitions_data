I can not express how hurtful this is as it is untrue and completely against Christianity. I do not get how this song has been allowed to play because if this song was against Muslin then there would be no way it would be allowed to play. I have sadly had to listen to people singing only this 'catchy' bit which 'happens' to be at the end of the song. As a Christian it is my life mission to make everyone believe that Jesus did die for you i am deeply saddened by this song and hates how Robbie, a respected artist has chosen to sing this song and how the British public could begin to believe what he says!",
