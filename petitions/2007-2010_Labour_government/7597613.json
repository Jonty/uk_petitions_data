        "background": "Honours should not be given to donors, supporters, activists or party workers for their services to their choice of political party. This will mean that cash for honours would no longer be relevant. Honours should be given to those that earn and deserve them and not to people purely for being famous actors, singers, sportsmen and women or supporters of a political party. They should only be given to people who work tirelessly for others in the community without political affiliation, to those who have shown courage in the face of adversity and those whose dedication to public service has benefited the majority. All honours to be granted only to British citizens or those who have become British citizens by naturalisation after a minimum period of ten years. Non residents may be acknowledged for good works but not given titles that allow access to the House of Lords. Existing title holders who were granted honours for services to their political parties should have them removed.",
