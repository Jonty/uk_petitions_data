A 3 line whip is a strict instruction to attend and vote in a particular way or suffer the consequences! This is not democratic and may not be the view of the \u201cpeople\u201d the MP\u2019s are elected to parliament to represent.\n\nMP\u2019s should be allowed to vote how the constituents want, not to \u201ctoe\u201d the party line. A similar result can be achieved by simply changing the rules to make all MP\u2019s attend a vote and not allowing party politics to interfere and let the elected representative\u2019s vote how the \u201cPeople\u201d want!\n\nAbolish this nonsense.\n\nIs that not democratic?",
