Working out VAT on Disabled Facilities Grant works is a minefield, with some items such as ramps and bathrooms being exempt, while other essential items such as accessible kitchens and bedrooms are not exempt.  Charging VAT on these works can reduce the available grant by up to 17.5% (reducing the current maximum grant of \u00a330000.00 to \u00a324750.00).",
