How many times do the public have to hear owners say,\u2019 it\u2019s all right, he's ok', before attacking children, dogs or any moving wildlife. Why doesn't the government make it compulsory to keep these animals on a lead. Either ban them, bring back the dog licence or the next time someone rings the police get the police to act quickly if a complaint has been made.",
