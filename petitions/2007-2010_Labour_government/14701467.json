        "background": "The Inland Revenue are beseiging Directors of Community Event Organisations with paperwork demanading evidence of earnings from people who kindly offer their time as a volunteer for free. The Inland Revenue Collectors have been told by the Government to target all Directors making inflamatory accusations that people do not work for nothing in this day and age. This kind of insiduous,malicious action is causing serious problems recruiting volunteers with organisational skills- they do not want to be bombarded with paperwork generated by Inland Revenue.What are they trying to achieve by taking this action- typical of a Nanny State Attitude.",
