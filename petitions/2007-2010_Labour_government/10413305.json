He is so out of touch with most people's income and expenditure. Its very sad for him but even sadder for the old folks on a fixed income(ALSO FOR THE AVERAGE WAGE EARNER). He can't sell any more gold, he can't take any more of our pension money, he has no more north sea oil of any quantity, his luck has run out, and the country is fast running out of money. The banks have no faith in him or his party. Come on its election time!",
