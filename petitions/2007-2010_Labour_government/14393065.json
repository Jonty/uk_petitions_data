            "background": "The United Kingdom's native bluebells are being killed off by Spanish varieties and need the help of gardeners to survive, according to wildflower experts. \n\nWe the undersigned call for support in controlling the spread of the Spanish bluebell, which has light-blue flowers and little scent. \n\nIt has been breeding with our native variety, which is a deep violet blue and has a strong, sweet scent. It is estimated that a third of all bluebells in the UK are either the Spanish or hybrid varieties. \n\nUnless something is done soon, our heritage will be wiped away within a matter of years. Outlawing the sale of Spanish Bluebells would be a start followed by the extermination of the non-native species from UK gardens.",
