        "background": "When the Lisbon Treaty is fully ratified it will give the European Union an enormous amount of power and influence over our lives, no British Government will ever be able to fully govern the United Kingdom again.  \n\nI am petitioning for our Government, rather than continue with the Lisbon Treaty which will be a self amending treaty allowing the EU to make policy and deals for us internationally without consultation, to begin negotiations for Britain\u2019s amicable exit from the EU.\n\nSuch a move would once again place Britain on the world stage as it would be fully able to make its own policies and agree its own trade deals without having to refer to the EU \u2013 which will increasingly take over these parts of our national sovereignty.",
