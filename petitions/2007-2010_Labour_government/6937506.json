The school has satisfactory numbers which are rising compared to surrounding schools.The quality of education and spiritual provision is excellent.There most recent Ofsted report was outstanding, compared to other schools in the area.\nThe school plays a large part in the community spirit and without this school many families would  miss the dedication of the staff towards  education for our children , in developing their futures as adult's .This school has many memories for parents/grandparents as generations have attended this school for years .\nI have chosen to educate my children in a highly regarded school which successfully serves our community and this option should not be taken away from me/us.\nRather than considering closure these reasons should be embraced .",
