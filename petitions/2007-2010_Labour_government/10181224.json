            "background": "As a self harmer I found it really easy to buy items like Scissors, Nail Clippers and Needles to Self Harm and they cost next to nothing to buy e.g nail clippers cost as little as 49p and they also come in little kits for girls of over 3 which are so sharp.I feel that an age limit of 16 (or over this age) would be good as these are so dangerous to certain people. so that people under this age should not buy or have these items, as there are just as dangerous in a way of using a knife ect and we cant buy them until we are 18(over. people need to be warned the dangers of these simple things.I harmed myself badly with these items so I have nasty scars.",
