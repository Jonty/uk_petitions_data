            "background": "The government should make an act of parliament that requires every young person to join a cadet force organisation or other youth organisation that provides and teaches a multitude of skills/sport/Duke of Edinburgh's Award/discipline etc. Cadet and other similiar youth organistions are located in some schools or attached to schools.I am sure that if the government spearheaded such a campaign there would be no shortage of volunteers - I for one would be first up there; being an ex member of the Air Training Corps and part time youth worker.\nIf the government introduced a compulsory scheme, I am certain that youth crime would drop significantly - these type of youth organisations bring out the best in young people at the same time teaching them discipline respect and well placed for a successfull career in what ever they choose. Employees would have a much higher calibre of young people with the right skills and discipline to join their organisation(s)",
