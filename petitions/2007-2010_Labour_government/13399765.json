The Baby Bond and child allowance is currently given to wealthy people who are saving it for university educating their children.  If they want children, they should pay for them.  By dropping the ridiculous Baby Bond, and means-testing child allowance, millions of pounds would be saved to go to the NHS or other worthy causes.",
