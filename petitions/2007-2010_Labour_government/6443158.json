            "background": "Anti social behaviour such as noise nuisance, criminal damage/vandalism, threatening/abusive behaviour and drug/alcohol abuse is a very serious problem in most UK towns and cities.\n\nUnfortunately, most social housing providers seem content to simply ignore the problem rather than take steps to evict the nuisance tenants. As such I propose a new solution.\n\nSocial housing providers should allocate one area of a town or city as being an anti social area. They should then relocate any tenant who has been convicted or successfully prosecuted for an anti social behaviour offence to this area.\n\nAs a result, offenders would be forced to put up with behaviour similar to their own and this might just teach them the error of they ways. As anti social behaviour is limited to just one area all other areas of the towns should then be free of this nuisance",
