            "background": "The petition referred to says that a percentage of savings could be circulated to pay wages and benefits; no mention of how to fund any other Government expenditure.  There was also no mention of the fact that people's savings belong to THEM so that the consent of each individual would have to be obtained; how likely is it that most would give this consent?  This is a hare-brained petition which I think is just intended as an anti-tax petition with no thought as to how Government services would be funded without taxation.",
