It is not right that valuable NHS resources and money are spent on irresponsible individuals who get excessively drunk then expect the NHS to pay. EVERY person in this country knows the effects of alcohol and many of us get drunk on occasions myself included BUT not so drunk they need hospital treatment. \nI propose that if a person requires hospital treatment as a direct result of excessive drinking then they should have to pay towards if not all the costs of their treatment. This would be a major deterrent for binge drinking a major problem in the country.\nThis does not included anyone with a genuine problem with drink however they must be made to take treatment for being an alcoholic or pay cost.",
