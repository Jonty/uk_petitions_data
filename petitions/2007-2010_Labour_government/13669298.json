            "background": "The government initiated a review into the prescribing of antipsychotic drugs to dementia patients over a year ago following claims of misuse but has yet to publish a report.\n\nEarlier this year, an Alzheimer\u2019s Research Trust-funded study published in Lancet Neurology found that antipsychotic drugs double the risk of death for many patients if used over a three year period. As many as 100,000 people with dementia are routinely prescribed antipsychotics in UK care homes.\n\nThe following organizations are calling for the publication of the government\u2019s report:\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s Society; Alzheimer\u2019s Research Trust; All Party Parliamentary Group on Dementia; Barchester Healthcare; Age Concern and Help the Aged; English Community Care Association; Carers UK; Local Government Association Community Wellbeing Board; Counsel and Care; UNISON; National Care Forum.",
