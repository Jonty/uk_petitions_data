            "background": "In a recent petition for the legalisation of wild camping in England and Wales the government responded:\n\n\"This Government appreciates the potential benefits of wild camping in England and its attractiveness to campers who already have the opportunity to camp in the wild in Scotland. \n\n\"The Land Reform Act in Scotland allows for wild camping, but the land issues and the legislation in England are somewhat different. The introduction of wild camping in England would be a controversial issue, which would require both significant consultation and legislative change.\"\n\nThis however sidesteps the issue by ommitting Wales and just says \"this is too much work\". Can we have an answer on that rather than sidestepping it?",
