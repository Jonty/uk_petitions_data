            "background": "A recommendation that Landlords/Agents & Living-In Landlords all require a license to conduct such an activity. All Landlords will need to uphold certain standards \"Citizen's Charter\" with the objective to protect the Health & Safety and Welfare of their tenants.  In a country where you need a license to fish, to watch tv, to drive, it is only correct to have Landlords/Agents fulfill standards to obtain a license.  One license will be required per property. This will also be good for tax purposes and finally criminal action should be taken against landlords who abstain from obtaining such a license.",
