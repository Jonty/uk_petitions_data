            "background": "Over the last 10 years, Merton Local Education Authority has sold off schools and playing fields, raising \u00a318 million.\n\nThe local authorities now find themselves substantially short of primary school places and wish to proceed with a low-cost remedy, intending to \u2018supersize\u2019 Wimbledon Chase Primary School, as well as expand a number of other good schools in the area, regardless of the consequences to long-term educational standards.\n\nWimbledon Chase would become an intimidating institution with more than 700 children, too large a school for young children (some of whom are only 3 or 4 years old), detrimental for their education, their wellbeing and, with the planned loss of playing fields, their health.\n\nIncreased traffic would create a local black spot and gridlock on a daily basis in the surrounding conservation area.\n\nThere has been no effective consultation by Merton LEA to the proposed expansion, with local residents not informed of the plans, and the objections of concerned parents simply ignored.\n\nMerton LEA\u2019s current plans ignore the interests of children and local residents and lack strategic direction.",
