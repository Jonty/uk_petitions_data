            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "There is no protection out there (apart from G'ment redundancy) for employees, when a company goes through a 90 day consultation period, goes into administration, and then gets bought on a pre-pack deal which includes not buying the debt. This protects the people left in the company and allows the company to carry on (so minimising job losses), but leaves the ones made redundant in an awful climate with potentially nothing. These people need more protection and rights than being offered at the moment. I suggest that if a company is bought after going into administration all employees (including those made redundant) are looked after foremost, as they are often the ones that have worked hard in creating the assets that are worth buying.",
