        "action": "scrap the present system of patronage whereby judges are appointed by their family, friends and colleagues, in favour of a system where all judges are elected having campaigned on a manifesto which made it clear how they would treat people found guilty of criminal and terrorist crimes in this country.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "For far too long our judges have used their privileged position to act politically and without paying any cognizance to the wishes of the people who pay them.  If judges campaign on a manifesto and then fail to keep to that manifesto they can be sacked.  It is abhorrent that people who get a job through patronage end up in a position where they cannot be sacked or otherwise removed regardless of their politicking or failure to protect the people.",
