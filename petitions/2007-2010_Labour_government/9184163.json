            "background": "For far too long our judges have used their privileged position to act politically and without paying any cognizance to the wishes of the people who pay them.  If judges campaign on a manifesto and then fail to keep to that manifesto they can be sacked.  It is abhorrent that people who get a job through patronage end up in a position where they cannot be sacked or otherwise removed regardless of their politicking or failure to protect the people.",
