        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Non-contributory means what it says: that these benefits are not paid for by contributions so no one needs to feel that they've paid for something they're not getting.  The sort of benefits I have in mind are the Child Trust Fund payments, Child Benefit, and the Winter Fuel Payment.  Also concessions for over-60s such as free prescriptions etc.  I feel, very strongly indeed, that all such benefits should be paid only on grounds of income rather than age; in spite of the fact that I myself am over 60.  We are in a recession; I would agree, strongly, that this is not the responsibility of ordinary people but this would be one way of helping the situation even if only in a small way.",
