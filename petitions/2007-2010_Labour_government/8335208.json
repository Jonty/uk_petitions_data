        "background": "successive governments since Margaret Thatcher have promised \"the NHS is safe in our hands\" they are fibbing. They want to introduce private health care and so are maligning much of what health care professionals do- the recent bad press re GP's, MRSA and c-difficile for example. Now they are criticising midwives. government targets, reduction in beds, reduction in investment of staff. Whilst the boast is they are putting more money into the NHS it is not for the things which are needed.  The money is for IT, and inspectorates to ensure that targets are met.",
