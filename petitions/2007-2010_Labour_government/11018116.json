It called on him to get the Food Standards Agency to make it compulsory to clearly label palm oil if it's an ingredient.  Yes, they're making efforts to produce 'sustainable' palm oil. Fine. Label it as 'sustainable' on the packet, but do label it!\n\n This isn't supposed to be a forum where we express our views only to have them fobbed off with non-answers.  It's supposed to a means of letting those in government know what their employers want of them.",
