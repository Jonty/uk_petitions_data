            "background": "I, like many others feel that life sentencing is not made life, with possibilities for parole and such. Life should actually mean life and therefore must only be sentenced in the most severe of cases.\n\nIn those cases where life is not a suitable punishment I feel VERY strongly that those who deprive others of their HUMAN RIGHTS in the most extreme manner should have their HUMAN RIGHTS taken away.\n\nThis petition has been fueled by a story I have read about a father who BROKE HIS CHILDS BACK IN HALF and killed her - showing no remorse in court.\n\nDo we REALLY think that this sort of person should be allowed to live?",
