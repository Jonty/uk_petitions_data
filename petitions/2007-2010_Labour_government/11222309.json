            "background": "At present you are able to obtain benefit and tax credit payments for as many children as you like. By restricting the payment to a two child maximum, you will make parents sit down and decide whether they can actually afford to have any more than two. Compare this to the current situation, were at present, the more children you have the more money you get! People can still chose to have more children if they wish, but at their expense rather than everyone else's. By doing this I believe that people will become more responsible in their decision making, and benefit payments will reduce.",
