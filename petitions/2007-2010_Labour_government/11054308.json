Victims like baby P, Ainlee Walker, Tiffany Wright who had no chance yet were subjected to unspeakable torture and neglect, yet the ones responsible get a \"holiday\" in our so called overcrowded prisons.\n\nAN EYE FOR AN EYE, YOU DO TO THEM, WE DO TO YOU. Stop being politically correct and all for \"human rights\" people like that lose all rights to be human when crimes like that are committed. SO GORDON BROWN, IMAGINE IT WAS YOUR CHILD???
