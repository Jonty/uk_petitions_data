            "background": "Petition to scrap outrageously high hospital car park charges. Held to ransom for a small fortune just to attend vital appointments or visit poorly relatives.\n\nHospital trusts make outrageous sums of money from their car parks. We believe parking should be at a nominal rate or free to those that need to use them.\n\nYou may argue that it's cheaper to travel by public transport and better for reducing global warming. However, those of us with an already compromised immune system don't have that option, particularly with the current outbreak of swine flu.",
