            "background": "The subject is all about the danger of white sugar and the harm it does to our bodies.\nSo sweet oh so sweet that is what we wanted it tastes like sugar.\nFor energy we desire sweetness in our diet. Sugar, put a spoonful of sugar in my tea or coffee as part of my diet; remember this is pure white sugar.\nIt comes in many forms and sizes and often colours. Grind it to a powder grind it to a fine powder and sprinkle it on some cake after it\u2019s has been baked. The dough is already full of \u00bd cup of sugar because it says it in the recipe whoever wrote it and that sugar is granulated.\nThat\u2019s the recipe and it\u2019s full of refined flour and sugar.\nNow and there\u2019s the sugar sweet alternative. The sweet alternative in fact it tastes sweeter than sugar. Barley and rice are grains both can be transformed or fermented into sweet textures just like barley malt and rice syrup. They are both very sweet and good alternatives.\nSugar is the flavour and sweetness is the desire.Refined sugar tastes sickly sweet. Natural sugar tastes simply out of this world and its sugar sweet.",
