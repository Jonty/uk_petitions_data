            "background": "The majority of attacks happen because a dog has been destabilized by irresponsible owners. I call for the following:\n1) With the exception of human death/ near death; dangerous dogs to be removed from their owners and rehabilitated, instead of killed.\n2) The ex-owners to pay all expenses until the dogs natural death, if not adopted.\n3) The owners to be banned from keeping any dog forever.\n4) Compulsory registration of ownership.\n5) A Dangerous animals license to be held for the breeds most likely to cause death/mutilation.\n6) Owners of dangerous breeds to have to prove their dog is obedient.\n7) Persons convicted of violence to never be allowed to own/look after a potentially dangerous breed. Dogs often mirror their owners/keepers personalities.\n8) All hospital/vet expenses to be paid by the former owners, not the taxpayer.\n9) The increased use of prison sentences where laws have been flouted. \n10) The confiscation of any dog from an owner that repeatedly allows fouling after several official warnings. Canine fecal matter contains dangerous pathogens.\n11) Heavier fines for fouling.\n12) The confiscation of any dog that repeatedly escapes due to ineffective containment.",
