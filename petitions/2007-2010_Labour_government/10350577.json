In addition, men who work after the age of 60 have to pay National insurance Contributions of about 11% of their earnings, and women do not. This is blatent discrimination, and cannot be justified.The Government are very keen to outlaw many types of discrimination, but, strangely, are quite content to allow this one to continue.",
