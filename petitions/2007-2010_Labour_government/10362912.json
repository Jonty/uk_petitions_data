            "background": "Social work currently shows little diversity in its workforce, which lends an unrepresentative authority to the body of workers who need to work with the many disabled people in our society(one in five of the population is disabled) without being able to access the profound knowledge, experience and wisdom garnered by the disabled.\nWe strongly urge the government to support further educational initiatives including disability awareness training for higher education staff,and a greater recognition that social work staff particularly need to employ the social work model within their own training, acknowledging that current training and work practices foster a disabling, stressful and unsupportive work climate for the very work force that needs to counter society's disabling tendencies.Until social work challenges it's own uncertainty about working with disabled colleagues, its value base will remain deeply compromised.",
