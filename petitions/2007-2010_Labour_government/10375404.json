            "background": "In my opinion i believe that the marking system should be kept within the Education system and not out-sourced to a Private company.\nThis leaves to much room for error and when there is an error those who have taken the exams are sure to lose out as well as the education system.\nIf business leaders have no trust in the Education system then in my opinion they would be less willing to trust employees C.V's.",
