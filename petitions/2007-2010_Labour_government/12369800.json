        "background": "Smoking has become too much of a plague, it forces babies to die before they are born and causes lung cancer for innocent passers-by. It is time we did something about this. My dad always told me \"If we banned smoking, there would be more crime\" but hasn't already happened with illegal (pardon my spelling) drugs? Stop the manufacture and when the supply runs dry, ban smoking, crime goes up a little, smoking related deaths go down a lot! Cigerettes are worse than cocaine, as they harm people around you as well as you.",
