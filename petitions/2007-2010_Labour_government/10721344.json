        "background": "Further to the recent campaigning by The Citizens Advice Bureau, some MPs, Shelter, the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health and tenants associations to effectively 'water down' the scope of section 21 of the Housing Act 1988 - we, as UK Landlords, would like to petition against such action taking place.\n\nWhilst it is true to say that there are some unscrupulous landlords operating around the country - it is unfair to tar us all with the same brush and we feel that contact should be made with ARLA and/or the NLA to get to the bottom of where the issues lie and then implement a plan of action aimed at addressing tenants concerns.",
