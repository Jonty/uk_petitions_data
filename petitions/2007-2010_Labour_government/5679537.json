            "background": "Many children coping with Autism and its many related disorders have problems with school life and social life. Our children deserve the best and need a specialist centre to be able to offer them the respite from the stresses of school and general day to day living, and also to offer support for the parents who cope with their children's problems. The centre we have available currently is too small to be able to offer help for all the children that desperately need it so a larger place is needed. Our children should not be overlooked and ignored. They will not go away. the problem will grow unless help is sorted out now. North East Lincs council are ignoring our pleas and they need to be aware how important this is.",
