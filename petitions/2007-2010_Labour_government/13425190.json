        "background": "Amongst the many examples of the poor services delivered by Royal Mail it has now become routine, if not systematic, for them to break the terms of their contract with Recorded/Signed-for mail customers. \n\nThese customers are charged a fee to guarantee delivery of their mail and for the delivery person to collect a signature and return the barcode label to the system so that it can be scanned, thus enabling the sender to track the item and check whether it has been delivered or not.\n\nHowever, Recorded/Signed-for mail is now routinely posted through letterboxes without collecting the signature or removing the barcode. My postman tells me that he has been instructed to do this by his supervisor.\n\nThis is an obvious breach of contract and more importantly a deliberate one. \n\nRather than remove the service altogether Royal Mail have seemingly calculated that most customers will not take the time to complain and/or claim a refund. They have instead chosen to continue profiting from this blatant breach of contract.\n\nThis is scandalous and must be stopped!!!",
