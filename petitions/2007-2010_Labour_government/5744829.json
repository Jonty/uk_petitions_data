            "background": "We, the population of Britain who follow any or no faith, would like the proposed plan to build a Mega Mosque in East London scrapped.\n\nWe feel there is no need to froth at the mouth about the potential violence that a Muslim centre in London will cause, but we believe that no public funding should be provided for places of worship.\n\nWe do not care that it will be bigger than St Paul's. We do not care that some people see this as an infraction on a Christian nation.\n\nWe care that \u00a3100 million is being thrown away for something which is useful (using that word in its widest possible sense) only to a minority and that has no practical purpose.",
