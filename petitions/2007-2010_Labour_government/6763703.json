            "background": "just an example, a 10 year old gets 20 page report to do over a week, she is so stressed out with no free time to play and unable to concentrate on anything else, also a 12 year old girl has just been givern a 10 page document to do over the weekend, the young girl did not go out all weekend and became worried that she would not be able to finish it in time. What on earth are we doing to these children  surely homework should be givern when it matters i.e study time for exams,\nChildren commit suicide for less stress they need to have a normal family life outside of school learning about social awareness and how to conduct themselves and family time. You are aware are you not of the problems in society with young people, let us teach them right form wrong and give us back our children in their free time and stop homework to this degree, stop the stress as this can lead to behavioural problems.  For goodness sake open your eyes to the state this country is in and wipe the slate clean and start again.",
