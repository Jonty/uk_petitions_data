            "background": "Heathrow airport is important to UK's economy but the proposed expansion makes a mockery of pledges to tackle climate change. The inevitable greater number flights caused by this expansion will create more pollution and mean increased noise for the surrounding towns and communities. It is important to improve travel networks with other countries but in the case of short haul flights, may be better rail transport would be a greener option.",
