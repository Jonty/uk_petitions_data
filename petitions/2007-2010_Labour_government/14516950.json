            "background": "We are campaigning to bestow bravery awards on three Merchant Navy heroes who helped to save 2000 British lives.  \n\nThey jumped on a runaway ammunition barge, full of tons of unstable high explosive, in extreme weather, that was about to collide with a troop ship housing almost 2000 personnel trapped on board, and towed it to safety.\n\nBecause of a technicality, the Honours Secretariat refuse to consider these awards, yet a newspaper campaign shows the people support the awards for outstanding seamanship and heroism.\n\nWe want people to let the Prime Minister know the level of support for honouring these men.  The Honours system was revised and reformed to remove iniquities, and yet they still exist.  We want these men to receive the recognition they so richly deserve.",
