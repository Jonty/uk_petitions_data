Not only will there be increased CO2 emmissions, but there will be more noise pollution and visual pollution. \n\nAlso an entire community would be obliterated and large amounts green belt land lost.\n\nIs it not slightly hypocritical of our goverment to introduce emissions targets and then expand an already massive airport??\n\nLets send a clear message to the PM that Heathrow expantion would be disasterous for wild life, the climate, the country side and local people.\n\nNO THIRD RUNWAY!",
