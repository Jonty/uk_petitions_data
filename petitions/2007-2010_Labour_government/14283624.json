            "background": "There is a serious risk to expectant mothers who request home births, at present on call midwives do not have any privileges that doctors have, they do not have any green lights and cannot drive above the stated speed limits. \n\nIf a lady starts labour and gets into difficulty, imagine they reside in a rural location and an ambulance is 30 minutes away, it is unacceptable to expect midwives to drive slowly on the way to assist or they get there as quick as they can and risk a speeding fine and points on their licence.\n\nLet ON CALL midwives have green lights for their vehicles, in order to let them help others with a faster response",
