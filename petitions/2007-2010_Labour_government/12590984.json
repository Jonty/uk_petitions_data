        "background": "The Speaker has shown himself to be complete incapable of the office which he holds. His handling of the MP's expenses has been a shambles. He spent huge sums of our tax money on failed legal action to try to prevent publication of them, had his own largesse exposed in the papers (including thousands of pounds spent on decorating his flat and on taxis for his wife), tries to get the police to investigate the leak of the expenses rather than apologise for the abuse by MPs and then lays into an MP, Kate Hoey, for questioning him on this.\n\nIf the PM had the authority to sack him, I'd be petitioning for that, but he does not. However the PM should be able to pursuade Mr Martin that it is time for him to resign.",
