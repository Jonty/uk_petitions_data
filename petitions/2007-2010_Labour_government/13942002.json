            "background": "I would like any funding which is subsidising childcare to be allocated to all families. Our family has made a huge financial sacrifice by the mother giving up work to look after children when pre-school age and also due to lack of grandparents being around we do not have that backup so difficult to work once they are at school. I have started my own business but its hard going and we would like some of this funding to come back to our family as well. We also have to pay taxes and I dont see why some of the taxes we pay should go to subsidise childcare vouchers for better off families who into the bargain may have grandparents to help out.  There are all sorts of family circumstances and all sorts of reasons why people choose to care for their own children at pre-school level or else take time out later on, so I think subsidies should be available to all not just the lucky few (who have been petitioning and winning their argument this week)",
