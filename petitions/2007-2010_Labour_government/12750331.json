My mum says I'd be good at it as I'm lovely and I care about things and stuff.\n\nI'd like to be Minister for Making Fit Women Wear Less Clothes please, but I'd settle for the Foreign Office I guess. I know more about foreign affairs than at least two of the last four American Presidents, and I love skiing.\n\nI look forward to my appointment party. I'd love to see the moves President Obama's taught you on the dancefloor. Do you ceilidh? We could have dwarves holding trays of cocaine on their heads like Freddie Mercury did.\n\nLove,\n\nMister Tony\n\nP.S. I resign\n\nP.P.S. I don't really, that was a topical joke for you",
