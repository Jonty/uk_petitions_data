        "action": "Give EMA money to all college/sixthform students.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I think it is incredibly unfair that the amount of money a student receives is based on the annual income of their parents, this leads to some people joining college for the sole purpose of the EMA money and therefore not working hard(although this mainly isn't  the case), whereas students who do work hard but have parents who are on a higher income receive nothing despite the fact that they work equally as hard as anyone else. Also people on higher incomes pay high taxes, like my parents paid around \u00a310,000 income tax last year, yet they receive nothing back for it. Although many parents who's kids do get EMA work very hard, there is a small minorty of drug using, alcoholic layabout parents who give nothing to the country and would prefer to sit on the couch and watch Trisha on Channel 5 every day rather than getting a job, see their kids supplied with \u00a330 a week.",
