            "background": "The Communities and Local Government select committee has just launched an enquiry into the role of existing housing stock, which represents almost half of the UK\u2019s total carbon emissions, in tackling climate change. Supporters of the Take Stock campaign believe that by empowering people through the provision of expertise and information, Estate Agents can play a major role in improving the performance of the UK\u2019s existing housing stock. The Government therefore needs to engage Estate Agents by communicating the strong business and environmental benefits to help drive change. Research by CABE has revealed that 84% of buyers would pay an extra 2% on the purchase price of an eco friendly home and 87% of buyers wanted to know if their homes were environmentally friendly. Take Stock is a not for profit industry campaign, which aims to encourage Estate Agents to play a significant role in greening the UK\u2019s housing stock. It is organised by myplace, the UK\u2019s only green estate agents.",
