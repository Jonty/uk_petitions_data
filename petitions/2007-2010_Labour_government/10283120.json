            "background": "In an age of fuel insecurity and environmental concern, I find it breathtaking that a 4-member family on my street have 7-8 vehicles, each of which has a full tank of petrol, but not all of which are driven on a daily basis. Will the Prime Minister please put a logical measure in place to prevent the excessive - and, in some cases unnecessary - consumption of fuel at the pumps. The rationing would work by the garage logging the registration of the vehicle. If the vehicle comes into the garage on more than one occasion during the week, it should be barred from filling-up. if rationing doesn't work, then the PM should do the courageous thing and start taxing multiple vehicle ownership. these two measures are the only sensible things to do to prevent fuel stocks evaporating before our very eyes. Rogue nations, terrorists and the oil-rich nations already threaten to strangle oil production and supply. We must do our bit to lead the way in sensible fuel distribution. I am the head of a 4-member family and our one car is perfectly adequate for all of our journey needs. My wife has never felt the need to fill it up more than once a week and that meets all of our vehicle fuel consumption needs.",
