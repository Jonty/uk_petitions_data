            "background": "The CSA deductions from a NRP wage slip is calculated as a % of net earnings, with net earnings being gross salary minus tax and national insurance and pension. \n\nI believe that it should, along with tax and national insurace, include deductions for student loan repayments.\nIt is logical that having a degree increases your earnings and therefore you liability. Paying for it should be taken into account by the CSA as it is taken at source and cannot be avoided.\n\nI also believe they should take into account ALL debts being repayed which were taken out during the relationship as if a couple stayed together they would have had to pay these debts together. \n\nIt should take into account minimum travel costs for NRPs to collect and return their children.\n\nI also believe in cases where a PWC refusing contact to NRP, the reductions for shared care should still be applied to prevent PWC withholding contact specifically to increase CSA money.\n\nIt is just punishing the NRP not to take these things into account and is completely unfair.",
