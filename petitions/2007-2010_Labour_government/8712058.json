            "background": "Why is it that only certain people are deemed 'suitable' to counter sign a passport application form?\n\nIf a person has worked in a clerical role for most of their life, are they not as reliable as someone who has worked as, say, a photographer?\n\nOnly certain professions seem to be able to countersign passport application forms, are these people considered to be of better moral value by our government?\n\nI propose that the law been changed to allow any British passport holder to countersign a passport application form, providing they have worked in the same profession for however many years the government deem appropriate, regardless of which field this is in.\n\n\nFor a full list of those currently able to countersign please go to the UK Passport website.",
