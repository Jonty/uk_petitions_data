            "background": "Since the introduction of the smoking policy in England, there has been difficulty in interpretation of the policy for bus/coach stops and bus/coach shelters.\nThe General Public are forced to congregate at Bus/coach Stops and shelters awaiting buses/coaches, this includes a lot of children and those who have ill health. Local and transport authorities are not inclined to issue no smoking signs in the majority of these location as it is not clear in current legislation what constitutes a partially enclosed space. (Answers from GLA/TfL and Islington and Camden in particular) The Act does not state explicitly that these structures are included.\nCan the Secretary of State For Health be asked to issue a Statutory Instrument as a legal device to specifically itemise Bus stops and Shelters irrespective of design, but only of function, that is, a Bus Compulsory Stop, a Bus Request Stop and a shelter for waiting Bus Passengers. To include say a distance surrounding these structures of say 3 metres, maybe marked with a green line demarcating the area, where one cannot be stationary inside and be smoking. this to allow transit through where the pavement is narrow.",
