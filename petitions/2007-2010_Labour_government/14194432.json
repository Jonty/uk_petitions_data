        "background": "Recently the government has announced the it will increase child benefit by 1.5%.  This measure can only encourage those who are better off on benefits than working, to remain that way.  Future measures should be tailored in such a way as to encourage people to go back to work e.g. those on minimum wage contributing less tax, but receiving less or no benefits depending. It has also been reported recently of large families renting in expensive areas of the UK with the working community picking up the bill. There needs to be more awareness that benefits from the government is actually taking from the working tax payer that pays for it, not the government per-say. Support to get people back into work or a \u201cvoluntary work for benefits\u201d scheme could be established. If everybody who can, had to get up to go to work each day, there would be less crime, less drug and alcohol abuse, less strain on the public services and more empathy with the people who are contributing.",
