I have paid Insurance on my household contents etc, for over 40 years and feel strongly that those that CHOOSE not to take out insurance ought NOT  to be covered. If any persons can show that they have had Insurance refused then they should be entitled to benefit from any Emergency Fund, otherwise benefit is paid to those who chose not to take cover. If I had not had to pay the premiums over the last 40 years then I am sure that I also could have as 43\" plazma TV and top of the range HiFi\nPayments ought to be make to those that tried to cover their owm losses",
