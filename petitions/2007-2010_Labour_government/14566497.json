            "background": "This petition has been created in response to the Governments plans to increase taxation on car boot sales, via a restructing of business rates.\n\nWe believe that any such plans should be immediately cancelled, for several key reasons;\n\n1) They will lead to an increase in prices for buyers and sellers at a time where people are least able to pay more.\n\n2) The government should encourage, not strangle, the growth of businesses which have defied the economic recession and increasing taxation is the worst thing they could do.\n\n3) The car boot sale industry promotes recycling, reduces landfill and lowers demand for new consumer goods. Given how much value they add to society, therefore, they should not be subject to any additional taxation. \n\nIn increasing car boot sale taxes, the government would be declaring their environmental policies morally bankrupt as well as strangling the entreprenial spirit ot land owners. \n\nWe kindly request that the Labour government considers the wider implications of their plans to directly, or indirectly, increase taxation on this great British pastime.",
