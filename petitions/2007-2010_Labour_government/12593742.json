            "background": "I propose that a national register of dogs is set up with mandatory registration for all dogs owned in the UK, and DNA records kept on all dogs.  The purpose of this would be to prevent owners from allowing their dogs to foul in public places and not pick up the mess left behind by their pets.  Environmental departments of the councils of the UK would have the power to take samples of dog mess left in public places for DNA testing and then issue fines to owners.  Spot checks would also need to be carried out by vets and environmental wardens to ensure that dog owners had registered their dogs and had the appropriate paperwork in place.",
