            "background": "On 23rd December 2009, the UN Security Council imposed sanctions on Eritrea based on unfounded allegations of its support for Somali insurgents and a purported border dispute with Djibouti. We believe that whilst Ethiopia\u2019s invasion of Somalia, the interventionist policies adopted by the US, and Ethiopia\u2019s continued occupation of sovereign Eritrean territory are the main causes for the upheaval, Eritrea is being made a scapegoat.  We feel the sanctions will only increase instability, having the potential to engulf the whole region into ongoing crises and bloodshed, not to mention the inevitable adverse impact on British interests.  Furthermore, the consequences of the sanctions on the ordinary people of Eritrea cannot be underestimated.  Whilst we strongly denounce the actions taken by the UN Security Council, we call upon the Prime Minister to take measures to repeal the unjust sanctions and genuinely work to bring peace in the region by promoting just, fair and equitable policies.",
