        "background": "Comments made recently by Clarkson whilst in Australia about our Prime Minister are snide and unacceptable. Whilst he, or others, may not agree with the political position of the Prime Minister and or government, such personal attacks are unacceptable and  have no place in a civilised society. When delivered from across the world, they must be viewed as especially cowardly and subversive",
