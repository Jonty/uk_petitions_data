        "background": "The current plan proposed by the French government under Sarkozy\u2019s leadership calls for a possible ban of the Islamic veil in the streets of France.\n\nSarkozy, assumes he is the modern spokes-person for the Islamic faith and has been quick to condemn the veil as barbaric and oppressive despite the fact that actual numbers of veil (niqab) wearers in France appears to be so small that even TV news crews have struggled to find individuals to film.\n\nMuslim groups estimate that out of the Muslim population there are perhaps only a few hundred women fully covering themselves, of who are mostly converts.\n\nWhereas French politicians are claiming it to be \"degrading\" and \"submissive\", research has shown that the veil is worn through self will.\n\nWe send this petition to you, Gordon Brown to advise Sarkozy not to enforce this ban on our veil but to condemn it. The banning of the veil is the real oppression here. The veil is liberation for us Muslim women and banning the veil should not be mistaken for liberation rather that will amount to oppression. Banning the veil would also be surmountable to an infringement of our basic human rights.",
