            "background": "The formation of the United Nations after World War 2 was supposed to ensure that the horrors of the holocaust could never again be repeated. Genocide however has continued across the globe due in large part to the vetoing powers of the five permanent members of the U.N. security council made up of The United Kingdom, The United States,China,Russia and France who time and again have put their own interests ahead of saving the lives of innocent people.\nThe current situation in Darfur needs immediate action. We need the UN to stop this genocide of millions and to fight for the peace,justice,and basic human rights for all of those locked in this nightmare.They are prisoners in their own country,and are being killed daily due to decisions by their leaders. They need our voice, and definitive action now.",
