With high unemployment already, a struggling NHS this government is laying the path open for the BNP to gain popularity. As seen in the euro elections on 04/06/2009. Also the influx of immigrants from within europe needs to be limited. These immigrants work for low wages and spend as little as possible in this country, they then sent monies to there home country. This damages the job market and the economy.",
