            "background": "Either people over the age of 80 do need more money or they don't.  If they do the amount of increase needed should be far more than 25p; what can you buy with that?  If they don't this increase should be stopped.\n\nAn increase of 25p per week is pointless; it must cost far more to administer than can possibly be justified by any benefit to individual pensioners.  It might have been worth something when it was instituted but, like the \u00a310 Christmas bonus, it has completely lost its value.",
