        "background": "Since this innane conception of offering payrises by percentage points the gap between rich and poor is always going to get larger. Percentage pay rises show 10% of nowt is nowt. \nThe sane idea of offering payrises in exact amounts in local and government occupations would save a huge amount. I just want you to think about this and put it to your Ideas team that using sensible offers could get us back on track for fair deals within the next 20 years. For example \u00a3500 per year across the whole of the civil service and government bodies would mean a huge increase in salery for the lower paid and if your earnings are of \u00a360,000 why would you need more.",
