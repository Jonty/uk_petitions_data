        "background": "Instead of recruiting Governors for NHS trusts and adding more expense to the NHS. Government should consider invited  members of the public to be non Executive members of NHS trust board of Directors. This would encourage people in all walks of life, with many years of practical experience but very little, if any, academic qualifications. \n\nPeople actually employed within the NHS, do need academic qualification but Government should not ignore people in the community that have little or no academic qualifications because many years of practical experience, in many areas of society, as employees, employers, parents, grand and great grand parents, is  second to non and would contribute many years of practical education to the NHS trust board of Directors, as Non Executive Directors.",
