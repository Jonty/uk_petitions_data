A proposal includes turning the all-female prison, which holds just under 400 inmates, into an immigration detention centre.\n\nThis type of facility would hold foreign nationals waiting for decisions on asylum claims and those waiting for deportation, following a failed application.\n\nPlease help to stop this from happening.\n\nThe change of Morton Hall as something that should not be considered.",
