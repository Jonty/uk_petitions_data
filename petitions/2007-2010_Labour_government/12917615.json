            "background": "Ronnie Biggs has been refused parole by Jack Straw, Minister for Justice.  The Parole Board concluded that he posed a 'manageable risk'.  He is tube fed and communicates by hand gestures and the use of an alphabet panel. He has had a series of strokes and a chest infection.\n\nIn the name of common humanity, please demand that Mr Straw sign the release order in order that Mr Biggs can end his days with his family and they with him. This is not a defence of his past actions.  It is a plea that an 80 year old man may die  at home.\n\nThis would be, on the part of the PM, an act, not of weakness but  of humanity and strength.",
