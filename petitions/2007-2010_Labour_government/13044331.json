        "background": "I, in concert with many other normal, reasonable Englishmen, am heartily sick of the politically correct brigade who make it seem shabby or immoral to be patriotic, or Christian or to demonstrate support for our armed forces. \n\nWe have all heard many stories where councils, companies, or other bodies have tried to initiate or impose politically motivated policies on their staff or communities; these policies are usually borne from over-sensitivity to the possibility of upsetting people based on their race, religion or nationality. \n\nWe the undersigned call upon the Prime Minister to instigate legislation to make it illegal for councils, companies, or other bodies to impose policies which most reasonable people would deem to be anti-patriotic, including such concepts as not being allowed to wear our national emblem the Union Flag, not being allowed to demonstrate support for the Armed Forces, or not being allowed to display Christmas decorations lest they might offend members of another faith. \n\nLet's get back to being a Great Bitain of reason and tolerance - including for the indigenous population !",
