He was shot using seven Jacketed Hollow Point rounds which mushroom on impact in order to reduce the chances of survival of the target, a bullet deliberately chosen \"that dumps all its energy into the subject.\", a bullet designed to kill. Should one of these seven rounds not have found their target and found another member of the public instead then two innocent people would now be dead. Had standard rounds been used with the skill fitting of a firearms expert, maybe Jean Charles would have survived the criminal wrong done to him that day.  \n\nJacketed hollow point rounds were banned from use in conventional warfare in the Hague Convention of 1899. Over 100 years later our police force puts the public at fatal risk by continuing to use these rounds. Ban Jacketed Hollow Point bullets.",
