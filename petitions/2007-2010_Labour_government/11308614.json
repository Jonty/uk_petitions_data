Typically the working week could be forty hours plus two shifts of eight for sleepovers (56hours) a week, or as many sleepovers their company says they have to cover as there is no limit to the amount they are asked to do,  for this their employers pay and allowance well below the national minimum wage. These workers provide a vital service within the care industry being away from their families (up to twenty four hours at a time) while carrying out their duties.",
