Me and nearly everyone at my school is terrified about the fact that this machine that is being used to re-create a version of the big bang tommorow is actually going ahead as it may put everyone in the world in danger. The fact that we are even being exposed to a small risk of an 'apocolypse' is absolutely ludicrous. I am terrified and scared of what to do, and I want to see my nieces' and nephew grow up. If there is any way possible that you can help. Please do! Yours Sinceraly Billy Danaher\n\nbiill@live.co.uk",
