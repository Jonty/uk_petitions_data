Members should have priority access to services throughout the Commons part of the Parliamentary Estate.  The petitioners agree that such an approach may be expedient during a division, but not everywhere all the time.  This announcement serves to create a rigid two-tier system which is counter to an enlightened image of Parliament.  The petitioners further believe that there is merit in a general presumption of equality on the Parliamentary Estate\n\nThe petitioners therefore request that the Prime Minister ask the Administration Committee and Sergeant at Arms to reconsider their decision.",
