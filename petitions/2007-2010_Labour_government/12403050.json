One man, one vote implies that everyone has a vote, AND THAT ALL VOTES ARE EQUAL, thus resulting in each decision having majority support.\n\nHowever, the labour party have the majority of power (55%) with only 35% of the vote; this is only 22% of those who voted, which is only 15.5% of those who the government deign to allow to vote.\n\nFurthermore, the system is designed to only allow us a choice between the conservatives and the labour party, which, on the issues on which they agree, gives us a 'communist choice' between 'option A' or 'option A'. \n\nWe are not stupid: we know the UK is not a democracy, and we demand that you stop pretending that it is, and that you 'represent the people'. Not that you have to obey this demand, even if it gets majority support, what with the UK not being a democracy.",
