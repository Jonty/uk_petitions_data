With a quarter of Island households currently struggling to heat their homes, we no longer accept selfish reason's of \"imperfect skylines\" to justify other Islanders' suffering - not just this winter but also in the long run. \n\nEvidently, long-term plans are not in thWART's interests. \n\nThe younger generations' futures are being decided when they themselves had not had a voice, until now. \n\nPlease sign this petition if you want the Isle of Wight to be host to wind turbines.",
