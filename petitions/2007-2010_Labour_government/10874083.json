There is no evidence that privately run large centres will provide better or more accessible care than GP led and managed services. The Government plans to create privately run clinics with salaried GPs answerable to shareholders or so called not for profits boards.The destruction of General Practice is a high price to pay for importing ideas from the United States, a country in which those that can afford to pay are often over treated whilst those that cannot are left untreated. Management consultants and surgeons advised by management consultants are not the best people to tinker with National Health Services. They rarely have contact with it as they go private. The proposed model will serve best those that least need the NHS.",
