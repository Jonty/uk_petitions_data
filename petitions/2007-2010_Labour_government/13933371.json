            "background": "Put a stop to the high cost of credit and background checking for rental properties via Estate Agents - costs \u00a3100.00 per person over the age of 18 - and makes it difficult (if not impossible) for lower income families to afford a decent rental property. Also to stop estate agents from making tentants pay for a further credit check when they want to move to another of their properties after a year. If a tenant has a good record for a full year of punctual payment of rent that should be enough.",
