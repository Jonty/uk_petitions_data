            "background": "Water fluoridation has no basis in logic, evidence or modern science.\n\nWhats more water fluoridation is compulsive medication. The answer for better teeth is better dental hygiene, NOT mass medication. \n\nFluorides effect is TOPICAL not SYSTEMIC. I.e Toothpaste works because it has contact with the teeth.\n\nDrinking water with fluoride goes straight into the stomach, and the effect is nullified.\n\nThere are many more arguments against water fluoridation. And the evidence against is overwhelming.\n\nDont be treated like a fool, please sign the petition.\n\nMany thanks.",
