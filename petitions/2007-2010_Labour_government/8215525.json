            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Our road tax is currently derived by exhaust emissions, yet those who tow caravans on a regular basis incur no extra charge.  Towing increases engine load, increases emissions, slows traffic and yet is allowed with no cost to the caravan owners.  There is no test for towing a caravan, they are often loaded badly and such dangerous and there weight increases wear on our roads.  All of which is subsidised by citizens who either drive motorbikes or eco friendly cars.",
