            "background": "We the undersigned feel that there is a distinct naivety amongst the UK population with regards to what is available to them as an NHS dental patient. Currently a patient will only receive NHS treatment if he/she signs a form. We would like the government to change the legislation so the patient receives NHS treatment automatically unless the patient requests/signs a form to say they wish to be treated privately. We would also like the government to educate the UK citizens about these NHS dental treatments that are available through the NHS and any that are not as many individuals do not have access to the Internet and this information is not published in magazines or newspapers nor is this information always displayed or clearly displayed in dental practices. It would make it harder for a dentist to, either deliberately or accidentally, mislead a patient in choosing private over NHS treatment. This opt-out system would ultimately save all PCT\u2019s/Health Service/Government/tax payer a lot of money.",
