            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The Government is set on higher university attendance; however, many people find tuition fees off-putting.\nIf a student enrols on a 4 year degree course, the tuition fee loan will total \u00a312,580. Factor in \u00a3100 a week for accommodation (\u00a33,800 a year) and \u00a380 a week for general living (\u00a33,040 a year) and this figure jumps to \u00a339,940 for a 4 year course. This is of course taken out as a loan from the SLC, a government body. This figure is still small as I have not accounted for interest, or the fact that many students resort to a job to sustain themselves, at expense to the education they are trying to afford. I believe it is morally wrong that the government stand to make a profit off of students - future high earners and those who will later pay taxes.\nOther parts of the UK have abolished the fee. This move would bring England into line with Scotland and Wales.\nTherefore, I petition the Prime Minister to scrap the tuition fee and replace it with means tested grants to aid living costs.",
