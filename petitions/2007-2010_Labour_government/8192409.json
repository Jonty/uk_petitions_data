            "background": "Basically, not enough money is being donated to the research into mental health, even though many people suffer from it. You will almost definitely know someone who has suffered from mental health problems, and you may have suffered yourself. To put things into context, these are the 2003 figures on ill-health:\n\nOne in 32,000 people suffer from Aids,\nOne in 50 people suffer from mental handicap,\nOne in 30 people suffer from Cancer,\nOne in 10 people suffer from heart and respiratory disorders and\nOne in 10 people suffer from mental illness.\n\nMental health illness is as common as heart and respiratory problems, three times as common as Cancer and THREE THOUSAND times as common as AIDS. In fact the closest thing it has in common with these illnesses is that it KILLS.\n\nSign this petition, more money needs to go into the research of mental health. Please sign it.",
