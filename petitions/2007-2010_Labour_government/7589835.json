Why do people think that giving clothes as presents is a good thing?\n\nLet's face facts; when a child opens his/her presents on Xmas day, they want the parcels to contain toys, games, sweets etc. The same goes for grownups, only the toys are bigger.\n\nSo, Mr Brown (or whoever is in No. 10 by the time I've submitted this) - it's time we made giving clothes as presents a criminal act.",
