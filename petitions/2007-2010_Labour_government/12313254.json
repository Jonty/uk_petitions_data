            "background": "The wholesale abuse of the present Visa system as starkly exposed following the recent arrests under Operation Pathway, demands a wholesale, in depth independent scrutiny of the whole process for approval of Visas to foreign nationals wishing to to enter UK for study. Nothing less than a Judicial Inquiry will do, with the widest possible mandate to examine procedures at home and abroad, manning levels, the system for accreditation of Colleges, the checks made against existing Insitutions, and last but not least the work practices of civil servants in all relevant departments towards the checks and inquiries staff are allowed to make before the granting of visas.",
