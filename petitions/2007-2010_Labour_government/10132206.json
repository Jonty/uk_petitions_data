        "background": "Louisa Oakes Education Centre was given as a gift to the London Borough of Waltham Forest for educational purposes.  The council have wasted thousands of pounds doing the building and its grounds up, including, painting, re-carpeting, interior decorating and re-roofing, only to sell the land and building to the highest bidder for housing to be built on!  This is wrong.  The council should not have sold this building, lessening education opportunities in the borough.  They should not have made money from a gift they were given.  Please help us to stop this from happening.",
