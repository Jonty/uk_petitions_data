Alleyways are not kept clear of overhanging branches and leaves. Cars are being broken into everyday, as they fail to maintain the street lighting.  When emailing or contacting them via telephone, they fail to respond, and therefore the streets of Walthamstow remain in a disgusting mess!  It is time for the Council to put our council tax to good use by employing those who will clean the borough effectively, and therefore prevent the spreading of disease!",
