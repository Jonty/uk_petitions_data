            "background": "Fac (firearm certificate) firearms are sporting rifles and non SGC shotguns.\n\nThese firearms rarely feature in crime and are only for sporting activity alike shotguns are. \nThe use of FAC type firearms is too heavily restricted for both purchase and use too, the reason I am asking this it that if our sport is to continue and be more open to prospective youngsters and adults, then Fac firearms need to be less restrictive in the way shotguns are. \n\nI believe that there should be one single certificate to posses all legal firearms which would still work in the same way as the current, very efficient shotgun certificate does, It would allow police lisencing forces to focus more on the applicant than the firearms in question. \nThere would be no negative effect on public safety as each applicant will be able to be checked more thouroughly than they are with Firearm Certificates at the moment becuase less time would be wasted mucking around with variations and searching for un-necessary information in the firearms department and for variation payements etc etc.\nDoing this will make firearms officer's jobs much much easier, less stressful and more efficient, and allow us to enjoy our sport more.",
