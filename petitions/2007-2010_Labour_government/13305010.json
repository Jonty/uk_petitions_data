            "background": "The use of P2P is neither illegal nor exclusive to copyright theft. Many free software providers use this form of distribution, as does the BBC\u2019s iPlayer. If citizens are innocent until proven guilty, ISP\u2019s would be forced to monitor internet usage to ensure that no copyrighted material is being transferred. This flagrant disregard for privacy is comparable to forcing the Post Office to search through parcels for photocopied documents or mixtape cassettes.  Such requirements would place enormous strain on ISP\u2019s whilst failing to prevent the distribution of copyrighted material through hidden IP\u2019s, http or ftp. Who is punished in the case of shared family connections?\n\nThe increasing role of the internet in access to society should not be underestimated. Cutting off households deprives families of education, government services and freedom of speech. We do not see this as a fitting punishment, nor do we believe the breaches in privacy involved to be justifiable under copyright law.",
