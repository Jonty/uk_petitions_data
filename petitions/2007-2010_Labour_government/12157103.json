            "background": "Some prisoners are highly misguided and in need of correction, but most prisoners are disturbed and in need of help.  Therefore, all prisoners should be allowed to opt for psychological and psychiatric treatment on an indefinite sentence -- only being given freedom when their treatment has been largely successful.  This would then provide the treatment, rehabilitation and support that disturbed people need.",
