        "background": "02 have taken it upon themself's and decided to erect a Mobile Telephone Mast on the Junction of Larkhill Road and Preston Road in Yeovil. The Local Council refused a planning aplication in March 2007 for the erection of the 15 metre mast. 02 however have decided that it was in the best interest of the local residents and customers and decided to use a loop hole in the law and erect the mast anyway. This mast is being erected within approximately 300 metres of a local school. Sign this petion to show 02 that the mast is not in the best interest of the local people who live in the area of Yeovil and to show that the people of Yeovil do not require these big mast in any part of the town.",
