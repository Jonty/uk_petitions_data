        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Whilst noting that these increases were levied to cut down on the binge drinking culture in the UK.it is becoming increasingly obvious that the policy is not working. The major supermarket chains have merely squeezed their suppliers margins and alcohol is just as cheap if not cheaper than was previously the case. However the traditional local pub,often the cornerstone of the communities they serve are closing in record numbers as they are bearing the brunt of this ill thought out policy. Please support this petition and bring pressure to bear on the government.",
