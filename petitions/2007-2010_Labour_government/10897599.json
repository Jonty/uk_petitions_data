            "background": "On behalf of all shared ownership schemes we request for help in buying the remaing shares in our houses.In the past 10 years due to increased market value in the housing market people have been unable to buy the remaining shares of their homes.  We request that owners be given a discount on their remaing shares so they are able to get a mortgage and buy their house. Housing tenants in local council housing schemes (Right to buy) receive a discount, but shared owners with housing associations do not receive any discount.If we were helped, there would be thousands of people wanting to obtain  new mortgages which would help the owners and provide new business for the banks. Most people who own 50% of their houses could provide secure loans for the banks. If the shared owners were helped in this way the whole economy could benefit.",
