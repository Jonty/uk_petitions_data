            "background": "This year marks the 40th anniversary of the successful landing on the moon by US astronauts, Neil Armstrong and Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin.\n\nAccompanying the US flag on that famous mission, was also a small flag from the UK, which was then returned to earth and presented to Harold Wilson by the USA, along with several small pieces of moon rock.\n\nThis flag, and the moon rock is now on display, but in private within 10 Downing Street.\n\nTo mark the anniversary, and promote the UK government's recent increased interest in lunar research projects - this petition asks that the government put the flag and moon rock on public display in a suitable location (or on a national tour) so that the public can see how Britain has already symbolically been to the moon.",
