            "background": "As a secondary school teacher and parent, I think it is disgusting that a local amenity such as this might be closed. My children (who attend Firs Farm Primary School, N13)are also taken to the library by their teachers on a monthly basis. Libraries are amazing places where children's imaginations are ignited. They, by their very nature, are associated with academic study. Edmonton is an area that has huge social issues, in particular with ethnic minority boys. Surely, we should be doing something to keep them off the streets and exercising their minds. There is already enough concern about boys simply not reading enough because it is not perceived as 'cool'. Also, the library is on the grounds of The Millfield Theatre - will that be next to go? Once again, my family and I strongly object to the closure of Weir Hall Library.",
