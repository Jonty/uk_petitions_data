            "background": "In the interests of public health, the lethal drug alcohol must be classified under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. It does not enjoy any legal exemption, (nor does tobacco.)\n\nAlcohol is causing unparalleled harm; to people's health and to society. Instead of encouraging drinking, the Government should discharge its duty to seek to reduce this harm.\n\nClassification is not the same thing as prohibition. It merely provides the public with clear information about the risks. \n\nBritain's alcohol catastrophe is not going to solve itself! Action is urgently needed. The means have existed to take action for forty years. All that's required is to implement existing Law.",
