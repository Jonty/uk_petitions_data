            "background": "According to \u2018The Ecologist\u2019 magazine, this quarry is very heavily polluted and no efforts have been made to clean it up or to bring those responsible to account for the pollution. The Environment Agency apparently disputes that there has been a lack of action on its part. This petition therefore calls for a full enquiry into the matter.",
