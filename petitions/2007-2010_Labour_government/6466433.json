            "background": "it's time for politicians to be more intelligent when it comes to flying and climate change. You should be encouraging people to fly in cleaner aircraft - just like you advocate for cars.\nIt is time to ban the oldest, dirtiest aircraft in the sky. It would be easy to do and would have a big impact.\nIt is wrong to tax families but not private jets and cargo. Air Passenger Duty should be reformed to tax aircraft emissions - those that pollute the most should pay the most. UK air travellers already pay more tax than any other country in Europe.\nAir travel could be 50% cleaner within 10 years.\nYou should urge people and your colleagues to act responsibly - to fly with those airlines that have new aircraft, high passenger loads and fewer emissions. More questions should be asked in Parliament about the efficiency of transport modes used for Government business. The more MPs are aware of the facts, the greater the ability of our country to take the lead in aviation emissions. The interests of air travellers in your constituency will be best served by having an informed political debate on the intelligent solutions to managing aviation emissions.",
