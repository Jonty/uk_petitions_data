        "action": "Stop the Embryos Bill being passed in Parliament",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This pertition is asking people to vote against the Human Tissue & Embryos Bill. This Bill will permit the creation of animal-human hybrids to be used in embryonic research.  It will also make it legal for children to be brought into the world and be denied a father and it will also allow the Secretary of State for Health to take far-reaching decisions on these issues aside from Parliament. Britain has pioneered the use of human embryos for research and experimentation - creating over 2 million embryos for this purpose - although none of this has resulted in any breakthroughs in curing diseases.  Meanwhile over seventy successful therapies have been developed using adult stem cells - not harming human life at all, but sadly these attract little or no publicity.  Please sign this petition to stop human life being messed around with. Stop even more abortions taking place and more nursing staff being put under pressure.",
