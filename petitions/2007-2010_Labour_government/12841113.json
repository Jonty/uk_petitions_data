            "background": "Even though most MPs have been exploiting expense claims, i can appreciate that having to work at home in their constituency and having to work in London (Parliment) will increase their costs and therefore justifies claiming living expenses. However being an MP does not cause an increase in your food costs one bit so why on earth are MPs allowed to claim \u00a3400 a month/\u00a34800 a year on food. We all pay for our food out of our salaries - thats what its for!Claiming for food as expenses is just one of the many ways in which MPs are maximising their salary and it should stop!",
