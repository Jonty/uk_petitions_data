        "background": "I would like to see a ban on all battery farmed meat and animal food produce eventually, but realise that it would take time for farmers to adjust. Let's start with chickens by making them all free range! I currently pay more for free range eggs and chicken meat, please do the same as me until battery eggs and meat are banned. \nI also believe that meat from an animal that has led a happy natural free range life is healthier than that from a battery farmed animal. Think of this quote from a source that is unknown to me: \"You are what you eat\"!!!!",
