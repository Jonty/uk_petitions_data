Once in possession of this information ensure that screening for each cancer is more frequent than this (e.g. if it takes 3 years to need chemo, etc., the maximum period between screenings should be 2.5 years).",

            "background": "I have heard that radiotherapy and - especially! - chemotherapy is very uncomfortable, or even painful, and the side/after-effects are also very unpleasant.  I have to admit that my main reason for creating this petition is fear that I myself may have to suffer this one day (I have a very low tolerance of pain/discomfort and I am also very weak emotionally); e.g. if a breast cancer contracted after my 3-yearly mammogram reached that point before the next mammogram.  I would, however, also point out that the extra cost of more frequent screenings would, almost certainly, be far outweighed by savings on the cost of chemo/radio-therapy; if, therefore, my proposal was put into practice this would be a real win-win situation.",
