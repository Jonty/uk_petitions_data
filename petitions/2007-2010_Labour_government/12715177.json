In order to restore faith a necessary and difficult renewal must occur. Any MP who has made \u2018excessive\u2019 claims within the current expense system must stand down. The hollow words, \u201cit was within the rules, I\u2019ve done nothing wrong\u201d cannot be used as protection against such a flagrant abuse of the taxpayer. Parliament has a duty to act with the highest moral values, to represent the will of the people, and to treat with respect the position to which they have been elected. Those that have so clearly failed to act with honesty and integrity must accept the consequences of their actions. Our democratic institutions must be renewed.",
