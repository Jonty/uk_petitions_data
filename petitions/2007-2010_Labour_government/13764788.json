The BBC\u2019s existence is yet another example of the English being treated as second class citizens in their own country. The BBC\u2019s presenters are overpaid and they are steeped in London\u2019s trendy elite culture. \n\nThe EBC would be a low-cost operation. It would be based outside of London and recruit a totally new set of presenters. These presenters would be paid more modest salaries and would be more reflective of the many different regions of England.",
