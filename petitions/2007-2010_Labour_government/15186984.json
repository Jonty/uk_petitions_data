The eu should have a maximum of 1 million from all the countries that are joined to it.  If the eu cannot manage on this vast amount of money then like most of us they will have to cut their cloth and make ends meet.  The eu was for free trade within europe NOT for total control over the peoples within Europe.  This is now another gravy train which is quickly getting out of hand and needs to be stopped in its track.",
