            "background": "There has been an alarming increase in the number of pregnant women and new mothers who are being made redundant.  It appears that some employers are using the recession as an excuse to break the law on discrimination. This is not only morally wrong and deeply damaging to workplace gender equality - it is illegal. The Government must play an active role in ensuring that the law against pregnancy discrimination is enforced. \n\nAlongside this, the Government\u2019s new Equality Bill (currently being debated in Parliament) could make things worse. At present, a woman must not be treated \u2018less favourably\u2019 because she is pregnant or on maternity leave. The Equality Bill appears to lessen this protection by stating that she cannot be treated \u2018less favourably than is reasonable\u2019 (Clauses 16 & 17). \n\nWhat is \u2018reasonable\u2019 remains undefined, allowing employers to use inconvenience or cost as justification for actions which at present would clearly be illegal. Legal experts in the field fear that if this clause goes through, the protection of pregnant women at work will be substantially weakened.",
