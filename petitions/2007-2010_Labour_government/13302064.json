        "background": "Cadbury's is the subject of a hostile takeover bid from a foreign rival, which is also active in the UK confectionery market. Cadbury's is a thriving British company, and an important part of our remaining industrial base. It is not in our national interest, or the interest of Cadbury employees or customers, for it to fall into foreign control, with the profits going overseas. It would also represent a reduction in competition in the UK confectionery market, and therefore it seems appropriate for the UK competition authorities to intervene.",
