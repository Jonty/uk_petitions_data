        "background": "The future of Little Brooklands is in jeopardy! As such, we thought it prudent to set up a forum for all parent(s)/carer(s) to voice their concerns and collectively highlight ways we can help to save our nursery.\n\nWe were shocked, like many of you, to hear that Little Brooklands might be demolished this Summer. I am sure you will agree, Little Brooklands is not just any other nursery. It is an exceptionally homely and happy environment where children enjoy learning and are continually stimulated with curriculum based activities.\n\nThere is a clear shortage of quality daycare in the Weybridge area. This increasingly highlights the importance of maintaining existing daycare structures. As such, can I please ask for your support in this initiative. We would like to lobby together to raise awareness of the importance of Little Brooklands to us all with the aim of 'SAVING OUR NURSERY'",
