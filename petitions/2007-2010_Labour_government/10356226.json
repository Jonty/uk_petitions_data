        "background": "Abolish the current student loan system in favour of the introduction of an additional 1% tax for university graduates. Revenue raised will be used to pay tuition fees and additional maintenance grants removing the need for the current debt based system. \n\nThis method will allow students to pay society back for the privilege of a university education without burdening them with debt and discriminating against students from financially disadvantaged backgrounds as the system currently stands.",
