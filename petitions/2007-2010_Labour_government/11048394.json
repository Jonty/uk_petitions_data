The prime minister needs to lead this country, he needs to stand up and say this is wrong, he must act.\n\nI would say ban reality television, but we need something to subdue the masses. However, please don't allow them to clutter my life with their rubbish, people should not talk about this utter tripe.\n\nThe prime minister needs to stand up at his next weekly press conference and slate the fools that not only watch programmes like the X-factor, but actually care about them. The saddest thing is people get motivated over reality television, but then cannot motivate themselves to even vote in local or national elections - oh the joys of our society.",
