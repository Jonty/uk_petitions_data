        "background": "We believe that healthy food means healthier patients. It makes no sense to feed vulnerable and ill people with below-standard food, often frozen mass-produced meals with little nutritional value. Government could improve patients' health, create more catering jobs, boost the local economy and cut down on CO2 emissions from transport and production if they put more emphasis and money into providing patients in hospitals with local and fresh food and drink.",
