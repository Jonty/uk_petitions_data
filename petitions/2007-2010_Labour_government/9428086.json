        "background": "Far too many people in the UK do not have access to a Rape Crisis centre or a Sexual Assault Referral Centre.  The facilities that do exist for victims of rape and sexual assault are seriously stretched, as they struggle with not enough funding and not enough staff.  \n\nIn those areas where victims do have access to a Rape Crisis Centre or SARC, people often have difficulty getting through on the telephone, and once through, cannot always talk for as long as is needed due to other pressures on the over-worked staff.\n\nIt is time that the funding and expertise were put in place to set up a National 24 Hour Helpline for victims of rape and sexual assault.  It is very much needed, in this country where rape and sexual assault are prevelant, yet the conviction rate for these crimes is at an all time low.\n\nThe government must take this issue seriously, and setting up a national 24 hour helpline would be a vital step in helping the thousands of victims who have no access to a Rape Crisis Centre or SARC.",
