Riding for the celebrated MV Augusta team, he won seven World Championships between 1956 and 1960.\n\nThen - with nothing left to prove - he made the transition from two wheels to four, winning the Formula One World Championship with Ferrari in 1964. To this day his feat of winning World Championships on two and four wheels remains unparalleled.\n\nDuring his remarkable racing career he won 290 of the 621 races he entered and claimed a further 103 podium finishes, recording 48 fastest laps and 100 record laps along the way.",
