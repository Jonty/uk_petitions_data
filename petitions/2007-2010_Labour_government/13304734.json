The body of the great leader had not been handed over to the relatives/followers as per civilized law of Justice and was buried secretly. The government in Pakistan and past British governments have always turned a deaf ear to the Sindhi people\u2019s requests for disclosing the place of burial. The place of burial is important to us because as a tradition of Sufi Muslim community in Sindh, we venerate our spiritual leaders by visiting their grave/shrine and organizing an annual Urs.",
