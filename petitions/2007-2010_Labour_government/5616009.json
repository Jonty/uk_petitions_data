            "background": "Congestion Charging should be changed in the following 2 areas;\n\n1) First time offenders\nOn the 1st offence of failing to pay congestion charging, an offer should be made to pay and outstanding charge + a small administration fee within 5 days, the current scheme assumes that all motorists are fully coherent with the scheme (even though it's not covered by the highway code) the 5 day rule could be delivered with a pamphlet detailing the workings of the scheme, advising the costs of a repeat offence.\n\n2) Online Registration Checker\nCurrently there is no way of checking online to see if you have entered a charging zone and/or entered/exited the zone late due to ones watch being incorrect.\n\nThe current system bullies one into paying the charge even though the charge cannot be verified.",
