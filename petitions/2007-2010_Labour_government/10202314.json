        "background": "In June 2008 Heinz UK launched a TV advertising campaign to promote their new 'Deli Mayo' range.  The advert - designed to show that the mayonnaise was so authentic it was like being in a New York cafe - featured a mother and father kissing.  However, the 'mother' was in fact a male chef. \n\nAfter the Advertising Standards Authority had received only 200 complaints about the representation of two men kissing, Heinz withdrew the advert.  \n\nWe believe that Heinz, in withdrawing the advert, has submitted to the demands of a small number of homophobes.  These actions are unacceptable from a large British company, and the government - which should be committed to equality for all - should condemn any organisation that acts in such a fashion.",
