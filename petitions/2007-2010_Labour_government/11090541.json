            "background": "It is good that us children get free bus transport but I don't like the idea that we have to bring an oyster card on every single bus journey. If you by accident forgot your oyster card and you were late to your destination and the bus driver did not let you get on the bus because you have no oyster card and no money that means you are even more late to your destination!\n\n\nSo I think that we don't need these oyster cards for children because of these accidental occasions. Also it is very harsh to take money off children who don't work yet in urgent circumstances where they have forgotten their oyster cards. Oyster cards are free and if you don't have an oyster card it would be exactly the same-it would still be free. I don't get the difference or what an oyster card does.",
