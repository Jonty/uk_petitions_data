We would like him, as endorser of the 'End of Life Care Strategy/Liverpool Care Pathway' to experience the same treatment modes afforded the average British Senior Citizen (VIZ: covert DNAR note on records, accidental overdose of Midazolam to allow their practitioners to play the 'Best Interest/Futile Care' card and overdose them on morphine for non-existent pain, and/or infect them with CDiff or MRSA, whichever is easiest for him), to highlight the dangers of attempting to recover the cost of the Iraq War by allowing individual practitioners to decide when patients are at the 'End of Life'.",
