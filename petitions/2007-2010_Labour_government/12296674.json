            "background": "The official religion of Great Britain is clearly Christianity. It is therefore right and proper that state schools should reflect this fact, and allow all children the opportunity to benefit from Christian worship and teaching. Christianity is a compassionate religion, which - as Archbishop John Sentamu puts it - is 'magnanimous' in its attitude towards other faiths. Christianity has shaped and held together our country for the greater good over many centuries. We owe so many of our freedoms and and social reforms to it. Indeed, education itself owes much to Christianity - which holds the key to the common good, and to the identity, coherence and survival of the British nation.",
