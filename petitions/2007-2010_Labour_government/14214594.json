        "background": "Since banks, top employees and shareholders have kept the massive bonus and profits they made in the past, and are once again making large profits they should be forced to bear the whole cost of the rescue package. \n\nIt is plainly unfair that public sector workers should bear the burden of wage cuts and job losses and the public in general should lose services in order to protect the lifestyles of a few wealthy people and institutions.\n\nIf the finance sector pays these costs there should be no need for cuts in the budget.",
