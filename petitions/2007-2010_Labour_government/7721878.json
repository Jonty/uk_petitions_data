            "background": "Compulsory redundancies need to be avoided by using voluntary redundancy as a statutory requirement and statutory compensation needs to properly reward all workers for their commitment to their employer regardless of age.  Current policy makes it easier for multinationals to sack workers in Britain than other parts of Europe. When considered against huge \u2018City bonuses\u2019 and \u2018golden goodbyes\u2019 for Directors, 4 weeks redundancy pay for each year worked is a modest request.",
