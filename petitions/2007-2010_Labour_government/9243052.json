            "background": "At present any foreign visitor entering the UK pays no road taxation. In reason years, there has been a massive increase in foreign vehicles using our roads, especially Lorries.  These vehicles cause additional wear to an already fragile road infrastructure without any contribution to the maintenance.  Switzerland has a very simple procedure of charging every vehicle that enters their country.  They issue a road fund licence in the form of a sicker that is displayed and cannot be transferred; it allows the user access to the country for a year.  Even if the duty was set at a nominal figure, it would create additional funding to improve our very poor 3rd world roads.",
