            "background": "Many people cannot afford to take low paid/temporary or part time work because they are not entitled to claim Tax Credits at the moment. If you replace JSA with Working Tax Credit you will make this automatically possible for all those who are unemployed. This will increase the incentive to find employment, reduce benefit fraud and alleviate poverty.",
