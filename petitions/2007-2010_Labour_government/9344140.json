            "background": "This petition is for parents/carers of disabled children we are sick and tired of our kids being treated like second class citizens. We hate the fact that we have to fight and complain to try to get things our kids rightfully deserve. \n\nWe intend to make the politicians sit up and take notice without excuses. Parents of disabled kids are voters too ! \n\nWe are fed up with having to pay out more for specialist things like car seats, bathing systems, bikes, special buggies etc, why are these items up to 10 times the cost of \"normal\" items ?\n\nWhy is there no play equipment in public parks or soft play areas that cater to disabled kids, aren't our kids good enough to socialise with their peers ?\n\nWhy can't parents and siblings be offered support especially in the early days of diagnosis ? Why can't parents be offered First aid with resus courses, Makaton or baby signing courses.\n\nWe are fed up with the discrimination, we want to go into a toyshop and buy a \u00a35 puzzle that won't fall apart when our kids use it, why should we have to pay out \u00a315 for one in a special needs catalogue ?\n\nTHIS IS WRONG !\n\nOur kids deserve to be treated equally and at the moment this isn't happening",
