            "background": "The Financial Services Compensation Scheme currently only pays interest up to the date that a financial institution defaults. \n\nIn the case of Icesave this was 7 October 2008 and it is unfair that no interest is earned from this date to whenever compensation is received, for the following reasons:\n\n1.) Some savers received their money back in November and have been able to earn interest on it since then, but others have to complete a paper form and their compensation may be received in February 2009 with no interest for months.\n\n2.) While some savers are not receiving interest from banks such as Icesave, those with savings in other failed banks have simply been transferred to another bank and have continued to receive interest.",
