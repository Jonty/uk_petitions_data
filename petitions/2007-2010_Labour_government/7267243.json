        "action": "repeal the Licensing Act 2003 to liberalise live entertainment",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The aim of repealing the Licensing Act (2003) is to facilitate entertainment otherwise prevented by the licensing of events or musical acts. A secondary aim is to allow  club/ bar owners to chose when and where they serve patrons instead of requiring mandatory licenses (at a cost) from the local council to determine designated time slots for when they can operate. The government could instead focus on individual cases of abuse rather than hindering the entire entertainment/ alcohol establishment on account of a minority of abuses.",
