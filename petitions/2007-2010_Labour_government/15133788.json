            "background": "When maintenance payments are calculated by the CSA, children who are not related to the non resident parent are taken into consideration, thus reducing the amount that the resident parent receives for the biological child. This needs to be changed so that non resident parents only pay for their biological children. Biological children should not lose out because the absent parent decides to move in with their partner who has children of her own. Their biological father should pay for them.",
