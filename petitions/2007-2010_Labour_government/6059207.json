        "background": "During 2007 a large-scale report on the medical effects of airborne road pollution on children living near busy highways confirmed views, long-held by UK experts, that further augmentation of road transport infrastructure is not consistent with the improved health and well-being of people. \nBy adding your name to this petition you will be sending a clear message to those who govern us that ordinary people want to know the facts about the health consequences of, what are usually irreversible, large-scale changes to the infrastructure of our Nation.\n\nThe most recent (2007) 26th Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution report, \"The Urban Environment\" makes repeated recommendation that, a HIA should be a mandatory component of any considerations for such schemes.",
