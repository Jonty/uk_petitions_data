            "background": "Of course BBC TV/radio broadcast is now 24 hourly continuous service.\n\nHowever, when I think back 15 years or so, when BBC 1 would cease broadcast for the night, at the end of each day, the British national anthem would be played to conclude the days broadcast.\n\nIn the last 15 years or so, I believe TV/radio broadcasting has been in a large way responsible for the decline in British morals... reality TV, unlimited swearing etc. The British public is crying out for a little more moral guidance, in what it should mean to be part of the Great British public. \n\nInstructing the British terrestrial channels to respect the country they are based in by playing the national anthem at around midnight each day, would be I believe a step(even if a very small one) in the right direction.",
