We urge the Prime Minister to put in place a mechanism to guarantee an annual RPI inflation increase on practice income in order to safeguard existing services including clinical staffing levels.  We urge the Prime Minister to ensure that the Quality and Outcomes Framework includes the full recommendations of the General Practitioner Committe (GPC) and not politically motivated targets.  We utterly oppose any move by the Government to unilaterally change GP contracts through imposition and demand that the government acts honourably and above board through open and transparent negotiations with doctors, through the GPC. We duly offer our support to the continued existence of traditional doctor services in our local communities.",
