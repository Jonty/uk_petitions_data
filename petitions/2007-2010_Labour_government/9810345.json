One sure fired way of solving the binge drinking problem is to make anybody who is drunk liable for the cost of any treatment they receive from any NHS facility BEFORE they receive it.  The taxpayer should NOT be made responsible for the consequences of anybody's lack of self control when it comes to alcohol consumption.  There are too many genuinely medically ill people in this country who are being denied taxpayer funded medical treatment because we can't afford it without us also having to pay for the medical treatment necessary after somebody gets themselves drunk on alcohol.",
