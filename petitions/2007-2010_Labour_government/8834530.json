            "background": "Even though smokers are banned from smoking in public places, it doesn't stop them from hanging around doorways.  Therefor, in effect, passive smoking is still going on while people are walking in the streets.  Also, people are spoiling the streets by dropping the cigarette butts on the pavement.  Therefor, I suggest that the Government ban smoking in the streets.",
