They have put forward a suggestion for a Unitary Devon. They advise that the status quo at this stage isn't an option. However the present two tier system with enhanced working between all councils in Devon can and should be supported by Local Government Minister Hazel Blears when she makes the final decision in January 2009. If you support the present two tier system of local government continuing here in Devon please sign this petition.",
