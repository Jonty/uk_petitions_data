        "background": "The Government of the Irish Republic have proposed to end the agreement which allows Citizens of the Irish republic to travel to the United Kingdom (and visa versa) without a Passport.  The reason behind this agreement is historical, the once inclusion of the Irish Republic in the United Kingdom prior to 1921.  It is proposed that Northern Ireland residents must carry their Passport in order to travel (outside of NI) within the United Kingdom.  It is unacceptable that a foreign Government make such a suggestion and must be rejected.  If they wish to end this agreement they must set up border crossing posts (at the land border with the United Kingdom) and have air and sea port border controls. The British Government cannot deny the command issue by Her Majesty \u2018to allow the bearer of this pass freely without let or hindrance\u2019 to their own Citizens travelling within their own Country.",
