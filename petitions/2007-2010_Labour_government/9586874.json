I also don't want him to be replaced by another front bench career politician (Jack Straw, Harriet Harman, etc) who is more concerned with their annual expenses bill and fattening themselves on the public monies.\n\nIf this doesn't happen David Cameron will win the next election.  Do we really want an over-privileged fool and once member of the Bullingdon Club (google it) running the country so he can give handouts to his old school chums?\n\nPlease Mr Brown, step down.",
