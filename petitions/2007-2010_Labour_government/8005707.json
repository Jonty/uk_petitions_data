            "background": "We ask that this government acts to ensure the provision of children's nurses for all children and young people in the UK.There is currently debate about the pre-registration framework for nurse education one proposal is that the children and young people\u2019s nursing field/branch should disappear from pre-registration programmes across the United Kingdom and be replaced by the generic nurse.It is impossible to reconcile this generic model with current public policy, expressed by your own government during the last decade, which places the child and family at the centre of service provision.",
