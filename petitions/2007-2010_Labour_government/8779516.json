            "background": "Not only is the Israeli government in breach of the Geneva Convention regarding collective punishment with relation specifically to Gaza, but also in breach of international law generally with regard to its treatment of occupied Palestine and Palestinians.\nInternational law states specifically that it is the duty of occupying forces to provide security, welfare and rights for those occupied equivalent to those provided for their own people. This Israel has never honoured. On the contrary Israel stands in breach of many United Nations resolutions regarding this and other matters, particularly the continued annexation of land and the building of illegal settlements as well as the killing, injuring of Palestinians and destruction of property and olive trees.\nWe the undersigned call on the Prime Minister to use his moral, legal and historical authority to summon the Israeli Ambassador immediately to account for his government's recent attacks on Gaza and threats of further action and to insist that they are called to a halt and proper action taken to address the rightful needs of Palestinians.",
