        "background": "The high earning and excessive bonus culture is morally wrong, and the government should introduce this high tax band to attempt to cap excessive income in view of the current financial crisis in banking and other sectors. The tax raised may go some small way to help fund the massive pay-outs by government to support the banks. The continued high rewards for financial mismanagement are disgraceful. The culture of high bonuses and greed has been a factor in the current crisis.",
