        "action": "re-introduce Cookery/Home Economics as a required National Curriculum subject, replacing \"Food Techology\"",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Government is constantly trying to reinforce a message of healthy eating to children, but children are increasingly not being taught how to cook at home because parents themselves don't know how to cook. \n\nTraditional cookery/home economics lessons were largely abolished in schools and now where anything about food is taught, it is usually \"Food Technology\".\n\nI was horrified to read about the curriculum for this subject, which is purely theoretical and involves no actual cooking, but instead teaches children about mass factory-production methods and includes designing packaging and learning about irradiation as a method of preserving food!\n\nFood Technology should be abolished as a subject and replaced with traditonal Home Economics, in which children are taught to actually cook real, simple and nutritious food from raw ingredients. This should be compulsory in all primary and secondary schools.",
