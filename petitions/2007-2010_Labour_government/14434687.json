            "background": "Despite promises that all girls\u2019 education was an important priority for Leeds City Council and would always have a place the last state maintained girls single sex school in Leeds (Parklands Girls High) is being threatened with closure.\n\nThis decision deprives parents in the Leeds area of a valuable option for single sex schooling without resorting to independent or private education. However the closure of single sex schools is an issue which affects more than just the residents of Leeds. It is one which if left unchallenged could mean the end of single sex provision across the UK.\n\nWhy is single sex education an important and serious option that should be available to parents?\n\nIt is not just because single-sex schools dominate the top of the examination league tables.\n\nBoys and girls mature at different rates Parents with both sons and daughters will know that they learn in different ways. \n\nGirls can benefit from being in schools that recognise these differences and can provide an education geared specifically to their needs.\n\nSign this petition to ensure that single sex education and in this case all girls\u2019 education is treated with the respect and dedication it deserves.",
