            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We believe that new legislation is needed to protect infants, toddlers, and small children. We therefore ask Parliament to enact legislation making it a criminal offense for parents and carers to leave children under the age of five unsupervised for any length of time, and a minimum babysitter age of 14 for children under five. We understand that there are gray areas but believe that Parliament must be able to enact a law that protects both children and parents, erring on the side of protecting children. We would urge Parliament to include in the legislation a requirement by police to visit a home when such an incident is reported and a mandatory and significant fine in the first instance and the same plus a social services report and possible jail in subsequent instances. Rather than create weak legislation for a greater age range, we ask for stronger legislation for a narrow age range where there is presumably broader agreement.",
