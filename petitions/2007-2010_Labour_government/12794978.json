This includes:\n\n- Schools and other council-owned properties; \n\n- Minerals and waste applications such as gravel extraction;\n \n- landfill sites; and\n\n- energy from waste plants.\n\nWe believe there is a lack of democratic consultation with the community, leading to potentialy biased decisions.\n\nWe call on the office of the Prime Minister to review this planning process, so that the communities affected by such planning decisions feel fully involved in the process.",
