            "background": "Milton Keynes was one of the first cities in England to have a cable network installed.  Whilst this was great at the time it is now and out of date and antiquated system.  Virgin Media who currently own the rights to this network seem unwilling (or incapable) of upgrading this network.  As there are planning rules banning outside (roof aerials) the freeview coverage is poor at best.  We need either the government to fund or subsidise the upgrade of the cable network.",
