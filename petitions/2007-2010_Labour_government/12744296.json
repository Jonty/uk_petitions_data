            "background": "The House of Lords lacks legitimacy because it is based on inheritance, patronage and a restricted representation of faith.  Replacing it with a directly elected review Chamber is not the answer because that Chamber might sometimes challenge the supremacy of the Commons.  We should instead invite various faith groups, eminent institutions and charities, e.g. the RC Church, the Royal College of Surgeons and the NSPCC to elect people from within their memberships to sit in a new \u201cHouse of Elders\u201d.  The selection criteria for candidates should be widely drawn and should become a written part of our constitution.  All candidates would be expected to have provided distinguished service in their respective fields.  The Government of the day should only be able to challenge candidates against the criteria.  Those elected to the new upper house would serve a fixed term of say 8 years irrespective of any changes in government.",
