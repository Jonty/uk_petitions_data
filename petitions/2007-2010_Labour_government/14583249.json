            "background": "As a parent of a disabled child I am deeply concerned about the present debate on assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia. If the law is changed by Parliment to allow this to happen by it could lead to underhand killings. The vunerable and disabled members of our society will be put at risk if they become ill. As a society we should be looking to greatly improve the care we provide to patients should they become severly disabled or are facing death.This should also run in tandem with increased support and help for their carers. I petition that we should leave the law as it is at present and issue the C.P.S. clearer guidelines when to bring cases to court.",
