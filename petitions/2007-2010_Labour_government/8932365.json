            "background": "Teachers always want to be treated as special cases when in fact they already get a very decent wage, have ridiculously long holidays and break times.  Ofcourse they will have us believe that they are working during all this time preparing classes.  Usually this involves making photocopies of the previous years work.  Our children are failing at school because teachers only seem interested in how much money and how many holidays they can get.",
