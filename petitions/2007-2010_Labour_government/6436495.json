            "background": "electric bikes or Electrically assisted pedal cycles are slow, heavy and expensive and are really not making the contribution to sustainable transport that they could be.\nThis petition wishes to look into raising the power available to electric bikes to allow them to travel at 20mph. This would spur innovation and new products more able to take their place on the roads and make them more attractive to buyers who are rightly spurning current products in favour of their cars.\nBattery technology would correspondingly have to improve to allow the range of the bike to be maintained, motor technology would improve and our roads may even loose some cars. Not many of us are fit enough to ride a pedal cycle for any distance and this would help us choose to commute by bike. Safety I hear you cry may go down but anyone who gets on the road still has to obey the traffic laws or quite rightly gets nicked.",
