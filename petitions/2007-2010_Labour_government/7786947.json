            "background": "Many assume that anyone who offers to draft a Will, which disposes of their entire wealth, must be trained and regulated. \nNot so. \nAnyone, including criminals and disgraced solicitors & financial advisers can (and do) become Willwriters and come into contact with the elderly and the vulnerable.\nThe Institute of Professional Willwriters (IPW) believes this is wrong and was formed in 1991 to provide a voluntary regulatory regime. \nOur members must; sit and pass an exam; complete ongoing training; provide a Criminal Records Bureau Disclosure; have professional indemnity insurance of at least \u00a32million and comply with a Code of Conduct which has an independent complaints procedure.\nMost non solicitor Willwriting providers find our standards too challenging and are not members of the IPW.\nWe urge the Prime Minister and the Lord Chancellor to urgently consider that the provision of Willwriting services should be statutorily regulated \u2013 just like any other legal or financial service.",
