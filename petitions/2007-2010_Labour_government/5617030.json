            "background": "Why is is that a large number of council properties are allowed to fall into disrepair and require expensive maintenence when so many are simply abused by the tenants. Council tenents should be made far more responsible for the care and maintenence of their homes. Failure to provide such care should be met with a formal warning and a date for the work to be done and failing the fulfillment of that obligation they should be either fined more than the cost of repair and or evicted. People must understand in this once great country that no one has the right to free housing but that they do have a responsibilty to treat any such provision of housing with respect and care so that future generations may have use of the facility.",
