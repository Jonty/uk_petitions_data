            "background": "There a more than enough signs that the majority of the UK would like to have hunting legalised again. It was not the current Prime Minister's actions that did this, but his predecessor, and so I think that he should call a public vote, and see how many people feel the same way about hunting that I do. Now I'm sure you get many petitions like this, and many say the same thing as this one, but think about this carefully, and especially in times like these, it could bring a lot of popularity back, and that's not a stab at you I assure you.",
