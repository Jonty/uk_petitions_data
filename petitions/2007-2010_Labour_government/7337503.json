            "background": "The government should stop confusing ICT with computer science. They are not the same. The ICT taught at the moment is generally the use of computers suitable for a business environment. However it does not teach the science of how computers work which is required for careers such as computer programming, hardware design etc. This is causing a major skills shortage.",
