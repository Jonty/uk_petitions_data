            "background": "The vast amount of financial assistance available to higher education students seems to offer help to every UK student, however there are some exceptions that have impacts on the lives of many. \nA large number of students wanting to continue into higher education are threatened by the pressure of living costs and often limit the amount of hours dedicated to their course each week to take on up to full-time work. \nMany students I have spoken to state their loan and grant allowance was determined by parent/guardian income, regardless of who was to take responsibility for paying tuition and maintenance fees. \nStudents from higher earning families deserve the same financial support as those from families with lower earnings as it is often the case the student is financially independent from the parent/guardians and is left with the pressure of funding themselves, often adding more debt to be repaid. \nA system that judges individual student\u2019s financial positions rather than their backgrounds, would prove far more beneficial to many and allow a more focussed approach to studies.",
