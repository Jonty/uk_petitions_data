You may therefore have a bank account with Natwest which Experian will know nothing about. But Experian will give you a credit-rating. This should be illegal - such a rating is supersition rather than based on fact. In such an instance Experian should say 'no knowledge use other agency' rather than give an inaccurate and possibly detrimental answer",
