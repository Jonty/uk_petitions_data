        "background": "It is bad enough that the UK has less bank holidays than most of the rest of Europe but to find that England, the biggest contributor to the tax pot, has the least Bank Holidays (Scotland has 9, N Ireland 10 whilst England has 8) requires some redress. A Bank Holiday to recognise our servicemen and women on the first Monday in July and a further holiday to recognise the contibution migrants have made to the nation, sometime in Oct/Nov are just a few to suggest",
