            "background": "I feel it is moraly wrong that vat is put onto common pain relief tablets, cold relief medicines, childrens pain relief, ie:Calpol. These medicines are readily available and give great relief to many people with everyday pains such as toothache, migraine, period pain, infants teething pain, keeping temperature down. Often after a visit to the doctor he may subscribe anti biotics but also suggest pain relief medicine that people have to buy. Also, vat is on ordinary everyday toothpaste, keeping clean teeth is important for good health, (can cause more serious problems within the body). Also vat on\nsanitary towels is not right, these things are not luxury goods but essentials. Transfer the vat to real luxury goods such as alcohol",
