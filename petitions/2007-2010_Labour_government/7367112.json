            "background": "So many minimum sizes do not take into account for the age and size that a particular species of fish has to reach before it can spawn. By killing a fish before it has the chance to spawn we reduce the amount of eggs that are fertilized and ultimately the size of the stock. This can also affect the gene pool which makes the fish stocks left less able to cope with disease and natural pressures. More and bigger fish are beneficial to both commercial fishermen and sea anglers alike, it may also allow the commercial fleet to grow sustainably in the future instead of total decline.",
