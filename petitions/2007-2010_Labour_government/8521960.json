            "background": "This petition is to give our underfunded forces a 'perk' for thier service to this country. Soldiers on weekend breaks in the UK often spend lots of thier hard earned money to get home to see loved ones from say Southampton to Glasgow!  Often forcing soldiers to spend weekends in a barracks, especially the younger soldiers who cannot drive.  And with the unpredictable nature of the armed forces routine left unable to book cheap fares in advance. Please give this your consideration",
