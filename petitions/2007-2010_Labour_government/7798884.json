        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Ama Sumani, aged 39, is receiving dialysis in Cardiff, as cancer has severely damaged her kidneys. She has publicly stated that if she is deported she will die within a few weeks.Her visa has expired and she cannot pay the fees for treatment in Ghana. She has a malignant myeloma, ordinarily treated with a bone marrow transplant, yet this is not available to her on the NHS because she is not a UK citizen. I thought people were granted asylum in this country in cases where returning to their country of origin presented a serious risk to their lives. I think this is such a case; she is being deported to face her death.",
