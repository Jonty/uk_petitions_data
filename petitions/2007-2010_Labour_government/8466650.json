During his time with the infamous band Sigue Sigue Sputnik, he kept his hair tied at the top of his crown - a 'top-knot' effect.  Sadly, now he no longer possesses it.  \n\nWe the undersign petition the Prime Minister to force Mr. James to reinstate it, be it naturally or prosthetically.  \n\nWe believe it will bestow 'gravitas' and bearing upon him, and greatly boost his standing with fans of his band Carbon Silicon.  Do it for all of us, Tony!",
