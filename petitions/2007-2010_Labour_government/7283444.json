            "background": "Japan kills more than 1,000 whales a year in the Antarctic and also the Pacific Ocean, causing bitter rows with mostly Western nations which call the hunt barbaric.\nJapanese officials are giving out the usual nonsense about this being a \"scientific\" mission. It's not. They plan on killing 50 humpback whales and 935 minke whales.\nFamilies waved little flags emblazoned with smiling whales and the crew raised a toast with cans of beer, while a brass band played \"Popeye the Sailor Man.\n\"The whalers plan to kill up to 50 humpbacks in what is believed to be the first large-scale hunt for the once nearly extinct species since a 1963 moratorium in the Southern Pacific put the giant marine mammals under international protection.\n\nFlags with smiling whales? No hypocrisy there.\n\nJapan has used a loophole in the two-decade international moratorium on commercial whaling that allows the killing of whales for research. \n\nLies. \n\nJapan makes no secret that the meat ends up on Japanese dinner plates and has led an international campaign to resume outright whaling, accusing Western nations of cultural imperialism.\n\nWe must put a stop to ALL whaling as it serves NO purpose, research or otherwise.",
