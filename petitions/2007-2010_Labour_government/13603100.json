            "background": "Kids today are taught at school how to eat properly, the importance of exercise and even how to have safe sex. But when it comes to sleep, something which takes up a third of our lives, there's not even a whisper. Poor sleep habits from an early age can lead to long term sleep problems and are directly linked to obesity, heart disease, mental illness and other life threatening conditions in later life. Day time tiredness in young students in this age of technology is an increasing problem. Schools need to address this by giving them more formalised information about the benefits of good sleep and how to achieve it. Our education system should take this on board in a serious and structured way.",
