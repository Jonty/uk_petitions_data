        "background": "The Home Secretary has deemed it appropriate not to backdate the Police Pay deal to September 1st, instead starting the increase from December 1st.  This equates to only a 1.9% rise, not the 2.5% quoted.  Taking into account inflation, Officers are on a daily basis, putting their lives on the line for an actual cut in pay.  The decision not to backdate has meant that the average officer will be around \u00a3200 worse off from the September to December period.",
