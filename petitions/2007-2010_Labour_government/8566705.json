            "background": "To not allow girls under 18 to have an abortion without parents consent.\nNo girl is in a fit state of mind to make a decision like this without her parents knowing. \nSo many girls are getting abortions without their parents knowledge and are suffering in silence.\nThe numbers of abortions that girls under 18 are having, is continuing to rise.  Sadly, it is only after these young girls have had abortions they realise they have done the wrong thing and the consequences will live with them for the rest of their lives.\nMany parents who do know that their child has had abortion are also suffering.\nGirls under 18 being allowed to have abortions without parents consent is undermining parents authority.",
