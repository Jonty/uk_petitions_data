            "background": "Its cost is to increase, according to the EC itself, by 3 bn GBP, and is to be paid by European taxpayers. We British taxpayers DON'T want to pay, and the government is constitutionally obliged to obey us. The REAL reason the private consortium collapsed is that Galileo is unprofitable. Moreover, it WON'T be civilian - the EC has ALREADY admitted that it will have military users. Furthermore, as the Chinese are also involved in it, it will worsen Britain's relations with the US.",
