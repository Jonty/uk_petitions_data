            "background": "We believe that Mr Peter McGuigan should be honoured at the earliest opportunity for his roles as former chief executive of a major UK brand and as Chairman of a non league football team that recently achieved promotion. In his former chief executive role at his services to business, especially resurrecting a great British brand are unparalleled. In his role as chairman of his football club his commitment to youth development, providing jobs and regeneration to a once beleaguered seaside town are of the highest order. We therefore request that this man be honoured for services to Business and to Football.",
