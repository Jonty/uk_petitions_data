            "background": "This very simple legal requirement-enabling the immediate spotting of any discrepancy between claimed income to the Inland Revenue and claimed income for any mortgage application for residential property purchase-would end the UK residential property bubble which in our view is based on massive and fraudulent over-declaration of income by very large numbers of mortgage applicants.The legislation should be made retrospective to the beginning of 2001 to enable this simple check to be carried out on already approved mortgage applications for recent past years also.",
