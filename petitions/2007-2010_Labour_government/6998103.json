            "background": "A scientific report stated that culling badgers would not make any significate difference to the spread of TB in cows. The new scientific report states that culling 80% of badgers in specific areas 'may' stop the spread. It has not done so in Ireland so why should it do so here? 95% of the British Public are against this cull, as far as I can see it is only farmers who are for it.",
