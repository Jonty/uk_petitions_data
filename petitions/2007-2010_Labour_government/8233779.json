I want the councils to do their duty as landlords and visit each property they give free rents for. Then they should calculate a unemployed persons assets and charge them a appropriate amount towards paying council tax, also they should not get their full rents paid. Obvious examples of wealth would be sky TV, Broadband , mobile phones, vehicles, tools etc.",
