            "background": "The undersigned believe that the Prime Minister should ensure that all regulators of prices and quality correctly perform their jobs and monitor the rate of inflation. This is to make sure that customers of products and services are paying a sensible amount of money for what they are recieving, and that inflation does not go further than it need.\n\nWe the undersigned believe that the government should ensure that independant regulators of the industry and the economy correctly perform their purpose and step in when something is not realistic and is taking advantage of customers.\n\nFor example, it is believed that one week the price of Corned Beef was 74p at a major supermarket, and was the next week \u00a31.17. Eventaully, people will not be able to live, especially when the heating, fire and hot water is required during the winter. Otherwise, many people and elderly people will die with no cause other than greed and bad regulation.\n\nPerhaps, instead of just focusing on regulating communications and phone scandals, the government should also ensure the economy is properly regulated.",
