The nearest snowdome is still atleast a minimum of an hours drive away to tamworth! The costs alone of that even if you can't drive is ridiculous via train! We need something more local that would generate more interest in the sport for the people of leicester! So please, build us a snow dome in Leicester so that the pointless travelling can stop, so that leicester finally has that \"thing\" to be recognised for and so that more young people can get learning snow sports rather than messing around on the streets of leicester!",
