        "background": "Whilst we do nor expect our governments to seek a mandate for each of the unexpected decisions that form the normal business of government, by no stretch of the imagination, can these extraordinary events, with the near collapse of the banking system and huge amounts of public money being spent, be considered \u201cnormal government\u201d.\n\nThe PM has not been democratically elected either by the country or by his party. There is no mandate for what is surely the most important decisions we as a nation face in a generations: decisions which tie the hands of future governments and potentially leave us indebted for generations to come.\n\nWe call upon the PM to go to the country as soon as is practical, for the government and the opposition parties to lay out their plans for the economy, for the country to hold the necessary public debate on the future of the UK, and for the people of the UK to decide which government to return with the democratic authority to tackle this crisis.\n\n(N.B. there must be a general election on or before Thursday 3 June 2010.)",
