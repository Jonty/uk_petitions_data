        "background": "A publicly funded exhibition is encouraging people to deface the Bible in the name of art \u2014 and visitors have responded with abuse and obscenity.\n\nThe show includes a video of a woman ripping pages from the Bible and stuffing them into her bra, knickers and mouth.\n\nThe open Bible is a central part of Made in God\u2019s Image, an exhibition at the Gallery of Modern Art (Goma) in Glasgow. By the book is a container of pens and a notice saying: \u201cIf you feel you have been excluded from the Bible, please write your way back into it.\u201d\n\nThe exhibition has been created by the artists Anthony Schrag and David Malone, in association with organisations representing gay Christians and Muslims.\n\nThe producers of the exhibition have indicated that the most offensive pages would be removed, but we believe the Bible and the video should be removed  and the exhibition should be put to an end. This exhibition is an absolute disgrace and disrepect to Christianity, it is unacceptable that such Blasphemy is not only displayed as art, but publically funded.",
