            "background": "A recent BBC documentary highlighted that thousands of lives are lost because people in danger from fire often remain stationary and don't evacuate as they don't phsically see the fire despite the presence of smoke in a room.\n\nThis petition to simply change the wording of FIRE evacuation placards and signs to SMOKE evacuation placards removes the need for people to stop and wonder if there's actually a fire before they decide to evacuate a building or vessel.\n\nBy emphasising that smoke alone is enough reason to raise the alarm and leave, my save lives.",
