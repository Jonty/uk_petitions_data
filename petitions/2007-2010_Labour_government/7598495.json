We need to adjust to high prices and scarcity, and the sooner the better. People have a right to campaign and protest to raise awareness of their issues, but not to threaten the lifeblood of the country by blockading. The Prime Minister needs to resist anyone attempting to hold the country to ransom for their own gain, and keep our infrastructure running smoothly.",
