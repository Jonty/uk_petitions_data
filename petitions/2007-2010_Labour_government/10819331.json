        "action": "reintroduce MIRAS (mortgage interest relief at source) for mortgages incepted before 30th September 2007 on owner occupied main residences, limited to the interest on \u00a350k of the outstanding loan.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "With the economy worsening daily and uncertainty over employment and incomes increasing, coupled with the imminent expiry of many homeowners' discounted mortgage rates, the credit crunch may be about to bite with catastrophic consequences.\nThe simple fiscal measure of reintroducing MIRAS for a limited period may equate to a monetary intervention not available to the Bank of England. It may stave off mortgage arrears and the consequent home repossessions, thereby averting a property price crash and the paralysing effects of negative equity.\nThe relief should be limited to standard commercial mortgages incepted before the obvious onset of the credit crunch, illustrated by the failure of the Northern Rock in September 2007. It would apply to the interest on first mortgages on owner occupied main residences at a rate of 20% (the basic tax rate) for up to \u00a350k of the outstanding loan, and be non-transferable.",
