            "background": "We the undersigned believe it was wrong to take away the power of the House of Lords to reject bills. We believe that they should have the power to properly scutinize and reject useless or corrupt bills. This is to better protect our law from abuse by only on House having the power.\n\nWe also believe that hereditary lords must have the right to sit in parliament, and that the commons should not have the right to appoint new lords. This is to protect the House of Lords from party political lords from the main parties, when the House of Lords should be above party politics like the Queen is.\n\nWe therefoe petition the Prime Minister to repeal the Parliament Act 1911, the Parliament Act 1949, and the House of Lords Act 1999.",
