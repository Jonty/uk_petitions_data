        "background": "Not everyone can afford to buy their own accommodation (even now prices seems to have gone down) or to rent privately.  EVERYONE needs, and is entitled to, secure accommodation which is also affordable and which reaches decent minimum standards of health and comfort; this is, or at least should be, a basic human right.  If the Government can afford to wage war in Iraq and Afganistan, and to fund sporting jamborees like the Olympics, it can surely afford secure, decent, and affordable accommodation for everyone.",
