            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We believe that multi-buy promotions, such as 'buy one get one free' or 'three for the price of two' promote excessive consumption with adverse effects including obesity, excessive alcohol consumption, waste and carbon emission/climate change. They also are detrimental to the interests of low-income and smaller households. We believe that retailers and others who wish to price-promote their products should simply reduce the the price so that 'buy one get one free' should become 'half price' or 'three for two' becomes 'a third off' allowing consumers to benefit from the promotion while buying the quantity they actually require. We believe the Government should bring forward legislation to outlaw this form of promotion.",
