            "background": "British ex-pats in the South of Spain are organising themselves to strongly oppose eight demolition orders recently issued to British residents in the town of Albox, Almeria.\n\nWe are protesting against legal and planning uncertainty, against bad administration and corruption, against the failure to respect citizens\u2019 human rights and against the failure of the administration to comply with European Parliament resolutions including the Auken report.\n\nWe cannot sit back and watch these demolitions and will do everything possible to avoid this injustice.\n  \nWe are not prepared to stand politely by as more unfortunate families are destroyed through no fault of their own. Recourse to further demolitions will only further damage Spain\u2019s image abroad.  The authorities must be made to realise that to continue with these actions is not acceptable, is contrary to the rights of its citizens, attracts damaging and hostile publicity and is tantamount to economic suicide in this region.\n\nWe ask all citizens and groups who wish to raise their voice and make their presence felt to turn up and support us.",
