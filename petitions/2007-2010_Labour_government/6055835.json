            "background": "In October 2006 FAREPAK went into administration losing over 150,000 families ALL of their SAVINGS. The Government set up an appeal fund and tried to help but with only 10 weeks for Christmas their wasn't any time to do much.None of the savings were ring fenced for the security of the customers.Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP were called to this firm in JANUARY 06 with referance to the CHOICE VOUCHER which FAREPAK BOSSES CHANGED TO BONUSBOND VOUCHERS by February of the same year,also it seems that alledgedly the money that had been saved with Farepak was used to bolster other companies and pay off masive overdrafts. The key person involved with Farepak and the other company EHR was Sir Clive Thompson, he was the Chairman at the time. The ADMIN firm being used now are called BDO Stoy Hayward and they forcast at BEST a mere 0.05p for every \u00a31.00 lost.This is not a person who deserves a Title, we feel very strongly that it should be removed as soon as possible",
