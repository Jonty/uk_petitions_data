            "background": "EMA applications are taken from the last tax year. For students of parents who have been made redundant, but couldn't claim in the past, this means they cannot claim until the following tax year. They may have to struggle for up to a year before they can get any type of support which I think is very unfair because they may not be able to afford books, equipment ect and therefor miss out on the good education that they are entitled to compare to some who can claim EMA.",
