            "background": "We the people sign this petition in  protest to christmas values being exploited for financial gain, and for chrismtas traditions to not faul foul of being turned into no more than marketing spin. more specifically in simon cowells x factor completely destroying the traditions of the the race to christmas number one in the uk charts. it is very unspirited indeed and promotes greed and capitalism in the highest degree, whils stomping on the most sacred and oldest tradition of our country. whilst aknowleging the more pressing issues of the nation do deserve proprity, we feel that the morale of the country would be boosted by a return of this tradition. whilst action may be difficult public govenment support would be apreciated by all who sign here, and would like to see something done about the realease date of future songs from these competitions. if any competition for singers wishes to release a single they should have as much right as anyone else. in this case however i see no harm in them releasing their kareoke singles in january returning our chrismtas traditions. we would also like to bring attention to the money raised for charity in name of our cause.",
