            "background": "There are currently insufficient incentives to encourage drivers to switch to greener motoring. We want the government to do more to make green motoring cheaper and more widely available to the masses rather than levying higher taxes on less fuel efficient cars in isolation. This could be done by helping to fund research and development of lower emission vehicles and by developing a strategy to significantly reduce the pricing of new greener cars.",
