            "action": "reconsider the reduction in funding for the City of Bristol College for the financial year 2010/11. This reduction will significantly affect the provision of courses to a wide range of vulnerable and disadvantaged communities in Bristol and South Gloucestershire, at a time when front-line support and qualifications are needed most to help those in work develop their skills and for the unemployed to get back to work.",

            "background": "The College has received total adult funding of \u00a314 million in 2009/10. The position for 2010/11 is a proposed allocation of \u00a311.6 million which is a reduction compared to this year\u2019s funding of \u00a32.4 million or 17%.\nThe proposed cuts will:\n\n1 \nRemove \u00a31.4 million of funding for developmental learning in such things as aeronautical engineering, plumbing, electrical installation, care and teaching assistants.\n\n2 \nRemove a further \u00a31 million of funding for LSC priority provision in areas such as construction, care and business\n\n3 \nResult in a direct loss of 3,000 adult training places \n\n4 \nLead to a devastating impact on local community provision including a threat to the viability of community/voluntary sector partners\n\n5 \nContribute to a financial crisis for the College which is opening a new centre (the South Bristol Skills Academy) in August 2010 with mortgage servicing payments of \u00a31.6 million per year\n\nThe overall impact of the reduction in income, without College action, shows a projected deficit of \u00a36.1 million in 2010/11 and a further deterioration in 2011/12, which will have devastating impact on students / learners, staff jobs, businesses and the community.",
