        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We call for government support of metal and glass industries, hit by low demand from the car industry, to manufacture photovoltaic and water heating building panels, and wind turbines, to help all our domestic, public and commercial properties be more energy independent and even to provide power to the national grid, eliminating our need for new power stations, and freeing billions of pounds for investment.\nWith government funding every building could produce it own Brown\u2019s gas for heating, cooking, or powering a range of manufacturing processes; or stored and used to generate electricity when the Sun\u2019s not shining nor the wind blowing. Eliminating dependence on natural gas supplies.\nSuch government support would stimulate huge new industries employing many thousands of people on an ongoing basis creating, manufacturing, retailing, installing, and maintaining their products.\nAfter manufacture, these products will have little associated carbon footprint compared to other energy options.",
