            "background": "We have just received our Resident's Parking Permit renewal, and am disgusted to see an approx 30% rise in costs. Mayor Livingstone might get a 30% pay rise but we are lucky to get 3%. Residents are being priced out of being able to park outside their own homes and this is just not fair. Residents permits should be capped at no more than \u00a340. With the increase of front drive parking, it is more difficult than ever to find a space in the street, even more so outside your own home.",
