            "background": "Rather than lessening the production of crops for food or threatening the continued existence of tropical rain forests for land to be set aside for the production of bio-fuel crops, replacing crops anywhere in the world that are used to produce illegal drugs would give the growers an alternative income to live on. There would also be less lives wrecked as a result of heroin addiction, less drug related crime, and crops for bio-fuels would be produced that would be less damaging to the environment than fossil fuels.",
