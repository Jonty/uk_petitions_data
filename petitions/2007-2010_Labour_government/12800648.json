            "background": "i am making this petition for all young aldults out there who fell like they are undermined because of thier age. i believe that 15 year old should be allowed to drive mopeds limited to 30mph to show that the government trust them to have this responsablity. It will also help the current economical crises as younger adults will be buying these mopeds as a travel item. It will allow students that live further for there school location to arrive on time.",
