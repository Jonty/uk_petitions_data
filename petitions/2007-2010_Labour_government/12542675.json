        "background": "We want the Visteon factories to remain open, being nationalised, to keep the workers working and not losing their skills. In the same way that the government has offered millions to bailout the banking system, we demand that the government provides funding for re-training and re-tooling, with the factories running under workers democratic control, providing the next green generation of public transport and providing workers with cheap, reliable and green transport.",
