        "action": "Stop pigeons from roosting under railway bridges via humane methods",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Pigeons only choose to roost under railway bridges because the girders are not covered up properly. Old-style traditional netting does not work, as it becomes loose and birds can find their way in. Unfortunately, they cannot always find their way out again, and therefore become trapped and either die or become injured.\n\nWe are trying to get local councils to put up wood or concrete boards to completely cover up the girders. This will force pigeons and other birds to roost in a more natural habitat such as trees and woodlands. This, in turn, will reduce the number of birds becoming injured or killed, and reduce the droppings associated with railway bridges.\n\nPlease sign our petition, as everyone will benefit.\n\nThe Wildlife Lodge",
