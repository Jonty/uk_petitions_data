        "background": "The Department for Children Schools and Families is consulting on proposals to permit extended family members to apply to the Court for leave to apply for contact rights in respect of children.  This would result in increased cost and stress for parents already suffering in cases of divorce and widowhood.  In extreme examples, multiple applications could be made to Court for contact resulting in the core family unit being unsettled and increase antagonism between family members.",
