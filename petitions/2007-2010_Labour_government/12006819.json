The quality of life for many patients would be greatly improved if they could collect all the prescriptions prescribed for them.\n\nSince April 2007 all patients in Wales have been entitled to free prescription and in Scotland patients irrespective of whether the patients have a chronic illness or not are paying for their prescriptions at a reduced rate on a sliding scale until 2011-2012 when they will become free is this just?",
