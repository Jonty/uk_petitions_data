            "background": "The current prices we pay for fuel are far too high.  The USA and GB are fighting the same wars in the middle east, yet their average pence per litre for unleaded petrol (Regular, 95 RON) was around 37.5p as of 2005; where as our average of that time was 96.7p - A clear 59 pence above what USA citizens are charged.  \n\nOur Government should not abuse our right to personal transport by charging the earth to use it.  Why we pay over 150% more per litre than USA citizens do is disgusting.  A breakdown of what we would pay if petrol was 90pence a litre, shows that over 50% of what we pay is duty.  That figure is down right out of order and needs to be reduced.",
