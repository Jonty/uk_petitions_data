            "background": "The goverment is now amending the Victims of Crime charge to include on the spot motoring fines.  This is nonsense.  Why should motorist foot the bill for every other crime committed in the UK.  Currently anyone fined by the courts for any offence is charged an extra \u00a315 to help victims of crime.  Yet if a person goes to jail for an offence but isn't charged they pay nothing.  Yet these are the people whose offences generally hurt others. How about fining these people.  Is that too much like common sense?",
