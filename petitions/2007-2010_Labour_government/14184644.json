            "background": "Previous rules were that EU nationals were allowed to look for work here but had to transport their own country's benefits & didn't get any UK benefits so that they weren't a burden to the UK taxpayer. However they now get UK benefits- means tested jobseekers allowance, tax credits, housing benefits,UK child benefit & free NHS treatment & prescriptions. Returning to the previous system would not prevent EU nationals looking for, or working here - as is their right to choose - but it would stop the UK taxpayer from having to fund their choice, especially in this time of proposed massieve cuts to our public services.",
