They remember the day their child would have been born, causing great emotional suffereing.\nWhat is needed is better informed and more directional sex education to allow young girls to know that they don\u2019t have to go the route of promiscuity.\nIt will be a very sad day for our country.  The emotional aftermath would be horrendous and the additional medical costs for emotional problems cannot be measured.\nThe nature of advertising is to be glamorous and make the product appealing.  This will follow the route  and marketing of all such advertising and have devastating affects on the moral nature of this country.\n\nRev. E. Roberts",
