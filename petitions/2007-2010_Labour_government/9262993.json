            "background": "As responsible adults we should be ensuring that the age of consent is raised for the reasons below and for other reasons like human trafficking into this country with girls under 18 forced into sex while being told if they are over 16 its legal.\n\nCasual sex is rife among young people, with almost a third losing their virginity before the age of consent, authoritative research shows. \n\nCampaigners blamed the Government for failing to tackle the problem properly, despite having put millions of pounds into sex education and contraceptives. The UK teenage pregnancy rate is still the highest in Western Europe and costs the Government an estimated \u00a363million a year. \n\n\n A very clever man said 'This survey presents a disturbing picture of high levels of promiscuity that are clearly not being addressed by the Government's insistence on promoting a \"safer sex\" message. \n\n'The emphasis should not be on normalising condom use, but on normalising sexual restraint outside the context of a lifelong and faithful marriage, which is the only sure way to prevent the spread of sexually-transmitted infections.",
