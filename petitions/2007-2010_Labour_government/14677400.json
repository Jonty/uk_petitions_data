            "background": "The Court of Appeal has granted permission for a Hindu to have an open air funeral pyre. This ruling to many in this country is abhorrent and the fact that the person who has taken this matter to the Court of Appeal has stated that he no objections to this taking place in a building or permanent structure leads me to question why can he not be cremated in a crematorium.  Funeral pyres go against the 1902 Cremation Act where it is unlawful to burn human remains anywhere other than a crematorium - so why is the Court of Appeal granting this when it is clearly in breach of the law?  It also begs the question about planning permission to build structures in areas of beauty to accommodate these wishes where normally planning permission would not be given for any kind of structure at all.  Does this also mean that others lose the right to certain areas of the countryside because the area becomes designated area for this purpose?  I respect other peoples regligions and beliefs but it seems to me that bit by bit we are losing sight of our own traditions and laws. There are far more important things to spend tax payers money on than court cases such as this.",
