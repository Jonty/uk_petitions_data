        "background": "We the undersigned, petition the Prime Minister Gordon Brown MP, to formally call upon the BBC Director General to allow the DEC humanitarian appeal for Gaza to be shown on the BBC; and add further that other broadcasters who have refused to show the appeal such as Sky should be asked too. We note that this is the first DEC appeal in 48 years to be refused airtime by the BBC. \n\nWe congratulate ITV, Channel 4 and Five, and the Prime Minister's own No. 10 website for showing the humanitarian appeal by the DEC.\n\nWe also call for the Prime Minister to ask the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee to bring the BBC Trust to Parliament, to explain their Director General's unfair, harmful and irrational decision to Parliamentarians.",
