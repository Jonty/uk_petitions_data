            "background": "Working in retail can be stressful.  This can often be caused by the work load itself but can be made worse when selling age restricted items.\nMany retailers may find it incredibly intimidating to ask for identification from a member of the public who doesn't look 18 (for alcohol).\nI believe that by enforcing a \"No ID, No sale\" for every member of the public rather than a \"No ID, No sale [unless you look over 25]\" law would result in much fewer illegal sales to underage youngsters and would limit the number of threatening behavior retailers face also.\n\nFurthermore, I would like to ask the Prime Minister to enforce a law that would ban supervisors and managers from over-ruling a customer assistants decision to refuse sale to a member of the public under age restricted circumstances.",
