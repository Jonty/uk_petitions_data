        "background": "The prime Minister is constantly putting up taxes, telling us how to cut down our spenditure to survive with the credit crunch,yet the government is quite happy to use over a \u00a31million/yr for travelling duties using taxpayers money.Surely he should address the issues in the UK before attempting other projects.\n\nThe 'going Green' issue-he should lead by example & not be chauffeured about in a gas guzzler...possibly a bicycle. Electric cars will make no effect to the environment as electricity comes from oil where the prices are still high and it will create emissions at sites around the world. Where is the sense?\n\nExpenses- Why do MPs need Taxpayers money to pay for luxuries to their 2nd home and top of the range furnishings to their office? If we have to pay our way then surely they should? In todays society people can not afford one house let alone 2. Surely their expense budget should be kept to a minimum in this time of chaos and need. \n\nI see no effort from him to help anyone in crisis. People with power are supposed to be leading us into good times not contradicting what he is dictating.\n\nGordon...lead by example or leave",
