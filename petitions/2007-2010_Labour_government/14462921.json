            "background": "Bolton council should not be allowed to remove roadside tributes after a period of 30 days.  There is no time limit on grief, and they are doing no harm.  Removing tributes to people who have tragically died is basically masking the real problems of drink driving, knife and gun crime etc.  Bolton council should stop being petty and focus on the real problems.",
