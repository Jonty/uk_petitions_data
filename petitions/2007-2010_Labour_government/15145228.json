            "background": "We the undersigned demand that the Prime Minister ban members of the BNP from being employed as teachers in British schools. We stand in opposition to the recent decision by the Chief Inspector of Schools Maurice Smith and the Government to allow members of the BNP to remain as teachers. We believe this to be incompatible with the values intrinsic to a well balanced education and wrong in principle. Membership of the BNP or any extremist party is inimical to the ethos of a balanced progressive curriculum. We believe that children should be protected from all those who promote hatred. Teacher attitude to culture and race are important in particular in relation in areas such as teacher expectations, the teaching of history, ethics and religious studies. We call upon the Government to reverse their decision.",
