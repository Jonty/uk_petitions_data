            "background": "Currently in Britain transsexual people can have their birth certificate changed to reflect the gender they identify with, and then use that gender on paperwork.\n\nBut some people don't feel they identify as \"Male\" or \"Female\", and may identify as both, or neither. These individuals are forced in everyday life to choose between one or the other or be assigned a gender on paperwork like job applications, driving licence, passport, school records, etc. This can bring additional distress to people who are already in a difficult situation. \n\nSomething as simple as even a \"N/A\" or \"Other\" option on forms asking for gender would be a great improvement over the current strict \"Male\" and \"Female\" options. \n\nPeople who identify as the Third Gender should have the right to be officially recognized as that, rather than their designated gender at birth which was forced on them.",
