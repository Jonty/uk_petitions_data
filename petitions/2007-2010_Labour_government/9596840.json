            "background": "In the last 6 months due to massive rises in steel (and lesserly so energy prices and diesel) our entire engineering sector is at risk of collapse.  Further massive prices are expected with \u00a31000 per tonne expected by Christmas (was \u00a3365 last December).\n\nIf this continues as expected then 10's of 1000 of workers will be unemployed by the end of the year and another great industry will be lost and we will be even more a country of \"service industries\".\n\nSteel prices are run by a monopoly in the UK so please put pressure on the company or limit steel prices as other companies have done before it is too late.",
