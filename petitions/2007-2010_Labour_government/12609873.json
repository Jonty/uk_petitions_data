Is there one vice you do not possess? Ye have no more religion than my horse; gold is your god; which of you have not bartered your conscience for bribes?\u2026 Ye are grown intolerably odious to the whole nation; ye were deputed here by the people to get grievances redress'd, and are yourselves gone\u2026 You have sat far too long here for any good you have been doing. DEPART I SAY AND LET US HAVE DONE WITH YOU. IN THE NAME OF GOD, GO!\"",
