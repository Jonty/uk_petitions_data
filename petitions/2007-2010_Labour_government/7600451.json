            "background": "If you run an average car on LPG rather than petrol/diesel it will produce only about 1/5th or 20% as much pollution, yet cars such as the Volvo V40 duel fuel (factory fitted LPG conversion) still have to pay the same tax as a 'normal' car. Given that such vehicles are recognised by the London congestion charge as being better for the environment, why doesn't the government prove it really means what it says and encourage these much cleaner cars by charging a lower road tax rate?",
