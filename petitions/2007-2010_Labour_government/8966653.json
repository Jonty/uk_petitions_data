            "background": "Provide funding for the UK development and manufacture of zero carbon road vehicles (both cars and vans) with a target on the road cost of \u00a35000 for release to the UK market within 5 years.  Vehicles should have a target lifetime of at least 10 years before needing replacing.  One suggested technology is compressed air engines.  It should be possible to fund this from the increased predicted revenues for VED and fuel duty between 2008 and 2010.",
