            "background": "Government plans to use money in \"dormant\" bank and building society accounts to fund community projects were unveiled in the Queen's Speech. \nCash from untouched accounts will be taken and reinvested in youth facilities and social investment through the Big Lottery Fund. Whilst these can be considered to be good causes, we already pay our tax for the government to carry out its duty in providng support for these causes already. \n\nThis bill should not be allowed. We have paid our taxes and continue to do so through the lifetime of an account. This is theft. They are running out of ways to tax us, so now they take our own money out of our accounts. \n\nThe government will never give you your money back and when you ask, the chnaces are the amount of paperwork and proof to be provided will far outway that which a bank would demand. \n\nI say let the government fund things properly, without the theft of the publics money out of their own accounts.",
