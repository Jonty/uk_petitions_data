        "background": "Make prisons a harsher place for prisoners to be, make conditions so that they will not want to go back to prison after all they have committed a crime. People who are in prison are there because they have committed a crime yet they live the life of luxury. They have in-cell televisions (licences paid for by the taxpayer), 3 meals a day, heat, computers, sport, facilities for gambling (lottery)  even Compensation for loss of their human rights, about anything they want all paid for by the taxpayer.  Take away TV\u2019s make life more harsh for them, make them spend more time in their cells, make them serve their entire sentence and take away their human rights.  Make the punishment fit the crime, their victims did not have human rights when they had the crime committed against them, therefore why should prisoners?",
