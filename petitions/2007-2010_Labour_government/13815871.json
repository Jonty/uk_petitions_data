            "background": "Much ado has been made in the last few weeks about Lord Mandelson and the 'three strikes' policy that he is intending on legislating.  Please can someone sit Lord Mandelson down with an \"Idiots guide to Filesharing and the Record Labels\" to educate him that the facts he is basing his decisions on are blatant lies.  We should not be forced into this legislation which will have little or no due process, and removes the presumption of innocence until proven guilty.",
