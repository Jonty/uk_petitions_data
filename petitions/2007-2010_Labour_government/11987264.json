        "background": "Acorns childrens hospice is a hospice that give vital support and care for terminally ill children. Not only do they support the children but the parents too giving advice and support when the time comes to say goodbye to their children. At the moment Acorns recieve most of their funding throught public or private donations. Little of their funding comes from the gouvernment. With the current economic situation Britan is in Acorns are getting less funding as people cannot aford it. A consiquence of this is that Acorns are having to make redundant their community team which play an important role in booking stay, over seeing the familys and children within their own homes. This is about to stop because they cannot afford to pay them. I am pettitioning to get more funding for Acorns Children's Hospice.",
