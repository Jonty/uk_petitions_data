        "background": "New car tax rates for 2009  \nAlistair Darling has unveiled changes to vehicle excise duty - reclassifying vehicles according to the levels of carbon dioxide they emit. \n\nWhile it should be good news for those with environmentally-friendly cars, it will hike the amount paid by owners of high-polluting vehicles who also face a \"showroom tax\" payable in the first year after they buy a new gas-guzzler. It will also hit poorer families with older cars who cannot afford to upgrade to a newer car with less emissions. \n\nSome families may find themselves paying \u00a3400 a year.\n\nVehicle tax should go on usage of vehicle & not on Co2.",
