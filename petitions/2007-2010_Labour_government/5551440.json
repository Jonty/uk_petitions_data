            "background": "Religion is a divisive force within any society and as such has no place in education aimed at producing open minded and intelligent citizens. The inclusion of a religious assembly at the start of the school day is merely an invitation to become brainwashed and steeped in the precepts of an irrelevant fable. Ensuring this happens in state sponsored schools is unforgivable as the aim of education is to produce people who think for themselves and don't require others to do their thinking for them. It also contravenes the freedom of association recently enshrined in law and by being the propogation of myths it infringes Protcol 1, Article 2 of the Human Rights act (The right to effective edication[Para]). We ask the PM to ensure that religious assemblies are banned form all school activities and that he undertakes to ensure that they never infringe on neither individuals' freedoms nor their education again.",
