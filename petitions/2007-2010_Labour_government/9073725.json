            "background": "In the course of their personal and professional daily lives people require at times to stop at the side of the road to carry out various tasks i.e. unload their cars of shopping or goods, enable the elderly or infirmed to get out of the car in a place which more convenient, Drop the children at a safe distance to their school, Make delivery of heavy items to premises or just allow passengers in general to enter or exit the vehicle. If such people are not causing an obstruction and are stopped in a sensible place and there are no legal parking spaces available a CCTV parking fine should not be issued. Only in the event that the vehicle is causing an obstruction or the driver refuses to comply with the direct request of a traffic warden should a ticket be issued.\nFurther to this if vehicles are prevented from stopping to carry out these simple tasks they will be forced to circulate in order to find a parking space in another location adding to congestion and carbon emissions and taking the space from someone who genuinely needs to park causing them to circulate also and again causing higher carbon emission and congestion.",
