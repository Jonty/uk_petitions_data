            "background": "With the unlawful, misjudged decision to invade Iraq it has become our responsibility towards the people of Iraq to do all possible to support them. Day-in and day-out we are coming to the same conclusion that military power is not the solution to the rise of poverty and death tool in Iraq. We need to empower the Iraqi government to do all possible for national reconciliation between the different religious groups and we should be seen as an impartial partner in the process if we are to play an influential role. It is within our own interest to see an emerging democracy in that part of the world, and it will restore our tarnished image in the Middle East and around the world. We have sufficient talent, expertise and history to achieve this. We just need to restore our confidence in our own capabilities. Cut-and-run scenario can be appealing from the view of a ballot-box. But the easy option is, in most cases, the wrong one. As such we need to help make the case to the British public that our commitment to a free and democratic Iraq is well worth the effort.",
