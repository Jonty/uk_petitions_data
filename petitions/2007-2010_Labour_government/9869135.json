        "action": "review the \u00a38000 tax relief on company relocation assistance set by Norman Lamont in 1992. Costs associated with buying a house are dramatically higher than in 1992 and the relief should be increased in line with associated costs. The limit should be higher than \u00a325K.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The costs associated with relocating for an existing or new job are very significant and the \u00a38000 tax relief is completely inadequate for most needs. The relief doesn't even exempt the payment of stamp duty by the company, which is often well in excess of \u00a38K itself. The govenment should be encouraging people to live where they work and not commuting because the cost of relocating is too high and any assistance over \u00a38K is taxed as income.\n\nRelocating to live where you live should be encouraged not penalised.",
