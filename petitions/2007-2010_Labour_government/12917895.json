        "background": "The British Society of Gene Therapy is struggling to progress with trials due to European regulations, yet UK sufferers have successfully received gene therapy outside the UK by travelling to China and the United States of America. The P53 gene is known as the cancer killing gene and was first used successfully with head and neck tumours. In this country we have fantastic scientists who are unable to follow through their fantastic research. Help make it possible for future cancer sufferers by allowing gene therapy to take place here in the UK",
