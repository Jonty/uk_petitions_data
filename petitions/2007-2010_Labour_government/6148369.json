            "background": "The average 7,000 acre grouse moor will make its owner in the region of \u00a3200K profit p.a. from shoots during grouse season. \n\nThe potential fine of \u00a310,000 for anyone caught poisoning a protected bird of prey - which threaten the success of the grouse shoots - is clearly insufficient to act as a deterrent. At a minimum, allowing protected species to be harmed or killed on a grouse moor should result in the revocation of shooting licenses, and possibly further sanctions.",
