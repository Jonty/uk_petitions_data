            "background": "Zero hour contracts are a dishonest way of circumventing some fundamental responsibilities that employers are legally required to adhere to in all other working contracts.\n  \nChanges to contracts reducing working standards are made much easier for employers to force through using the zero-hour system, as they have the power to simply cancel the contract and redraft it, avoiding redundancy payments through valid counter-claims if an employee refuses the new contract terms.\n\nThis system unfairly puts all the power in the hands of the employer. Surely in a time when job security is at an all time low, especially in retail and agency work, we need the government to ensure that tactics that could easily be exploited to force employees into significantly worse working standards, are no longer available to employers.",
