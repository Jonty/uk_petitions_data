        "background": "Radio 2 used to represent shall we say the Older Generation in programming, particularly Music Choice.  Over the years instead of say Jimmy Young or Michael Parkinson slowly but surely the Station has been taken over by a younger generation of presenter, and the Music which represented the over 50s generation of 50s to 70s Music is being replaced by much of the current day music\nThere are plenty of New BBC Stations galore which represent music of the  relatively young like Radio 1, 6, BBC1 Extra and the rest, but Nothing for the over 50s Generation.\nSome Commercial Stations do this and concentrate on Golden Oldies, but not the BBC.\nSo let us have a brand new BBC Radio Station which will play Music from around say 1950 to around 1970 and therefore put right this 'Anomaly'!",
