It is also a skill which is sadly lacking within the general population.  We have it within our power to arm the next generation against quacks, frauds and charlatans by teaching critical thinking in British schools.  Educate our children today so they won't be taken for gullible fools tomorrow by internet scammers, bogus medical treatments, magical thinking or confirmation bias.",
