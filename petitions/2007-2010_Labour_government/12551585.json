        "background": "Gordon Brown consistently claims that Nu-Labour is 'hard on crime' and 'hard on the causes of crime'.  This is currently proving only to be lip service and everybody is flaunting the system and making our police and judiciary the laughing stock of the world.  The innocent people of the UK need respite from those convicted of anti-social behaviour and if a fine does not stop them - or remains unpaid - then that convicted anti-social criminal needs to be taken off the streets for a period long enough to cause him or her to reflect on their situation.",
