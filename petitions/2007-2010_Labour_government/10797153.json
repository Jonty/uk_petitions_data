        "background": "At present, student nurses in the UK get a non means tested bursary if they study on a diploma course, and a means tested bursary if they study on a degree course. The amount of time and effort put in by students is extremely high, and in my opinion should be rewarded with more than a bursary. This pay should be for all students, no matter which academic qualification they study for.",
