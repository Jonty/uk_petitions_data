            "background": "The European Union has always made clear its aims for a European Superstate. Like any state it needs an army. Former European Commission president Romano Prodi said that the creation of a European Army was essential. There are a number of reasons why this must be resisted.\n\n1). A European Army harms our countries ability to defend itself and maintain our security.\n\n2). Any British military personnel in this European Army would not be able to act in the intrest of the United Kingdom on the international stage.\n\nThe cration of a European Army would cause serious damage to our way of life. So it must be resisted should future plans arise.",
