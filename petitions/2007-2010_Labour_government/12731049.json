            "background": "As a young disabled person with poor fine motor control, I am constantly dropping coins and holding up queues of people whenever I go shopping. Due to this embarrassment, I tend to use notes, and have a large bag at home where I store all my coins, however, the smallest note currently in circulation is \u00a35, this means that I revive even more change and my bag grows ever larger. I have developed ways of coping, I add up the items and get the money ready before I check-out, unfortunately I am also dyslexic and don\u2019t always add up correctly.\nThe reintroduction of the \u00a31 note would greatly benefit me, other disabled people, elderly people, and people with Parkinsons etc.\nThank you",
