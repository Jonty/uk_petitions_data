            "background": "There are already a few legalise drugs petitions on this website.  However, they usually argue that drugs - or one particular drug - should be legalised because it will help reduce crime.  While the creator of this petition believes the crime reducing effects of drug legalisation to be absolutely true, he believes that people should be able to - and should have the RIGHT to - do whatever they like to their own bodies without threat of coercion.  Anything less than this entails politicianry to government.  Please sign if you disagree with the current drug laws in this country, whether you partake in the consumption of illegal substances or not.",
