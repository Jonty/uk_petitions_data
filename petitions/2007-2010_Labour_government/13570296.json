However voters sometimes do not like any of the candidates and end up either spoiling their paper or voting for some radical or lesser party.\nReally to do this is dishonouring our fallen heroes and we would like the right to make our vote heard and at the same time show our disapproval of the major candidates. Please allow us the chance to vote for \"None of the above\".",
