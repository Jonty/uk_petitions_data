            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This petition calls for a drastic reduction to the variety of inflated fines and excessive traffic restrictions against motorists in residential and commercial areas of London. The justifications for issuing penalty charges are becoming more meaningless, more tenuous and more imposing than ever before.\n\nExcessive road signing,parking restrictions and CCTV cameras are strangling our beloved city.These excessive restrictions are not motivated by a desire to protect the public but rather to further the pernicious profiteering of London's administrative bodies. I'm not allowed to park on my own street.I've been fined for parking outside my house. Penalty charges seem to be given out in the most cavalier fashion. I ask you: what about the livlihoods of small shop owners, students and people who just want to be able to travel our roads without being spyed on and subsequently robbed by our city's administration? Our liberty is being usurped. Please sign this petition  and help end the CCTV/Penalty charge racket that currently chokes our city.",
