        "background": "We've all heard about it, prisoners with TVs in their cells, kettles, etc. Why should they have these luxuries? Where is the deterrent for re-offending? \n\nI propose that prison sentences be harder. No TVs in cells, no luxuries whatsoever. Prisoners should be made to work for their keep, Laundry, Cooking, Cleaning and anything else the government feel would be of benefit to society. \n\nPrisoners should have time locked in their cells and Games rooms, etc should only be open for a few hours a day. Prisoners should take part in daily exercise.\n\nPrison should not be a holiday camp and this would stop prison overcrowding.",
