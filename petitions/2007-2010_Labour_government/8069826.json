            "background": "I propose the reduction of minimum age for alcoholi drinks purchasing to the age of 16. I believe that this would be beneficial because as current affairs stand it is easier for young delinquents to purchase tobacco cigarretes and low class drugs such as marijuana, crack cocaine and ecstasy tablets than it is for them to purchase the relevantly harmless and short-term, legal drug that is alcohol. I think that this would significantly decrease the amount of underage smoking and illegal drug consumption in young people.\nI believe that as affairs stand, the current alcoholic purchasing regulations are in violation of our human right to be intoxicated.",
