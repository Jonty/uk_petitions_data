            "background": "The Equalities Bill will mean that if there are two candidates of equal qualifications and ability applying for a job,then a female or coloured candidate must be given preference over a white male candidate.\n\nIt would also mean that white male candidates rejected for a job because of their colour or gender would not be able to claim racial or sexual discrimination.\n\nThis bill-ironically named the Equalities Bill-makes racial and sexual discrimation legitimate.Jobs should be awarded on the candidates' calibre and not on their skin colour or gender.\n\nIt is also extremely perverse that this law restricts or denies racial and sexual discrimation rights based on a person's gender or race-these rights should be available to ALL.",
