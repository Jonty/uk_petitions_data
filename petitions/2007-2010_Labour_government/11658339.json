            "background": "The UN rapporteur who is supposed to be the global guardian of free speech has had his job rewritten \u2013 to put him on the side of the religious censors. \n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights stated 60 years ago that \"a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief is the highest aspiration of the common people\". \n\nStarting in 1999, a coalition of Islamist tyrants, led by Saudi Arabia, demanded the rules be rewritten. The demand for everyone to be able to think and speak freely failed to \"respect\" the \"unique sensitivities\" of the religious, they decided \u2013 so they issued an alternative Islamic Declaration of Human Rights. It insisted that you can only speak within \"the limits set by the shariah [law]. It is not permitted to spread falsehood or disseminate that which involves encouraging abomination or forsaking the Islamic community\".* \n\nFreedom of expression must be upheld and religious groups should not be offered special treatment or be excempt from criticism.\n\n*Source - Johann Hari.",
