            "background": "Urgent review required that allows Directors of a Company can choose to liquidate it's assets by closing down to simply open up again trading from the same premises, using the same equipment having pocketed the benefits of the previous company by using it to dispose of debts whilst employees have no recourse along with a knock on effect within the creditor base who also often have to cut back by release people to limited the impact on their business.\nTypical recent example that I have investigated could be traced through companies\u2019 house when a new company was formed by the existing Directors just a few weeks before folding the existing one. Next step was to increase the stock holding of everything from raw material to toilet rolls, which was swiftly followed by the liquidation. The employees were released for mandatory 1 week and then selected for re-employment (no redundancy) employee\u2019s selected started work again in the same factory making product for the same customers. The results indicated that the company had gone into liquidation with debts of approx \u00a31m and the assets had been bought back for approx \u00a390k giving the Directors an approx \u00a3910k clear profit.",
