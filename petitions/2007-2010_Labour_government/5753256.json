            "background": "a system could be put in place that can wheedle out the cases being brough vexatiously or without foundation, thus ensuring that a return to legal aid for any futile or revenge only based cases are not funded indiscriminately and do not drain the system of funds or clog up the tribunal with frivolous action. Unforunately in todays society most diasbled people find themselves in a postion of being financially precluded from action due to lack of legal aid, along with other types of discrimination that are exempt from the 12 month rule for tribunal acceptance. This would really ensure equailty in the workplace as intended by the law and ensure a true reflection of the scale of problems that are still encoutered across the entire workforce. a law is an ineffective tool if those intended to benefit from protection are unable to bring action to bear upon the perpetrators because they are financially precluded from doing so. Law and it's protections should be free and equal to all.",
