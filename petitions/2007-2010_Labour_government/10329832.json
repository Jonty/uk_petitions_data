        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "824 tonnes of Medication is destroyed annually at a cost to the tax payer of around \u00a31bn,a figure equivelent to 3% of spending on drugs. The cost of disposal of said drugs, either by incineration or landfill sites is close to \u00a310m. When properly channelled through qualified practitioners, Medication is gratefully received and used to its full potential after further screening within the African Hospitals.   These drugs cannot be recycled for use within the UK, they are considered hazardous waste, however, after licensed screening they can be recycled for use overseas. The Licence is extremely expensive both initially and annually thereafter as are the related conditions to the Licence. 'Intercare' is the only charity that can pay these high fees but are obviously restricted in operational time because of related regulations.\nBy reducing the cost of the Licence, more Charities would be able to recycle these drugs thus reducing our National Expenditure.",
