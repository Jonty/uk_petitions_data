            "background": "How can poorer countries develop their more sophisticated secondary and tertiary industries, when they are crippled in agriculture by markets which are heavily favoured to us.\n\nSome African countries can no longer even meet their own grain needs, whereas they could before because of the forcing of free markets upon them.\n\nNo matter how hard these countries try, they will always fail, the system is set up for their agricultural failure.\n\nIf we stopped subsidising our farmers, they would almost all surely disappear, but its the morally correct course of action to follow to end suffering.\n\nThis issue is akin with slavery, we are holding people in perpetual subservience, the only strong argument against it is that our economy will suffer and that was true of slavery also.\n\nFOR OUR SLICE OF HEAVEN WE INFLICT HELL ON EARTH FOR OTHERS",
