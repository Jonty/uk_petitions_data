            "background": "In all recent governments, Margaret Thatcher was the only Prime Minister who can say she truly stood for Great Britain. She helped put the Great back in Great Britain, only to see many aspects of our country and its patriotism removed by subsequent governments in their unstinting thirst for a global PC approach, which decries lots of good and great aspects of being Great British. Shame on those responsible.",
