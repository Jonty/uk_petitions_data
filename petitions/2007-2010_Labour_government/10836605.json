            "background": "Currently blind people are not automatically given the higher rate of disability living allowance (DLA). The mobility of a blind person severely hampers any attempt at a basic amount of independance. Lower rate is \u00a317 per week, whilst the higher rate is \u00a346 per week. I'm not blind, but my brother is deaf and registered as blind and can not gain the higher rate.",
