            "background": "Jacqui Smith had to stand down as Home Secretary due to public pressure during the expenses revelations and has now been ordered to apologise to parliament over \"wrongly designating her family house as a second home\", which she has done.\nThis incorrect designation resulted in Ms Smith claiming over \u00a3100000 in inappropriate second home allowances, which she has not had to repay.\nFollowing these events, to bestow a peerage on Ms Smith would be to completely devalue the entire upper house and the peerage process and significantly weaken the standing of the entire UK legislature.",
