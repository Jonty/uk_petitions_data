            "background": "Interest on Legal Aid bills  is currently at the rate of 8%.\n\nThe government should lead by example and reduce its interest rate as it is trying to force the banks to do, instead of attempting to make additional profit from some of the poorer people in the community.\n\nThe people paying this interest have a house that is depreciating and could be forced into negative equity by this high rate of interest.\n\nMany are struggling single parents on low incomes with young children who are now facing severe economic problems as a result of the governments hypocrisy over interest rates.\n\nThe Legal Services Commission has taken a charge on the property so those affected cannot borrow at the cheaper rates available on the market to repay the loan",
