            "background": "Community sports clubs bills for waste water drainage have risen at an alarming rate due to water regulator OFWAT\u2019s guidance to utility companies to move to \u2018site area charging\u2019 for drainage. This model fails to distinguish between community facilities and commercial buildings.\n\nIn addition to drainage charges, clubs are also facing significant increases in installation and supply fees for water, gas and electricity. At the root of this problem is the fact that legislation currently distinguishes only between domestic and commercial premises \u2013 and as sports clubs are not domestic, they are by default treated as commercial entities.  CCPR believes that legislation should recognise a new category of \u2018community building\u2019 including buildings such as sports clubs, village halls and churches, which would be subject to lower fees.",
