            "background": "Major Phil Packer has given hope to many that have spinal injuries and has shown that their lives can go on with purpose. He is a fine example of a British serviceman who despite serious injuries is more concerned about what he can do for others. He is a role model that many can look to for inspiration. He is a true Hero. Therefore I propose that he carry the Olympic Flame to start the 2012 Olympics.",
