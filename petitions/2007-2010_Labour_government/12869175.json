        "background": "It is a serious lung disease. Asthma attacks are distressing, debilitating, frightening and can be fatal. Try to breathe through a pillow case folded in two, held over your mouth. That's what it feels like. Except, when you can't breathe anymore, you can remove the pillow case. An Asthmatic can't make that feeling of suffocation stop. During an attack you start to cough as your lungs try to rid themselves of what they think is just congestion, like a chest infection. In fact what is actually happening is that the lining of the lungs has become inflamed and swollen, narrowing the airways from  the size of a 10p piece to the size of a squashed straw. We have to rely on inhalers and anti inflammatory steriods. It's worse now in the recession, as more of us find that we cannot afford the \u00a37.20 prescription charge. So we are trying to make our medication last longer by not using it as often as we should. But we put our lives at risk by doing so. If we were granted free prescriptions, we wouldn't have to do this. People with Thyroid Disease, which is NOT a fatal illness, get free prescriptions. So why shouldn't we?? We want the Prime Minister to act now!",
