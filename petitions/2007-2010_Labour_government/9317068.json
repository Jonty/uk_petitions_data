            "background": "Levels of Brake Horse Power on cars today has never been higher, with modern hot hatchbacks all producing well in excess of 200 BHP, this is a major technical feat by car engineers but it is irresponsible for manufacturers to market such a vehicle for sale to the general public, as driving skill varies from person to person, some are incapable of handling a vehicle with this much power thus placing a dangerous risk to road safety, not to mention the fact that these vehicles are some of the highest polluting vehicles, because to produce this high power, they need to burn more fuel, thus they are environmentally irresponsible as well. This petition requests that the government places a maximum of 140 BHP on all new mass produced vehicles available to the public at large.",
