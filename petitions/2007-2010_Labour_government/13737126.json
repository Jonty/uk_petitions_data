        "action": "sell the road network to raise funds to repay debt incurred in the current economic crisis",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We propose that the government should put the entire motorway network up for sale to the highest bidders. The funds received should be used solely to repay the massive UK debt mountain. The network could be sold on a lease commensurate with receiving enough revenue to remove the burden of repayment of the massive UK debt from the taxpayer. At the end of the lease the network could revert back to the country. This policy would also ensure that road movements would be reduced due to the introduction of taxable tolls. Thereby making a major impact in reducing emissions, maintenance of the network would revert to the purchaser removing yet more costs from the public purse. As part of the sale the private companies should be encouraged/forced to remove part of the lane structure and replace it with a rail transport infrastructure with hubs at major motorway junctions to encourage less polluting transport.",
