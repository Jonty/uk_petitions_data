            "action": "instruct the appropriate minister to prosecute councillors of Local Authorities which did not enact the smoking ban by 1st July",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "My paper recently reported two councils where the smoking ban is not yet being enforced because there had been a delay in putting the necessary procedures in place.  This means that the non-smoking citizens of these councils are still not being protected from passive smoking.  It is the responsibility of councillors to ensure that legislation is carried out properly and on time so I propose penalising the councillors personally; this will mean that there is no effect on local people.",
