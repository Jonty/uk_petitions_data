            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Patientline Ltd has long term contracts with about 150 Hospital Trusts in the UK. In April the  company abolished a reduced rate for NHS Patients over 65 and introduced a basic daily rate of \u00a32.90 per day for TV viewing and an out going  bedside call rate of 26p per minuite (with a minimum charge of 40p) in most hospitals. Two 10 minuite calls from a hospital bed cost \u00a35.20.  The incomming call rate to sick people is 49p per minute peak time call rate (39p off peak).\n\nAt any one time at least ten per cent of Patientline's bedside units are faulty. Additionally Patientline's products are far too complex for sick people to understand.\n\nPatientline are operating a poor service at an expensive rate and are thus creating extra  stress on NHS wards.",
