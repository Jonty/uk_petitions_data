            "background": "On fine days when you need to open windows or go out in the garden or put your washing on the line (thus saving energy) someone nearby will always light a bonfire regardless of their neighbours comfort or enjoyment of their property. With smoking you are able to move away from the smoker, with bonfire smoke you have to put up with it! At night you can't tell where it is coming from so you can't report a smoke nuisance. It can cause bad feeling amonst neighbours and could also be a health hazard. Councils don't act unless there is a smoke nuisance and have scant rules to limit the practise. It can make your life a misery and in the days of garden waste recycling there is no need for it.",
