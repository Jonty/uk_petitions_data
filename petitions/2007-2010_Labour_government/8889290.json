So I propose we do away with all this Cornflakes and Marmalade nonsense, and make Sultana Bran official Cereal of Great Britain!\n\nJust imagine the results, Children working harder at school, People more enthusiastic at work, and generally happier in life. Social barriers could be broken with the mutual adoration of Sultana Bran! \n\nSultana Bran - the pathway to a better world.",
