            "background": "It is disgusting the way the Government have hidden their new ruling that only one egg is implanted in IVF treatments.  Previously two eggs were implanted and now my daughter and her husband have been told that two eggs would create multiple births (twins!!!) that it would increase the chances of not having a natural birth, and that it could damage her liver, kidneys etc., and finally it could cause them to divorce. What utter rubbish, there is already a high chance she will have twins as twins are already on both sides of the family.  Should she have twins 'naturally' is she supposed to abort one because of the potential damage to her organs.  How utterly ridiculous when we know it is a move by the Labour Government to save money and cheat the public out of their rights.",
