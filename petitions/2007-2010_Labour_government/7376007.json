These rules have been created and amended by various Chancellors.  \n\nThis petition urges the Prime Minister to create and enforce a law that requires any Chancellor of the Exchequer to have sat and passed this exam (or similar exam offered by a registered body of Accountants) prior to taking the Cabinet post.  \n\nThis would mean that the Chancellor has a micro-economic view of the impact of  the budget, as well as an overview of the macro-economic changes.  It may also result in a simpler tax system, reducing administration costs for individuals and businesses.\n\nIt seems peculiar that the individual who sets our taxes is in no way qualified to prepare a tax return.  This petition, in short, urges the Prime Minister to ensure that the Chancellor is fully qualified to understand the impact of the Budget.",
