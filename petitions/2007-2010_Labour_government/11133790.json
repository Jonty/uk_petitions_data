Darling\n\nThe interesting phrase is \"this year\". Following years, when the VAT rate is returned to 17.5%, the additional fuel duty will not be removed, so we will be paying increased fuel taxes.\n\nThis is a tax on going to work, something all working people have to do, whether by personal transport or public transport, much of which also runs on diesel.\n\nAgain the government is imposing unfair taxes on those who work for a living; taxes which again target working classes and lower middle classes who have the same need to commute but lower incomes.\n\nWe do not need taxes to be raised on WORKING.",
