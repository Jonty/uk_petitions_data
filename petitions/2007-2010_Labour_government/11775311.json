            "background": "The UK has banned Dutch MP Geert Wilders from visiting the UK. The government is apparently equating extremism with encouraging a debate on extremism. This is a dangerous precedent and one that should be reconsidered urgently. Obviously statements that fan the flames of racial hatred or discrimination should be condemned, but banning an elected representative of another nation in the EC from visiting the UK is preposterous. One does not have to agree with everything Geert Wilders says to defend his right to say it.",
