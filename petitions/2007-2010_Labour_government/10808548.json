            "background": "The UK internet service providers (ISPs) have long since pre-ported to provide unlimited bandwidth to UK consumer. This however only applies if you stay within their determined limits of their \"fair use policy\". Once you pass this cap the ISP then limits your bandwidth, in some cases to dial-up speed levels.\n\nThere is currently no regulations or governing bodies that prevent the UK ISPs  from advertising this clearly capped service as unlimited. With bandwidth costs dropping month by month for the ISPs this practice is unfair to UK consumers who aren't receiving the unlimited service they expect.\n\nRather than expanding to handle the volume of customers they are getting and continuing to provide the level of service their customers expect the ISPs impose artificial caps on the service to those customers they deem are using too much of the service.\n\nThis practice is holding back technology adoption within the UK and preventing open access to information.\n\nWe the undersigned respectfully request that the Prime Minister addresses this issue and allocates a body to oversee these service providers as it already has with the rest of the telecoms industry.",
