            "background": "As many people are aware the average IQ across the country seems to be plunging.  This is due to the benefits system currently in use in the UK. Legitimate benefit frauds are better off claiming benefits than working in low paid employment.  This leads them to having more and more children to increase the amounts of benefits they receive.  I propose a IQ based intelligence test to 'allow' people to bare children.  The higher the IQ the more children allowed.  This would solve our huge 'benefit' debt and increase the average IQ of our great nation for generations to come!",
