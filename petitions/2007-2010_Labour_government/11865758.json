            "background": "Part of the Governments thinking behind the 'free swim' was to inspire children to become the next Olympic hope. If they wanted to achieve this surely a better option would be to make the Swim Clubs free. As part of the club they would be tutored and trained.\nAll the free swim initiative has created is overcrowded swimming baths, full of cavorting children.\nUnless at the 2012 Olympics they intend to host events such as Handstands in shallow water, Synchronised verbal abuse or The running bomb at the deep end, then Britain will not gain the medals in the pool which the government believe this scheme will bring.\nI have witnessed the aforementioned events on numerous occasions at my local swimming baths in Braintree Essex. \nProblems the free swim has caused = Overcrowding, Prolonged waiting times, Time restrictions in the pool, Increased risk of injury, reduced income for council run pools due to cancelled membership. \nWe just want to pay our money and be able to swim when we desire.",
