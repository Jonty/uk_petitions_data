            "background": "There are thousands of people in the UK with Mental Health problems, yet it is still not recognised as a serious issue. Treatment in the NHS for people with any kind of mental health problem is seriously lacking and not taken seriously enough by healthcare professions/the government. \nDrug & Alcohol problems are well recognised and treated several times, so why not people with non self-inflicted mental health problems?\nThere are so many discussions on how people need to get back into work and off of benefits, but no one seems to acknowledge that in order to do that people will need professional treatment for their conditions, not just assessments.\nIts not just the people with mental health problems that are suffering, the families suffer too.\nIf you agree that the government needs to investigate how people are actually being helped with mental health issues and that the government should work with the NHS to offer better services to people with mental health issues, please sign this petition.",
