        "background": "Anyone who works for a financial institution and has a mortgage with them is taxed on the difference between the interest rate and 6.25% as this is classed as a benefit in kind.  How can this be so when interest rates are 2% and anyone can get 4% on the high street now, this is costing many workers hundreds of pounds a year in extra tax.  The 6.25% rate should be reduced to 3.5% now",
