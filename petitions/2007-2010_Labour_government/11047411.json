        "background": "The recent reduction in fuel prices is a welcome one. However, it wasn't so may years ago that Diesel fuel was as cheap if not cheaper than Petrol. As Diesel is a less refined product than Petrol, is in not therefore cheaper to produce? Is the price rise in Diesel over Petrol purely down to the significant increase in Diesel cars being purchased in the UK and as such making more money for the government through tax. How can the government justify this price difference in fuel?",
