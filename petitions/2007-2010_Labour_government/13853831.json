        "background": "Many people say that you can\u2019t help who you fall in love with. This is just as true for Homosexuals, Lesbians and Bisexuals. Everyone has the right to love. Therefore everyone should have the right to marry.\nIn the UK we are allowed to enter into a Civil Partnership, but not marriage.  Why? Marriage is being able to be joined and bonded on a deeper level with someone you are in love with, so why can\u2019t we have that right?\nI am petitioning for same-sex marriage to be made legal in the UK. I want the right to marry the person that I fall in love with, whether that be male or female. \n\nI am asking you to please help make this possible by signing this petition. \nThank you.",
