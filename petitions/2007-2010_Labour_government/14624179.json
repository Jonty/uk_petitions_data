Battersea Dogs Home are overpopulated by Staffs (and im sure rescue centres all over the UK are too)as dogs are now being turning away as the breed has been over-bred. If we can cut down on the amount of Staffordshire Bull Terriers that are being bred we can give a lot of abandoned Staffs a home and hopefully this will stop a lot of dogs being put down.",
