            "background": "Ms Margaret Haywood was struck off the nursing register by the NMC on 16th April 2009. Her crime? Acting as a whistle blower to report neglect of elderly patients at the Royal Sussex Hospital in Brighton in July 2005. She was doing so with the help of the Panorama programme. The Council members of the NMC, a rather sclerotic collection of individuals, said she failed to \"follow her obligations as a nurse\". A really strange almost unreal statement when one considers that her actions lead to improvements of the conditions for patients at the above hospital. This injustice must be corrected by her re-instatement,  excuses from the NMC and replacement of council members.",
