            "background": "In Southwell, Nottinghamshire, 02 sited a mobile phone mast just metres from our schools.  With no long-term research into the effects of these masts and more and more research coming to light that the effects could be harmful, we ask for immediate action.  We accept that mobile communication is important, but ask that the planning laws be changed to ensure safe siting of this equipment.  This petition is to get our mast relocated to a safer site and support any changes in planning laws.",
