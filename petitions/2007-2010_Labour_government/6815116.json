        "action": "introduce a credit report freeze law to help protect consumers from identity fraud.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We call on the government to introduce a credit report freeze law. \nThis would enable consumers to instruct the credit reference agencies to restrict access to their credit reports.  This would prevent new accounts being opened fraudulently in their name.\nIt would enable vulnerable persons, such as those confined to hospital, or temporarily unable to manage their affairs for reasons of mental health, to be protected.\nNew account fraud through impersonation is one of the easiest forms of identity theft to be committed. It often involves mail interception. A significant amount is undertaken by persons living in the same household. \nCredit ratings would remain unaffected, existing credit account repayment history would continue to be reported as normal.  Credit report details would remain inaccessible to all until the consumer instructs the credit reference agencies to lift the freeze.\nConsumers would experience a few days delay when seeking to lift the freeze, to enable them to apply for credit. But this is a small price to pay for the peace of mind a law change would bring.",
