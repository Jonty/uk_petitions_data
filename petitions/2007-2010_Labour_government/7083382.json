        "background": "We already pay for refuse collection through Council Tax.  If UK citizens are asked to pay twice for refuse removal we believe that the response to this will be seen by the number of rubbish bags discarded on the roadside from passing vehicles. \n\nHow will this extra charge be monitored? Who will keep the records at the point of collection -  the refuse collection men? Who will administer the bills - the local councils? This will surely increase the numbers of local state employees throughout the UK who will most certainly cost far more than the income generated by the additional refuse collection tax! \n\nNo doubt householders will end up with locks on their wheelie bins to stop sneaky neighbours depositing their excess in other people's bins. \n\nThe integrity of Global Warming is being compromised now that it is being used for increased taxes through the introduction of 'environmental taxes'.",
