        "background": "to install lifts in all railway and underground stations so all disabled citizens may use them.  There are so many stations that do not provide any type of help for disabled people.  The disabled act reads \"The Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 1995 aims to end the discrimination that many disabled people face. This Act has been significantly extended, including by the Disability Discrimination Act 2005. It now gives disabled people rights in the areas of:\nemployment \n\neducation \n\naccess to goods, facilities and services, including larger private clubs and transport services \n\nbuying or renting land or property, including making it easier for disabled people to rent property and for tenants to make disability-related adaptations \nfunctions of public bodies, for example issuing of licences\". \"The Act requires public bodies to promote equality of opportunity for disabled people. It also allows the government to set minimum standards so that disabled people can use public transport easily\"\n\nThis needs to be done now and not later.",
