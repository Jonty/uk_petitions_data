People living at the coast are also under threat from rising sea levels but the Environment Agency are refusing to pay for damage to sea defences around our coastline. We have found the money for the 2012 Olympics, when peoples lives and homes are in danger, what is more important.  Eventually, we are all going to become victims of flooding and future Governments have to make this a priority for the sake of our children and grandchildren.",
