            "background": "Instances of all male specific cancers are increasing, yet men are not provided with any preventative screening services, similar to the screening services offered to women. This petition calls on the government to provide equality in screening services for men, to screen for all cancers, but in particular for testicular, bowel and prostate cancers. This screening service should not purely be hospital based, but should be taken by mobile teams out into the community, again as with female breast screening units. The potential savings in early detection would go a long way towards funding such a long-overdue service. Men are not asking for special treatment, just to be treated equally over something so important.",
