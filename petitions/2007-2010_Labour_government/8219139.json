            "background": "If all prostitutes have to register we can check their age (are they over 18) as well as checking if they were kidnapped. Visiting a non-registered prostitute can then be made illegal and we can persecute the men. Visiting a registered prostitute is not illegal and no persecution can follow. This will stop sex slavery in the UK.",
