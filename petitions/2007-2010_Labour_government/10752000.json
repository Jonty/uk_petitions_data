        "background": "I think in view of the government preaching about pay cuts amounting to below inflation rises. Those, the MP's of Parliament should here by take a pay cut and review financial grants that are paid to them e.g. second homes, bathrooms and travel expenses. These should come out of the MP's already above inflation pay band and not out of the tax payer\u2019s purse.",
