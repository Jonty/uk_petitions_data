Our 31 million people strong workforce will SHRINK by 7 million people by 2035 if no more immigrants arrive. Starting from 2011, the workforce of the EU as a whole will be shrinking.\nIn Romania, Bulgaria and Moldova (75% of Moldovans are eligible for Romanian passports) there are millions of workers - unemployed or earning an abysmal wage - who are currently not allowed to immigrate to Britain. Please open the labour market to them.",
