            "background": "According to Ofsted, 4 CHILDREN PER WEEK ARE DYING OF ABUSE AND/OR NEGLECT.  How many more cases like Baby P's will it take for people to open their eyes and see what is going on? Please consider this: \"As the fall-out from the shocking death of Baby P continues, inspectors said vulnerable children are being neglected as councils fail to act on the \"worst cases of abuse\". The watchdog said \"too many\" children were being let down because of major flaws in the way cruelty cases are handled. \nIt said almost half of council-led reviews into serious child abuse cases were **inadequate**\". THE KEY WORD HERE IS **INADEQUATE**.  If things had been adequate, maybe Baby P would still be here.Please make change happen now, and child protection guidelines clearer and more stringent!Please also implement change to improve lines of accountability so that this NEVER happens again.",
