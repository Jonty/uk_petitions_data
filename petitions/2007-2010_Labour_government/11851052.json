            "background": "British waters are over fished and not just by British commercial fisherman but also, fishermen from overseas.\nWe\u2019re aware that the British Government has now put in place MCZ in several locations, the restrictions in place are not adequate enough to prevent the ever decreasing state of the natural fish stocks and indeed their declining habitat. \nIt is not just removing the fish that is the problem; it is the depletion of their natural food by dredging for crustaceans. This is also having a massive effect on their ability to sustain large schools/ shoals. Dredging also destroys their sea bed, leaving large desert like seabeds around the British coast.\nStop commercial trawling, long lines, dredging and mass potting within 2 miles of British coastline to all commercial ventures, not just our own, please!\nGive nature the chance it needs to re-cooperate before it's to late.\nThis to ensure that the sea creatures that have inhabited the world, long before our ever increasing need for them, deserve the right to a decent life with a bright outlook for their future, not the bleak outlook that seems to be forced upon them.",
