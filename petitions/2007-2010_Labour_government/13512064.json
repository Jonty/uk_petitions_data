            "background": "Our country is in the depth of a very deep recession which is having catastrophic effects on all sectors of industry. The UK already pays more in business rates than any other country in Europe. Business rates are a major fixed overhead of any commercial operation. Most businesses are actively seeking ways to reduce overheads to stay afloat. For the Government to do anything to increase the burden of business rates would defy common sense given the prevailing market conditions. It also places British businesses at a major disadvantage when trying to compete with overseas competitors. The Government often says that it supports British business - now they have a chance to prove it.",
