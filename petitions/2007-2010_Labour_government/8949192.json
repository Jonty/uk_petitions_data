        "background": "I think that Christopher Dean and Jane Torvill should be giving a knighthood for their contribution to the world of ice skating and also their endless work for charities. They have made ice skating fashionable again through their Dancing on Ice concerts and also through the TV programme.  It would also be good if they got a knighthood as it is close to them celebrating 25 years for them winning gold in the Olympics in 1984.",
