            "background": "In Australia prescription drugs carry a small charge that is a percentage of the cost of the drug. This is said to disuade profligate and wasteful behaviour. It would be interesting to study if prescription drugs are wasted in England and Wales, the latter having free prescriptions. This study should provide hard evidence to facilitate policy decisions about prescription charges.",
