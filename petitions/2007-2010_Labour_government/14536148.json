        "background": "In 2003 it was found that three babies were abandoned every 48 hours in just one territory of South Africa, KwaZulu-Natal. This figure is believed to have increased dramatically over the past four years. (p.15 Daily News June 28, 2007) Additionally in 2007 South Africa had an estimated 1,400,000 children orphaned through Aids. (Unicef (2006), \u2018Africa\u2019s Orphaned and Vulnerable Generations: Children Affected by AIDS\u2019). Orphanages in South Africa are able to place some of these children within EU member states. UK Citizens who wish to assist in the plight of these children through adoption are disallowed by the current UK Government's policy which restricts adoption to family members only. The DCSF will review this matter in April 2010. Please add your voice to ask for restrictions to be lifted.",
