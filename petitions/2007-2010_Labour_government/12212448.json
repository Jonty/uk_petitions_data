        "background": "I feel that all this media about SBT being aggressive dogs is wrong, as any dog can be harmful if there in the wrong hands. I feel that bringing in a law which says you must be at least 21+ to buy or own a SBT, could solve half the problems of them coming into the wrong hands. I myself have a SBT and she is the most loyalist, loving dog iv ever had, she is brilliant around my son. I couldnt ask for a better dog.",
