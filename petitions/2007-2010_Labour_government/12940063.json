However, to make any practical arrangements for giving notice of marriage or civil partnership, it is obviously necessary to know which country the marriage or civil partnership will take place in, i.e., to be in possession of a visa for that country. The above requirement presents the illusion choice, while actually preventing any real choice. Please remove this ridiculous requirement. A British citizen should have the right to form a union with any person of their choosing, and this right should not be denied at the whim of policy makers and civil servants.",
