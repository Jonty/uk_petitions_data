Why should the perpetrators be able to sit in a prison cell more akin to a 3 star hotel and play on a playstation? They should be made to work, I am sick of our namby pamby attitude towards these people. If this current situation of violence on our streets is to stop we need to act. These thugs need to be put to work hard during their sentence then they would not be so quick to reoffend on release!",
