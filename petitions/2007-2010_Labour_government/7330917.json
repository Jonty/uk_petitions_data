            "background": "Despite constantly assuring the public that it holds data securely, the Government's failure to ensure that the personal and banking details of 25 milliion people were securely transferred from HMRC to the National Audit Office, demonstrates that such assurances are worthless.  This is simply the most catastrophic and latest incident in a series that demonstrates that the Government cannot be trusted to deal with data securely.  In these circumstances we believe that the public cannot have confidence in the security of the National Identity Scheme and that no further action should be taken to implement this scheme until all police investigations have been completed, and a review of all data handling procedures including the training of civil servants with access to this type of data is also complete.",
