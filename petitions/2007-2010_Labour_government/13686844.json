            "background": "With the sales and marketing director of Center Parcs openly admitting that they raise prices by >300% of the 1 week of half term, the government is urged to stagger term times and half term times.\n\nThis simple move will enable families to enjoy holidays at closer to normal rates and end the monopoly that airlines, holiday companies and other leisure firms have on the pockets of parents of children.\n\nIt will also benefit commerce where there is a rush to book half terms, resulting in staffing issues.\n\nThis is a simple move which at worse would lead to non-even terms, but enable families to invest more time (and money) on their children.",
