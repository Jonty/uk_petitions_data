Many reports done by auditors and investigation agencies in the UK have even done so much in relation to this. Yet, your government has refused to release to the Kenyan public one of the crucial reports that would have indicted the perpetrators. Sir, am petitioning you to address this matter with the seriousness it deserves. Two, allow the Kenyan taxpayer access to this latest report. Thank you",
