            "background": "In our opinion, too many people are 'getting in on the act' of citizenship and spoiling the general makeup of Englishness by not adhering to the well-established English way of life and furthermore attempting to overwhelm the English indigenous population.  We propose that any people(s)who choose to reside in this country should adhere vehemently to the English way of life, swear allegience as such, and thier public presence should be as an English citizen and not impose thier culture in any way, shape or form on the English way of life.  To ensure this, there should be relevant laws imposed on all citizens equally within the English community.",
