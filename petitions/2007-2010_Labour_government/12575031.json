            "background": "The systems of public transport in the UK are not reliable. Large parts of the country are unable to be dependent on Public Transport due to the inconsistent, expensive and overcrowded nature of it. At a time when we are encouraged to use Public Transport to lower emissions, the privatised transport industry is not attractive to many who would otherwise be reliant on private cars.\n\nThis petition is to call for the nationalisation of all public transport (Railways, Buses & Trams) across the UK. Nationalisation will lower fares and remove extortionate ticket prices created by competitive private companies. State run public transport will be better managed leading to better services where they are needed most.",
