        "background": "Discrimination on grounds of race, religion, sexual orientation, sex, age and disability is illegal, so why do we allow employers to ask questions about which of these groups we belong to? They are asked in the interest of 'equality monitoring', which is a sugarcoated way of saying 'discrimination'. In allowing employers to ask these questions we are allowing them the tools by which to discriminate for how can an employer discriminate against a person based on sexual orientation (for example) if he doesn't know the persons sexual orientation in the first place? I know that a person does not have to provide the information, but I'm sure that employers use that as a disqualifier, despite not being allowed to. However if we prevent them from asking these questions we prevent any problem that arises from the knowledge",
