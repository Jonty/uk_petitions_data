They are asked in the interest of 'equality monitoring', which is a sugarcoated way of saying 'discrimination'. In allowing employers to ask these questions we are allowing them the tools by which to discriminate for how can an employer discriminate against a person based on sexual orientation (for example) if he doesn't know the persons sexual orientation in the first place? I know that a person does not have to provide the information, but I'm sure that employers use that as a disqualifier, despite not being allowed to. However if we prevent them from asking these questions we prevent any problem that arises from the knowledge",
