            "background": "In recent months there have been numerous protests at airports around the country, including our major airport- Heathrow. Personally, and I am sure I am not alone, I believe this is an absolute disgrace people are allowed to enter such a secure area so easily. Fences are being cut open easily by these supposed \"peaceful\" protestors. I think that anyone who enters an airport unlawfully should receive a prison sentence, or another strong deterrant. A fine would be no use as some businessmen support these groups and may pay the fine on behalf of the protestor(s). What if a terrorist group managed to get in as easily as the protestors? That would lead to many deaths of innocent travellers. I hereby think that security at airports must be toughened, i.e. stronger fences, patrol cars around perimeter fences and tougher punishments. This issue may develop into a much more serious one, so actions should be taken now!",
