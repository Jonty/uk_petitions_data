            "background": "Publicly support a plan to apply any future congestion tax to >all< sources of congestion and not just motorists who suffer the congestion.\n\nCongestion is often caused by road works and toll charges.\n\nMotorists already have a large incentive to avoid congestion since they are the ones that suffer the wasted time.  Those responsible for toll charges and roadwork do not directly suffer the pain of congestion.  This tax would give them incentives to avoid causing congestion. \n\nTaxing roadwork would create a financial incentive to complete them quickly and deficiently reducing the situation commonly seen today of no one working on large sections of closed carriageway. It would also encourage long term capacity planning and the use of high quality materials in road and utility pipes and cables buried beneath them.  \n\nToll collection often causes congestion. Forcing the toll collecting authority to pay motorists rather than charge during periods of congestion would effectively place a tax on them for causing congestion.  This would create a financial incentive to make toll collection as efficient as possible and avoid inflicting iniquitous delays on motorists.",
