            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "There are many reports of persons who are long term unemployed having ridiculous numbers of children, sometimes as many as 15 being reported, making it financially impossible for the parents to obtain employment that would match the state benefits. This is unfair on families that pay their taxes and could not afford huge families. I do not think that people who are genuinely unemployed and in need should be penalised, but when people have been unemployed and had 12, 13, 14 children afterwards because they can, it is unsustainable for the economy and grossly unfair on the taxpayers. There is also an issue about the mentality of the children, growing up and seeing benefit acquisition as a lifestyle and not as a social support in times of need.\n\nI have suggested a that benefits cease to be paid for the seventh child and onwards. No doubt there would be an argument for a lower number, but I hope that it is reasonable to set a limit at a level that it is difficult to argus against.",
