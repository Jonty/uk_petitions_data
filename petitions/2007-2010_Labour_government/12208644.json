            "background": "With the recent \"false\" expence claim of Ms Smith (Home Secretary) regarding her husbands pornografic film fetish and her expense claim, although she has said it was a mistake and will pay this back, had she not been found out would she have willingly pointed this out? I seriously doubt it.\n\nTherefore I wish to petition the Government to introduce new legislation that ANY MP regardless of their position in the house, have criminal procedings brought against them. they are after all stealing from the tax payer, the very people who have put their trust in them to oversee the running of the country.\n\nNo other employer would stand for this type of theft and the employee would be lucky to escape prosecution if found to be fiddling their expenses, let alone accept an apology and keep their job.\n\nWith this type of legislation in place would ensure MP's are more careful with the public money they claim and therfore more money can be generated to be used in more productive areas.",
