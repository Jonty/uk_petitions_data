            "background": "To firstly, ensure, by legislation, that the public purse costs associated with road traffic accidents should be charged to those found to have contributed to the cause(s) of a road traffic accident.\n\nCreate default legal protection to more Vulnerable Road Users. This means that for a road traffic accident, which resulted in injury, the default party to be charged with being responsible for causing the road traffic accident would be that from a less vulnerable road user group.\n\nRoad users vulnerability would increase, as described elsewhere, in this successive order: pedestrians, cyclists, car drivers, van drivers, taxi drivers, bus drivers, truck drivers.",
