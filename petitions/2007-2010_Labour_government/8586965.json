        "background": "This is a new scheme taken from a US policy to reward Jobless families more benefits and bonuses of up to \u00a33000 per year.  They would receive more benefits for finding jobs, re-training, attending parents evenings and taking their children to the dentist.\n\nThis is just another way to reward those people in society that take all and give nothing back.  \n\nI am disgusted that tax payers and conformists are once again being put aside in favour of those who chose not to take responsibility for themselves.  The ones who are working and struggling to get by are the ones who will be paying for it all.  \n\nThis is not the answer - Mr Brown, you should be coming down harder on these people, not rewarding them.",
