It will soon not be economically viable to run a vehicle on LPG therefore forcing drivers to return to polluting Petrol and Diesel alternatives. \nIf the Labour Government is serious about green issues then LPG should be supported as a cleaner alternative to Petrol and Diesel and the cost should reflect this support.",
