            "background": "There is no evidence of a spirit world, and no evidence that people can communicate with none existent mythical spirits. Therefore mediums should be banned outright, it is not good enough to force them to sell their deception as just being entertainment, because the deception still causes people to change their lives on the strength of the mediums words. It is unethical to allow people to sell life changing deceitful advice to the public, just because they admit it's deceitful.",
