            "background": "Carlos Tevez is one of Manchester United's most exceptional and underrated player, and since the vastly overpriced arrival of Dimitar Berbatov, he has slowly been phased out of Sir Alex Ferguson's first team plans. Its about time the Prime Minister stepped in and pointed out to Fergie 'look, Tevez is much better than Berbatov. Dimitar is inable to run for more than 2 mins a match, and only goes for the ball if its a maximum of a foot in front of him. Whereas Carlos will run his arse into the ground for the entire match even if he has been forced to play in a second string side with players like Danny Welbeck and Gary Neville.' With your help we can return natural 1st team player like Carlos to the starting line-up where they belong.",
