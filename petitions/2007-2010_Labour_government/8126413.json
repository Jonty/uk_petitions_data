Is there no-one in this country who can sort this madness out?\n\nI am seeking to organise a powerful coalition of retailers, banks and consumers to lobby for an increase in the number of \u00a35 notes in circulation in the UK.\n\nThis measure could be cost neutral for the tax payer, if increases in \u00a35 notes were off-set with reductions of other coinage (I suggest reducing the near useless and oversized 2p as an initial measure).\n\nThe only possible down-side that I can imagine is a reduction in trade for pocket repairers.\n\nPlease support this important quality of life measure.",
