Creating such a group will result in the\n    immediate termination of your Facebook account.\n\n    Yet there are hundreds of religious hate groups all over\n    facebook and they are fully aware of all of them.\n\n    We have tried emailing abuse@facebook.com as well as\n    privacy@facebook.com and NOTHING is done, not even a reply is\n    given.\n\n    THOUSANDS of complaints have been made about these hate groups,\n    yet they are still functioning, with NO response to members who\n    complained. We demand that the UK prime minister ask Facebook\n    to practice what it preaches, without discrimination - and\n    terminate these groups and members who insult, offend, abuse\n    and hurt innocent users.",
