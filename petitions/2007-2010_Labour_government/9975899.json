This process is continuing with the Treaty of Lisbon (European Constitution in sheeps clothing). As a direct result, the ability of Parliament and of our respresentatives to administer the affairs of this country has been eroded beyond recognition, yet MPs are being paid at the same levels despite this significant reduction in their responsibilities. The level of pay should reflect the level of responsibility.  The taxpayer is entitled to value for money and if this process is to continue, the pay of MPs and government ministers must be cut to reflect the fact that their function is being reduced to that of Local Council officials.",
