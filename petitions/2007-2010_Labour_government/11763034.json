            "background": "People are people regardless of means of communication & should be treated as such. All children enjoy learning different languages, even 5 year olds, which makes it the best age to start. You could even teach it in nurseries. Why should BSL or its users be segregated? Allow all people from birth through life to be & know they are part of society, not different. I would need an expert opinion to know whether it is possible to do the same for blind children, preferably from a blind person or one who teaches blind people. Blind people can hear, communicate, play & work. I imagine there would need to be an extra teacher in the classroom & specialist equipment for the blind people.\nBehovioural problems of all children hearing or non hearing should be treated equally\nThanks",
