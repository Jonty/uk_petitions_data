            "background": "this petition is being created following the announcement of 23 primary school closures on the isle of wight.These proposals are crazy,the primary schools are continuingly to perform well and its the older children and higher levels of education that continue to fall below standard.Rather than closing schools and re-structuring schools they should be raising the standards within them.They should not expect younger children to travel further to school,especially within a small community and parents who do not have transport,these plans have to be abolished,whoever came up with these proposals really didnt think about it from a parent or childs point of view.If you agree with any off all of these issues which i hope you do please sign this petition,tell your friends about it too.you really could make a difference,many thanks",
