            "background": "Many of us spent our own hard earned money on the HI training course and were promised a bright future in this industry, the way the housing market and the economy is at the moment, it seems unlikely that there will be much work available for us new entrants, therefore we should get some compensation or even a refund because of the lack of work.  Personally, it was very hard at the time to part with the money for the course, but did so with the view to be working and earning a decent living from it.  This has not happened and like many people I am extremely disapointed and disheartened with the whole thing.  Please sign if you feel the same.",
