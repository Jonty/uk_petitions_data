            "background": "Tony Blair lied along with president bush to further western corporations and their interests in the middle east.Mr Bair along with Mr Bush should be arrested and tried at the hague, they are no better than Milosivich, Pol Pot, Stalin and Hitler, they just did it in a stealthier way. The fact that western companies are earning billions of dollars from the misery in Iraq and Afghanistan shows that Mr Blair and Mr Bush have looked after their friends who sit on many of these companies boards making money. The whole middle east scenario is all about control by the U.S, U.K and Israel, the unholy alliance or unholy trinity.",
