Did u know that some our soldiers on tour work for less than half the minimum wage?\nHow come it is fair that someone risks his life, watches as some of his beloved comrades die etc and yet recieve less than the minimum wage? People working in call centres, receptionists etc earn more. Surely this is no way to reward the courage, valour and duty to counrty we get from them!",
