It has been created by a small number of people, bankers mainly, but not only, expressing unreasonable greed in the search of personal gain. this was expressed with clearly no concern for those affected.\nThis is not about bonus values, it is about the pure, unadulterated immorality of such excess greed. It is, simply speaking, just WRONG. I suggest we leave it to the courts to decide if this level of immorality should be punished. Taxing bonuses will not help. They will move to other countries, or tax regions. Make them criminals, and that makes the ill-gotten gains the public's to do with as is fit (let's not start talking about helicopters here).",
