Much official research has been done into the adverse effects of sodium fluoride on the human body, please, research them. If you feel that as human beings, we are entitled to our birth right of natural, clean, healthy drinking water, a source of survival, please show your concern by signing this petition. If enough people sign maybe we will get the democratic rights we original should have to chose what is in our water. Exercise your rights.",
