Between 1997 and 2004, up to four million people died in the conflict. In the latest mortality survey published in the Lancet, the IRC estimates today, three years later, 38,000 people die each month. A particularly brutal aspect is the war against women.  \u2018We are not talking about normal rapes anymore. This is sexual terrorism, because they're completely destroyed - they put hot plastics, wood, bamboo, guns inside, so the women need heavy repair surgery. An eighteen-month-old child died with broken legs after being raped for two months - males have suffered rape and genital mutilation. At Panzi Hospital, in Bukavu, eastern Congo, we found 60% are carried out by Hutu from Rwanda, the other 40% by rebel and Government troops. The hospital has up to 250 raped women waiting or healing after surgery\u2019. Please take action now.",
