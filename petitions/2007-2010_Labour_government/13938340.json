        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "As a parent, I rely on the current tax relief on child care vouchers as a saving on overall child care costs, which have increased significantly over the last number of years. It is very  short sighted of the government to propose to abolish this tax relief as the govenment is attempting to get parents back into work. This proposal will stop many parents from working, and therefore stay at home with their child/children because the child care affordability factor will not be viable. This outcome will mean a potential increase in benefit claims adding pressure on public funds whilst the child/children will not benefit from social interaction with other children, which may affect later educational performances.",
