            "background": "The real reason for the numerous phone boxes on our pavements is not to serve the public (as today everyone has either a mobile or land-line phone), it is for media companies to profit form bill-board advertising on the side of the boxes. All phone boxes have a notice inside saying \u201cif you would like to advertise your product with us contact us on\u2026\u201d\nThe media companies are turning a blind eye to the fact that these boxes have now become tools to display prostitution cards and a meeting point for drug dealers.\nWe demand the removal of all phone boxes that have become redundant for legitimate use.",
