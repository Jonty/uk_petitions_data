As he has ginger hair his sacking may constitute unfair dismissal on the grounds of disability discrimination.\n3. Snow White and the rest of the dwarfs don't want him to come home.\n4. He hasn't managed to win an away match in the Champions League yet.\n \nOn these grounds any attempt to remove Mr Strachan from his current position of employment would be unjust.",
