            "background": "We believe that the BBC Channels and the TV License should be optional to Sky Subscribers.\n\nIt is appalling that the population is forced to pay for a TV License when they would quite happily go without the BBC.\n\nEven BLIND people only get a 50% discount for the Television License. If you own a mobile phone, you are basically required to own a TV License now.\n\n\"This includes a TV set, digital box, video or DVD recorder, computer, laptop or mobile phone.\" -- Quoted from the TV License website.\n\nPeople should have the option of removing the BBC Content from their Sky Subscriptions, and not have to pay the TV License.",
