        "background": "I urge you to implement a profitsharing system that is non-deferred,generous, frequent, and business-friendly. \nTo be specific:\nallow businesses to return up to 20% of net profits to employees regularly, and give that business a 60% tax credit for that return.   \nThis will quickly increase household income, and is a built-in stimulus!\nIt will change the global economy from the bottom up. It is a politically neutral concept, dovetailing the left and right.  It changes low paying jobs into well-paid partnerships.  \nThis is the answer to the global economy. It is the missing link in the world's search for an equitable economy.\nJohn Huddleston, former IMF chief, agrees that a tax credit for profitsharing will restore confidence in the global economy.   Let's try testing it on a local basis first.\nInvestigate the \"profitsharing uprising\", it is beginning all over the world.\nDr. Darian Lance Smith",
