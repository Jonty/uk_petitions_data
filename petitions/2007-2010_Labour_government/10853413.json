            "background": "National Youth Day is the latest initiative to be pioneered by The National Inner City Young Entrepreneurs Association, an organisation focused on supporting the enterprise activities of the young.  Young people are making valuable and notable contributions to British society through a wide number of activities, including Sport, Business and Politics, yet many are expressing frustration and apathy as a result of negative images that seems to reinforce their negative issues and perceived powerlessness in modern day society.  Therefore National Youth Day will be a platform on which the positive and inspirational young can be congratulated, encouraged and celebrated. NYD can also raise the international profile for UK Youth.",
