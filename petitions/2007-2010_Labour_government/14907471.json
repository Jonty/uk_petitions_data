            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We petition the PM and the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) to reconsider the unfair connection between the (MCS) Micro Generation Certification Scheme and the new (FIT) Feed in Tariffs set for introduction later this year 2010. The MCS Scheme is causing the prices of approved systems to become 'artificially inflated' and out of touch with world wide technology prices. Thereby ensuring only individuals with large amounts of money can pay the inflated prices and are eligible for the Feed In Tariff Scheme. Also allowing them to short cut the planning application process for speedy installations, a crucial part of the Wind and Solar site approval process.\n\nWe the undersigned feel this is grossly unfair to smaller Manufacturers of systems and less fortunate end users. It is further detrimental to the cause of reducing Climate Change. We petition the PM and the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) to remove the connection between the two programs and allow everyone to have a fair and equal opportunity to be part of tackling climate change at home with Green Energy Systems.",
