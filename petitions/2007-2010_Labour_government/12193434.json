            "background": "Justice is for everyone. Over 1000 UK citizens are currently being spied on. The cost of all this surveillance is now \u00a33.5 billion a year. People who spy and inform on others are destroying UK integrity and trust. My worry is that people will no longer trust one another. It was the security services who started the illegal war and this has resulted in even more surveillance. It is easy to create more spys in this current climate.",
