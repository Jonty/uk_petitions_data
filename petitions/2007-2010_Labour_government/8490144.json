Stop Immigrants accessing the Benefits and NHS system unless contributed into.  The quantity of immigrants in this country is affecting villages, towns and cities in the British Isles.  What about the British persons rights!  Women are no longer safe to walk anywhere alone and crime rates have double.  Areas that were once pleasant to live in have become dirty and run down; Our Government should stop considering how British laws and religious beliefs affect the so called \"ethnic minority\" and wake up to the fact that British people are the ethnic minority! - If immigrants coming to this country don't like our laws or religious beliefs they are free to leave, if they choose to stay then live by the laws the govern the British people born here.  But CLOSE OUR BORDERS NOW!and KEEP BRITAIN BRITISH! stop the fundemental errosion of British rights.",
