            "background": "We believe that all children need to be equipped with adequate knowledge to understand the world around them. Politics affects everyone in every country, and by giving all citizens eligible to vote the right to do so, we are assuming that these citizens are able to vote. However, if we do not have the knowledge and understanding to make an informed decision, can it really be said that we are all capable of voting?\nBy introducing compulsory (and unbias) political education, we can ensure that the future generation of voters are making informed decisions. This in turn will lead to a greater participation in elections, and hopefully a more democratic society.",
