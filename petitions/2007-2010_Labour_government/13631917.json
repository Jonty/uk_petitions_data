The debt level the USA owes the UK has increased from $66 Billion to $220 Billion from July 2008 to July 2009.\nDuring this period the unemployment figures rose to 3 Million in the UK.\nThe UK government should take whatever action is required to get this money back and use the money to invest into the UK economy to save jobs and cut our own debt levels.",
