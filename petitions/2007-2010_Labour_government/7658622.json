            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Small Businesses are currently being tricked into paying hundreds of pounds a month because fraudulent companies use scare-tactics (e.g. Debt Recovery Letters, and threats of Court Hearings) to recover illegitimate debts. Trading Standards are aware of these organisations, but as their focus is on the Consumer and not the Business Trade, they do little to prevent this ongoing crisis. We, as legitimate Business owners, appeal to the Government to end this issue by providing Small and Medium Businesses with assistance when dealing with these fraudulent companies. We appeal that justice be served on the people behind the running of these faux-organisations who threaten, demand, and make false accusations of debt against a UK based Small Business.\n\nWe request that something be done about the way complaints from Small Business owners are handled and addressed by Trading Standards or the OFT. We request that the 'scammers' behind these fraudulent companies be dealt with, not by closing their company and letting them off, but with some sort of meaningful penalty and the automatic disqualification of running or starting up further businesses.",
