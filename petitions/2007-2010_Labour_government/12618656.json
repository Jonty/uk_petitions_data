        "background": "Members of Parliament are elected by their constituents to represent them and work on their behalf in public office, and the nature of some of the claims show that some MPs have been taking advantage of their position. The cross-party nature of this scandal shows that simply disciplining individual MPs cannot restore full public confidence in Parliament, but a general election will allow the public to voice their opinion on whether their MP can be trusted with the power given to them by the people. An election should take place as soon as possible, to allow the public to have full confidence that their MP is conducting themselves in an appropriate manner. Given that there is only a year before a general election must be called anyway, we feel that there is little to be lost and much to be gained by calling a general election now.",
