            "background": "Council Tax was first introduced in 1993. Since then it has risen dramatically to the point where today it is far too expensive and the average family is struggling to pay it. The government managed without charging Council Tax for all those years prior to 1993 so why should we put up with such a burden now, especially when we see very little for our money?\nThis petition is to request that the government do away with Council Tax so the struggle and burden are removed.",
