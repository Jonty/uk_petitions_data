            "background": "International pharmacy students graduating from UK universities are disheartened from the irresponsible and unfair decision announced by the Home Office (UKBA) on15-06-2009, which means that international pharmacy graduates may not be able to undertake their pre-registration training year due to IMMEDIATE changes in 'immigration rules'. Mpharm international students and OSPAP (overseas) students believe they have the RIGHT to finish the final part of their degree, pre-registration training. Depriving us from this right is a major betrayal coming out from the country that we invested in to study pharmacy. \nWe ask UKBA to find a solution for the problem it created. Major groups and organizations are invited to support our campaign 'justice for international pharmacy graduates' by signing this petition and joining our facebook group \u2018International pre-reg pharmacy students demand justice from the Home Office\u2019",
