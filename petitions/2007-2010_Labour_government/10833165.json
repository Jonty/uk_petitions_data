            "background": "Need I add any more details? If these products were taxed less, more people would buy them because they would become cheaper and be able to compete better with other unethical products which may be manipulative of poorer people throughout the developing world. This increase in popularity would mean more businesses would offer fairtrade products and thus more businesses would start to employ people fairly and with decent wages throughout the developing world. Therefore everyone wins, cheaper prices for the fairtrade products we buy and better wages for many of the world's poorer people, what could be better?",
