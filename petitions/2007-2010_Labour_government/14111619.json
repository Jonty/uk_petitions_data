            "background": "The idea of spending taxpayer's money on those who have committed the worst crimes is offensive.\n\nNo money at all should be spent on the likes of Maxine Carr, or on Tracey Connolly or Ian Huntley if/when they get released.  If they wanted to live in safety, they should never have done the awful things they did - no one forced them to do it.\n\nEvery penny spent on these worthless excuses for humanity is a penny not spent on the innocent people who actually deserve the spending - and this goes double post credit crunch, when we are heavily in debt and cannot afford to protect murderers.\n\nLeave them to protect themselves - just because you have a duty not to execute them does not mean you have to bend over backwards to save their lives.",
