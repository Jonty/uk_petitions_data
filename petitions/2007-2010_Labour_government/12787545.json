            "background": "Bethnal Green Centre is under threat. The London Borough of Tower Hamlets was awarded the freehold of the centre in 1996 in order to \u201cprovide adult education to the local community.\u201d This award required the Borough to grant a 99 year lease for Tower Hamlets College to continue to provide adult education classes in the centre. The lease was never signed. The Borough and the College are currently negotiating a deal to lease out the centre to schools and other unknown 3rd parties to displace the adult education that has gone on here for over 80 years. We believe this centre belongs to the local community of Tower Hamlets  for the sole purpose of ADULT education.We call upon the Borough to maintain the centre as an ADULT Education Centre, in recognition of its value to the community and outstanding historical record as being the first Adult Education Centre in this country.",
