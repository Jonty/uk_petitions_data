            "background": "Our current Prime Minister is unelected and was previously a scottish constituency MP, elected by voters who are now properly represented in their own Parliament in Scotland.  It is, therefore, in Gordon Brown's own best interests for him to delay in calling a general election for as long as he can because he has no parliamentary seat to go back to when he is no longer Prime Minister.  This is the best (or worst) example for taking the decision over whether or not to have a general election away from the one man (or woman) who can most benefit from having that responsibility.  Our political system, currently, is so absolutely corrupted that individual politicians should NOT be entrusted with this responsibility.  We need to adopt something along the line of the US system where a general election is held on a date laid down by statute which cannot be changed by politicians in their own interests.",
