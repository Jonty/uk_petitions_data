I quite like you, although I am confused when a Scotsman supports the England Rugby team.\n\nStill, there's nothing like a good bandwagon which brings me to my subject.\n\nGordon, you must ban Nissan Micra's from the road. If you do this I will personally be held liable for this guarantee:\n\nTHE CRASHES ON BRITAIN'S ROADS WILL FALL.\n\nI love you Gordon, but this is just getting silly, Micra drivers must be stopped. Don't worry, they're going slow enough, it shouldn't be a problem...",
