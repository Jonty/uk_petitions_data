        "background": "In the recent plans to improve Altrincham railway station the demolition of the beautiful victorian footbridge was announced. The bridge spans all four platforms. Reason being that there is not enough disabled access. However this is in fact false as there is a disabled crossing at the end of the platforms and lifts can be easily added without destroying the structure.\nThe case therefore for its replacement is obscure. Please don't let it happen.\nWork due to start in 2011.\nAnnounced byt the Greater Manchester Transport Executive (GMPTE)",
