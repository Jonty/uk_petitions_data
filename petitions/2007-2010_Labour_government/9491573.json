I have been trying for over 6 months now to get my life back on track by taken my self off  incapacity benefits. I have applied for over 100 jobs ever by phone or by email and as soon as I state I am registered disabled you don't even get a response or asked to come for an interview so employers have now found a new way to  Discrimination in an in direct way. A law should be passed that all disable registered people should be offered the chance of a job interview as a minimum by allowing this the government would be on track of getting over a hundred thousand registered incapacity benefits people back to work .myself would be one of them I did not come into this world to be supported by state benefits",
