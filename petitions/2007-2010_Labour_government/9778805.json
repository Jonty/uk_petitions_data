            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Recently I read in the Telegraph that two Christian ministers had been threatened with arrest (under hate crime legislation) after handing-out Christian leaflets and speaking to a group of 'Asian youths' (quoted from the newspaper).\n\nThey were also threatened by the special police officer who warned them against preaching their religion in a Muslim area!  And he also told them that they'd be beaten-up if they return!\n\nThe paper didn't mention what denomination the special police officer was.\n\nThe response from the police force was that the special police officer involved would be sent for 'communication training'.\n\nPolice officers,even special ones are public servants. Where personal religious beliefs interfere with their duty, then they are unfit for purpose and should be fired. The officer should himself be arrested for intimidation.",
