            "background": "We, the undersigned, wish the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) to abolish the required numeracy test for all trainee teachers in England effective 1st January 2010.\n\nThe test is an unfair measurement of the skills necessary to become a teacher.  Despite current pedagogical development resulting in the recognition of various learning styles, the numeracy test requires all trainee teachers to be able to quickly process numerical information and compute it auditorially.  \n\nIn the workplace, this is neither necessary or practical.  Furthermore, the ability to recognise and compute quickly is not necessarily a skill that determines success or intelligence.  It is not raising the standards among the teaching profession in an appropriate way.",
