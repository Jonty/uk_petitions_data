            "background": "Peterhead is the largest white-fish port in Europe. The HMRC office in Peterhead currently provides a first class service to the fishing industry nationwide and to the local community. By closing the office, HMRC are removing forever an area of expertise that supports the fishing industry and aids it to continue to grow. They are also taking away the deterrant that currently exists that means most fishermen pay what tax they are due to, which means we all benefit as honest taxpayers who use the services provided by taxpayers money. What is to say that they will continue to do so if nobody is there to police the tax system? By 2015, will there be a local tax office North of Edinburgh and Glasgow? Not at this rate! Save your local tax offices, by supporting all of the online petitions. This government is ripping the heart out of local communities and we need to take action to force them to stop doing it!",
