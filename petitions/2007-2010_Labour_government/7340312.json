            "background": "The compulsory collection and retention of DNA samples by the police is a violation of Chapter II Articles 7 and 8 of the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights.\n\nIt is indisputable that DNA evidence is an invaluable tool to law enforcement however the retention of samples collected from indivduals who are arrested and later freed or found innocent in a court of law is a violation of civil liberty.\n\nThe law does not require the police to retain samples from indivduals but does allow them the right to do so, this creates a mechanism of selective application and furthermore the lack of such a law acknowledges that such retention is unnecessary.\n\nDNA is the most basic component of the individuality of every human being and may yield information which the state could not and would not compel by any other means. On this basis any sample required of a citizen who is later determined to be innocent should be immediately destroyed as recommended by the Human Genetics Commission.",
