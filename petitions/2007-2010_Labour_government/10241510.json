The procedures are heavily weighted against the parents and are more in keeping with the Feudal System rather than those of a fair and just country!We feel that these Hearings should be heard in Open Courts and the so called Forced Adoptions of the Closed Court  outlawed!Also, that the public advertising of children put forward for adoption should be stopped, they are not on Special Offer at the local supermarket.  They have feelings too and a right to keep their own identity which comes from their own roots. Not to be taken away from their own families that love and want to keep them!",
