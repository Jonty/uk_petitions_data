            "action": "protect consumers from being sued to bankruptcy by Britain's big housebuilders should they find themselves unable to complete on contracts agreed before the credit crunch started and encourage the housebuilders to renegotiate with purchasers to help them complete in the current economic climate.",

            "background": "When you purchase a new build home, or one off-plan, there is very little consumer protection in this country. In fact, you have more rights buying a bottle of milk in a supermarket than you do purchasing a new build home. Currently thousands of people are being chased through the courts by Britains greedy housebuilders (the big firms) for non-completion on off-plan contracts signed before the credit crunch began. Many people are relying on mortgages and now cannot get a mortgage, or they cannot borrow enough as the value of these properties has collapsed in the past 6 months. Most of the builders are completely refusing to renegotiate and are instead retaining large deposits and proceeding to sue individuals in court for damages and compensation, driving most to bankruptcy. At the same time this industry is seeking Government assistance, yet holding consumers to ransom.",
