The Billions wasted on foreign aid must be put to better use in protecting this country from more natural disasters, and ensuring the safety of the voting public.\n\nThe money must be put into developing our own crumbling infrastructure, which successive governments has chosen to erode at the cost to it own citizens. We want better flood defenses, hospitals, roads and rail systems, the list goes on.\n\nStop wasting our money! \n\n \n\n \n\nSUSPEND OVERSEAS AID NOW.",
