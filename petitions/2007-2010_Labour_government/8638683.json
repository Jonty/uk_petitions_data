        "background": "...as VAT was designed to do in the first place. The people of this nation seem to forget this little factoid, hence sit back and are consistently double-taxed not only on their expenditure, but also on their income. VAT works across the board, ie it is indiscrimate on who it taxes, income tax is nothing to someone who earns 100k. It is a serious burden to those on <10k. No math involved here. Ten percent of 10k is 1k, which is a fair chunk. 40 percent of 100k is 40k, that earner is still netting 60k! ANYONE ELSE SEE A PROBLEM HERE!?",
