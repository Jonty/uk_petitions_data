            "background": "Grammar schools have made a great contribution to the education of this nation. They have provided a good, decent education to bright children all around the country, regardless of colour, creed, wealth or social standing. Yet successive British governments seem bent on tearing apart these remarkably successful schools, criticising them as 'elitist', despite their obvious contribution to social mobility and education - national comparisons show areas with selective school systems achieve 15-20% better GCSE results for ALL pupils. We therefore petition the Prime Minister to defend this education system and to oppose any legislation that attempts to dismantle it, such as the Northern Ireland Education Order currently going through Westminster.",
