        "background": "The British Empire Medal (BEM) is a British medal awarded for meritorious civil or military service worthy of recognition by the crown.  A British Empire Medal for Gallantry was awarded from 14 January 1958 until its replacement with the Queen's Gallantry Medal in 1974.\n\nWhen our monarch changes, and a King is on the throne, the medal will be changed again.\n\nThis can confuse people and people awarded with the BEM/QGM may be recognised for different acts.\n\nPlease sign this petition to halt the changing names of medals and return the Queen's Gallantry Medal to its original name of the British Empire Medal, thus keeping the heritage of the medal.\n\nThanks",
