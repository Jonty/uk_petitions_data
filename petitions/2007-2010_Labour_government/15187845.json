            "background": "Certain UK airlines are currently accepting payment from newly qualified pilots in return for allowing that pilot to operate their revenue aircraft for a limited period of time, typically 150 hours.\n\nThis practise is a disturbing development which brings no advantage to pilots paying for the scheme who typically pay over \u00a340,000 for the experience, which will be in addition to approximately \u00a370,000 debt incurred during basic training.\n\nThe practise of pay to fly demands that the student pilot is supervised by a training captain.  Consequently, fare paying passengers are effectively being transported in a single pilot capacity, which is in contradiction of British aviation law. In certain situations student pilots have less than 200 hours total time and are both incompetent and incapable of  flying the aircraft in the event of incapacitation of the training pilot. I consider this a dangerous practise and ultimately an accident waiting to happen.\n\nThis practise needs to be stopped immediately.",
