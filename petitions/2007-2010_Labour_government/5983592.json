A number of these warships could be purchased from the United States and  then be easily adapted for use in the Royal Navy as an affordable way of increasing and modernising the British naval fleet. Ex-American cruisers, destroyers, frigates and possibly a couple of Marine carriers with their Marine Harrier aircraft would benefit the British Navy especially in their deployment globally.",
