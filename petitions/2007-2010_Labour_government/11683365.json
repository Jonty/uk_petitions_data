        "background": "Quadricycles take on many forms, from 4 Wheel Ride On Motorcycles to 'Buggy' style vehicles and Small cars with up to 4 Seats and Boot. Quadricycles are further categorised as either Heavy or Light.\n\nThe 'Type Approval' process for vehicles classified as a Quadricycle does not allow for testing C02 emissions thus eliminating them from \nthe current Banded VED structure and placing them into the Private/light goods Category (TC11) at cost of \u00a3120.00 per year.\n\nWe feel that the government should re evaluate the taxation \nprocedures and charges for quadricycles and create a separate VED Taxation \nCategory for all Quadricycles.",
