            "background": "Whilst we do nor expect our governments to seek a mandate for each of the unexpected decisions that form the normal business of government, by no stretch of the imagination, can these extraordinary events, with the near collapse of the banking system and huge amounts of public money being spent, be considered \u201cnormal government\u201d.\n\nThe PM has not been democratically elected either by the country or by his party. There is no mandate for what is surely the most important decisions we as a nation face in a generations: decisions which tie the hands of future governments and potentially leave us indebted for generations to come.\n\nWe call upon the PM to hold a referendum, so that the country may hold the necessary public debate on the future of the UK, and so that the people of the UK may decide whether the government has the democratic authority to undertake the actions they deem necessary to tackle this crisis.",
