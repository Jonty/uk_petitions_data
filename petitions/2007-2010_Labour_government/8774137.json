            "background": "Despite the abhorent profit margins acheived by the Arcadia group, the producers and manufacturers of the company's cotton are subjected to gruelling politician labour, in a country which grossly violates their basic human rights. Children are taken out of school by their teachers to work on the cotton plantations, with no protective clothing provided for their safety. Workers pay up to \u00a3725 to get the job (7 months wages) and then receive between 22p and 40p an hour once there.\n\nThe Redress Fashion Campaign is petitioning for change in 3 main ways;\n1. Paying suppliers enough for workers to receive a living wage.\n2. Ensuring workers are free to organise and speak out.\n3. Allow independent assessors to ensure that companies are maintaining an ethical standard of practise.  \n\nThe Arcadia group is the biggest high street retailer not to join the Ethical Trading Initiative. Whilst joining is not an answer in itself, it is an essential step to improving conditions in its supply chain.",
