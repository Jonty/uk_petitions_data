        "background": "I am a serving member of the armed forces and i spend a lot of time away from my barracks but i am still expected to buy a TV licence.\n                      I recently wrote to HM Prisons for information on how a prisoner would be able to afford a TV licence and was told they do not need to buy a licence as prisons are on the CROWN land. Now i do not believe that it is right that someone who has commited a crime should get the privillage of watching TV without buying a licence. When the majority of pensioners and decent law abiding citizens who can hardly afford to buy a licence need to have one.",
