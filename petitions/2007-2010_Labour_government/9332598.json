            "background": "The only way to stop the vile trade in trafficking women and children for sex is to make the selling of sex illegal in the Uk. The huge rise in so called \"massage parlours\", i.e brothels is a disgrace and licensing by local authorities should cease as should advertising in local papers etc.All prostitution wherever it takes place is a terror for thousands of women and distructive to the families involved. It is not a profession as many would like to call it but a degradation to women and children.",
