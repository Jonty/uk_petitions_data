            "background": "Any astronomer knows that Dr Allan Chapman tours Britain and the world tirelessly giving some of the most elegant and informative lectures, which entertain and inform his willing audiences. \nHe is always very accommodating after each lecture in terms of meeting people and sharing his immense knowledge in a most enthusiastic and engaging way. His animated presentations and vast understanding of astronomical history, recalled from memory and without notes, really brings the subjects of his lectures to life in a most spellbinding way. \nHis many appearances on The Sky at Night are also very entertaining and I for one have been inspired massively by him. \nI believe he fully deserves a knighthood for his outstanding contribution to astronomy and for his great encouragement to others to take up this fantastic hobby.",
