MPs who have made fraudulent claims, dodged tax, not abided by the Commons' own allowance regulations, must be prosecuted to the full extent that the law allows. As the ordinary tax payer would be. The Inland Revenue is not interested in 'innocent mistakes' that the ordinary taxpayer makes. MPs must be brought to justice and the only way this can happen is through prosecution. If they are merely allowed to stand down and bow out of the limelight, it will make a mockery of our country and our people.",
