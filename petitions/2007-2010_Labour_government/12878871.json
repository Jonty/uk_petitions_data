        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In Hong Kong, due to historical reasons, there are more than 3 million British passport holders. Most of them are British Nationals (Overseas) and some of them are British Citizens.\n\nA British passport costs more than HK$1600 (\u00a3124) in Hong Kong. It is already one-tenth of the monthly salary of an average employee here. A package tour to countries nearby (e.g. Taiwan, Thailand, the Philippines etc.) only costs about HK$2500.\n\nThe British Govt is losing its revenues from issuing passports in HK because many people are tempted to apply for other passports. With government subsidy, the HKSAR passport only costs about HK$400. The passport renewal office at the British Consulate General Hong Kong has been very quiet.\n\nCurrently UK Residence Permits for BN(O)s and Renunciation of BN(O) status are free of charge.\n\nIt would be more beneficial to both the UK Govt and UK passport holders in Hong Kong if a passport can be renewed in HK for a much cheaper and competitive price.",
