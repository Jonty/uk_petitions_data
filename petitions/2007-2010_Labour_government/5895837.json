Women are kept under and are not allowed the same freedom that western women enjoy. Mosques have been hotbeds for terrorist and radicalisation of young Muslims so why build more.  Churches are open for anyone to attend, but Mosques are closed off to the british public. It will be interesting to know how much the British Tax payer is paying towards this.  If one wanted to build a large church in this area would planning permiion be given?",
