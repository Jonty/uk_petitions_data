Ah've got tae get this sorted\" he said, as he single-handedly stopped international terrorism at Glasgow Airport.\n\nThis man, who was just doing his job, kept cool under pressure. He instinctively knew what he had to do, and he did it. While most people would have ran screaming, John got it \"sorted\". If only more of us were like John, the world would be a much safer place.\n\nFor risking life and limb for what is right, he deserves some official recognition, and possibly to be made Scotland's Official Superhero.",
