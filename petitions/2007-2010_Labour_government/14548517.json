            "background": "The recognition of the possible non-ability to take part in PE within school, due to suffering from marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome & Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.\n\nMany children with sometimes life threatening conditions are still being made to take part in PE in some UK schools. This still happens even with written information from the child's medical expert. Physical education teachers need to be made aware that when a medical consultant says No to PE, this means No.\n\nMany sufferers are in the possibly fatal position of being at the point of Aortic dissection or pneumothorax if they were to take part in contact sports or even pushed beyond their physical capabilities.\n\nPE staff also need to be aware that there might be a serious reason behind a child's reluctance to take part perhaps due to Muscular Skeletal problems or lack of energy.",
