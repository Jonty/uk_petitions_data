            "background": "Following the recent budget by this present labour government I feel that I must do something about the increase in VED. I have a 2003 2.0l family hatch back. I need this car as I need the room for the family. I think it is outrageous that by 2010 the VED for my car will increase to \u00a3310 per annum. As far as I'm concerned this is totally unacceptable and must stop. The government are pricing me out of my car. The VED should be scrapped all together and a penny should be added to the cost of a litre of fuel, so the more you drive the more you pay. They also seem to forget the VED was bought in after the 2nd world war to help pay for the road repairs",
