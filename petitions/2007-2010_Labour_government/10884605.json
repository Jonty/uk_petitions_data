        "background": "The government has undertaken to underwrite private investors' money held in failed Icelandic banks. It is now considering its position in relation to local authorities' investments. Such investments, made in good faith, were taken out by the most important local public bodies that underpin the baseline services holding local communities together. It is vital that the goverment ensures these bodies are protected against further financial loss at a time when most are already struggling to maintain services in the face of ever-tightening budgets.",
