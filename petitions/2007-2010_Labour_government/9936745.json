        "background": "Like many peaceful, law - abiding citizens, I am appalled by AOL reports that more than 1,000 people were warned by police last year that they were the subject of a murder plot. \n\nSenior officers across the country issued so-called Osman warnings to businessmen, drug dealers and gang members after receiving specific intelligence that they were at serious risk of being killed by individuals with the resources to arrange their death.\n\nLikewise, death threats, scuffles and skirmishes are often a prelude to more serious crimes - which often go either unreported or not acted upon. Please do something about this, PM.\n\nWhen he was arrested, Paget-Lewis said: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you stop me before I did it, I gave you all the warning signs?\u201d",
