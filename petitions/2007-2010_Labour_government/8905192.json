            "background": "Current policies regarding welfare reform, pandered to by the media, creating a social stigma in an already widening gap between wealthy and poor is proactively harming the health of the sick, disabled and vulnerable.  Near levels of hysteria towards already vulnerable people in our society have been heightened, played upon and creating further social problems for those it affects.  In modern times, the treatment of the vulnerable like this should be considered nothing less than disgraceful.  And the already existing problems these people face is eroding their health further with unnecessary worry.  And the more support they get, the more your voice is heard the better.",
