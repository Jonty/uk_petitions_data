            "background": "History shows that human beings are not able to properly cope with the stress of being Prime Minister for a long period of time.\nThe Americans, as well as a large number of other countries, recognise it is counter-productive to expect and therefore to allow Prime Ministers, or Presidents to serve more than 2 consecutive periods in office.\nBy limiting the continuous duration, that a single Prime Minister can serve, removes the potential for lame governments to continue beyond their natural usefulness.\n\nLinked to this is a separate existing petition, on this website, to disallow changes in Prime Minister during the normal term of a Parliament, without a General Election.  You are recommended to join the separate existing petition to require a \"within term\" retiring Prime Minister to call a General Election, instead of passing the job to another member of the same political party. The current situation is not democratic",
