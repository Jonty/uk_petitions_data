            "background": "The current system of M.P. claims for expenses and allowances has upset and angered members of the public, who have lost confidence in M.P.'s of all parties.\nThose who choose to take up politics should be offered student style loans to cover the additional costs of being an M.P. \nAs students are expected to repay their loans when their income arising from their education achieves set levels, so M.P.'s should repay these loans when they receive income from lecture tours, Lobbyists, Directorships and from lucrative book deals.",
