            "background": "The Government proposes having 47 million \"smart meters\" fitted in 26 million homes by 2020 at a cost of between \u00a37 billion and \u00a39 billion, or around \u00a3340 per household.\n\nThe devices will save the average household only around\u00a328 a year off a typical annual bill, so it will take 12 years to break even.\n\nThe savings represent a tiny fraction of the current average annual gas bill of  >\u00a3800 a year and electricity ones of >\u00a3445.\n\nThe costs/benefits simply do not stack up for the majority. Introduction will mean pointless spending, redundancies, and control of our households by (mostly foreign) power suppliers.",
