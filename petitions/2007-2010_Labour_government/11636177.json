        "action": "...prevent any payments being made to those dependants of terrorists killed in the commission of their crimes.The thought of these payments is repulsive to those of us who have served in Northern Ireland, and who have had friends killed or injured there as a result of their service.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The law in this country precludes criminals from benefiting from their crimes. Why should dependants of terrorists? Such payments will acknowledge terrorists as victims rather than perpetrators, who chose to join organisations proscribed by UK Govt, and carry out atrocities on their behalf. \n\nThey took part in bombings or shootings, with the sole intent of killing innocent members of the public or the Security Forces. Terrorists killed whilst carrying out attacks, are the authors of their own misfortune. Any payment will only legitimise these illegal organisations and their activities. Successive UK Governments have had policies of NOT negotiating with terrorists, so why reward them for their crimes now? \n\nWe feel that anyone living in a law abiding society, and in particular, the citizens of Guildford, Birmingham, London, Manchester, and Warrington, who suffered murderous attacks, or lived in fear of them, would be abhorred if such payments were made. \n\nFinally, can we assume that this will set a precedent that will be available for the Taliban or even Argentine forces, or anyone else who feels victimised by the British Government, to make claims in the future?",
