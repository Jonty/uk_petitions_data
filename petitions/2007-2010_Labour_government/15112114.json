            "background": "At some point during the past few years some car headlights have increased in brightness to the point where they are extremely dangerous if they are not set correctly and the beam is pointing directly in your eyes. The beam is so bright and if the car with LED headlights is coming from either direction the effect is blinding and can cause many accidents putting our lives at risk on the road. We would like to see a law only allowing them on the road if the headlights have been set correctly with the beam pointing downwards towards the road rather than upwards directly into the eyes of other road users.",
