        "background": "It is now time to review all the policies and legislation that is linked to climate change.This is now needed due to the fact that more and more scientists are disputing the co2 theory.This is even more urgent as there is now evidence that over the last ten years the planet has cooled not warmed.I would urge all MPs remeber that nearly all of them are incapable of understanding in depth the science involved in this because when it goes wrong it will be you that are held acountable not the scientists.Sign this petition if you want to see real action on climate change in other words this nonsense to stop.Billions of pounds are at stake here and its our money the tax payers that is at risk.This must stop now no more money should be taken in green taxes until it is 100% certain that man is to blame.",
