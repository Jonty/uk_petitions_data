        "background": "Dogtanian was a cartoon first shown in the UK in 1985 on CBBC.  It was massively popular and the theme tune became a household name.  Today's children are fed a diet of mainly US-imported cartoons which lack the in-depth storylines and quality of older shows.\nIn these cheerless, cash-strapped times, I urge the Prime Minister to contact the rights holder BRB International SA of Madrid, to air Dogtanian again on TV so that those of us who were children in the 80s can enjoy 30 minutes of entertainment and today's children too.",
