            "background": "Current law states that you are classed as a resident of the United Kingdom if you are in the country at the start of the tax year. Therefore if you leave to work abroad at any point after 5th April you are liable to pay UK tax on foreign income for the rest of the tax year. We believe that it is wrong for the government to charge tax when you are no longer in the country and will no longer be in receipt of tax paid services.",
