            "background": "Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic liver disease which can cause progressive destruction of the bile ducts in the liver. The bile ducts are channels through which bile flows. The body attacks the cells lining the bile ducts within the liver as if they are foreign to the body itself, i.e. attacking ones own cells. This damage causes poor drainage of bile acids, which leak outwards and damage the normal liver cells. Cirrhosis is often assumed to mean damage to the liver caused by excessive alcohol consumption. This is not the case - cirrhosis simply means an advanced form of scarring, which changes the structure of the liver cells. This disease, now recognized by Social Services as a Disability, has no cure, only a drug, Ursodeoxycholic Acid, which puts up a barrier, slowing the progression of the disease preventing further destruction of the liver. \nThis petition is to get this drug prescribed to all who need it without having to pay for it.  For those who do not receive free prescriptions, it is a financial burden.  \nPBC is a disease which kills, so why should we pay for a drug which will keep you alive ?? \nPlease show your support by signing the petition.",
