        "background": "We have been campaigning for many months to have the Dartford Crossing revert to a free service, as promised by Government once it had recouped its construction costs. If it is sold to private enterprise that will confirm its long-term status as a paid for service. Whilst I vehemently disagree in principal with your Thatcheresque asset stripping, the inclusion of the Dartford Crossing is particularly unpalatable and it should be excluded as not being in the public interest.",
