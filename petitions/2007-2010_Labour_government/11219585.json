        "background": "Why should people who earn more pay a higher percentage for income tax? \n\nIf a flat percentage rate was introduced - however much you earn you still pay more money into the Government coffers. \n\nThis would have an advantage that people wouldn't deliberately reduce the amount they take home to be below the threshold and encourage you to earn more - putting more money into the economy and people's pockets, which they will then spend.\n\nWhy do we penalise people who are successful - creating jobs and doing well for themselves?",
