            "background": "I am white and had a four month gap between jobs as was made redundant. The Asians that were made redundant with me were all in a job within 6 weeks of being redundant. This is despite of us having the same amount of experience give/take 6 months. I did apply for many jobs, but was rejected at the first stage (application). Whereas, my Asian friends attended interviews. They also saw very few non Asians attending the interview or assessment centre. The other non-Asians that were made redundant with me said it took 3-4 months to get a job. This means companies have targets for recruiting a certain percentage of non-white to be within the company's targets. People should be employed on the suitability of the role, not for the colour of their skin.",
