            "background": "At moment pensioners receive either \u00a387.30 for a single person or \u00a3139.60 for a couple. This is very unfair and you can see why some pensioners are deciding whether to feed themselves or keep themselves warm. I think pensioners should get the equivalent of someone working fulltime on the National Minimum Wage. Currently as of April 2008 when the petition was created the NMW is \u00a35.52 per hour. So, the minimum pensioners should receive is \u00a3193.20 each per week. In order to make up the difference, it would only be fair for to reduce the benefits of those unwilling to work. In some cases, people get more money for not working than for working, which is wrong. I think the maximum payment per week for these should be 12 hours of NMW (\u00a366.24 based on April 2008 figures). This will make some of these non workers to seek work. The govt should be awarding for those who have retired, not those who cannot be bothered to work.",
