            "background": "I regularly deal with offenders who go in and out of prison all the time.  The reason for this...??  \"Prison is easy, I don't have to worry about rent, bills, food, fags, or anything.  If I'm out I have to sort all this out myself\"  This is what was actually said to me!!!  Prisons should be somewhere offenders hate to go, a punishment, but at the moment, they see it as a holiday camp.  Take away all the luxuries like Sky TV, gyms, etc...., and make it unpleasant.  Crime WOULD drop, and criminals would have to take responsiblity for themselves, instead of letting the state to do it for them.  Hardship does work, if they didn't like it, then behave and don't go to prison.",
