Without any reference to you a Policy Provider (such as a Sky maintenance Policy) can be renewed year after year without any further authorisation from the Policy Holder (You). You are not sent any paperwork relating to the renewal, not are you asked if you would like to take out the Policy for a further period. It should therefore be made illegal for a Company to renew a Policy of any discription without seeking written confirmation from the Policyholder that they accept the renewed terms!",
