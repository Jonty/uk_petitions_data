            "background": "Tony Hart is over 80 years old and has recently suffered a stroke. This has meant he has had to give up his art that he has famously shared with the nation during mine and many other peoples lifetimes. During his 50 years of broadcasting he has probably inspired the creative efforts of youngsters more than anyone else. For that reason we think he should be rewarded with an acknowledgement of his outstanding achievements.\nLet's make it happen.",
