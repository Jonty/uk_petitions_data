Even in the 3rd world people don't have a link between who they are, where they live and how they vote.  There is continuing and rapidly building evidence that corrupted party political activitists are using this information to the detriment of voters rights and the rules must be changed so that we go back to being able to vote without having a record of what we voted put into the hands of people who cannot be trusted not to misuse the information at any and every opportunity.",
