        "background": "The European Union \"doctrine\" of Subsidiarity (a horrible word with sensible meaning) requires that anything that is done should be done at the lowest administrative level that is practical.\n\nThis means that amalgamating several District Councils to form one Unitary County Council is illegal. Instead, the EU doctrine would require that DC activities, if anything, be devolved down to multiple Parish Councils.\n\nExcessive centralisation is bad for democracy. I used to live in Salisbury District, I now live in Wiltshire Unified County, I have not moved.",
