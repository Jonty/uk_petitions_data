        "background": "Light entertainment shows such as X factor and 'strictly come dancing' seem to have produced a quantifiable increase in interest in sining, music and dancing.\n\nI would suggest that a program such as ITV's Gladiators might do the same for health and fitness. Given the increase in morbid obesity in under 18's roll models are certainly required. As such the below signed and I advocate a public subsidy to be set aside from the TV license fee to pay for the restoration  of Gladiators or a similar program to our prime time TV schedule.",
