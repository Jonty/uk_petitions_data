        "background": "Employers are continuing to age discriminate even though this is now against the law.\nOlder people, aged 40+ who have worked for the majority of their lives but have been long term unemployed through no fault of their own are less likely to return to work.\nMost of these people are not work shy and they possess valuable skills and attitude.\nEmployers often discriminate against applicants who have the necessary skills for the job but are perhaps \"too old\".\nOlder people should not be \"written off\" by employers because they are less likely to require time-consuming, costly training and they are often fit enough and skilled enough to do the job just as equally as a younger person.\nEmployers should be monitored from time to time without warning and and valid, detailed reasons should be given by the employer to those whose applications have been rejected.\n \"Not suitable\" is not good enough.\nEmployers should be fined if they discriminate for any reason.",
