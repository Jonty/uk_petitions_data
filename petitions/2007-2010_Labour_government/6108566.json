            "background": "Leeds' roads are the worst in the UK in terms of condition and quality. Leeds City Council asks for tax, and seems to give nothing in return, other than boast about and promote itself to non-Leeds residents. It has also wasted millions on a lighting project that could have been spent on repairing the countless roads that have been neglected, and are in a condition that is non-existant in the third world. They are uncomfortable to drive over and cause damage to vehicles and cyclists. We deserve better roads.",
