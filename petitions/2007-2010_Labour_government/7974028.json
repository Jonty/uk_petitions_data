            "background": "There is simply no rational moral argument to stand in the way of creating embryos for this vital and potentially life saving work. The 'embryos' used in this type of research are small clumps of undifferentiated cells, called blastocysts (look them up!). They have no capacity for feeling any pain or loss. You kill more cells every time you scratch your nose. If your morals are concerned with suffering and happiness then you have no more reason than a privative 'yuck' factor for opposing this. Adult and child human lives are already being needlessly wasted because of the 'yuck factor' blocking medical advances. The government must confront this head on and educate the general population about this essential area of research.",
