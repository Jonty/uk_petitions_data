            "background": "As the only option for law-abiding citizens who have no shame in wanting to pursue a certain path, alcohol does more harm than good. It costs families, individuals, their friends and lovers, the NHS so much.\n\nThe well respected adage that 'everything in moderation' is ok, is not possible when there is only one option. It is best to go one way or another, and not sit on the fence.\n\nCertain people will never change. That's life and it's their chosen course, how they choose in their minds to live it to the full. \n\nI believe that the problem will never conveniently disappear until we go one way or another, and that as we seem so intent on going one way then we should put our hearts where our words are and see what happens.\n\nLet's see how certain folk react when deprived of their drug of choice. Will they all get fat on bacon butties? Will they turn to shrooms or something even harder?\n \nGood people are suffering because they are only free to indulge in one thing, and the issue is never going to disappear as long as that thing remains freely available alongside the prohibition of all else.",
