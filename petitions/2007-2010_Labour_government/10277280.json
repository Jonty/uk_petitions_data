            "background": "The dedication and professionalism of retired members of HM Forces and Emergency Services who served the Queen during her reign needs to be recognised.  Allowing those who served for a period of 5 years during her reign to purchase and wear either the Queen\u2019s Silver or Golden Jubilee Medal would allow those who believe they were overlooked and somewhat undervalued to show others that they served their Queen with great pride and dedication. Criteria being 5 years service during first 25 years reign for Silver Jubilee Medal and 5 years service during next 25 years reign for Golden Jubilee Medal.  Some would be eligible for both. This would be a no cost option for the Government but allow those who qualified to receive rightful recognition as many believe that the criteria for the issuing of these medals was too restricted and was basically down to cost. Do the right thing now and make amends to those who served and allow them to show others they served with dedication and loyalty.",
