            "background": "Instead of pursuing tighter controls on \"Internet Piracy\" the Entertainment Industry should be embracing the potential of the Internet and File Sharing, allowing the sharing of copyrighted material and helping upgrade the hardware and software to enable high-speed and perfect quality delivery of their products.\nInternet users should be given a viable alternative to piracy, that doesn't cost the earth. The alternative should give full access to all copyrighted material at a price(Either by a direct charge to the user, through Ad-revenue, etc...) which should reflect the absence of a \"Hard Copy Medium\", this would allow many people to become \"Responsible File Sharers\".\nOnce this viable alternative is in place then moves should be made to crack down on Internet Piracy.",
