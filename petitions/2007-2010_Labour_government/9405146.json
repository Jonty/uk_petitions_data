        "background": "Rick Astley is British. He is as British as Blackpool rock.  He grew up in Newton Le Willows and became a national and international sensation with his musical talent.\n\nEven to this day, the power of his 80's hit 'Never Gonna Give You Up' is still felt, both in the online and offline media.\n\nI propose that the current national anthem is changed to something more modern and current, which reflects Britishness. I feel that Rick Astley satisfies these qualities and that is why the national anthem should be changed to this fantastic song.\n\nAlso, I believe that the Prime Minister should recite the song every Christmas, on a national broadcast.",
