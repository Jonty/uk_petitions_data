        "background": "this government should be ashamed of itself for selling the people who elected it down the european gravy train river without a paddle or referendum. I urge this government to listen to its people for once or face a vote of no confidence in it by the people via a referendum or general election. This government has lost its moral authority by ignoring its election manifesto promises. It is destroying this country with its policies on immigration, law, sentencing, health service meddling and tax raising. I call on MR Brown to call an election and a referendum on the European constitution issue straight away.",
