        "background": "Local authorities should not be allowed merely to paint white lines on the road and then call them cycle lanes.  They should also be discouraged, if not prohibited, from placing cycle lanes on pavements where cyclists might pose a danger to pedestrians.\n\nCycle lanes should not be so termed unless they meet requirements defined by statute law.  Cycle lanes should be designed so that cars cannot drive in them or park in them.  Likewise they should be designed so as to minimise inconvenience for pedestrians.",
