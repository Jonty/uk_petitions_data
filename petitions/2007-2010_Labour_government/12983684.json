            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The Leamside line would provide access to the new town of Washington, Tyne and Wear, along with other towns and villages along its route. Reopening the line would not only provide a valuable commuter rail link, but also allow some freight traffic to be diverted from the hopelessly over congested ECML to the south of Newcastle, so it appears to meet the aims of the governments white paper on transport ie. increase capacity. If it is electrified, it would provide a diversion if the ECML is closed. \n\nThe trackbed is intact, some of the track is still in situ, so it would not be too expensive to reopen.",
