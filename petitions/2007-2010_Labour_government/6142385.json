            "background": "As we all know, teenage yobs are running the streets. Decent areas are being turned into no-go zones; people are afraid to leave their homes; crime isn't being reported for fear of repercussions.  We petition the British government to create a way of dealing with the parents or carers of these yobs, for example fining them heavily, with a gaol sentence being a possibility. Children learn from their parents: if the parents let them run wild and won't discipline them, the rest of us suffer!  No more, we've had enough. No-one protects US, the law seems to be aimed at protecting the yobs!!",
