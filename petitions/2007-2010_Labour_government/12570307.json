            "background": "Firstly, I find it deeply shocking how Labour go on about \"Education, Education, Education\" yet they brought in the tuition fees. How can someone aim higher, when tuition fees are extremely high? \nSecondly, how can one part of the UK get this for free, when the rest of us has to suffer? This screams out injustice to many English, Welsh and Northern Ireland students.\nAs you are traditional working class party I hope you can try and recognise the struggles of the working class to achieve above the boundaries when the cost is beyond their control?",
