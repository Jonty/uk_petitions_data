        "background": "With declining standards in TV/radio, channels are now airing explicitly sexual shows of a pornographic nature.  Virgin 1\u2019s \u2018Sexcetera\u2019/ Channel 4\u2019s \u2018Sex Education Show\u2019 are examples, whilst so-called comedy like \u2018Little Britain\u2019 & similar are filled with crude, smutty innuendo.  Media glorifies violence/immorality as \u2018cool\u2019 & to be aspired to, influencing young minds & doing nothing to discourage today\u2019s gang culture.  We don\u2019t want these shows even AFTER the watershed.  We\u2019re told if we don\u2019t like it, then switch off!   This allows standards to further degrade.  We demand a return to decency/morality by broadcasters.  The supposed defence that censorship is ALWAYS wrong, doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny.  Society censors behaviour all the time.  If not, why have laws, as all behaviour, even murder, would be OK!  The constant drip of immoral/indecent viewing/listening material, can & does lower society\u2019s standards too.  This is not a simplistic conclusion.  It\u2019s common sense!",
