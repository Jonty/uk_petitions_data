        "background": "Samantha Orabator is a convicted drug smuggler and has no worthwhile purpose in contributing to the UK other than to flood our streets with drugs at our childrens expense. She should be considered lucky that due to her own devious actions she has not been given the death penalty. But she should stay where she is as a detterent to others like her and UK taxpayers money should not be used to help bring her to the UK to be a further burden on us in the UK prison system.",
