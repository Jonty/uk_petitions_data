        "background": "A large % of the tax collected is used to collect the same. It would thus be much better to scrap all the multiple forms of direct and indirect taxes and replace the same with a single form of tax prferably that will have much lowers points of collection.\n\nVAT is a good place to collate all the taxes and the % can be increase to say 30% so that everyone (rich or poor) all have a same level of payment. This will also allow people to save more as if they do not spend, they can save more and hence the economy will also be kick started",
