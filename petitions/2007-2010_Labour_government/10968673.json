            "background": "We have a world class further and higher education system and it already helps business in many ways.  These connections should, however, be strengthened and deepened.\n \nEverything possible should be done to encourage cooperation between scientific and technical companies and relevant departments in universities.  \n \nAlmost all companies could benefit from better use of IT but too few businesses (particularly SMEs) know how IT could help them.  Universities and colleges of further education often have IT departments whose staff would be more than capable of carrying out an \u201cIT review\u201d for a company, seeing what changes would benefit them and helping them learn how to use any new equipment.\n \nThese research and IT contributions could be hugely valuable.  \n\nUniversities and further education colleges who make them should be rewarded when it comes to rankings and funding.",
