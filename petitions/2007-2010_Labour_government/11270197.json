            "background": "To allow bailiffs to use 'reasonable force' to obtain posessions is a ridiculous idea. The people they are visiting are already traumatised enough and do not need to have the potential to be assaulted added to their worries. The definition of 'reasonable force' is vague enough at the best of time and I have severe doubts that the majority of bailiffs understand the interpretations that exist of the term 'reasonable.'\n\nThe Police should be the only people entitiled to use such force in one's home - and that is only under certain circumstances.\n\nAs debt is crippling the nation, the last thing we need is for intimidation and threatening behaviour to be permitted.\n\nAs for suggestions that there will be a watchdog supervising the industry - the question that needs to be asked is - how effective are these bodies?",
