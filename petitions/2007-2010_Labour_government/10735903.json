I don't subscribe to satelite TV as a personal choice that i don't watch a lot of TV. \nBut i find that Satanta has exclusive rights not just to this gane, but to the Crotia game, and further matches in Ukraine, Kazhastan and Belarus. There is not even highlights. \nThe same probabaly exists with Wales, Scotland and N.Ireland matches.\nThere is not even highlights. This is a disgrace where people who alteady pay a TV licence cannot watch thier home nation on TV play in world cup qualifying games.",
