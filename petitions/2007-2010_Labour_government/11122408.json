            "background": "I recently went to see The Woman In Black as part of my GCSE drama course. I was so disturbed by the play that I had to get professional psychiatric help to let go of the trouble this play has caused me. The chances are, that any student studying drama will be pretty sensitive and are bound to be as affected as I was by this play. Please, if you are studying or have studied GCSE Drama and feel the same way I do, sign this petition.",
