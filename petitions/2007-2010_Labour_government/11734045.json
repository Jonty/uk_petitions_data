            "background": "Cannabis is used by many UK citizens recreationally and medicinally. Cannabis if also legalized will create many jobs for our country and also create a great amount of tax that this country can use to get out of the current economic crisis. There is no \"super skunk\" its just government propaganda to scare people away from using it, and it has been proven that you are more likely to get schizophrenia from drinking alchohol, and there are no deaths ever recorded from marijuana.",
