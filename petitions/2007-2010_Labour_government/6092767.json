        "action": "pass legislation requiring politicians of all parties to lead by example in the course of their work if they believe that the cause of global warming is rooted in human activity.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Politicians who preach the Global Warming message should be using public transport at every available  opportunity, abandon overseas trips wherever possible in favour of video conferencing, use electrically powered vehicles in preference to those driven by fossil fuels wherever possible and where not use vehicles with maximum engine size of 600cc powered by LPG. \nInvestigations should be carried out into making the Houses of Parliament carbon neutral including generation of power by wind and the Thames. (I personally do not subscribe to the theory that Global Warming is manmade; in my view it is part of a natural cycle. Having said that, if politicians expect the average man-in-the street to change his lifestyle they should actively set an example by reducing their consumption of energy and according to the current popular philosophy their impact on the world's climate).",
