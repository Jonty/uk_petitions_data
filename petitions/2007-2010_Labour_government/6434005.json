            "background": "In the present climate, where the young people show such disrespect and a lack of discipline, the fact that the armed forces are struggling to recruit, it makes sense to introduce national service.  Parents appear to have, or do'nt want control over their children and schools operate with one hand tied behind their back.  If you live in the inner cities, you are constantly under threat and the police are no derettant.  This country is going down the pan fast and unless steps are taken now its finished",
