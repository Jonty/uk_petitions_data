            "background": "Pulling together all of the diverse UK police services in seperate counties into 1 Uk wide police service would save tens of millions of pounds in budget, these saving would be based on 1 standard of uniform for all police officers  also standardise police vehilcles with community,patrol,traffic and specialist vehicles being sourced from one manufacturer leading to substantial savings on both the vehicles and parts accessibility. to keep some form of individualism within the services areas the force badge and in certain areas the custodian helmet design would remain. This petition is designed to save the taxpayer millions of pounds and to enable the UK police to function in a more effective manner providing the levels of services they should be to the public by keeping more vehicles on the ground and having more money to recruit police officers.",
