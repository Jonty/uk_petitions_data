        "background": "A request to the higher powers to investigate how the tragedy happened, if the person was known to welfare organisations how thorough was the investigation, on what grounds did they deem it acceptable to leave the equines in his care?\n\nthey did not starve overnight, many members of the public in the direct area claim to have reported the condition of these animals constantly to no avail, a true genuine thorough investigation and publication of the full facts in this case am sure would be appreciated by not only the horse community as a whole, but by the people of Amersham who are also suffering at this act, and also to possibly prevent such a tragedy from happening again.",
