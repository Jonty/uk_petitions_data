The thought of children travelling to school in the dark, whilst tired, with tired, vision impaired drivers on the roads is madness! I can remember the 70's experiment - Not Good. It wasn't taken up for a reason. Please ignore the ignorance of people who haven't thought it through, or who use spurious environmental issues as an excuse, or worse still - think we actually, physically lose daylight!",
