I decided to take two weeks paternity leave from work to try and bond with him and help my wife.\n\nI have just discovered that I will only be paid either 90% of my wages or \u00a3117 p/w. I usually earn \u00a3260 p/w before tax & NI. \n\nWith the cost of living increasing every day, how on earth can any man expect to be able to have time off work to spend with his child(ren)?\n\nThe Government and society in general constantly moan about the youth of today and how unruley they are, but what do you expect if they don't get a good upbringing by their parentS who have no alternative but to work because the government live on a different planet to the rest of the world?!\n\nIt's time the blame was passed to the right people and that is the Labour party for destroying what was once a great country to live in. \n\nRoll on the next election!",
