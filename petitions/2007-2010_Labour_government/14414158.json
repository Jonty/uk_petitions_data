        "background": "It is not law for businesses to recycle; they usually have to pay for the privilege! \nThe government wants to encourage recycling amongst its citizens and even wants 74.5% of glass to be recycled by the end of the year, but  tons of glass is thrown away in pubs and restaurants every day! \nI therefore put forward the motion of making it law for all businesses that serve food and drinks to recycle their empty bottles. This can also stimulate the economy by creating new businesses in the recylcing industry.",
