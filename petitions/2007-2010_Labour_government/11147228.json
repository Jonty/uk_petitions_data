        "background": "My main reason of starting this petition was to stop cruelty tocats as it is disgusting the amount of people that get awaywith it however I then found out that the new animal welfareact 2007 states: Anyone who is cruel to an animal may be bannedfrom owning animals, fined up to \u00a320,000 and/or sent to prison.Which in my option is about time, however I found this stilldoes not cover if you run over a cat. At the moment the lawstates that if you run over a dog you have to report it but ifyou run over a cat nobody cares. I feel in my option and imsure many people will agree with me that this is wrong. Dogsand cats are both beloved pets that should be treated the same.We should have to report these crimes. I do understand a lot ofthe time a cat may jump in front of your car and it is agenuine mistake but it still needs reporting as I stated beforecats are beloved family pets and there heartbroken families will be searching for them. I understand that there is a similar petition however I believe mine to be more reasonable and realistic.",
