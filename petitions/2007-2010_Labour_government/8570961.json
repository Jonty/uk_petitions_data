            "background": "In the run up to T5 BAA once again promised no third runway. Now they want just that, plus Terminal 6! BAA have lied & lied about their intentions for Heathrow.\nThe noise the airport produces is disgraceful and as outlined in the news today, it can even be dangerous for your health. \nIf this expansion goes ahead, more and more areas of greater London will become unbearable to live in. Is the government prepared to compensate the people who will lose value on their homes due to increased air traffic noise in their area?\nWho can honestly say that if every couple of minutes, whilst sitting in the comfort of your own home, you wouldn\u2019t mind if it felt as though a Jumbo Jet was landing on your roof. Not only is it noisy, the planes can be so close that you can wave to the people inside.\nThe government says that it is committed to tackling climate change, how can it be when they will allow further expansion at Heathrow? \nThis expansion goes against everything the government says it stands for. It is a disgrace and I for one will be protesting against this until the British people are listened to.",
