        "background": "With violent crime becoming a part of our everyday life now, isn't it about time the government passed tougher sentencing laws against these criminals.  This Country is becoming a laughing stock with its 'softly softly' approach to violent crime.  It's time the government/justice system thought more about the victim and the rest of society rather than being afraid of 'upsetting' the scum that committ these crimes.  What deterrent is there?",
