From our national team all the way down to our children and the lack of quality facilities.\n\nThe selection of successive national team managers has been farcical and it is blatantly apparent that the current incumbents are out of their depth.\n\nA new, more democratic regime is needed. Led by footballing people who have played and managed within the game.",
