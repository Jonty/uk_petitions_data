            "background": "Existing police background checks can only bring to light previously known sex offenders.\n\nApplicants for jobs working with children (and other vulnerable groups) should undergo a 4-tier test to include - Polygraph, Voice Stress Analysis, Sodium Pentathol and close Scrutiny by experts with the same level of Lie Detecting skill as Derren Brown -  Applicants that don't pass the tests with flying colours should then be rejected without compromise.\n\nThis would almost certainly deter ALL applications from people with unsavoury intentions who would otherwise pass existing police checks undetected.",
