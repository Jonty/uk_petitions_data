            "background": "It's unrealistic to expect the government to scrap stamp duty because of the loss of revenue, but we need to help first time buyers get on the property ladder. Virtually everybody who sells their house subsequently buys another (on which they would pay Stamp Duty), so why not change it so that the seller pays it on the house they're selling not the house they're buying. Nobody loses and first time buyers gain. It's not going to revolutionise the world, but it will make it a little better.",
