Therefore, this requirement, called hijab, is not fundamental to the needs of the Muslim community. \nThe burkha is a tool of oppression used to alienate and control women under the guise of religious freedom.\nIt is particularly wrong in Britain, where it is alien to the mainstream culture for someone to walk around wearing a mask.\nIt is impossible to distinguish between the woman who is choosing to wear a burkha and the girl who has been forced to cover herself and live behind a veil.\nWe, the undersigned, believe it should be banned.",
