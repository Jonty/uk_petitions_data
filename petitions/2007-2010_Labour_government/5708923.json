        "background": "Other available stop smoking methods target the addiction to nicotine as opposed to smoking itself and work amazingly well. These methods can, will and do save and prolong lives, but are not recognised as effective forms of treatment by the NHS or Government. These alternative methods cost as little as the price of a DVD as opposed to many hundreds (and even thousands) of pounds per patient using current NHS methods.",
