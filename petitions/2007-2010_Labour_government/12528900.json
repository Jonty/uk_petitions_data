            "background": "Higher education standards are falling in this country. The majority of school leavers now attend a university after completing their A-levels. \n\nThis would seem favourable but a large proportion attend so called 'new universities' which are, in essence, former polytechnics. They have low entry requirements, low standards and emphasise contemporary subjects such as media studies.\n\nEvery year graduates from top russell group universities much compete against the droves of students from these universities for jobs and postgraduate study. \n\nThis would be acceptable if standards were uniform but many new universities have been found to be inflating the value of a degree by reducing the criteria required for a 1st or 2.1 classification.\n\nA group consisting of our top universities akin to the ivy league of the USA should be instated to ensure those best qualified can be fast tracked into jobs where their skills are required.",
