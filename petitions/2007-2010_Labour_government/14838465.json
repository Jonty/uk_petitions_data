        "background": "In order to ameliorate the worst biological effects of those waiting in regular rush-hour 17 mile traffic jams to pay the Dartford Crossing toll it is requested that the following exceptions are allowed to current motorway regulations.\nBeggars to be allowed to crawl between stationary vehicles as in Delhi, but rather than offering windscreen washes to offer the use of bedpans to driver and passengers, This will have the added advantage of saving NHS the cost of repairing ruptured bladders, and give the beggars useful work to do.\nGreasy Spoon Canteens such as \"Smiffy's Munch\" and \"Out to Lunch\" to be allowed to set up in the emergency lane to restore the blood-sugar levels of those dizzy from hunger. \nChiropractors and osteopaths to be allowed to practice in the central reservation to reduce muscle spasm induced by sitting in the same position for several hours.\nAnd just think - you could tax all this!",
