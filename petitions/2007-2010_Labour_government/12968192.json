            "background": "I would like the Prime Minister to look at the HNC Millinery courses. For one day a week for A  35wk  slot, the course is over \u00a34000 pounds, for one year. \nThe course is a two year course I have a degree, so  I have to pay the full cost which is over \u00a38000 pounds.\nHow can the Prime Minister put this sort of cost on a mature lady, that wants to enhance her skills, for the small business she has just started. \nI have a degree in Clothing/Fashion taken in the year 2000. For the past two years I have been given a place on a HNC Millinery course, but of course could not afford to pay the outrageous cost for a very limited course, with limited hours. \nSurely being a past tutor myself no one can give that amount of teaching for the cost I would have to pay.\nWill the Prime Minister sponsor me or any member of Parliament,or better still make the cost affordable for everyone.  I know this particular HNC Millinery course is valuable to progress my business.\nPlease sign my pettition as I am still fighting to be able to get some help with the cost.\n  \nI have tried for the past two years trying to get help, and I have tried my local Member of Parliament and not found a solution.",
