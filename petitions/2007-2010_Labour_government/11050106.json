BT was amongst the first to introduce punitive payment charges (currently \u00a34.50 every three months!) for customers settling their bills in cash. The undersigned wish to bring the following points to the Governments attention:\n\u2022\tCustomers lacking bank accounts are being penalized \u00a318/year for paying in cash\n\u2022\tLongstanding customers (i.e. clients predating this development) did not sign up for such discriminatory treatment\n\u2022\tUtility Payment Charges target British citizens least able to afford such discrimination\n\u2022\tPost Offices lose turnover  as new customers sign up to e.g. Direct Debit\n\u2022\tSuch charges are deemed illegal elsewhere in the EU (e.g. Eire).\nPrime Minister, MPs, MEPs, MSPs, Whitehall mandarins, Political Correspondents, OFCOM, Journalists, Editors, Speech writers etc, please look at your most recent utility bills and ask yourself if you are happy for your voters (or readers) to continue to shoulder such discrimination?",
