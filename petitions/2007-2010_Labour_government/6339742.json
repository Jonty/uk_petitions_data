            "action": "award full and non-staged pay increases to all our public sector employees (including all those who work in the NHS, in prisons, in our schools, in the emergency services and all other civil servants whether in central or local government) and financing these pay increases by withholding the UK's 2008 and 2008 national contributions to the EU of some \u00a39 billion per year.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "All would agree that ideally the proposed pay increases in the public sector should not be staged.  In fact these proposed pay \"increases\" are purely nominal increases, when account is taken of price inflation and income tax.  If the Government does not provide proper increases in pay (which are not to be staged) many employees in the public sector will face a continuing cut in their real living standards.\nThis petition specifically requests that the government fund the necessary and fully deserved increases in pay for the public sector by funding these from the UK's national contributions to the EU, where it is common knowledge that much of this money would be wasted by the EU in uneconomic CAP subsidies or by fraud under the EU's poor governance.",
