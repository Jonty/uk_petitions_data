            "background": "Sexual education in the UK is of an appallingly low standard, as the statistics show. We the undersigned propose that sexual education should deal with firstly the notion of romance and love, secondly of sexual relations and intercourse, including discussion on safe sex, STI's, pregnancy, and building a family, and later with issues of gender identity. The entire process should begin at the age of 9 or 10 years, and at all points where love or sex are discussed, they should be taught in the context of homosexual relationships as well as heterosexual ones. Lessons should occur bi-annually to provide a chance for follow-up, and they should become interactive discussions as the individuals mature. This would enable children to fully understand the concept-map of love, sex and relationships in the modern context. It would help to reduce the appaling teen pregnancy rate, STI virulence and homophobic bullying, and, if handled sensitively, trans- bullying also.",
