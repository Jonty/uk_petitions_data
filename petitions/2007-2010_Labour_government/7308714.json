            "background": "The Japaneses whaling fleet intends to slaughter upto 1000 whales (including  endangered Humpback whales) in defiance of international treaties banning such activities. There is no scientific basis for the destructive sampling of marine mammals and given the current rate of global biodiversity loss, is in contempt of current ecological thinking. Research has shown that whaling is not sustainable and the British government should stand by its current policies on biodiversity and afford protection to these mammals.",
