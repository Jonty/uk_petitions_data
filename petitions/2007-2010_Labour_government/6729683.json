            "background": "Since inception the ISA allowance has remained unchanged. This petition doesn't ask for an increase in the overall tax free allowance, simply increased flexibility for those that wish to save for the future without the risks associated with stock market investments, and therefore reduce the pressure on the public purse in the years to come. These people should be rewarded with an increased allowance for tax free cash savings. This is a minor request that will benefit hard working britain, not just the rich, and help keep the banking sector stable in future, to the benefit of all, by increasing the amount of cash saved.",
