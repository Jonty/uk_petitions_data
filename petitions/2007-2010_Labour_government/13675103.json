        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Christians are appalled to learn how the law can be used to suppress freedom of expression and worship in the UK. Of necessity, worship involves amplification especially if there is a large congregation. Amplified worship is not unique to the UK Christian and it is practised all over the world by all faiths.\n\nOn any week night in any city it\u2019s not unusual to walk past pubs playing amplified music. Not to mention stadiums with thousands of fans loftily cheering on their favourite player or groaning loudly at the narrowly missed goals. \n\n The recent spate of noise abatement orders issued against several churches by some councils goes against internationally recognised rights to freedom of worship. This would mean that UK Christians can not express their natural joy in congregational worship as other members of our country can.\nAre we now expected to sing our congregational hymns in whispers and hushed tones? Perhaps not even worship.\n\nWe are asking the Prime Minister to review the rules in order to allow practitioners of all faiths to worship freely without threat or harassments from local councils.\n \nIf you agree please sign this petition to show your support.",
