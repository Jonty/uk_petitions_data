            "background": "We think the government should include all types of ageism within the 'ageism in the workplace' law due to discrimination of under 50's not being allowed to purchase low cost housing. We believe this would benefit many young people who would not normally be able to afford their first home.\nIt is agest to suggest that because you are under a certain age then you will be loud and always partying. We think that estate agents and participating landlords/sellers are agest about selling property to older people and not everyone.",
