            "background": "There is a market for veal in the U.K. this was confirmed today in 'Farming Today' on Radio 4.  'Bobby' calves, i.e. dairy bull calves are going to be shot at birth owing to the present Foot and Mouth restrictions. Owing to current restrictions imposed, movement in certain areas is impossible and farmers wishing to sell these calves within the U.K are unable to do so. Calves  reared for veal in this country ARE NOT HOUSED IN CRATES, they have access to space, natural light and a natural diet.  Following the lifting of restrictions, surely is better for these calves to be HUMANELY reared here than to be shipped abroad and then sent back as carcases to satisfy demand.",
