        "background": "I propose that a block of apartments are built for M.P's to live in, as close to westminster as is practicable.\nthis would replace the need for a second home allowance.\nThey can be built to high standards.\nEach out of London constituancy has an apartment which is the residence of the elected M'P.\nThe apartments belong to the tax payer and maintenance will be paid by the state thus negating the majority of expenses currently being claimed.\nFurnishings can be of a high standard.\nAlso security must be exceptional and will be easier to provide at an econmical cost.",
