Assurances such as that Iraq was a known harbourer of Al Qaeda and that it had weapons of mass destruction turned out to be not at all accurate. We are now faced with the situation of a country still in tatters and our forces fighting a war for totally different reasons for why we invaded. The British public deserve to know why.",
