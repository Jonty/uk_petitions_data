            "background": "Operation Pentameter II has the laudable intention to target the sex slave industry. This will result in the release of many vulnerable people who will immediately be threatened with deportation to their country of origin and the clear threat of being taken back into the sex industry however fearful and reluctant they might be. The numbers are small in comparison to the huge level of immigration, these people need our protection far more than so many that claim asylum.",
