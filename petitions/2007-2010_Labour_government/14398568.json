            "background": "In the UK, it is considered unethical or immoral for a doctor to falsify medical records, but is not illegal. (This is not the case in USA, or most of Europe).  Falsification is therefore routine. It may take the form of alteration, substitution, addition, removal, selective editing of material, lying, miscommunication. The repertoire is creative and endless. It can, and does, lead directly or indirectly to the death of patients (murder), injury and incapacitation, blackmail, false sectioning under the mental health act  e.g \" delusional belief being abused by medical system\", or precipitation of genuine mental illness (breakdown).  \n Complaints are futile as they lead to more of the same behaviour by all interested parties, and litigation is expensive and pointless. \nProviding evidence (proof) of  deliberate falsification, particularly with harmful consequences, should lead to immediate suspension pending legal action, at present it is simply ignored.",
