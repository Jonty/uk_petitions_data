            "background": "My son received an .I.P.P sentence in March 2006 for 30 mths, he is over his tariff, his next parole review he will have served over 50 mths. He has completed various offending behaviour courses but probation is preventing his progression into the community & severed contact with his children.\nSocial services are satisfied with proposed child contact visits, however probation & MAPPA still refuse visits to resume.\nIt is a real disgrace to think this is happening to people in the prison system. I do not feel it is warranted that my son is serving well in excess of his tariff, doing everything possible to help himself without any prospects of release, adding the fact that he has been purposefully denied any contact with his children without good grounds. \nThis I.P.P. law is such a severe punishment & goes against all human rights to keep prisoners in the prison system indefinitely. They do more to hinder a person\u2019s progression & integration back into society rather than encourage it.",
