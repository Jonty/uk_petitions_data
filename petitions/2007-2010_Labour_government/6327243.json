Unfortunately I did watch the attached clip to my horror! I enquired to the originator of the petition whether it will be sent to the Japanese Prime Minister as so many people have signed the petition yet nothing seems to have been done with it!  I have not received a response and fear that the names listed and their efforts have gone to waste! Please can you help me ensure that everyone\u2019s efforts to fill in this petition have not been wasted.  We must stop this awful slaughter of dolphins! Please sign this Govenment petition which will be acknowledged after 200 signatures! Many thanks!",
