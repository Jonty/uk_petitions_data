            "background": "Ever get the feeling that constant media hype makes a bad situation worse?\n\nThey are in the business of selling papers or raising viewing figures and not reporting news responsible. \n\nFor example. The recent run on the bank Northern Rock. Financially they had made a sensible decision to ask for help from the Bank of England. Without the media hype would thousand have rushed to take their money out? Oddly Northern Rock is the safest place to put your money as it\u2019s backed by the Bank of England.\n\nSecond example. The recent tanker drivers strike. Constant publicity, leading to panic buying. There were plenty of other firms that were still delivering and supplying petrol.\n\nThe popular \u2018media\u2019 includes the press, radio and TV. How can we get them to become more responsible and raise their journalistic standards?",
