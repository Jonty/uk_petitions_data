            "background": "Basically you can get a card for a set amount of drinks (maximum of 10 for example) issued from a Council Office, with this card it then allows you to get drinks from pubs, clubs and restaurants in a designated town. This will then stop underage drinking and binge drinking.\n\nThe cards will be personalised with faces of the owners on them, and can only be topped up with ID at the offices.\n\nAt each location that serves alcohol, they will have a card-reader, once the consumer hits 10 drinks they are then advised to go home.  If there is any disturbance, then the people involved will lose drink points (like a penalty point) so that the maximum might only be 8 drinks instead of the 10 which will stop violence in the streets.\n\nFinally this will help the government monitor drinking trends, help the businesses (as they can put a set standard of price, because the businesses can then redeem the amount of drink swipes and recover the revenue from the council drink pot that has been filled when the consumers top their cards up) and overall help create a good nights atmosphere in all our towns and cities.",
