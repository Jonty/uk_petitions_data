            "background": "On 24th March 2010 stamp duty for first time buyers on houses under 250k was abolished for two years. However there are thousands of first time buyers who just missed out on the previous stamp duty holiday which ended 1st January 2010, because their purchase didn\u2019t complete in time. As a result these buyers were forced to find the extra money. It would be a much needed and welcomed boost to these buyers if the government backdated the new stamp duty changes to the 1st January 2010. It is wholly unfair to any first time buyer who purchased a house in these three months to not backdate these changes.",
