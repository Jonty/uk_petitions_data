At present, only after a certain amount of miles the Job Centre Plus may reimburse your fares or petrol. This is not right. If an employer wants to find a good employee, they must be ready to shorten their shortlist of potential candidates and pay their travelling expenses. It is all the needy yet again who has to pay and 9 times out of 10 have no job at the end of many interviews. This must be revised and travelling expenses paid by the would be employer.",
