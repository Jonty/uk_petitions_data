            "background": "Rather that the goverment buying unsold houses, I petition the  government to suspend SDLT for house sales under \u00a31.0m for a period that will cease when the Bank of England confirms the credit crunch is over and the credit markets have returned to normal\n\nIn addition I also petition the government to introduce immediately Mortgage Interest Tax Relief on residential mortgages for the period of the credit crunch to allow families to get through these difficult times.\n\nThe SDLT suspension will get house sales started again and the Mortgage Interest Tax Relief will make the expensive mortgages cheaper by about 25% - 40%.\n\nThe introduction of both these measure will kick start the housing market, encourage renters to buy, and create a climate of confidence and prevent the property crash which is coming our way and which the government has done little to prevent",
