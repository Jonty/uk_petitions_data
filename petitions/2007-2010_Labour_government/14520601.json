            "background": "Britain is ranked 27th in the world for its state pension with 2.8m older people living in poverty. If retirement were to be a positive choice by the individual taking into account one's job satisfaction, health, pension and personal circumstance and every one was guarateed an income in retirement above the official European poverty line linked to retirement and not age there would be no need to raise the age of eligibility to the state pension. The prevalence of depression is twice as high amongst unemployed people as it is those in employment.Redundancy, and enforced retirement is precisely that, has a more lasting harmful effect that any other of life's experiences. Therefore to abolish the mandatory retirement age would enhance the quality of life of many and prove cost effective - there are adequate means to deal with incapacity and incompetence. There is a correlation between income and demand upon the NHS, in all age groups, and therefore an adequate pension would further reduce demand upon the NHS and produce further compensatory savings.",
