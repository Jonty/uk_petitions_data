            "background": "Halifax central library was opened as recently a 1983 and contains a state of the art archive facility. Despite the library and archive being accessible to all and via public transport links the council plans to relocate the facility. This will be a great expense to council tax payers (est. \u00a310m), will reduce the public transport links to the facility and will not provide a facility of equivalent functionality. The proposal is to replace the library with retail units despite Halifax containing empty units. This is not a good use of tax payer\u2019s money and the council does not appear to be responding to their constituent\u2019s objections. For this reason we wish the office of the prime minister to intervene",
