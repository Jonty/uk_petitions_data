            "background": "BRITAIN'S favourite free tourist attraction is to break with a century of tradition by introducing a charge for admission. \n\nFrom 2009,punters will have to pay a minimum five pounds charge to enter Blackpool Pleasure Beach or buy a ride wristband. \n\nOnly under-threes will get in free. \n\nThe park refused to comment but said it was telling customers about the change this year so that they had time to get used to it. \n\nSO WHAT DO WE WANT TO GET FROM THIS... \n\nPleasure Beach Blackpool has been free to get into for well over 100yrs & we think it should stay FREE. \nWe hope to try to over turn this charge. \n\nPlease join our group then your vote counts......",
