            "background": "Three homes in every town are needed to fulfil what we believe is an essential part of our growth and knowledge in combatting child abuse. We need every council in the UK to facilitate properties that can be used by our teams for this purpose. It is an option that should eradicate child incest/abuse as each child will be admitted to us immediately, or admit themselves, until investigations are complete. If nothing untoward is found, the children can go home upon conclusion.\nIt makes sense in 2010 to update our inadequate systems to concentrate on the rapid rise in child abuse. To that end, I give you my petition for Safe Homes For Abused Children UK/Global",
