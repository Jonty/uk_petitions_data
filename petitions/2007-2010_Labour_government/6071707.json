            "background": "Leeds is in lack of facilities that allow our citizens to enjoy themselves. We have a cinema, we have youth clubs but a large attraction that comes every year in the winter is the portable ice rink. I think a permanent ice rink in the city centre would offer far more recreational activities for people in leeds. It would also allow ice hockey clubs to be formed so that kids in leeds have more to do. \n\nAlso if leeds had an ice rink it might be able to put a team forward for the EHL (Elite Hockey League.) This would prove to be an exellent attraction for Leeds aswell as giving people something to support. \n\nIce hockey is massive in the US and many people would agree that increasing its size in the Uk might benefit our sporting communities largely.",
