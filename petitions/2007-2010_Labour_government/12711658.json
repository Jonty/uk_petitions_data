            "background": "VAT does not belong on fuel bills for heating, lighting and such. These are basic fundamental rights. VAT is value added tax and was intended to be levied on value items, non-food, cigarettes, alcohol and other such \"luxury\" items. What's more, with greedy fuel companies charging such high rates, especially in the case of pre-paid meters.\n\nVAT needs to be removed from fuel bills.  Even at the lower 5% rate, it's adding to the bills of those who cannot afford it and, in fairness to the public, even those of upper income brackets are being heavily taxed and should not be made to pay this additional tax. We want VAT removed from fuel bills before the next general election with a governmental promise that it will never again be added to such basic, fundamental human needs.",
