        "background": "As a business man, having run my own business for 20 years.  I know for certain if v.a.t was none existant the cost of living, would be reduced dramactically.  This would then kick start the economy as average working class people would have more money in their pockets. Thus making the public  more confident to borrow and spend. In my opinion if this is not done immediatley  the country will be in the biggest recession since the 1920's. please abolish v.a.t for up to 1 year and then bring it back in at around 5% to be increased up to around 10% in late 2010",
