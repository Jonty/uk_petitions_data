            "background": "Many keepers of classic and historic vehicles do not hold V5 documents or current sorn certificates for some of their vehicles or parts, such as motorcycle frames, which require documentation. I propose an amnesty for a period of 3 months during which time keepers of unregistered vehicles can provide details to the DVLA to obtain the necessary documentation without fear of fines or penalties for previously failing to declare a vehicle sorn or obtain a V5 document. This will allow the DVLA to update records on many of the estimated 1.2 million unregistered vehicles for which no records currently exist.",
