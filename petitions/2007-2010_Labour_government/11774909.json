        "background": "I spent money on cavity wall insulation, loft insulation and draughtproofing, yet still pay a fortune (to a French company) for energy every year.  I also try to save energy, wherever possible, even where this is to my discomfort, as I sit here, with cold feet, in my unheated study.\nYet, as I walk down the \"High Street\", go to a DIY store or to a supermarket, I see that these shops have their doors wide open and those silly electrical \"curtain\" heaters blowing \"my\" saved energy out to the street and the entire World.  Surely it is time that industry and commerce were forced to \"shut the door\" on wasted energy.  Maybe then they could save a few jobs, too.",
