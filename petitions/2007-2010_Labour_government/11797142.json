        "background": "We request that using British Government diplomatic routes, including sanctions & UN pressure do stop the oppression of Iranian Baha'is. \n\nThis as stated in US Congress, is state-sponsored. Secret documents from the Iranian government have been found; these documents say that \"their [Baha'i] progress and development shall be blocked\" and \"employment shall be refused to persons identifying themselves as Baha'is\".\n\nFurther, since the Iranian government deems Baha'is as \"apostates,\" Baha'is can legally be killed for their beliefs.\n\nIf you find these crimes against humanity committed by Iran distressing, and would like to voice your concern please sign the petition.\n\n7 Leaders of the Bahai are due to be executed and are in need of urgent support.  International condemnation would be particularly helpful.  However the situation is something that will take much longer to eradicate.",
