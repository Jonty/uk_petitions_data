            "background": "The re-doubling of the line between Moreton and Dorchester South would bring benefits to the towns of Dorchester and Weymouth, and also allowing less impact to delays of 'up' trains during disruption. As Weymouth is the designated town for the Olympics 2012 sailing, it will provide additional capacity for trains to operate between London and Weymouth, as currently there are only paths for 1 additional train per hour (not mentioning electrical supply) between Mondays and Saturdays. The line was singled by BR in the 1980s with the extension of electrification to Weymouth.",
