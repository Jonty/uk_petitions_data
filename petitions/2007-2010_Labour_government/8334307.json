        "background": "If some of our prisons were operated under British standards and control in African countries there could be considerable savings and benefits. The price of housing 30,000 prisoners in the UK, would pay for 100,000 in an African country -- even allowing for the cost of flights. Also, British prisons in African would provide good jobs for Africans and their wages would kickstart local economies and may reduce the desperate migration of impoverished Africans to European countries.",
