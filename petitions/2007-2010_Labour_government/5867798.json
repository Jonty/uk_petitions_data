            "background": "The tax credit system has evidently suffered some fraud and much error in its application. However HM Government officers appear less willing to admit to their errors than they should be and as a result families are put into hardship by faulty repayment adjudications. An independent organisation with no interest in reclaiming of money or admission of error should be set up to process appeals.",
