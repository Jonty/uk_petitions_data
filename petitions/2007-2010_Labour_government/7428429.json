The Sudanese should apologise to Ms. Gibbons for the tactless and sensless attack on a well meaning person. Advice and guidance in the strange ways of Muslims would have done more good than a hammer. The British government should make it quite clear to the Sudan that the British people will not tolerate our tax money being wasted on such thoughtless people as themselves.",
