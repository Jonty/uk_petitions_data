            "background": "For some years now the duty on diesel fuel has been higher than petrol.  This is the opposite to most other countries and actively discourages the use of diesel cars in the UK.  A higher use of diesel cars would be a positive step to reducing CO2 emissions.  In addition transport costs would be reduced and hopefully reduce (or at least keep down) the cost of goods in the shops.",
