        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Please give a one off yearly charge for sufferers who regularly require prescription medicines and allow a predetermined cost to be spread over twelve months. The PPC (Pre Paid Prescription) does not cater for most individuals!\n\nAs an Arthritis sufferer, I have to take a couple of different types of drugs. These are often changed to ensure that I can find the drugs which work best for me. Anybody with a long term condition who requires regular intake of drugs to enable them to keep some kind of equality of life should be able to do this in financial confidence without having to worry about additional costs. Being ill should not be costly! \n\nThe PPC is not good enough to cover this as this is not guaranteed to reduce the amount paid but could increase the cost.",
