            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In the wake of the Icelandic banking crisis the Prime Minister proclaimed that he sought to protect the interests of UK depositors except those in Landsbanki Guernsey (LG). LG was placed into administration on 6th October & the administrator stated that the main reason for the Bank\u2019s difficulties was the placing of funds with Heritable Bank. Ironically. Heritable Bank assets were subject to a freezing order from Her Majesty's Government & I feel that the Prime Minsiter should release these funds (36.3 million pounds) back to LG for distribution amongst depositors. \nAlso as per the Crown Dependency constitution, the UK Government has a duty to represent Guernsey in international affairs & as a result I would ask the Prime Minister to defend the Landsbanki depositors' interests by negotiating with Icelandic Government for the repatriation of c. 12.8 million pounds sterling owed to LG by parent bank, Landsbanki hf.  \nThese UK citizens all paid tax whilst they were working in the UK & are typically expatriates who are not allowed to hold accounts in the UK.  The Channel Island depositors pay tax on their interest income, a percentage of which is remitted to the UK Treasury.",
