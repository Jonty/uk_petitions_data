            "background": "Milton Keynes is now the largest town in the United Kingdom without city status and is still growing by 4,500 people per year.   40 years old in 2007, it is the home of the Open University, the country's newest football stadium, the largest under cover shopping centre in Europe, and Britain's first city centre ecumenical church.  In Milton Keynes we feel really proud of our city - its design, vibrancy, sustainability and diversity.  We ask for national recognition of our success and of our potential through the award of city status.",
