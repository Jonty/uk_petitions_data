            "background": "In these troubled times of financial moderation and cut-backs, forcing the British public to pay for a service which provides no longer an unbiased, objective, informative view of current and past events.  \n\nIn recent weeks, even senior members of staff at the BBC have voiced concern over its direction, focus and underpinning strategy (http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/bbcs-future-bleak-says-john-simpson-960593.html).\n\nI believe the BBC as a publicly-supported institution has had its day - it quashes a competitive market for information services in the UK.  Making it a criminal offence not paying the Licence Fee effectively denies British citizens their right to choose who is the main provider of consumer information in Britain.",
