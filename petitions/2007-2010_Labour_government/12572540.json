        "background": "These campaigners have done the country great service by exposing the greed, hypocrisy and double standards of many sitting MPs. These MPs, who are supposedly servants of the public and are required by the MPs' allowances system to be \"beyond reproach\", have used the former secrecy to abuse the generosity of the public purse. Only by the dogged determination of the FOI campaigners has the cold light of day been shone on these abuses, for which the phrase \"snouts in the trough\" is too kind.",
