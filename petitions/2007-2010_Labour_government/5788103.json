        "background": "Beverley Hughes: Minister for Children and Youth Justice\nAs the law stands it is perfectly legal for children of any age, including babies, to have their ears pierced with the consent of their parents. For the following reasons I believe an age restriction should be imposed for babies and children under the age of ten.\nI believe children under ten have not developed sufficiently, emotionally or physically, to make the important decision as to whether to have their ears pierced. In particular, babies and toddlers can have no desire to have this done - this invasive procedure is carried out purely for the parents gratification. The child gains no benefit from having it done at such an early age, only an unexplained pain and the possibility of subsequent infection and complications, which according to medical opinion, are particularly common in infants and toddlers.\n\nWe the undersigned believe that ear piercing under the age of ten is wrong, should be made illegal, with an age restriction imposed.",
