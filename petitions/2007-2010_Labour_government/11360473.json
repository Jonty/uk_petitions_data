            "background": "Man made climate change is a theory rejected by over 30,000 respected scientists and the majority of the public worldwide.  Yet our government continues to pander to misguided green groups by investing millions of pounds in unpopular green schemes such as eco-towns, taxes on holiday flights, banning traditional lightbulbs and building eyesore wind turbines.  The government should be investing this money into building new nuclear and coal power stations immediately - we face a catastrophic energy crisis if nothing is done.  \nThe majority of the British public are tired of being lectured on MMCC.  , when overpopulation, energy shortages and global cooling are the real threats.",
