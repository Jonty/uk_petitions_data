        "background": "Ensure that the London Stock Exchange measures corporate profitability against long term stability and therefore discourages short to medium term gains to fuel personal incentive bonus plans of senior executives which destroys the fabric of UK listed corporations.  Legislation needs to be in place to avoid the wreckless destruction of corporations by increasing profit at any cost to employees or the infrastructure of the business or market by corporate executives in their self interest for personal gain instead of the long term stability of their corporations.",
