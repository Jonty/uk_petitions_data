Surely if the rest of us can live on this wage the MP's do not require \u00a364766? Or if they do they can pay their own travel expenses to and from work and their own housing costs like the rest of us. \u00a364766/year is more than enough to rent a small one bed flat or book a room in a budget hotel for the nights when they are required in Westminster. Or they can all just move to London fulltime (because they so rarely bother to come to their constituencies) and rent a small place in their constituencies for when they need to canvas/remind us we actually have an MP, at their own expense.",
