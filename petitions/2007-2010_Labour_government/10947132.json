            "background": "Today I have just recieved a bill from the tax man of \u00a3375 for being late by 2 days for paying my VAT return, I find this amazing that in these tough times the tax office behaves in such a way, I get paid nothing for collecting VAT and because I am 2 days late they slap me with this. Dear Mr Brown you are making a terrible situation even worse for small busines people like me. the jobs I do for other companies are paying there bills to me later and later because of the economic down turn. I can't understand why banks can not get away with large late payment charges but goverment can, I refuse to pay this extra charge and if it closes my business then thats another 18 people on benifit, maybe you don't care about this given the number of people claiming. is any one else in my position? kind regards Phil",
