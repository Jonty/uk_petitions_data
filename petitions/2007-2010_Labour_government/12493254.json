            "background": "The other day I had to attend an out-patient clinic at my local hospital.  The appointment time was 10.30 but I was not seen until 11.45; in addition the waiting-room was so crowded that I was lucky to get a seat which I lost when I left it to use the loo.  \n\nThis situation causes stress to patients, especially in clinics where the condition is one which causes anxiety (my appointment was for the breast clinic, having felt something in one of my breasts, and this COULD HAVE been an indication of CANCER), and it must have the same effect on staff by making them feel pressurised and probably subject to verbal abuse from patients getting fed up (and IMpatient!) with these very long waits.",
