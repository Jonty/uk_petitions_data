            "background": "On Britain's roads there are hundreds of yellow boxes: some on 20' poles and some on the roadside. If a driver slips a few miles an hour over the limit he receives an instant \u00a360 fine. This must happen hundreds of times daily, bringing in vast quantities of revenue.\nHowever, I suggest to you that speed is not the cause of accidents, fatal or otherwise in the United Kingdom. I suggest that accidents are caused by bad and dangerous driving, and that speed CAN be a factor, but is not the be all and end all. \nI am therefore asking the PM to remove the emphasis from speed and place more visible Police cars on the road and force the Police to deal with drivers who drive badly or dangerously in all cases, including those where speed MAY have been used inappropriately.",
