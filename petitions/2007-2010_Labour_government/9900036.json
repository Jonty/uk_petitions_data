            "background": "Britain led the world in developing the aircraft carrier during WW I. Since then the aircraft carrier has become the dominant type of naval vessel, crucial to almost all forms of naval operation, offensive or defensive. \n\nOver the last century the Aircraft Carrier has been vital to the defence of Britain, and the Commonwealth. The Battle of the Atlantic would have almost certainly been lost without naval aviation, and with that loss, the UK would have been starved out of the war. The Falklands war would have been impossible. Taranto knocked the Italian battle fleet out of WW II and was the model for Pearl Harbour. Norway, Suez, Korea, The Pacific, the Adriatic, the Carrier is a key component of so many British military operations. \n\nDespite recent statements about buying 2 new carriers, it is entirely possible the 3 Invincible class carriers will be the last British carriers. Even if not, a preserved Carrier in British waters is long overdue.\n\nWhether under the auspices of the MOD, RN, or IWM, the Prime Minister could, and should, sponsor the preservation of one of the three Invincibles to be set up as a permanent museum of Naval Aviation.",
