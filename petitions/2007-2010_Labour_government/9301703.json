            "background": "why should reckless borrowers be bailed out while prudent savers are penalised? This is a straightforward political attempt to bail out the UK mortgage market at the tax payers expense. The sooner over-valued house prices drop to affordable levels for the majority only then will we see economic stability. Using tax payers money to try and further inflate the housing market  for political motives is immoral and highly irresponsible.",
