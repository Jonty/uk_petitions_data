            "background": "The UK government is quite happy to give grants to failed asylum seekers to let them go back to their home country and start up a business.  However, no such default grant system exists for small companies across all of the UK, particularly if your business is based in the south.\n\nThe government has increased the tax burden for most small companies during the last 5 years and they don't appear to be doing anything to promote new business in the UK.\n\nI consider this a breach of our human rights that these grants are made available for non-uk asylum seekers by default but not for UK companies.",
