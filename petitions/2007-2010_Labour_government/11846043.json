            "background": "I am a Uk resident, I have a 11 year old son that lives in the USA with his mother.  On most occasions i can not even get a visa to visit him. I have a good relationship with him considering my battles over the last 11 years. I have been stopped entering the USA to visit him as the US goverment seem to think i will stop and not return to the UK.\n  I have been there on many occasions over the last few years always returned and never over stopped my visa times. \n I am tired of the constant battle just to be a good father and would just like to visit my son with ease. His mother has no issues with me visiting at any time. \n I cannot believe how hard that make it on there so called allies. I understand they have a duty to protect there borders but as a father there must be some humanitarian rights for me to see my child.",
