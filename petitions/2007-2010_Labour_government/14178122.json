        "background": "Residents living in close proximity to the proposed Tranquility funeral parlour in Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire, along with other persons having legitimate objections to the application, made their views known to a planning committee of the North Lincolnshire Council. It is their opinion that the process culminating in approval being given to the application was fundamentally flawed, and that the decision to approve the application should therefore be overturned. In summary, it is the process by which the approval was given that they challenge, not the decision per se.",
