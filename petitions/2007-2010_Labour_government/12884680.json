            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We do not recieve the privilages of being an adult, so why should we recieve this burden? The outrage is escalated by the fact that most 16 year olds are in education still,  and therefore cannot get a job the same as an adult to pay for this fare! For those of us that do work, the minimum wage is \u00a31.24 lower an hour than an 18 year old. If we are not afforded the privilage of the same wage, why should we pay the same? The transport companies making us pay full price is theft and dishonesty. When the Prime Minister is made aware of this problem, as man who is renound for integrity he will surely see the injustice and try to get a law passed, so please sign. Oh, and i know there is a similar petition but it is only for London. Thank you.",
