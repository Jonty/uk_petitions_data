            "background": "I believe Sharon Shoesmith should be sacked, simply as she cannot see that her department has failed in the very essence of what they are supposed to do, which is protect young and vulnerable people. Even now, she denies that her department has done anything wrong, which is clearly not the case, and from her attitude, deserves never to have the authority over such a department to look after vulnerable people again.\n\nTHIS IS NOT THE SAME AS THE SAFE4KIDS PETITION!",
