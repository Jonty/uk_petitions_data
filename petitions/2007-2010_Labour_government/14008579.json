            "background": "Re - EU review of Common Fisheries Policy 2009-2012.\n\nIn light of marine species, such as Flapper skates and dolphins, being threatened by commercial fishing, I feel an examination of fishing practices is required by the UK independently of the EU review.  \n\nThis may involve - trawlers having provisions onboard to keep the catch alive until it has been inspected and the separate species identified (pilot scheme with cameras onboard trawlers), changing the guage of the holes in nets to allow smaller fish to escape, foreign trawlers entering UK waters, and so forth.  It would also need to remind trawler staff that the coastal waters belong to the UK Monarch and the territorial waters belong to the UK government.  (Complicated by the EU Common Fisheries Policy.)  The seas should not be seen as a free-for-all.\n\nThere are other elements of commercial fishing practices, which I will leave to the scientific advisors and politicians to identify and resolve.  The UK's review will also need to feed into the EU's review which began in 2009 and is due to end in 2012.",
