So I'd like to ask you to create some kind of \"best of\" list with the funniest petitions. \nAs this is a serious website, it may be wise to show this list on a different webpage. Or perhaps some newspapers would be interested to publish a few gems?\nMaybe you could organize a \"stupid petition of the month\" contest?\n\nAnyway, I'm sure you must read hundreds of e-petitions daily so when you find a humorous one, don't hesitate to forward it to me.\n\nThanks a lot for taking time to read me.",
