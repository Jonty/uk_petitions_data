            "action": "Stop messing around with this pre-budget which only helps the rich and do something worth while like increasing people's disposable income by reducing fuel duty, getting the energy companies in order with reasonable pricing and reducing food costs, which, let's face it, are the real issues causing the economic crisis.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We, the undersigned, are concerned about the measures proposed in the pre-budget report as they don't appear to address the need of the majority and only address the needs of the weathly. \n\nThe cut in VAT does not alter the underlying costs (fuel, energy and food) affecting peoples disposable  income and therefore any cut in VAT will not boost the economy and will only help the rich (e.g. \u00a35 off a \u00a3220 TV is pointless if we can't afford to spend \u00a3200 in the first place).\n\nFurthermore, paying for this by increasing fuel duty and NI is only compounding the problem as the low and middle wage earners will once again be paying more and therefore have even less disposable income which will in turn affect the economy more.\n\nBoosting the economy requires getting the disposable income back into the pockets of the majority. To do this petrol prices, energy bills and food costs need to be reduced to realistic levels. Instead of losing \u00a312.6bn in VAT cut, use it on something that will make a difference like cutting the costs of petrol, energy and food. \n\nThis is what the people need, listen to them, don't close your ears to them, show us that you listen to and understand the people that elected you.",
