            "background": "I believe that students who take more intellectual and challenging courses at university level (physics, maths, chemistry, biology or related subjects) should have their tuition fees paid for them.  This would encourage more teens to take up the sciences which would, in turn, produce a higher number of trained scientists, and would greatly benefit the technological development of the country.\n\nIt would also encourage students to think twice before choosing a less stimulating degree \"because it is easier\".",
