            "background": "I believe that being an MP should be a full time post. Indeed, that is what the electorate believed they voted for - someone to look after their interests on a professional and continuous basis. \n\nAny MP that believes that wider experience of business is necessary would be able to undertake other roles and not be a drain upon the public purse whilst still earning an income. Any MP who devotes their time solely to Parliament would benefit from a suitable salary and appropriate benefits.\n\nLong hours are not only worked by MPs. Many of the workforce do not wish to work extended hours and have no option but to continue for no additional remuneration. MPs, similarly, do so because it is in their interest. There should therefore be little or no recognition (payment) for early or late meetings etc. in line with the majority of the country. \n\nThe transparency of such a system would indicate which MPs are in the post for the good of the nation and which perhaps have a different agenda.",
