        "background": "Oscar Pistorius has no legs and uses prosthetic limbs which allow him to run. The IAAF have now ruled that these limbs give him an advantage over able bodied athletes which has been scientifically proven. Ethically we should not be discriminating against a man who has overcome his disability to participate in what should be a test of athletic strength and the olympic spirit. Please give Oscar a shot, if Dwain Chambers and every other steroid user is now clear to participate then I see no reason why Oscar should be banned.",
