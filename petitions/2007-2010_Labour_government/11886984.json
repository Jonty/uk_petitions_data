            "background": "Asylum seekers come to the UK because they are at risk for many reasons. There is no evidence that they come as health tourists seeking to benefit from UK health and social services. However many can have pre-existing health problems. Denying health care to those who are awaiting removal not only endangers their health but also risks the public health by those with communicable diseases not receiving appropriate care. Denial of access to health care is opposed by many health professionals experienced in caring for this vulnerable group.",
