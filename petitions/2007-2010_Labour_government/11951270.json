Price agreed by both parties at this time.\n\nA consultation fee (if charged)inc\n\nDiagnose in a pre-determined format. X-Ray-shows any abnormalities to organs inside the body.Blood test for other irregularities. These two tests when done should be the basis on how to treat the animal.\n\nRCVS says veterinary surgeons use professional judgement in how diagnosis takes place.\n\nEG we'll try this and if it does'nt work come back next week. \u00a3100-\u00a3200+\n\nNext week try this \u00a3100-\u00a3200+\n\nFinally take an X-Ray and blood and suddenly problem found.\n\nEither op/put sleep costs.\n\nNot much change from a \u00a31000+\nIf tests done first less suffering for the animal and less money for the vet.\n\nIf animal put to sleep due to Vets delay no fees should be payable.",
