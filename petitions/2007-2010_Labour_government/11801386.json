            "background": "Since 2005 we have been campaigning on the very important and real threat to the Package Travel Regulations.  There is considerable debate as to what constitutes a 'Package'.  All holidays sold must fall into the full provisions of the Package Travel Regulations.  Government must recognise that de-regulation is not an option; the Consumer and the Travel Industry needs Regulation. Low cost and major airlines must also be brought with this regulatory environment. To demonstrate Consumer detriment (eg. pre-departure, health & safety, financial etc) during 2008, we shall produce a report in March 2009. The Government should now recognise the dicta within R v CAA which highlighted the need for legislative action to cure this problem.  We call on government to urgently act now, particularly before the summer 2009 season.  We also call on the Government to support the EU Commission's investigation into these issues and strengthen Consumer Rights.",
