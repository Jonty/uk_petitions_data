            "background": "I/We raise this objection to the prosecution of anyone whom grows uses and consumes cannabis as a medical preparation in all its forms whilst there are companies that trade freely under licence on the British stock market who's sole purpose is to reap the medical properties of the cannabis plant.\nWithin this I/We also seek the freedom to grow use and consume cannabis in all its forms medically with the approval of the Home office and a clear set of guide lines on quantity/plants per person under single and multiple licence/registration.\nThis objection is raised on the blatant fact that shareholders and government make money from medical cannabis and are in turn no better than the drug lords that run the illegal cannabis markets in the UK.\nFurther more companies which trade in medical cannabis should be removed from the stock markets as no member of the British public or members of companies should be allowed to profit from the sale of medical cannabis whilst medical users are prosecuted for growing free cannabis solely for personal use.",
