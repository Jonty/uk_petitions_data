            "background": "My view is that David Blaine's activities are self-seeking, pointless, boring and environmentally wasteful. I petition the Prime Minister to enact a law that forbids all UK Media from reporting on any of David Blaine's activities (other than his permanent retirement) until 2020. Such a law will, in my view,  undoubtedly improve the quality of life for millions of Britons and remove a complete waste of valuable resources from our community.",
