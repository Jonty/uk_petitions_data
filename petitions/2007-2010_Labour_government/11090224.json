            "background": "Carers Work 24 hrs a day, 7 days a week ALL year round with little no breaks. A Carer can receive as little as \u00a3184 per month. It could be argued why should carers be paid to look after their own families, The answer is that carers love their families, and do not wish to see family in care homes/other organisations, where they may not be properly cared for or the staff do not have the time or resources to deal with a person/illness. Some carers do get support, but not much if any. Most Carers are overworked, underpaid and extremely tired. Also what help is offered is almost always of the useless, placating carers, but not really accomplishing the required level of help or assistance. We wish also to have our position in the job market recognised, as you would any other type of job, both within the Government, and also in the work place environment. It is also our wish to make it known that the current Carers' Rates award, should also be recognised for those who care for people who qualify for Lower, and middle rate Disability living allowance, as their carers still have to look after these individuals, almost always on a full-time basis.\nPlease sign this petiton.",
