        "background": "During the recent Job Evaluation process, the special needs Teacher's Assistants and Office Staff have been regraded, often leading to a significant reduction in pay.  We believe that the evaluation process has not taken into account the extreme dedication of these personnel, nor the skills and training that they have, including:\n\n- Medical - eg tube feeding, trachies, medication\n\n- Therapies - eg physical, speech, sensory\n\n- Communication - eg Makaton, PECS, visual / hearing difficulties\n\n- Behavioural - compassionately managing difficult behaviour\n\n- Intimate personal care\n\nWe ask the government to give this matter their URGENT attention - these staff are hard working, committed and essential to ensure the quality of life for all disabled children.  We want them to be recognised and remunerated accordingly.",
