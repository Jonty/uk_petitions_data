There is a petition coming to you this week and my correspondence with Mr Rooker & Simpson has FALLEN ON DEAF EARS.  To simply say that an allocation of \u00a3187k is all that is available is ludricous.  BEES pollinate a third of what we eat and even you must agree that something must be done fast.\n\nPLEASE - It is up to you.  Thank you.\n\nYours sincerely - Tony Woodley - Norwich",
