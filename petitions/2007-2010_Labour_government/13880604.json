            "background": "Currently students at university have tuition fees and in many cases take \nout loans, which are assessed for repayment based on their subsequent \nincomes.  Previously, the government subsidised the grants awarded to students who then graduated and moved into high-earning employment, without needing to pay the money back.  (Some have emigrated as part of the brain drain, so - income tax?)  These individuals should be assessed for the tuition fees, as if they were engaged in higher education under the current scheme. (ie as if they were studying for their degree now.)  Financial support for benefit-claimants and low-earners should be excluded.  As a p/t uni student, I usually pay for my education.  I see it as a fair trade-off for my future benefit.  I see no reason why the rules changing should give other people an unfair advantage.  The money should be claimed back, either direct from the individual concerned or as part of inheritance tax.",
