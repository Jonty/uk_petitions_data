            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We, the undersigned, agree that welfare reform may be necessary but reject the ideas conveyed by the current Work and Pensions secretary, Peter Hain. Plans for new tests for claimants are derisive at best and could be disastrous if disabled people are denied Benefit as a result. We also think that government assistance in helping those disabled people who feel able to seek work is wholly inadequate. Public money should be invested into services for disabled or sick people who want to seek work. We favour a realistic agenda of helping sick people back into work that takes into account individual needs and circumstances and is not based on central government targets. Incentives to work should be increased by allowing a greater amount of \u201cpermitted work\u201d whilst still on benefit. The government needs to understand the value of voluntary (unpaid) work by claimants who feel like they can contribute but cannot cope with the demands of a paid job. Many Incapacity Benefit claimants gain confidence from voluntary positions and this progress should not be jeopardised by forcing people into premature paid employment that could worsen their condition.",
