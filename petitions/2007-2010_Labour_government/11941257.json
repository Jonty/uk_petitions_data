If your husband/wife died before pensionable age their pension goes into a black hole and you get nothing or perhaps 50% of their SERPS if they were well paid once you are pensionable age.  If it had been a private pension you would have got something.  If you do not have a job or have not paid NI for two years and have savings over a certain amount you do not get job seekers allowance.  Why can you not be eligible under your husbands payments.",
