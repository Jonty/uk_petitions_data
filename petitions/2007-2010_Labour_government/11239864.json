It is due to the failings of the ONS that the ethnic English are statistically invisible.  \n\nThe above represents a potential tragedy in the making for the ethnic English.  It should be a priority for the ONS to rectify the situation by providing the ethnic English with a tick-box in the 2011 census form.",
