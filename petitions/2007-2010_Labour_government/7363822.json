            "background": "No individual incarcerated, in custody or under the physical control, regardless of nationality, shall be subject to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. This has long since been international statute. The British Government unreservedly condemns the use of torture as a matter of fundamental principle. We work hard with our international partners to eradicate this abhorrent practice, through the UN Convention Against Torture and the European Convention on Human Rights, and we expect all other countries to comply with their international obligations. Therefore, the petitioner is calling on the P.M. to address why I can easily access photos of torture victims from my home P.C. in Iraq - doesn't this defeat the peace - keeping effort ? (P.S. I reported the site to my internet provide and Amnesty USA) but more needs to be done at central level pressing the people who commit these vile acts  to deliver on these vocalised but poorly enacted human rights commitments (if they want UN protection, security and international aid).",
