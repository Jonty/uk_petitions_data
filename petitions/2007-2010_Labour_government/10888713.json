        "background": "The Early Learning Foundation stage is over complicated and will not improve the development of youngsters in the care of childminders as the primary role of the child minder is to keep a child in a safe environment and help that child to learn through play and interaction with other children, this can not be achieved if the child minder is bogged down with petty minded Bureaucracy.\nThe time taken to implement this minefield of badly thought out and overcomplicated rubbish that could only have been thought out by someone who has no idea how to educate young children sitting in some office in Whitehall will take the child minders away from their primary purpose but will make a fair proportion of them either give up chilminding or carry on without registering thus leaving the children and parents worse off in the long run",
