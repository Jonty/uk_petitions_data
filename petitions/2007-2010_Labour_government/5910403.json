            "background": "Met Police officers are entitled to free travel within a 70 mile radius of London due to their 'key worker' status. Teachers are also 'key workers' who earn less than Police Officers and yet they do not receive this significant bonus. With the escalating cost of travel within the capital it is only a matter of time before London will suffer from a significant lack of teachers as the cost of living is too high.",
