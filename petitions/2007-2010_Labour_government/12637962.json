        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The British people demand that those individuals who have abused the expenses system should be treated like any other British employee who has taken liberties with their employers' finances. We demand that they are removed from public office immediately, that they should never be permitted from holding office again, and that if necessary they face criminal proceedings. These are the rules the British people live their lives by, it is only right that those who've been chosen to represent us live by the same rules.\n\nWe also demand that MP's finances are made public in full so that every benefit received by them in their capacity as public servants be made clear to the British people.",
