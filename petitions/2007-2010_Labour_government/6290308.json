            "background": "As it stands at the moment everytime a member of the public contacts the Police and there is any evidence to support a crime then it has to be reported as a crime and investigated. Officers are no longer allowed to use their discretion. Therefore if a person wishes to crime the theft of an apple then it has to be recorded. Prior to this officers could inform the complainant that this is not in the publics interest. This would free the officer up more quickly thus having them back on the street to patrol.\nAlso a number of stations have officers inside stations to monitor if all offences have been recorded. Again removing officers from the front line.\nSupport this to get Police back on the street.",
