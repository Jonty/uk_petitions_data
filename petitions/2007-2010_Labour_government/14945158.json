            "background": "The EU has imposed rules upon the Olympic Organising Committee, saying that tickes may not be sold to British Citizens first, and may not be sold before becoming available to the rest of the EU.\n\nThis is wholely unfair as the British taxpayer has funded the olympics out of their own pocket. We feel that the least we are owed is a fair chance of a ticket to the Olympic venues in 2012.\n\nAs the govt now defends the rights and interests of the Falklands Islanders (whatever you may think of the issue), can it not also defend the rights and interests of the UK citizens?\n\nIt just takes one word: No.",
