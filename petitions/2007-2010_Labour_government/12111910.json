            "background": "Bringing back the death penalty would sort out the current crisis of prison shortages. I also think that people who commit crimes of a serious level (eg. murder and drug dealing) would be better to removed from society by receiving death as opposed to just life imprisonment which to be honest isn't really life as they can appeal to get their sentence reduced to be let back into society to commit the same crimes again. It's the answer to some of the problems we are currently facing. Please sign up to this if you really want to give prolific criminals what they deserve.",
