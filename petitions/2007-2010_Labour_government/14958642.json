            "background": "This petition does not seek to deny women the right to choose to wear heels or skirts; merely to ensure that it is a choice, and that they have the option of wearing trousers or flat shoes if they prefer. We ask the government to prevent companies from stipulating different uniforms for different genders; to create a law that forces equal uniform rights, whatever the job. Across society, employers force women to wear impractical and health damaging uniforms without justification or reason. Women are forced to stand for 12 hours in high heels. This leads to long-term health problems such as back problems, joint misalignment, varicose veins, fallen arches, and arthritis.  Women are forced to wear skirts and tights in place of trousers, which is often impractical. Employers insist on tight skirts to do physical jobs such as heavy cleaning. These skirts constrict movement and ride up, exposing the thigh or forcing women to flash their underwear. Women are often subject to harassment and abuse, which is worsened by sexist uniforms. Female workers deserve the same levels of comfort and dignity as their male counterparts. Trousers and flats can look as smart as skirts and heels.",
