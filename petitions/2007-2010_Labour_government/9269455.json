The sole reason for choosing this solution appears to be to massage the national debt figure, which does not include one year bonds (but would include three year bonds).\n\nWe petition the Prime Minister to ensure that this arrangement is admitted into the national debt regardless of its form, in order to avoid a serious impact on this country's reputation for honesty and integrity.",
