        "background": "Cuts are as much taxation as is work or trade in the black economy untaxed production. A money system to account for such without central cash casinos instituting gambling as a sense of security - save in the fraud of biased odds to fundamentally flaw markets with inefficiencies - based on impartial computation of consumption over time with respect to biological fecundity as may in a black sense subsides that informally - clearly needs to be instituted, in some part to address social equality within accountable efficient markets.\nFor 'economists' to be paraded about to gloss over the assumption of inefficiencies in their analysis to give a requirement for perceived 'cuts' rather than more generally understood 'taxes' when the issue at stake is overconsumption and the money system seems incapable at the moment to mediate that resource allocation process - is to call their status into disrepute.",
