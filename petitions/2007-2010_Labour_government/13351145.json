Europe hasn't done us any favours what so ever all we do is pay them a load of money then they tell us what we can and can't do and give us a load of problems in process. We would be a lot better of being a way from it all. When Europe was first setup it was meant to be a trading partner but now it seems to be that it's making the laws up for us and tell us how we treat our own people I for one have had enough we were doing fine before they came along and we'll do fine again without them. Get us out.",
