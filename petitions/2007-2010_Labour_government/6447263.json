If this happens will our mortgage debt be 'written off'? \nNO OF COURSE NOT!\n\nI smell double standards, and this is 'so' unfair. \n\nAs a home owner, if I didn't pay my mortgage, I'd eventually have my home repossessed - YES?\nYet if a 'company', like Northern Rock, for example, falls to pay their debts, the company goes into 'liquidation' and the debt is 'WRITTEN OFF', or.... the Bank of England step in to help them - Why is this? \n\nMy request is for the government to either put a stop to the 'Bank of England' bailing these company's out, unless they are willing to offer the same help to the 'home owner' when he/she falls into the same trap - that's a fair request, isn't it?\n\nWouldn't it be nice if..... when company's like 'Northern Rock' do go into 'liquidation' or are 'taken over' by another company, we, as the home owner have our mortgages written off! - Ahhh, I can dream!\n\nUNFAIR DOUBLE STANDARDS METHINKS!",
