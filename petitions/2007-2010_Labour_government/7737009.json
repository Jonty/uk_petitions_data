        "background": "Many people say this country should, for instance, stop aid to a specific country because its GOVERNMENT (or royal family or dictator) has decided to spend what little money the country has on weapons or luxury goods for the king (or queen)/dictator.  Other reasons given are, for instance, anti-British statements made by the government/royal family/dictator.  The ordinary, powerless, impoverished citizens of any country have no control over what their GOVERNMENT (etc) does - in fact some decisions, such as spending decisions, make them even poorer than they would otherwise be - so my very strong opinion is that it is TOTALLY wrong to withhold aid from them for the sorts of reasons I've mentioned.",
