            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The protocol should not only focus on homophobic bullying, but educate pupils in the age range (11-18), focusing upon personal liberties in relation to sexuality. Section 28 may have been repealed, however a scar still remains upon both teachers and pupils, both unsure what is politically correct. The protocol would not only address these issues, but also help lift the 'taboo' of homosexuality amongst children and adults alike, creating a schooling system in which gay and lesbian children feel that they can be themselves without fear of abuse.",
