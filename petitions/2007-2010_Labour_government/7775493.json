They are more reliable and dont require the stringent testing that the MOT demands. Many MOT centres use the MOT to create work on vehicles in order to boost profits. Those cars that are in disrepair have the types of driver who is likley not to bother with the current MOT, tax, insurance etc. The MOT has just become another stealth tax on the motorist and its time it was scrapped!",
