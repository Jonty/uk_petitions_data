            "background": "The England national football team do not gel well on the pitch. They are poor in comparison to other national sides. In third world countries such as Brazil the players started off kicking a coke can round a run down area with a few freinds. They are good now but the only reason they are good is because they had to earn the privilege and they also have much more pride than our side has. At the end of the day win, lose or draw our players will still have thier posh house, psorts car, wife or girlfriend and lots of money. If we only pay them half the full wage for a draw and full wage for a win per game they will soon have an incentive. If they lose they get NOTHING.",
