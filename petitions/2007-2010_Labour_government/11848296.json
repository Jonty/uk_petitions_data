            "background": "The Prime Minister today congratulated the British winners of the 2009 Oscars, calling last night\u2019s success a \u201cfantastic achievement for the British film industry\u201d.\nI wish to petition the Prime Minister to stop HMRC endeavour to re-define the meaning of s48 1997 legislation twelve years after it was written. The film 'My Kingdom' staring Richard Harris produced in association with Sky Pictures remains subject to HMRC enquiry eight years after it was made along with numerous other British films produced in association with film Partnerships established in response to tax incentives enticing investment in the high risk British film industry. Whilst one understands the need to counter blatant tax avoidance schemes it cannot be anything but a wrong to challenge investments that accord with the purpose of the original legislation subject to the retrospective  establishment of case law. Such enquiry pursues more than the intended tax mischief.",
