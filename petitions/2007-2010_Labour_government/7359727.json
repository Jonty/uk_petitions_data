            "background": "why do politicians spend so much time personally slurring each other ? what's the point ? Parliament was designed to discuss issues of local, national and international significance - to which both sides of the Houses of Commons, from differing economic and administrative perspectives can contribute. The petitioner is calling on MP's to address what and how debates are conducted in parliament to ensure more productive discussion for tax payers'pay results rather than waste time on personal vendettas. How can we as a nation expect to come to any conclusion or positive decision  making - produce effective leadership when we battle agaisnt each other ? Lets us not forget that it is poverty, disease, educational standards, bad governance, crime, terroism, corruption, policy decision and   international diplomacy that are the real issues - not each other - where has the sense of team and politeness gone ?",
