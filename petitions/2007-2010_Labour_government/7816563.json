            "background": "there are many good tenants but occasionally you come across a tenant who deliberately rents a property then stops paying any rent. the legal system to evict bad tenants is a farce. taking months to get the eviction. us landlords take alot of stick because people assume we are \"loaded\" but most of us are just hardworking people trying to improve our futures. from start to finish it should take no longer than 6 weeks to get the tenants out. the employment of private bailliffs should be allowed. the councils should take more responsability for them but they adopt this attitude that its not their problem, they dont have to find them anywhere to live until they get a bailiffs eviction date and then they'll rehouse them on the morning of the eviction. the law is a farce and we the lanlords need some rights too.",
