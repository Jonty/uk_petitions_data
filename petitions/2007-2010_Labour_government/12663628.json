        "background": "This is a petition for the PM to order an independant public enquiry into the MP's who have made false expenses claims with the findings passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration of prosecution under the Fraud Act 2006. Such proceedings ARE in the public interest, contrary to the announcement made by the police on 19 May 2009. Members of the public who make false benefit claims are prosecuted for fraud. So why not MP's who make false expenses claims - usually for very much more money? There cannot be a law for one and a different law for others.",
