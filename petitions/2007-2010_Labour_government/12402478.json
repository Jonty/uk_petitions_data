Unfortunately (for the UK government) more enlighted schools of thought have appeared since then which has led to most of the world (America, Canada, Australia...) declaring independance from the UK and yet being FAR more successful in human righs, education, GDP etc.(ie the HDI). Stop dictating and being so PC, and respect and care for your citizens as these countries do rather than ridiculous immigrants that hate western society. Also, get rid of the database state.",
