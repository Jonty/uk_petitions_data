I still oppose this idea but while looking through petitions on this subject I saw that ALL were in favour not only of that but also of capital punishment and, in one case, even torture! In my opinion all these petitions, if acceded to, would put this country back to a state of barbarity.  \n\nI do agree that some crimes need to be punished severely - in particular crimes against the person - but not like that!  Surely it would be better to show perpetrators how their acts have impacted on their victims; some may not respond to that but it would be worth trying as a first resort.",
