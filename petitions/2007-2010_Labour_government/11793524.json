Our brothers, fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers fought and died in previous wars and continue to fight in wars today to preserve our freedoms and way of life, the government should not be curtailing these freedoms.\nI may not agree with the comments that are made by some of the people silenced, but generations have fought to secure their right to say what they wish. There is no justification in the current trend of Orwellian oppression of thought or speech.\n\u201cI may not like what they say, but I will defend their right to say it with my life\u201d has been one of the cornerstones of British Civilisation for hundreds of years and to turn our backs on this now when it is needed more than ever would be to disgrace the British people.",
