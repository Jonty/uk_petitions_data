I have worked all my life, yet because she has more kids by someone else and claims, I have to pay CSA, yet she doesn't have to pay a penny. Surely if we have a child each to raise then that evens things out? I have emailed & written to my Councillor & MP, who have both recited \"the Law\" and there's nothing I can do!!\nThe benefits they are paid are reduced because I pay CSA, so in effect, I'm \"keeping\" my ex-partner and her man in a life of luxury.\nTell me again, why we bother to go to work???\n\nTHIS IS TOTALLY UNFAIR, DISCRIMINATIVE AND WRONG!\n\nThe Law should be fair & equal, not a dictatorship.",
