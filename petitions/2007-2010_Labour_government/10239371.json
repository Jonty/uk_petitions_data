            "background": "Please ask Rt Hon Ed Balls/Denham in  their capacity as Schools/Skills Secretaries to liaise better with university departments - specifically Paul Garner at the LSTM, to supervise immigrant students better. I spent 6 months translating and proof - reading an OVERSEAS PhD thesis (on the contractual agreement that I would be paid \u00a3200) - then the person left the country ! I also paid petrol expenses transporting which I was not re paid - does the British govt think my pocket is a bottomless pit or a taxi ?!\n\nThe British govt. should NOT allow foreign students to study in UK institutions who exploit, steal from and generally abuse British citizens who try to help them, especially, if university depts claim to have charitable status - the actions of some make the process look like a con.\n\nThese individuals spoil international studies and the good work being achieved by projects by pioneering individuals like Bill and Melinda Gates for everyone. The DFID should be closely examined - Britain is being taken for a ride !",
