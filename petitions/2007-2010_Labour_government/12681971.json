        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Our current electoral system is undisputably undemocratic: in 2005, Labour won 55.2% of the seats in the House of Commons, in spite of winning only 35.3% of the popular vote, and the Liberal Democrats won only 9.6% of seats, despite winning 22.1% of the popular vote. \n\nIn today's modern world, this cannot be acceptable: how can a nation call itself democratic, when voters feel they have only 2 choices of political party open to them? How can a collection of MPs call themselves the government, if they only represent 35.3% of voters?\n\nIf you want the opportunity to know that, wherever you live, your vote will make a difference to central government, to know that your voice will be heard, whoever you vote for, please, sign this petition.",
