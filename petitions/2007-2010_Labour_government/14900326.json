            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This petition proposes that money being spent by pressure groups (a group which aims to exert influence over policy making of the government of the day) should be available for the public/members to view. They should be able to question and propose how their money is spent within that pressure group. It is unfair that money being spent by pressure groups is being spent on helping some MP's to pay for their canvassing/printing of leaflets, when they have exspenses that should be providing them with the resources to do this. It is also unfair that the money goes to any other form of instituion or person other than representatives of the group. The money should solely be spent on investing in the pressure group, to help expansion and promoting its cause.",
