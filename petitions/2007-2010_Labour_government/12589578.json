        "background": "While we understand that many of these infamous expense claims may have been technically within the rules, they were certainly not morally acceptable. There were numerous calls for the former Chief Executive of RBS to voluntarily reduce his pension even though there was no clear legal precedent for doing so. Similarly, we believe that the abuse of the expense system by many of our politicians is so blatantly and incomprehensibly immoral, that we, the public, must call for the individuals involved to voluntarily refund the worst expense claims, or resign.",
