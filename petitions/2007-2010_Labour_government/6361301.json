            "background": "RAF Abingdon was a Royal Air Force station near Abingdon, Oxfordshire.\n\nThe base was opened in 1932, initially as a training station for RAF Bomber Command. It continued in this role through World War II.\nThe station was closed in December 1992. It was taken over by the British Army and renamed Dalton Barracks.\n\nI would like to see the Airfield Re-opened for Civil FLights. This wold be very popular with Aviation Enthusiasts all over the country and it would be a real boost to the local area and economy. It would also be a boost to tourism in Abingdon and Oxford.\n\nThe Airfield has a lot of history and it really would be a good thing to bring flying back to the site",
