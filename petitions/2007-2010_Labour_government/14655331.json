        "background": "Please consider upgrading a Zebra Crossing on Somnes Avenue, Canvey Island to a Pelican Crossing. The crossing is busy as it is used to access three local schools. A pelican crossing would make it safer for pedestrians, as cars do not always stop. It would also ease congestion as traffic would be regulated by the pelican crossing rather than the flow of predestrians.",
