            "background": "I have noticed that a problem is growing regarding the gaming machines in Betting offices in my area (London) and I assume across the country.  Gambling is meant to be a fun leisure activity, however I have yet to see one person on these machines that has total control of their finances these machines have created a different type of gambler.  These are gamblers that will not and in most cases cannot stop until all their money has gone which can lead to further problems for the gambler which can include relationship breakdowns, eviction for non payment of rent/mortgage, depression, crime to pay for this new addiction, child poverty for their siblings and in worst cases suicide.  There is also a large rise in the number of young people becoming attracted to these machines which could prove to have  disastrous effects for this country in future years.  These machines only appear to benefit the Betting offices. I request that the Government whose primary duty should be to look after the interests of the majority look into banning these highly addictive gaming machines for the sake of the public.",
