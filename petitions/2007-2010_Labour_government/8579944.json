            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The fault with Cheshire is that County Hall is way over in the west, and it's a long way from Macclesfield and the Pennine foothill towns. Add to that the lack of direct public transport: any Macclesfield councillor wishing to pull his weight against the westerners has to contribute great clouds of CO2 from his car to do so! And non-drivers, whether councillors or others attending county hall from the east, have greater difficulty. A look at the rail map would suggest Crewe as having more direct links than anywhere else.\nSplitting into 2 unitary councils would mean that decisions that would be done by our borough councils get taken further away: Vale Royal (for example) is already large, and there is no ready public transport from one end to the other, for the convenience of those unable to drive. A bigger unit would only be worse.\nWe therefore request that due consideration be given to retaining the two-tier system, and centralising Cheshire County Council, to make it more democratic and reduce CO2 emissions.",
