            "background": "Why should we work hard to earn enough money to pay bills etc, for all the money that goes into the government and local councils by way of income tax and council tax (and tax on everything we buy)to be wasted on ridiculous salarys and benefits that you would not get if you worked for an ordinary private company. The amount of money these people seem to waste is horrific. where does this money come from? US, If you stopped wasting so much money you could cut the amount of tax that the ordinary person has to pay and we would all be happier!! And yes that does include cutting down on the number of people who want to sit at home and claim benefits because they cant be bothered to get a job, I dont see why I should be paying for these people. Also I believe that stopping immigration completely and removing those who are already here and making no contribution to society, would significantly reduce the costs of looking after these people. We need to start looking after our own country/people before trying to sort out the rest of the world.",
