        "background": "We should minimise all immigration now.  We should locate and deport all illegal immigrants, send asylum seekers back whence they came and be brave enough to say that this is for the benefit of the country.  This is an English-speaking nation with traditions and cultures that are not the same as those of other countries and we must not allow the arguments of Political Correctness and Human Rights to destroy our heritage.\n\nI believe that the acceptance of this petition and the adoption of the policy that it supports would give the public what it wants and would facilitate, as a minimum, the following benefits:\n\n Reduce the influx of undesirable aliens\n\n Reduce spread of disease and infection\n\n Reduce erosion of the nation's identity\n\n Reduce the threat of terrorism\n\n Reduce the housing shortage\n\n Reduce the prison population\n\n Reduce hospital waiting lists\n\n Reduce congestion on roads\n\n Reduce welfare expenditure \n\n Reduce school class sizes \n\n Reduce driving accidents\n\n Reduce unemployment\n\n Reduce crime rate\n\n Reduce taxes",
