One of these MPs Mr Elliot Morely claimed \u00a316,000 for a mortgage he had already paid. If a person in any other walk of life had done this they would be investigated for obtaining property by deception. Justice needs to be done to these members. It is bad enough that they are claiming fraudulently but then for no procedings to be taken against them makes them appear above the law. Mr Brown, please allow justice to be done on these members.",
