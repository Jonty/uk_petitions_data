            "background": "The government has postponed the introduction of the new motorcycle test until 31 March 2009 because the new motorcycle test centres were not ready for the new test introduction date of 29th September 2008.\nThe increase in the price of the new test was \u00a320, from \u00a360 to \u00a380, but despite 10,000 tests having been booked and a further 25,000 test bookings likely in the 6 months to March 2009, motorcyclists are being offered the old test but having to pay the new rate.  This is a right rip off and bookings already made should be refunded their \u00a320 and the old test fee reinstated until the end of March 2009.",
