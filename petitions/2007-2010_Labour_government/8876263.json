            "background": "Some reports now claim that public pensions are costing up to 20% of the council tax bill & account for a large percentage of the increased cost of council tax.\n\nI believe the public should be properly informed of the costs of public sector pensions.\n\nBorough & town councils, police & fire authorities should be required to publish their full pension costs each year in the annual council tax statements. At present, pension costs are hidden amongst the costs for the services provided. Pension costs should be separated out for transarency.\n\nThe figures published would be decided by a committee but might include: TOTAL PENSION COSTS, COST TO EACH TAXPAYER, CONTRIBUTION PER PUBLIC WORKER, ANNUAL CHANGE (per measure).\n\nWhen available, this information will enable residents to compare their contribution to public pensions with their own pension contributions (if private). One benefit may be that private sector employees increase their own contributions voluntarily; a much needed shift. Another benefit may be that the public sector voluntarily controls increasing pension costs going forward.\n\nI believe that when the information is in the public domain, informed debate will ensue.",
