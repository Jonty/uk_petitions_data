            "background": "There is one simple way to tackle the current binge drinking culture and at the same time increase the future prospects of young people. \nBy initially increasing the voting age to 21, when the drinking age is increased to 21 those below that age who it concerns will not be able to vote. Yes this may sound 'harsh' but it is required for the best of the country. \nWith the legal drinking age increased to 21, not only would it stop younger people drinking heavily (especially those at university who see it as a chance to drink and party, and not to gain further education) it would mean that when people are at an age to consume alcohol legally, they would be more responsible themselves about how much they drink.",
