        "background": "Given the current economic climate, businesses should be able to let demand and supply determine the price of labour.  It is possible to hire 2 people for little more than the current NMW given that some people are willing to work for less.  Some businesses & employees have found ways round the current NMW and this benefits certain classes of employees.  By opening up the labour market up to cheaper labour rates, the demand for labour could increase.  The cost of living in the North of England, Wales and Scotland is dramatically different than the South of England, yet there is no difference in the NMW.  The result has been ridiculous wages in traditionally poorer areas, with no change in cost of living thus no benefit, leading to an increase in unemployment once the local and european subsidies have run out.  i.e. Objective 1.  The NMW must be abolished in order to allow businesses to negotiate resonable wage prices.  Reducing unemployment, benefit claims and helping the economy.",
