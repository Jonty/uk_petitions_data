            "background": "Ofcom have proposed that a tax should be applied to ipods, freeview boxes, satelite dishes, internet subscriptions, blank cd's and dvd's.\nThis is because ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5's revenue from advertising is falling and the tax would be to help publically fund these TV stations.\nWhy should the public be forced to pay to keep these companies afloat?  We are already taxed to the hilt.  The residents of the UK are already being squeezed for every last penny, this tax would just add insult to injury.  Are we to slide back into the dark ages?  Maybe window tax will be next on the agenda?!!!!\nSign the partition and say \"no\" to more tax.",
