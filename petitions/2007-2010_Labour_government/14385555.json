            "background": "Im 20 years and its hard for me to live on \u00a345 per a week now the prices are going up on food and clothing ect \nso i think that they should raise it a bit more and for people that have not been working for a certin amount of time should get put in any job avalible. Also housing benefit is \u00a342 per a week and that should be higher as there is not many places that are less then \u00a370 per a week in the north east of sunderland so i think they should also be raised to at least \u00a360 and that they should help you with getting a deposit ( that is normaly \u00a31000 ) \ni think this would help alot more people out",
