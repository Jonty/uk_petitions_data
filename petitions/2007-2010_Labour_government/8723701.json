            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "As time has passed by and the British legal and prison system has become softer, I believe, that the social collapse and apparent lawlessness is a direct result of this. The British prison system is costing more than ever and prisoners rights have increased and even surpass those of the law abiding citizen. I've started this petition in the hope that we can return to our roots and enforce a system which strips convicted criminals of these rights and liberties that should be available to the law abiding citizen. The luxuries they now enjoy cannot be afforded by the taxpayer and are a luxury they we do not get ourselves.  In removing these freedoms, the cost will be dramaticaly reduced and will act as a real deterrant, rather than having a 'holiday camp' persona which doesn't have any real impact on crime at all, and almost incites crime.  The criminal justice system should be tougher, prisoners have too many rights and luxuries and the British Taxpayer is footing the bill.  This negates the fact that prison is a punishment and prisoners should have their rights removed, because to be imprisoned, they have breached the human rights of those to whom they have offended against.",
