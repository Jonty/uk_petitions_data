            "background": "This petition was inspired by seeing headlines about multi-million pound companies paying little or no tax.  I'm sure everyone realises that all public expediture is funded by various forms of taxation so it's obvious that the less tax any company or individual pays the fewer services can be provided (or everyone else has to pay more tax; but the Government will not increase direct taxation).  Either the situation of these companies paying so little taxation (or none at all) is illegal, in which case (as stated in a previous petition) the Government should target the perpetrators with as much zeal as it does benefit fraudsters (and if it does not it is responsible for the consequences), or it is legal in which case the Government is responsible for any effect this has on the life of any individual such as not being prescribed drugs which could SAVE (or enhance) HIS/HER LIFE!",
