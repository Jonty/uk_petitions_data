            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Many people have been in a situation where either they have had bailiff letters, bailiffs have visited, or they have had their property seized by bailiffs.\n\nThe proposal is to make companies themselves recover the debts and cut out the bailiffs who often use dodgy tactics on people who are clearly vulnerable. Companies/Lenders will be allowed to send mail and make a maximum of two visits to an address, they should speak on level terms with the consumer, they will be allowed to charge a fee (Based on the cost of these actions around \u00a32 for a letter, \u00a35 recorded mail, and 20pence per mile for a car drive, they can employ their own debt collectors, but not make huge sums of money on debt) This situation is particularly fragile due to the recession currently going on.\n\nThe aim of this legislation would be to protect the people of Britain, to ensure that they aren't put into the hands of bailiffs, which in turn causes more debt problems, as some turn to high interest loans as they cannot afford to pay the debt.",
