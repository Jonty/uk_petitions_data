In summary, we the people, demand to know from you, as the Prime Minister of our elected Government, why the Treaty of Lisbon was not put to the British people in a referendum since it is, in reality, simply the European Constitution Treaty broken down into smaller parts (\"The new treaty would be based on the first and fourth parts of the Constitution, the rest of the Constitutions changes being achieved through amendments to the Treaty of Rome.\" ) to aid in the ratification of the TOL and circumventing the vote of the people on an issue that affects our lives in this country and Europe.",
