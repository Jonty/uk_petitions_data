            "background": "Today (1st of October 2009) the 'UK Supreme court' opened. It cost \u00a359m and it will keep taking our money. Law lords no longer have the most power, which goes against British judicial history. Hearings will be televised, which also goes against history and may affect decisions in the court.\n\nIn conclusion to all these points I believe that power should be returned to the law lords and the new building can be used for another, more necessary political duty. If you feel the same way then, please sign this petition.\n\n\nThankyou",
