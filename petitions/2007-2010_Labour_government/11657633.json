        "background": "The National Trust still wants to buy up and flood or junglefy some 15,000 acres of fine food-growing Cambridgeshire Fen land, the best of Britain's most basic resources and close by the ancient Fen-edge settlements of Wicken, Upware, Burwell, Reach, Swaffham Prior, Swaffham Bulbeck, Lode & Longmeadow, Bottisham, Stow cum Quy, Fen Ditton, Horningsea and Waterbeach. We deplore the loss of this land, the threat to homes, livelihoods and businesses, and the grave danger to a place of worship (the well-known and greatly-loved 'Little Chapel in The Fen'). We are concerned that additional car parks and extra traffic in and through the villages - as well as more flies and mosquitoes - will affect residents adversely. Most of all, we are angered by the pointless and enormous estimated \u00a3100-million-plus expense (to include the \u00a320-million so-called 'Bridge of Reeds' over the A14) and believe, in this recession, that there are other and better objects and causes to support.",
