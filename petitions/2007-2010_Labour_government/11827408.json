        "background": "Girls are being discriminated against at schools across the United Kingdom by not being allowed to wear trousers as part of their school uniform. The winter months especially in the United Kingdom are bitter cold and whilst boys can wear trousers, girls are told that they have to wear a skirt, the most affected by this preposterous policy is the young primary school children, some are told to simply wear tights but this isn't always suitable as dry skin conditions such as eczema are very common.  This is an infringement on our young female\u2019s rights.",
