The Women\u2019s wheelchair basketball team are ranked higher than many teams who have received funding in the latest announcement.  We ask the Government to rectify this inequality in support to women\u2019s wheelchair basketball, who despite remaining in the top ten in the world and finishing eighth in Beijing whilst other sports ranked much lower in the world are rewarded substantially, are set to receive no money.",
