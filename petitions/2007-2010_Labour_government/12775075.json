How many thousands of petitions are signed each each to scrap the tv licence and are then ignored or some rubbish excuse is given for why we should fund the bbc. people only pay the fee because the threat of \u00a31000 fine is just something they can't afford. i thought demanding money with menaces was illegal. why has the bbc been allowed to do it for so long!! i feel like i've been robbed. why pay for something you don't use?",
