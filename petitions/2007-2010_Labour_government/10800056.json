            "background": "I feel that it is wrong that parents get into trouble if there teenager refuses to go to school. If the parents ask for help, they don`t get it, what are the parents supposed to do? The law needs to change, it needs to change to help parents get and keep the children into full time education. Also there should be a 'Boot Camp' for so called teenagers, where they are forced to go to a camp where they go away for a month and do the work they have missed while not at school. The parents need help in this matter and 90% of parents do not get the help they need.",
