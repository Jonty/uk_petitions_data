        "background": "We are Fibromyalgia sufferers, and we are being degraded and having to jump through hoops just to get through this ESA benefit. Fibromyalgia sufferers that are being turned down with 0 points after having medicals, and being told they are only entitled to JSA, if your GP has signed you off work because you are ill, you are not entitled to JSA, so what are they exactly entitled to? the forms themselves are causing huge stress to us, let alone the anxiety that these medicals are causing, stress is one of the things that causes a flare up, Fibromyalgia can be and is a debilitating disease, image having to cope with pain all over your body and chronic fatigue this is just how we feel everyday, it is not curable.  ESA is too complicated, too long winded  too stressful we urge the Prime Minster to rethink this benefit urgently, and to give fellow Fibromyalgia sufferers that dignity and recognition they deserve and to be recognised as they do not take into account how variable this disease is",
