            "background": "I am campaigning to stop the closure of Dewsbury Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. At the moment the intensive care part of the unit has temporarily closed only leaving special care. This is resulting in babies requiring intensive care being transferred across the country to an available cot. The unnecessary transferring of babies in my opinion is unacceptable and we need to act now to restore and improve the facility at Dewsbury before any more lives are lost.",
