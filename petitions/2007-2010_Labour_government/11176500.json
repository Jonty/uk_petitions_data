I'm sure the millions of people who lost relatives would have something to say about it. Why are we brushing these horrific acts under the carpet so as not to offend the Muslims who are being taught in our schools. This is not a racist petition against Muslims it is a petition to ensure that our children grow up to appreciate everything they have now and how much suffering has gone on to achieve where we are today.",
