            "background": "Many youths enjoy the skate park as an area to spend their time and to carry out exercise that the government tells them is so important to partake in. We feel it is currently an excellent area which keeps youths busy and of off the streets, so recent plans to use a percentage of this space to create a programme called Muga is unacceptable and could easily be placed in one of the other 73 acres of land available. We disagree with the fundamental suggestion that something has to be sacrificed for this new programme to be achieved. We would therefore suggest a rethink on the destination of the programme called Muga.",
