            "background": "It was estimated by Diabetes UK that diabetes costs the NHS 9 billion pounds a year or \u00a3100,000,000 an hour. Most of these costs arise from complications like 100 foot amputations a week as well as the countless people requring eye operations, kindey dialysis/transplants or emergancy care. Dont forget that those who develop severe complications then become a further cost through disability living allowence etc etc. So why cant the government help the NHS to give the approx 2.3 million diabetics in the UK a CGM each for free or partially funded dependant on age?\nIf it costs 9 billion a year and only approx 8 billion to give everyone a Continuous glucose monitoring system, then surely the benefits of alllowing diabetics better equipment to gain better control will save the NHS money and save patients limbs and lives in the long run? I would like the government to implement a system where all diabetics can have a CGMS for free or heavily subsidised based on age/income",
