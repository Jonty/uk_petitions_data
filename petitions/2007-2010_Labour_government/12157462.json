        "background": "Investigations into Climate Change at current are never focussed on whether or not it is caused by Carbon dioxide or greenhouse gasses, but on what we can do to cut down these gasses. Any report on a matter of such significance to not only our nation, or our economy, but mankind, should be ongoing; it should not create a conclusion one year and not revise that report when new evidence is found the next; and as \"climate science\" of this nature is relatively new, evidence will continue to be revealed on both sides of the argument each and every year for decades from now.\n\nAn investigation should include evidence given from all sides of the scientific community and should not, like many independent investigations, be focussed on proving climate change's effects, or proving that mankind have caused it, but should be focussed on investigating whether or not man has, indeed, caused it.",
