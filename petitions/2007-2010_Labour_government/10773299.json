        "background": "Single people demand fairer treatment in the tax system of both central and local government.  We (single people/households) are a growing part of society but are NEVER considered in either central or local government taxation issues.  Running a single household is expensive with no shared costs or expenses.  We demand fairer treatment of single people in government taxation planning both centrally and locally (for example increase council tax discount to 50% for lone households). Senior citizens are often single households and suffer from the current taxation system, particularly from council tax.",
