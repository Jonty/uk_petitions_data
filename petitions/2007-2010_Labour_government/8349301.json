        "background": "Last week, the Tower Colliery in South Wales shut its doors for the last time.\n\nThe pit was condemned to close by the Conservative government, but the men of Tower - led by Tyrone O'Sullivan - ignored their claims the pit was empty and kept it open for nearly two decades of sucessful mining.\n\nIt is a testament to Tyrone's belief and the men's courage that the mine became one of the most proiftable in Britain and for this, he should be made Sir Tyrone for his services to Wales, the mining industry and the human race for making peeople believe in themselves more.",
