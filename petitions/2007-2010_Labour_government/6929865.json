        "action": "levy a duty on sugar, in order to persuade the food industry to reduce sugar in its products.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The proportion of sugars in foods has risen over past decades - correlating with the rise in obesity.\n\nSugar is a cause of obesity. Sugars go quickly to the bloodstream. Too much sugar in the blood is dangerous, so the body produces insulin, which causes the excess to be removed and stored as fat. This mechanism can overshoot, leading to low blood sugar, signalling the body to eat more. Obesity results. Diabetes follows. The NHS goes bust.\n\nSo, tax sugar. The easiest way to do this is to bring it into the duty regime. Like petrol, sugar comes from a refinery and moves in bulk tankers. You can track it; you can tax it.\n\nThe aim of this duty is to alter the behaviour of industry. Even an initial duty of zero would send a clear message.\n\nPackaged foods are engineered with a keen eye on costs. Rising duty will alter the costs seen by industry and hence alter the ingredients list, bringing more choice to consumers.\n\nThis proposal also supports a general move to switch taxation from labour to consumption.",
