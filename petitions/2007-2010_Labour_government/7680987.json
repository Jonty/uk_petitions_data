        "background": "It is felt that due to the pressures on the housing market and local services caused by those taking a 2nd property for holiday or residential purposes, owners should support the local area by paying a Social Responsibility Tax.\nNot enough thought for the social cost of 2nd homes is taken in to account.  The lack of affordable housing  means permanent residence can not afford to live in the area - leading to local services such as schools and shops to close.\nLocal services must be maintained even if they owners are not in residence.  \nSome areas have such a high density of second homes house prices have been driven up that some may seem to be ghost towns at times.  The 2nd home owners have noted a certain benefit by living in the particular local community.  They should help to maintain the area all year round \u2013 either that or central government needs to address how areas like this are funded for the benefit of a few.",
