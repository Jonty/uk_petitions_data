            "background": "The e-borders system threatens British citizens most basic right of freedom of moment by effectively creating a \"exit visa\" system as used in the repressive soviet era. No democratic government has any right to restrict its citizens movement without the use of a judicial sanction. The system must be restricted to the most basic data and must contain nothing other than passport number date of exit and place of exit from the UK. Furthermore any use of this system for other than its declared aim should be considered unlawful.",
