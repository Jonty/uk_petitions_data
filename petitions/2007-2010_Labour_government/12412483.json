            "background": "The response to 'Ban The Existance of a god in all State Schools' was a side-step in addressing the real issue. Yes - teaching children the differences between religions and their relationship to the rest of humanity is a good thing. But! The main idea was petitioning against faith-based schools totally - you have not answered the question as to how we can implement schools for schools sake - purely education not superstition.",
