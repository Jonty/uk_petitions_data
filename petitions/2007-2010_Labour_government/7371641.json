            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Government should make cannabis legal as is IS widely used across the county by many people.It should be legalized so that government could put in regulations to protected users other than having to buy it on the black market.These are my proposed regulations:1.Age Limit be set between 18&21.2. Sale of cannabis is taxed(money made can be used to fund medical treatment for cannabis users).3.Sold at designated outlets. (eg selected shops and retailers)4.Consumption of cannabis is not allowed outdoors or in public.(will be for personal use in the users own home)5.Set amount of cannabis sold per person at any one time in a shop(eg 3gram maximum then the shop has to refuse to serve them again) 6. Advertising limits,like the limits on tobacco,should be placed on cannabis and health warnings should be on all packaging.The Government would be able to control potency of cannabis available and amount sold to each individual.Money made from tax would cover any medical treatment needed by users.",
