            "background": "British shoppers get though eight billion a year, but elsewhere the humble plastic bag has become a menace, with one country even banning them outright. Could the UK follow suit?\nA person\u2019s use of a plastic check-out bag can be counted in minutes \u2013 however long it takes to get from the shops to their homes. Plastic bags however, can take between 15 and 1000 years to break down in the environment.\n\n\nIn the marine environment plastic bag litter is lethal, killing many birds, whales, seals and turtles every year. After an animal is killed by plastic bags its body decomposes and the plastic is released back into the environment where it can kill again.\nOn land, plastic bag litter can block drains and trap birds. They also kill livestock.At least 80 million plastic bags end up as litter on our beaches, streets and parks.Plastic bags are a by-product of the oil industry.",
