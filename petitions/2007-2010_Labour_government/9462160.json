            "background": "I have slowy watched my local petrol station increase the price of fuel 6p in the last two weeks. This fuelling station is an owned franchise of Texaco. However, the fuel price per litre is set by the company owner, Malthurst, not the the franchise owner. Whilst having a converstion with the franchise owner,he informed me that Malthurst would be increasing the price of Diesel to \u00a31.50 per litre by the end of June. I find it disturbing that the government is prepared to let these prices increase so drastically as well as add their own tax on top. I therefore petition to stop these increases and ask the government to reduce the price of fuel per litre.",
