        "background": "I feel that all the hard earned money which tax payers are expected to pay should be solely for the use of running the country - schools, hospitals , community sundries etc. As the owner of a small business and with a young family,I haveto make the money to pay for the extras in life.  It is completely unfair that I haveto carry those who earn thousands upon thousands of pounds by default. I live in a mediocre home and have forgone simple holidays in the last few years while starting my family - They should be ashamed of themselves!!!!!",
