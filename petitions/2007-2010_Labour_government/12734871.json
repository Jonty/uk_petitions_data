            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Section 1.54 of the Document L1 of the Building Regulations 2000 requires that reasonable provision be made for the installation of energy efficient lighting, preferably in those areas where the lighting is expected to have most use. To achieve this it recommends the installation of a number of these fittings dependant on the house size.\n\nThe result has been that many builders fit BC3 fittings which are similar to the traditional bayonet fitting but with an extra pin. The result is that these BC3 bulbs (made by only a few companies) cost around \u00a310 a bulb whereas the standard energy efficient bulbs (which many people are now using) cost as little as \u00a31.\n\nThis seems like a very unfair situation and means that it is actually cheaper to replace the fitting and bulb when needed rather than just the bulb.",
