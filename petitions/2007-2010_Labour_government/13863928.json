        "background": "The touting of tickets for musical concerts in the UK has for too long been overlooked. Whilst the Glastonbury Festival should be commended for it's use of photo ID to prohibit the resale of tickets by those whose only desire is to make an undeserved profit for themselves, every other event in the United Kingdom is still open to such enterprises. \n Ticket Touting does not damage the profits of Music Venues or the Artists who are performing. The people who lose money to this trade are genuine fans. We all deserve the freedom to attend these events without having to pay an unofficial third party two or three times the normal ticket price.",
