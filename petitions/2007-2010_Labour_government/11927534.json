Speed is not the only contributing factor in road traffic accidents, but is the only issue cameras can ever detect. \n\nWe, the undersigned, believe this scheme should be scrapped. \n\nIf there is money available for schemes to cut road deaths, it would be better spent on employing more traffic police and driver education.",
