            "background": "At present we allow commercial banks the huge privilege of creating money out of nothing as their own property for their own benefit. You and I can\u2019t do it. Why let the banks do it? They do it by issuing loans of money which didn't exist until the borrower signs a promise to pay it back. Then the bank sells that agreement to a dealer for real money up front. We don't need to depend on banks for our nation's money supply. Let\u2019s make the Bank of England, acting as a public servant, the sole creator of new money in our land. Then our money would be an asset of the nation as a whole not the property of commercial banks. This practice caused the credit crunch. Banks lent to people who couldn't repay because it wasn\u2019t costing them much in the first place. It's why bankers get bonuses. The problem isn't bonuses. It\u2019s the activity that the bonuses encourage ie getting people to borrow. Don't nationalise the banks. Let them compete but don\u2019t let them create money out of nothing as they do now.",
