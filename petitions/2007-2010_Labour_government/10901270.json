            "background": "The youths of today find crime to be fun. They have no respect for authority and when they are finally caught and sentenced, it is never enough to prevent them from repeating their actions. However if the prisons were a hell on earth like America's, then they would be scared into behaving. This would also save money which is so badly needed in these times. I am under 21, i have never commited a crime, i believe in justice and i have nothing but respect for higher authority. I have never met someone else who could say that. This should change.",
