            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We want the Prime Minister to stop the proposed march in March 2010 by the ISLAM4UK extremists through the town of Wootton Bassett.  It is used as a highway to show the UK's respects to our fallen servicemen through the Iraq and Afghan conflicts. This proposed march by Islam4UK will incite a national outcry if is not stopped. ISLAM4UK can march anywhere they want to in the UK but have chosen this peaceful and prominent focal point for the repatriation of fallen service men and women. Choosing Wootton Basset has caused nationwide offence and outrage from all ethnic backgrounds.  Read their website and see if their proposed march is for their fallen or if it is to cause racial tension in the UK.  ISLAM4UK is an extremist Islamic Group headed by Anjem Choudray, who was behind the protests during the Summer of '09 when service men came back from Iraq.  Nothing was done to stop that march, look at the public outcry!!  If this march goes ahead the Prime Minister could have the possibility of heightened racial tension and trouble.  Is this the way we want our country to be?  Let Islam4UK have their march, but somewhere they don\u2019t cause offence and meaningful to them....not Wootton Bassett.",
