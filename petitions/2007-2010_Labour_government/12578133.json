            "background": "In today's society, health and safety is a good thing, to some extent. However, it seems to be increasingly used  more and more to be an excuse for reducing costs, mainly by accountants and insurance companies. It seems common sense is being lost to over the top health and safety legislation and instead of making jobs easier and quicker to complete, jobs are taking longer and with a increase of cost due to over the top health and safety legislation and risk assessments. \nBring back common sense and let health and safety officers do their job, instead of accountants and insurance companies. We ask the Prime Minister to review the current Health and Safety legislation and to make changes, where necessary, to reduce the unnecessary, over the top sections of the legislation.\nThank you.",
