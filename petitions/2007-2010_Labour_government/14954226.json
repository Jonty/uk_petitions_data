She would know. And proving Ms.Maggie Thatcher right, the power lies in how one uses the mind to conceive changes that often impact the lives of millions. Anyway, the undersigned feels privileged when was asked to re-edit the petition on 05/03/2010, even though, he is not a British citizen or resident. He might have never even dreamt that petition into the same subject would be asked by your kindself to re-edit. This is indicative of UK's liberal outlook and support to the freedom of individuals. However, as a last resort to recover the dues, I would like to re-edit hereby in the same issue that the power of remittance is laying into the hands UK National Lottery department. If the Government of UK is compelling enough to instruct this department to remit the lottery outstanding, not only warding of the rejected petition but also the whole issue may, quite literally, be clear.\n \nThanks,\n \nMukesh Kumar,",
