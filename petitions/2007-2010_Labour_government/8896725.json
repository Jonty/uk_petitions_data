One being Bad Taste Bears. These Bears are a integral part of British society and have fans all over the world. If these Bears disappear, then so will the livelyhood of all the people behind them, I know it is a small industry, but an important one no matter what and Government should be prepared to save Piranha Studios if The Administration fails to see a way forward. Save Our Bad Taste Bears!",
