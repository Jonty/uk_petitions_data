        "background": "As of this week we have learned that Piranha Studios has been placed into Administration and the future is uncertain of the products they provide. One being Bad Taste Bears. These Bears are a integral part of British society and have fans all over the world. If these Bears disappear, then so will the livelyhood of all the people behind them, I know it is a small industry, but an important one no matter what and Government should be prepared to save Piranha Studios if The Administration fails to see a way forward. Save Our Bad Taste Bears!",
