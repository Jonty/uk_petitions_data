How dare they, we are here struggling and have to pay our own bills and everything else ourselves but they can use our money and get away with it.\nWhen you look at it there stealing from us, they have already used our taxes to bail the banks now there being greedy and using the money for their luxuries. I think that everyone should not vote at all as it is a waste of time, all the parties say vote us were not like that but there all the same GREED is all there about they don\u2019t think about the real people us voters, they only care about us when its voting time once they have your vote they couldn\u2019t care less about us.\nAll the parties have done a crime and yet no one is paying for their crimes, its like famous people when they do a crime they just get away with. What is the world coming to, we the public should not be paying for their mistakes, why should we. \nPlease sign this so they don\u2019t get away with it again. We have a right to be angry it is disgusting what they are doing.",
