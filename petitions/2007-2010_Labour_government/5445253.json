This includes students who are unable to get the grades required for a particular course. There needs to be courses in place to allow students who have the passion but not academic ability to achieve their potential.",

            "background": "This petition should be read by everyone who is going through the university process, like me or by those who have children going through it. I believe that there should be access courses available for students who have the passion, motivation and dedication to do a particular career yet are unable to achieve the A level grades needed for it. I believe that more children from state schools should be given this opportunity to go to a top rated university and especially those who have parents who have not gone onto higher education.",
