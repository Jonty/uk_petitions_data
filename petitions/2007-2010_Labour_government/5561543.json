            "background": "Why should HM Forces personnel have to pay tax on their pensions once they have left the service?\n\nAll service personnel sign up to serve their Queen and country.  This could mean being sent to war!!!!!! This happens because the goverment wants to ensure peace in the world and in the UK.\nWe want peace to, thats why we join the Army, RAF or Navy.  \n\n\n\nWHY DO YOU TAX OUR PENSIONS WHEN WE HAVE SERVED OUR COUNTRY TO EARN IT?  ITS DISCRACEFUL AND WRONG. \n\nPLEASE SIGN THIS PETITION IF YOU CARE ABOUT OUR SERVICE PERSONNEL.  THE GOVERMENT SHOULD NOT TAX HM FORCES PENSIONS.  Thank you.",
