We bring the cessation of trading of these two companies to your attention as we believe there is a possibility of fraudulant activity, and the adverse effect upon our livlihoods, in the hope that you can speak out for us. \n\nWe ask that you bring to justice those that have abused their positions in running these companies, have returned what we have paid without receiving adequate training or mentoring, and have the law amended to protect others in the future from such abuse. \n\nSigned",
