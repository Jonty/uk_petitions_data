        "background": "It is shown that the civil service/government agencies/departments are not capable of replacing the Family Law system. Instead of enhancement with primary legislation of the family law courts/system the legislature has undermined the 'family' in the UK and the courts. To the extent that the youth of this country is demonstrating that 'the welfare of the child' is not paramount in their eyes. Parliament has overseen the destruction of the 'family' children are lacking primary guardianship the function of the courts and our next generation is suffering as a consquence.Too much violence as the children feel they are of no worth and lack the support of the adults in parliament/courts/social services/police/CSA in fact all our agencies.\n\nPlease vote to support this because all our children are at risk everyday of the week.\n\nIts very indicative that Family/children are not a category can't be important to this government\n\nDenise Rowley",
