        "background": "The Acts of Union 1707 allows Scotland to be seperated from the rest of the UK by many ways, the Scottish parliament further increases this problem. MSPs are allowed to vote on matters concerning only the rest of Britain whilst MPs are not able to vote on matters concerning only Scotland. Scotland benefits from a different law system and superior drugs are available on the NHS. University education and elderly care are free in Scotland, while the rest of Britain is charged. All this occurs while the GDP per capita of scotland is nearly \u00a31,500 less than the rest of Britain.",
