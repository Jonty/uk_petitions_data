Much taxpayers money is being abused here. Act very urgently.\n\ng) Control and accurately monitor what is being paid to Immigrants in certain cases. Much abuse goes on here.\n\nh) Scrap winter heating payments to all pensioners; means test it instead so that only those that need it get it.\n\nAs you know, the list here could be much longer,.....\nGovernment:please act on incidence of tax-funded wastage that has been pointed out to you.",
