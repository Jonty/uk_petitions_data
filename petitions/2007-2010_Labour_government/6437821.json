            "background": "Royal Marines Base Chivenor is a British military base used primarily by the Royal Marines. It is situated on the northern shore of the Taw estuary, adjacent to the South West Coast Path, on the North coast of Devon, England.\n\nOriginally a civil airfield opened in the 1930s, the Royal Air Force took over the site in May of 1940 for use as a Coastal Command Station, calling it RAF Chivenor.\n\nI would like to see Civil Flying return to Chivenor. THis would be very popular with Aviation Enthusiasts all over the country and it could also boost tourism in the area and bring money in to the local economy.",
