They are just projections of the vocal chords, they aren't really anything else. What seperates f*** from darn? If someone is saying it to offend someone, then it should be just as bad as the word idiot. There is no point in making words worse than others. As far as I'm concerned, curses should be expressions of frustration and offensive swears normal insults. There should be no up of an age rating just because they say c**t.",
