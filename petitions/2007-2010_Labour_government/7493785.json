            "background": "Since the time of Richard I the British society has actively promoted the beliefs of the Christian faith. This is now being eroded by those PC officials who are scared of upsetting those of other faiths that decide the UK is the place they wish to live. Those who wish to celebrate Christianity are now being told they cannot \"put up decorations\" in town centres in case they upset the MINORITY faiths. Time to redress the balance and actively promote Christianity in Britain I think.",
