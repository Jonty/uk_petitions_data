        "background": "The people of the United Kingdom have been kept in the dark for quite long enough about the European Union and it's aims. However, over the last couple of years, many of these aims have come to light, not least that it's end goal is \"economic and political union\". In the 1970s the people of Britain voted to enter a trading agreement, not the opaque, supranational beaurocracy that the EU has become. It is time the people of the United Kingdom were allowed their say on where this is all heading.",
