        "background": "I believe that poeple aged 16 - 18 should not pay adult fares on public transport. People aged 16-18 should only have to pay child fares as they are still not officially an adult. The legal age to be an official adult is 18. So why do we have to pay adult fares from the age of 16 when we are not legally an adult. It is totally unfair. Even when you get fined for having a child ticket at the age of 16 you still have to put your parent/guardian down on the slip as you are not an adult yet! So if it says your not an adult on the fine slip then why should we have to pay an adult rate. It dosen't make sence.  If you agree with this, then help us to fight and help us win. The only way we can do this is with your help. So to show your support please join this petition and get as many people as possible to join it, We seriously need as many people as we can get!",
