            "background": "We would like to see the balance of power shift from the criminal to law-abiding members of society. From zero-tolerance of anti-social behavior to the death penalty for violent crimes and crimes against children, we need to put fear back into the mind of a potential criminal. Convicts (including young perpetrators of anti-social behavior) should be made to work on state infrastructure (U.S. Chain gang style) like roads and rail with long sentences, individuals convicted of sex attacks on children should be castrated after very very long sentences, the list goes on. We should consider that convicts have chosen to opt out of their human rights, etc. and sentences are some of the most harsh in the world. In other words, we want to be seen to be intolerant of criminals.",
