            "background": "As a single parent currently working but in reciept of tax credits I am finding it extremly difficult to heat my home. My home heating consists of one gas fire in the living room and one in the hall way. None of my other rooms have any form of heating at all. My daughter is always complaining on how cold she is especially in yet another cold grip. I do not rent accomodation, however currently pay a morgage. Surley in the 21st century people should not be living in this counrty in such poor heating conditions. I have hunted every web site and spoken to so many people about this and they say the same thing. Unless I am over 60 or in reciept of further benifits no one can help me. Are there no pockets of grants that can assist me heat the inside of my house?",
