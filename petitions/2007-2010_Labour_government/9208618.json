            "background": "For years guinea pigs have worked tirelessly to help mankind and I think that it is high time that we gave them something back. They should have equal rights, that is, the right to vote, the right to an education, the right to employment benefits and minimum wage etc. Guinea pigs have always worked hard for this country, guinea pigs built this country. They drive the taxis, collect the rubbish bins, deliver the post, design and make cheap electrical products, this country couldn\u2019t run without them, they are the backbone of Britain. Guinea pigs are remarkable creatures. They are highly intelligent, fast learners and very adaptable. They possess many rare and useful skills that mankind require. This is just one more reason why we must give them equal rights. The skills and knowledge that they have can help humanity no end.",
