Mediumship and healing are the associated practices of the spiritual philosophy of Spiritualism. \n\nThe Repeal of the Witchcraft Act and its replacement with the Fraudulent Mediums Act was a response to the original Freedom Campaign of the last century. The new Freedom Campaign is in response to the lack of any consultation over the Repeal of the Fraudulent Mediums Act and in recognition that spiritual workers of the 21st Century deserve recognition and protection from discrimination.",
