            "background": "The background for this issue is that gradual tree \"back planting\" of uplands and field perimeters will enhance oxygen quality, increase the world's carbon sink, provide shelter for domestic animals and increased habitat for indigenous species.\n\nIt is important to join this petition because it is the lynch pin to green house gases and protection of species issues. Governments can change laws regarding use of land by building in \"protected zone\" covenants applicable to all agricultural and industrial use. Such environmental laws could be imposed on existing land users by way of initial grant funding to initiate and encourage replanting. New conveyances would include the new environmental laws as mandatory legislation\n\nPresidents and prime ministers are reluctant to include policys that may be detrimental to votes into their party manifesto. This is why media reporting on the issue of replanting as a solution is scarce.This petition provides the answer.",
