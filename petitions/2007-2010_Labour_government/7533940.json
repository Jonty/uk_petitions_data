This achivement went virtual un-noticed in the UK press, even though 125,000 people attended Brands Hatch to see him win his first double race win. \n\nHe is now moving on to MotoGP for new challenges and prove himself against the some of the best riders in the world.\n\nJames is our best hope of success in the elite class since Barry Sheene.\n\nI think James' achievements so far should be recognised by those outside of the biking community.",
