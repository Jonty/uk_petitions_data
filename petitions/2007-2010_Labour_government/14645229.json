            "background": "Do you think it is fair that the uk drivers should fit the bill for damage to our vehicals when damage is caused by pot holes in our roads. \nhow to use our car tax, there are a number of people unemployed wanting to work, looking to people who have been unemployed for over 3 years,(giving people jobs gives them pride) having an instant work force, cutting the costs of road repair, but would speed up the issue of rough roads. using the companies that already repair our roads and asking them to help manage this mammoth task working alongside the transport minister and also employ a larger workforce at a more cost effective way to the tax payers. if you agree please sign my petition please.",
