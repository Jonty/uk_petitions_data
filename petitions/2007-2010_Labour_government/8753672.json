As far as I can tell, for those petitions that receive a Government response, the response is invariably along the lines of \"Thank you for your interest in this petition...we understand your point of view but will continue to do as we were going to do anyway.\"\n\nWhilst I did originally consider this site to be an excellent idea, in it's present incarnation it seems to be little more than a gimmick.  In an age of high levels of voter apathy and disillusionment with the Government, I'm curious as to whether you could give me some examples of where public opinion has had any significant effect on Government policy.",
