Women, children and elderly are dying as a direct result of the aerial bombardment.\nThere has been increased violence in Sri Lanka following the capture of Tamil territory. On Thursday January 8th 2009, Lasantha Wickramatunga, the editor of a leading Sunday newspaper, was shot dead in Colombo. A few days prior to Wickramatunga\u2019s death, gunmen armed with grenades stormed into the offices of the largest private TV broadcaster in the country.\nMore than 70,000 people have died in this violent conflict. This number will only continue to rise in light of recent events.",
