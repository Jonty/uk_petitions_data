            "background": "Mps have patently been taking tax free money on fraudulent expenses for donkeys years. We have paid for their sisters flat, for their moat to be cleaned, for every house they have bought and sold for a profit and they have the cheek to ask us for 21% or 40% of our income per annum. We are told it's paying for the National Health Service, Education, The Emergency Services, Highway Maintenance, Defence of the Nation etcetera.\n     It is our view that they have no mandate any more to demand money from the hard-working citizens of this nation. Therefore we should be given a one month tax free break where income tax will not be charged on any working citizen of this nation. Then maybe our government can make up the shortfall and only then could a line be drawn under your fraudulent and undemocratic ways.",
