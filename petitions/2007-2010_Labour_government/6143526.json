This medal is designed to recognize their peace keeping role and is the same medal as was awarded to troops immediately after the Taliban were deposed. The current campaign can be considered to be anything but a Peace keeping role with our troops currently facing a 1 in 36 chance of dying during a 6 month deployment in Helmand province. Their bravery and loyalty deserves recognition above and beyond  that awarded in general and individual acts of bravery.",
