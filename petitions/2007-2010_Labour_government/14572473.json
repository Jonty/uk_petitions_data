        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Usually couples come to surrogacy after experiencing an awful lot of heartache, having been unable to have a child themselves. This pain is only added to by the fact that there is no legal requirement for employers to provide the same parental rights to them as to parents who become a family without the help of a surrogate. Many parents through surrogacy are thus forced to leave their jobs and / or are not provided with the support from their employers that others receive. It is time that this gap in the law is redressed, by providing the same rights to parents through surrogacy as for parents through biological parenthood or adoption.",
