        "background": "The 48-hour opt out means that employees can agree to work over the maximum working week of 48 hours.  This is however often seen as a compulsory requirement on accepting a job offer. The UK opt out of the European 48-hour regulation means that some employees work exploitative hours of 55-65+, with very little or no compensation (either financial or lieu time) for these additional hours.  Please sign this petition to get rid of the UK 48-hour opt out.",
