        "background": "Dr Hans Koechler, UN observer at the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial, has described Mr al-Megrahi's conviction as a \"spectacular miscarriage of justice\". If, as now seems inevitable, the Libyan's conviction is overturned on appeal, Libya will be exonerated and a new investigation is going to be required.\n\nApartheid South Africa is the prime alternative suspect for the Lockerbie bombing - see Wikipedia article \"South Africa luggage swap theory\".\n\nWe understand that, when Libya takes its seat at the UN Security Council in January 2008, there will be calls for an immediate United Nations Inquiry into the death of UN Commissioner for Namibia, Bernt Carlsson, in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. The other 14 UNSC members - including Britain - should support such an Inquiry and nominate Dr Koechler to conduct it.",
