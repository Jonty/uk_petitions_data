            "background": "Recent media coverage of the trial of the mother of \"Baby P\" and her lover for the torture and murder of this young child, has horrified the nation. Not only did this child endure unimaginable suffering before his death; shockingly he suffered it at the hands of those who ought to have been his protectors, his guardians.\n\nBritish citizens should not be expected to pay for the upkeep of people who can scarcely be regarded as human. They are unfit to take their place in our society, and nor should they ever rejoin it.\n\nIt is time for the reinstatement of the death penalty for crimes against the most vulnerable members of society:\n\nCrimes such as paedophilia and child murder should be punishable by death.",
