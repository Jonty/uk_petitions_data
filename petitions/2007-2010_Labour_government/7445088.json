            "background": "On Thursday Gillian Gibbons was sentenced to 15 days in prison for allowing a 7 year old child to call a teddy bear mohammed, which the Sudanese claim is an insult to the prophet Muhammed. Firstly Gillian herself did not name the teddy bear herself the 7 year old named it after himself? Surely this is a cultral misunderstanding. Dr Muhammed Abul Bari from the muslim council of britain says \"they have grossly overreacted in this sad affair\" Amnest International say \"they consider her to be a international prisnor of conscience\" and Catherine Wolthuizen of the fair trials abroad say\" there was no intent on her part and a number of people here and in sudan have said the same\" Sudanese immigrants in this country are not treated in this way and receive fair trials the Goverment need to make it known in the strongest possible terms that they will not tolerate uk citizens being treated in this manner when abroad.",
