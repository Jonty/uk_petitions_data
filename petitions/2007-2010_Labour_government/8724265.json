        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The fulminance of mysoginistic murderers and the everpresent threat to children posed by paedophile killers, makes Britain an unsafe place for women and children,who are exposed to sexually motivated violence.As many of these grave offences are serial in occurrence,and with no evidence of remorse,it is clear that the perpetrators are beyond the pale when it comes to the concept of rehabilitation.In this regard the concept of rehabilitative justice is an unsuitable model for this type of criminal.Given that rehabilitative justice is a suitable model for the majority of those who occupy our prisons,therefore there is no place in our prisons for individuals who chose crimes which are intolerant of Society and outside the realms of our principles of justice,these un-rehabilitative prisoners should be automatic candidates for execution given that a large majority of the U.K. population would wish to see the death penalty reinstituted for certain categories of crime",
