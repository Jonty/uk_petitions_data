            "background": "the british armed forces has a current force in total of about 250,000 men now in the past 6 years of operations in afganistan we have lost 232 men from all over the country aswell as expierence equipment shortages and a huge civilan loss plus it makes the extremists even more eager to detonate bombs in our own countries!!!!!\n\nwe are hugly in favour of withdrawing the troops as we have found many reasons for this:\n\n1. no loss of life\n2. money can be spent better\n3. people will be more happy\n4. the armed forces can prepare for the future\n5. the homeland will have better security if all the armed forces are home\n6. many countries will be more happier\n\nbut there are also bad reason's:\n1. afganistan as a country would properly collasped\n2. terrorism could spread\n3. the armed forces might get less expierence\n4. there may still be civilan deaths\n5. the west may return\n\nbut we have also thought about other solutions:\n1. leaving a 400 - 700 strong peace keeping force\n2. getting better support from other strong economic forces\n3. spending more money on the armed forces\n4. sending a possible SAS (Special Air Service) force to eliminate specific commanders of extremists",
