        "background": "The Elderly Mentally Infirm (EMI) Unit at Glastonbury Court in Bury St Edmunds is a shining example of innovative care for the elderly who suffer from Dementia, Alzheimers, and other challenging conditions. This specialist unit excels because it combines the expertise of 6 qualified mental health nurses who work in partnership with Social Services employed care workers. The combination has provided a loving, safe, caring, and comfortable home for vulnerable members of society who can no longer care for themselves. Suffolk CC intends to close the unit in October \u2013with roughly 11 weeks\u2019 notice- and \u2018place\u2019 the 19 residents elsewhere; a disturbance that may be their death sentence.  And why? \u2013 could it be because of a pending review of all Suffolk Care Homes? Is it better to rid the system of a one-off and undoubtedly difficult unit first, thus making the remaining package of homes more attractive to sell? Glastonbury Court is a success story and example for the future, which should be duplicated not shut - will this happen near you soon?",
