            "background": "In Sweden advertisments aimed at chldren are considered unacceptable and are banned for children under 12. Greece has a ban on advertisements for children's toys between 7 am and 10 pm and a total ban on advertisement for war toys. In Addition,  research by advertising agencies confirms that children's personal preferences can be targeted and changed by TV advertising, this can then influence family dynamics.  Furthermore, research has found the media can isolate and shape children's preferences for life styles, subcultures, toys, food and drink at different ages. Reinforcement of these values occurs when they are fed back to them in advertisments. Children exposed to advertising are indoctrinated with attitudes about particular lifestyles, desires and needs; how products are supposed to make them feel.  Commercial companies don't have children's well-being in mind; only profits.  The UK should lead the way in advertising reform for the EU and introduce laws designed to protect our children from the detrimental affects of advertising.",
