            "background": "Dr. Ioan Davies has been a senior figure within the Medical School at the University of Manchester, and is currently the co-ordinator for Phase 1 of the course. Not only is he dedicated to the role, but also helps and inspires students to do their best academically. This has a direct implication on the future of healthcare in the Greater Manchester area; those students who do well will have a better chance at becoming better doctors, and therefore healthcare in the area's where they practice will be improved in that respect. \n\nDr Davies has also been a key figure at the University in research of Degenerative Medicine, and his contributions have included many publications. His work at the Medical School is yet to be properly appreciated, and I think there is no better person to receive this recognition than him.",
