        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Science and mathematics are essential for education and the national economy.\n\nTiered GCSEs in these subjects pressure schools to select borderline children at 13 years old for the lower levels to get the 'safe C' - a grade less than D at the higher level is a fail.\n\nThe different tiers take different exams but successful lower-tier students often find they can't study science or mathematics at A-level.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with streaming but all children should sit the same exam with the easier questions at the beginning.  Students who catch up or get extra tuition can try the harder questions can then get the higher grades.\n\nThis covert 13+ places a big strain on teachers, is insulting to the children, discourages technical careers and disadvantages them in the jobs market when compared to overseas applicants.  \n\nWe rightly abolished the 11+ many years ago but in these key subjects we have put something insidiously worse.\n\nPlease instruct the CQA and boards to change.  Tier the exam, not the syllabus!  It will make it much easier to administer and much fairer to the students.",
