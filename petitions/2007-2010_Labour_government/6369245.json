            "background": "On 5 July 2007, the Rt Hon John Denham announced an increase in the threshold of household income by which students become entitled to a maintenance (non-repayable) grant. Students whose household income is below \u00a325,000 can now claim the full grant (previous threshold \u00a317,500), and students whose household income falls below \u00a360,000 are eligible for a partial grant (previous threshold \u00a337,500).\n\nHowever a clause in his statement reads \u2018The new arrangements come into effect from the academic year 2008/09; they apply only to full-time undergraduates who start university in 2008. Students already in the system continue to have access to the improved package of support introduced in 2006\u2019\n\nThis means that 2006 & 2007 entrants whose household income lies between \u00a325,000 and \u00a345,000 will be between \u00a3700 and \u00a31,100 a year worse off than their counterparts who start their courses in 2008 (These statistics are available on the governments' own website).",
