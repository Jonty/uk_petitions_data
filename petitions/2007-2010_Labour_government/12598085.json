Such nonsense should be corrected at the ISP level with the correct Commonwealth English version of the word, as enjoyed in Gentlemens' clubs up and down this fair isle.\n\nLiteracy is essential for us to become the world leader in the technology industry. If you continue to tolerate this text speak menace, Britain will soon become an isle of simpletons, unable to even compete in World Snooker, let alone in the global economy.",
