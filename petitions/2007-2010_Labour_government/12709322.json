        "background": "Every Wednesday, Thursday and Friday I get on 4 buses throughout the day and on at least one of these buses will be someone playing music through their mobile phones without the use of headphones. Not only is this annoying for other passengers, it lacks thought and consideration for other people. I have had enough of this and something needs to be done about this anti-social activity! So if you have also had enough of this, then sign the petition and lets try and put an end to it!",
