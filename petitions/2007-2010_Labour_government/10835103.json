Under his leadership this business made some of the most ridiculous decisions which ultimately has cost the jobs of thousands of ordinary hard-working individuals with mortgages to pay and families to feed.  He did not have the skills required to run a financial institution nor does he have the skills required to run our Tourist Industry.",
