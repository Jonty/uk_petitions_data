            "background": "Babies and children need feeding regularly.  Many mothers feel intimidated about feeding their child in public spaces, and are often subjected to bullying and harassment, and demands the feed be stopped and they leave the premises or public space in which the child is feeding.  We ask that all children, and their caregivers, be given protection to allow them to be fed milk, regardless of type of milk, feeding method and location.  Make it a specific offence to interfere or ask the feed be stopped.  Babies and children deserve protection, as do their caregivers.",
