        "background": "We believe that Northumbria Police over-reacted.  Sunderland supporters were injured when not posing a threat to themselves, others or the police.\n\nWe say the accusations made by Northumbria Police and the subsequent investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commision (IPCC) was too quick and incomplete.\n\nNo eye-witnesses were interviewed before the judgement and the actions of the IPCC have already prejudiced the result of any further inquiry.\n\nWe therefore call for a full independent inquiry to take place and published detailing the full facts of this incident.",
