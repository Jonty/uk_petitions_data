            "background": "it is the fact that a detetion in uk schools is basically making us stay in a room and not allowed out. breaching our human right to be freedom of movement and of speech.(section 24 paragraphs 4 and 5) and i propose a solution of exchanging detetions for extra questions to homework. meaning they can catch up and it is not depriving us of any time as it is just adding a say extra 2-3minutes on top of a normal homework day. and that heads of departments and heads of years can put essays for the subject if they continue to persist in disrupting lessons o missing homework. this question must be answered to the best if the persons ability. if this rule goes to my action plans 19 and 20 step they are suspension then exclusion. this is per lesson per week. so it is reset for all people and lessons after the friday end of school. teachers simply pick a couple of extra harder questions to do. if this question is wrong it does not matter, as long as the effort is shown equally and fairly. \n\nthank you for reading and please sign asap please thank you",
