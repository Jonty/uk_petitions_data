It may be many weeks before the case reaches trial, if ever, as many cases collapse before doing so, but the damage is done. The person making the false allegation remains anonymous and is almost never prosecuted for perverting the course of justice, the accused may never recover, or may be murdered by a lynch mob fomented by media hysteria over the severity of the allegations. In the interests of justice, fairness and basic human rights, I call on the government to treat the accuser and accused equally by granting anonymity to both until completion of the trial process. If found guilty, then he can be named. If found  innocent then he should never be named. I believe in innocent until proven guilty, don't you?",
