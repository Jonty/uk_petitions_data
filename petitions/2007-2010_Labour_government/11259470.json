            "background": "As parents of four beautiful children, over the last 3 years it has become a world in which we can not take our children to see santa at christmas and sit on his knee instead with all the new laws in place our children have to stand next to santa like a spare part. The christmas spirit is no longer there and the build up to christmas is no longer exciting. If the santas we hire have had the relative crb checks then why should sitting on his knee be such a problem when it has been done as tradition for many years. We as parents take our children and they aren't left alone in a room with them. Please help us to bring back sitting on santas knee!",
