            "background": "Britain of late has introduced wave after wave of repressive and illegal legislation.(under most international human rights treaties which we have signed and ratified) ASBO's, Control Orders, Curfews, Section 44, The ban on protest around parliament. All of the following are repugnant and completely against what the nation was built on (namely the rule of law and equality under it). These should be repealed immediately and if the response to this petition is to state the 'necessity' of these laws for the defense of the nation, I would also appeal to the government to search their brains for the sense to understand which is more important; short term (debatable) safety or the long term survival of our previously great (uncodified) constitution.",
