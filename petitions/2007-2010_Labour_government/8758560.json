            "background": "Parliament is where all the major decisions concerning our society are made so where better to protest? Disallowing citizens to protest in particular places is an infringement of our right to freedom of expression. The Government use the over-practised excuse that it is to protect us against terrorism but surely it is just as easy for a 'terrorist' to simply walk past and throw a bomb over the fence? The actual reason for the ban on protests outside Westminster is that MP's found it irritating. I rally you who value your basic human rights to challenge this and petition for our basic right to freedom of expression.",
