        "background": "The NHS is being overstretched by a public  who call for lower taxes, yet more expensive treatments they know little about. Politicians are not helping to solve the issue by generally backing up what has been said by people about desire for treatments that are ridiculously expensive for little gain, especially surrounding cancer, the publics greatest enemy as some would have it. We the undersigned ask the prime minister to take the logical approach, and to put the spending of tax payers money in the NHS to those who are most qualified to make such judgements - the medical staff themselves.",
