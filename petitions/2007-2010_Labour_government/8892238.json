            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The Government has failed to encourage and demand the rapid deployment of new technology in building standards to reduce the carbon footprint of the UK's building stock for new builds or to provide sufficient grants, or tax breaks for existing housing/buildings to be corrected. The Government has also given Aviation more taxation leeway in addressing Climate Change than the taxation levied against motorists who have no choice but to use cars to work and contribute to society. These motorists continue to need cars because the Government has not provided public transport systems outside of London that are connective or affordable.\nLegislation should be enacted to introduce movement sensors in all public and commercial buildings after the end of normal business hours to ensure that energy is not used to  light buildings that are not in use.",
