            "background": "At present, fathers can take Paternity Leave for 2 weeks at the reduced rate of Statutory Paternity Pay. Many fathers are either taking this leave and are struggling to pay bills at a time when their lives can seem more stressful than ever, or they are not taking any leave whatsoever and missing out on crucial bonding with their newborn and with the mother of their child.\n\nI propose that the Statutory Paternity Pay should be amended so that fathers receive full pay for 3 days once their child is born and then the 2 weeks following this is given as optional for those wishing to spend more time with their loved ones. I think this can be deemed as reasonable by employers and employees alike.",
