            "background": "Peter Andre (who is my inspiration as well as my cousin) is an international pop icon. He was born in the UK and has helped the UK economy to thrive over the last 15-ish years due to the millions and millions of record sales he has racked-up due to his talent of fusing hip-hop, pop, R&B and ballads whilst not alienating his legions of fans. Peter should be recognised by his home country for helping the UK record industry to thrive and deserves to be made a knight of the realm for all the above achievements. Thank you for reading, and please sign my petition so that together we can turn Peter into Sir Peter Andre.\n\nThanks,\n\nAndre Andre.",
