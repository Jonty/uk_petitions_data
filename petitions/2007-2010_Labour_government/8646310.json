            "background": "There exists an option open to Government to sell the Northern Rock now it has been nationalized and redeem its record for fiscal prudence. This would immediately remove all need of Government subsidies, guarantees and financial support. The 6,000 Northern Rocks jobs would be secure and the shareholder litigation avoided together with potential EU fines. Since each UK resident has a circ. \u00a35,000 at stake in this banks future it is inappropriate that the panacea is being ignored.",
