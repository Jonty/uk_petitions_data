            "background": "The congestion charge idea was not good enough. People refused it because to many people would be charged unfairly.\nHowever the transport system in Manchester must be improved at all cost. I suggest that the government finds another way to raise the money for improvements. The current state of affairs is just no acceptable because the buses trams and trains stop running far to early on Saturday when so many people are in Manchester enjoying them selfs after a hard week at work.\n\nNot only do we need trams trains and buses to run for longer hours but we also need more tram destinations, more buses and more trains.\n\nDuring rush hour our buses trams and trains take far more passengers than the safety limits.\n\nImprovements are drastically needed as soon as possible especially when considering the increasing population of our city.\nMore and more people use our public transport every day. One way or another we must have improvements soon before the situation gets critical.",
