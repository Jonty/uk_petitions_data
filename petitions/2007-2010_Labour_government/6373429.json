One has no objection to anyone joining the housing list, this being the legal process in each locality. The present situation will cause resentment towards incomer, thus creating more strife and violence in our towns.The action appears to be unjust discrimination against those who have waited patiently while also contributing to the local economy, in many cases for years.The childless couples seem to have little if any consideration. There is a need for a just and moral  law for all.",
