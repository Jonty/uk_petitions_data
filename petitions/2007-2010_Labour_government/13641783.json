I would have liked to have paid!  Reason: The NHS is not set up to accept payment from anyone.  \n\nThe NHS cannot be expected to treat every visitor for free.  When British citizens go abroad they buy health insurance.  Why does this not work the other way round?\n\nMillions or even Billions could be saved here!  There are over 1 million expats alone never mind the foreigners who travel to UK for this free treatment.",
