        "action": "enforce that Cambridge City Council are to make ample land available for all recognised independent punt operators to continue to work on their traditional stretch of the River Cam, and to recognise the rich history that independent punt operators bring to Cambridge. Moreover, we ask the Council to realise that a virtual punt monopoly by the Scudamores Punt Company kills fair competition and prevents tourists and Cambridge residents from alternative and often financially fairer tours of the heritage rich River Cam. Such a monopoly would be vindication of years of aggressive touting tactics by Scudamores, which has been misrepresented in the press, and allow the company to impose prices and conditions on tourists and residents without effective restriction.\"",
