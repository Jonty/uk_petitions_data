            "background": "The government has found a way of saving money by cancelling As and A level resit exams that were due to start on Monday 11 January 2009 by blaming the weather. I accept some young people will not be able to attend their school but those that can get there should be allowed to sit their exams and improve their long term career prospects. To put money savings first is wrong and blame the weather is unacceptable and shows a blatent disregard for the people who will support the country in the future. They should all resign now.",
