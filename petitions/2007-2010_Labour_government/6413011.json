        "background": "It should be law for horse owners, keepers, livery yard owners\n     etc to have third party liability insurance. If there is a road\n     accident caused by a horse bolting or getting out of a field a\n     horse should have an insurance that will automatically pay the\n     innocent party for any property damage the horse has caused and\n     any additional expenses such as car hire etc. If it is a horse\n     that caused the damage because a horse owner, keeper, livery\n     yard owner etc has chosen to take responsibility for the horse\n     it is them who should be held responsible regardless of being\n     negligent or not. You should not have to prove negligence to\n     claim liability. Negligence and damage are two separate issues.\n     A horse can do damage without anyone being negligent. However\n     someone has to pay the bills that result from such accidents.\n     Horses should have passports and insurance. It should be made\n     Law. This is not a vendetta against horses, horse owners,\n     keepers, livery yard owners etc but a realisation for the need\n     of fairness to innocent people being caught up in a accident\n     situation through no fault of their own ending up being the\n     ones to pay for it!",
