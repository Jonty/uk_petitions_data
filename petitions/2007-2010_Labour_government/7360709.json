            "background": "In January 2001, the tax on sanitary products was reduced from 17.5% to 5%, with the excuse that it cannot be reduced any further due to the fact that when Britain joined the EU in 1973 they signed an agreement not to extend 0% tax ratings to any products other than those already 0% rated at the end of 1975.\nHowever, massive advances not only in sanitary protection but also in equal rights have been made since then, and it is vastly unfair that there is essentially a tax on being a woman. We motion that sanitary products are a necessity (certainly NOT a \"luxury item\") and should be available tax-free, if not on the NHS.",
