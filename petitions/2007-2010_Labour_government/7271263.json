            "background": "The NGA has assumed the mantle of governors representative body without any evidence that its views represent the views of those it seeks to represent. Whilst most governors agree that league tables are not perfect, there is no evidence of widespread support for their ending.\n\nThe NGA has not consulted the wider governance community, especially on this matter, and without evidence to the contrary, its representations should be safely ignored. Many governors, and others including employers and many teachers, want to keep national testing as a the best available information model for parents to help in choosing their childrens schools.",
