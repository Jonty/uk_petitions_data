            "background": "BT are, from April, going to change the time that evening calls can be made - from 6pm to 7pm.  This will have knock-on effects of making families in the UK poorer, catching people out unfairly and setting an industry precedent whereby other telephone operators will follow.  In a time of unheard-of family debt, this is a poly profit from some of the poorest people in society who cannot afford the extra costs, the \"any-time\" tariffs or the 18 month minimum contracts.  This must be stopped.\n\n\nAs detailed here: http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2010/jan/29/bt-free-evening-calls-change",
