            "background": "This petition is to ask the Prime Minister to scrap TV licensing and force the BBC to rely on advertising revenue like all other TV channels. It is not the State's responsibility to provide television. \n\nIf there are educational or other special types of televised programmes that the Government want to support or ensure that people can watch, then they can subsidize the production of these programmes and through a fair tendering process find a private TV channel that would show it. This would be more cost effective for the UK tax payer.",
