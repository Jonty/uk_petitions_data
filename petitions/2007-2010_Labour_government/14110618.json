            "background": "This scheme is anti the UK\u2019s ambition to respect Human Dignity, it\u2019s against fair trading, only big businesses i.e. Tesco and Asda  benefit from the scheme, this stops small businesses participating. It\u2019s impractical and causes distress. Vouchers can\u2019t be used at launderettes, or on public transport (people have to walk great distances in order to obtain food and essentials) Participating businesses don\u2019t provide food which is religiously acceptable, and are expensive in terms of items for babies and children. People can\u2019t shop close by or participate in buying from charity shops or accessing recycled goods. Consequently users are in a situation similar to German Jews following the 1938 extension of the Nazi\u2019s Nuremburg laws i.e. recipients of vouchers can\u2019t use public  baths, go to the cinema, or use public transport, they\u2019re  only allowed to use certain shops. This is de-humanising and degrading, it ruins the UK\u2019s good name in terms of human rights, fairness and freedom.",
