        "background": "The Government should urgently review the current soft sentencing of offenders of crime and provide funding for the building of new prisons to house additional offenders. The current policy of early release and tagging of prisioners is unacceptable to society and victims of crime, and should be abolished. The policy of early release for good behaviour should also be scrapped, and all sentences should be served in full. A harsher sentencing regime generally should be adopted and the Government should liaise with countries that have adopted a tough stance on offending to establish how this could benefit the UK.",
