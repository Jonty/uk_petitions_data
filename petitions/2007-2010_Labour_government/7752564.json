            "background": "We call on the Government to drop plans to build a third runway, and/or a sixth terminal and/or get rid of runway alteration at Heathrow.  Expansion would bring in more road traffic to a heavily congested area.  With prevailing winds being south-westerly, arriving aircraft traverse a large part of London.  Flights start arriving soon after 4am.  Runway alternation allows a brief respite in the daytime for those under the flight path.  Kew Gardens is spoilt by overhead aircraft for half of every day.  London tourism will surely suffer if the aircraft blight grows.  We suggest that schoolchildren and service industries will be more productive if residents and visitors are allowed uninterrupted sleep.",
