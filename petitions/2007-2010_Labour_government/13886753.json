Apparently, it had been bought off an online buy and sell website. \n\nThe dog had been hardly fed, had worms and had lost most of its body fat before being rescued. \n\nThere needs to be MORE REGULATION, especially in relation to owning a dog.\n\nPlease sign this petition to STOP the sale of animals on buy and sell and auction style internet sites. \n\nAnimals can easily be bought from registered breeders or from the many recognised organisations, including the RSPCA, PDSA, The Dogs Trust, Battersea Dogs Home and registered breeders where animals can bought or taken to be re-homed and where prospective owners can at least be \"vetted\" for their suitability as owners.",
