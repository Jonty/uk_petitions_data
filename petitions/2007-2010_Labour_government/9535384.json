            "background": "The results of a medical research, published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology, said exposure led to inflammation and lesions from tiny fibres which are widely used because they are lightweight and strong may pose a similar health risk to asbestos, more hazardous than graphite.\n\nNanotubes have been used to make lightweight sports equipment, tear-resistant clothing and stronger concrete but tests on mice suggest that their widespread use could lead to mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the lungs, if the fibres are inhaled.\n\nSome prelude has already been given to this problem, by the recognition of falling sperm counts and rising prostate cancers. PM, don't let mankind be caught with their pants down !",
