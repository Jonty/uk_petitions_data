        "background": "since being diagnosed with breast cancer recently at the age of 36, whilst receiving treatment at the hospital i have become increasingly aware of the growing number of people of a similar age and much younger that have also had or have got it. i am aware that by the end of this year the age will be lowered to 47 but we feel that this is not young enough as the number of young people suffering with this has increased immensely. we feel that this is something that will generate a great deal of public backing and support.",
