What message does this send to everyone who take\u2019s part in this evil so called sport? \nThe poor dogs involved in these fights are seriously injured or even killed. Most become scared and aggressive. Something needs to be done now. Dog\u2019s don\u2019t have a voice but we do! Please sign the petition below.",
