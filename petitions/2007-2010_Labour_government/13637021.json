            "background": "My unborn baby died at 16 weeks after I contracted the 'Slapped Cheek' virus in my workplace (I am a Reception Class teacher).  Testing for immunity to this virus at the same time as testing for rubella (at my booking appointment) would have raised my awareness of the disease and informed me that my unborn child was at risk as i was not immune. Steps could then have been taken to reduce the risks of me being exposed to it. Unfortunately, a small number of children in my class presented with Slapped cheek and I knew nothing about it until it was too late! Pregnant women need more advice about this virus and the deadly affects that it can have. I write this in the hope that 'mothers to be' can be better informed in the future and not have to go through the anguish that i have suffered during my first pregnancy.",
