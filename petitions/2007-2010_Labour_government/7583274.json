Party whips have the power to instruct members on how to vote in the house and have the power to punish members who do not follow the party line. This petition is to remove the power of the whips to have this power when it comes to voting in the house, members should be able to represent the people who elected them and not be bullied into doing what their leader wishes if they believe that their constituents would disagree with the policy which is being voted on.",
