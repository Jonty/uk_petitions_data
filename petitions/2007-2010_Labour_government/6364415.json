            "background": "The energy giant E.ON has applied to build the first new coal-fired power plant in the UK for 33 years. Even before Medway Council has finished considering Eon\u2019s application, two more energy companies have joined the rush, saying they're going to build three new coal-fired power plants of their own. \n\nGiven what we now know about climate change, how can energy companies hope to stage a comeback for the most polluting of all fossil fuels in the most polluting of all sectors? \n\nWe the undersigned do not want coal power in Britain and believe that the response to climate change demands the use of renewable energies.",
