These spaces are there so we can get our pushchairs out safely and our children in them safely and also so we can get our children in and out of their carseats safely. We cannot do this if  we are not in the space. We put our children at risk because ignorant people keep taking our spaces!! \nThere should be tougher fines and employed people to do this job. This way the problem will lessen if not stop!",
