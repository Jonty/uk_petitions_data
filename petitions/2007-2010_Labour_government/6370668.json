            "background": "The RAF, hit the hardest by the last 17 years' cuts (cut by 16,000 people), which has less attack aircraft than the RAF Museum, needs to be properly funded. It needs:\n1) 330 more fighters (but please not Eurofighter EF-2000s!)\n2) 7 more AWACSes\n3) 220 strategic bombers and 220 nuclear warheads to provide a nuclear deterrent like the RN does\n4) Replace L-1011 tankers\nIt needs much more than 998 aircraft. The Russian AF, which now infiltrates British airspace every month, has 7000 planes of different sorts. The RAF also needs bases to park these planes, and to RETAIN RAF Lyneham, where some of these additional planes could be stationed.",
