It could be the lock has fallen off, flush does not work etc. Some establishments do not bother to fix their toilets. One High Street store's toilets, only one out of five was usable. With councils closing down public toilets, it is vital these establishments I have mentioned above to keep them maintained. Our need for toilets has not decreased.",
