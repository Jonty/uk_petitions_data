            "background": "First time buyers who bought a house for between \u00a3125,000 and \u00a3175,000 between 1 January 2010 and 24 March 2010 have been hit with a stamp duty bill of up to \u00a31,750 which they would not have had to pay outside of this window.  When the 2009 stamp duty holday ended, there was no indication that another would be reintroduced 12 weeks later.  At a time when many first time buyers have been struggling to find deposits in a difficult mortgage market, this is an additonal cost that many could have avoided if they had been aware of the proposed change by delaying completion dates.  We ask the Government to backdate this change to 1 January 2010 and refund the stamp duty paid by any first time buyers who would have been eligible for tax relief under the new arrangements.",
