            "background": "In the United Kingdom we are privileged to live in a modern, open and tolerant society. Three quarters of the British population claim to have no connection with any religion or church (Tearfund - 2006). Among those who do claim to belong to a religion, church attendance has been falling for many years. Religion no longer deserves a special voice in our society especially when that voice preaches discrimination and intolerance.\n\nComments made by the Pontiff regarding equality and tolerance in the United Kingdom are outrageous. His attempts to encourage discrimination against women and gay people show the kind of attitudes that are not welcome here.\n\nGordon Brown should stand up for the principles of the United Kingdom and rescind his invitation to the Pope.",
