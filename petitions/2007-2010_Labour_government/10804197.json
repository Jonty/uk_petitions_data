        "background": "Over 40,000 complaints against the police are investigated each year regarding assaults and unprofessional conduct. If all officers in England wore body cameras these complaints could be dealt with in a more clear cut way. \nIt would also make it easier for the courts in determing the level of violence used against officers who claim they have been assaulted by the public. The I.P.C.C in investigating complaints by the public would be able to determine if the claim against the police was justified by viewing the film footage therefore saving time and public money in long drawn out investigations.",
