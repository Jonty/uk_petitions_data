        "background": "Currently, our anti-terrorism laws do not prevent the publication, sale or distribution of 'Terror' training manuals.\nFor example, an Al Qaeda Training Manual containing graphic, detailed instruction on methods of torture, bomb-making and how to get the maximum casualties from terrorist activities, is currently available from UK based Internet booksellers.\n\nMuch of the money received from the sale of such material goes to the authors (presumbably supporters of terrorism, or even the terrorist organisations themselves) and therefore the sales are directly (or indirectly) funding  terrorism.\n\nWhilst it may not be possible to prevent sales of these publications that originate from beyond UK borders, the Government should be taking urgent steps to prevent this from happening within the UK.\n\nI urge the Prime Minister to table an urgent amendment, to make dissemination and possession of terrorist training manuals an offence.",
