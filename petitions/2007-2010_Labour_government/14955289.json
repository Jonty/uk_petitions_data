It provides specialised and experienced early learning educational activity through play, to mentally and physically disabled children, aged 0-3 years. \n\nPortage workers go into the child's home to work with both the child and their families, providing the basic building blocks of how to start engaging and teaching a mentally impaired child, preparing them for school, and to compliment a pre-school environment.  \n\nIt is the only educational service that engages directly with the youngest and most vulnerable members of our community, in an endeavour to provide them with a strong foundation of  skills from which their future learning can flourish.",
