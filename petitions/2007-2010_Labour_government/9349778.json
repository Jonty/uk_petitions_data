        "background": "Germany, Poland, Italy, Australia, all encourage the use of fuels such as used chip fat in cars, by not taxing them. This is a substance which would normally be disposed of, yet the British government feel that even this needs to be taxed. If Her Majesties Government truly cares about climate change, why do they not do the small things that show this? Remove the tax so that everyone can go green.",
