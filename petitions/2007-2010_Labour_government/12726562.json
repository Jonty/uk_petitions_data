            "background": "The trouble over expenses is a symptom of a more significant problem: we are allowing the formation of a political class with very little in common with the vast majority of voters.  A generation ago, the different political parties drew their MPs from the unions, from the army, from law and from business.  Whatever their views, these MPs had life experience.  Today, an aspiring MP may go from student politics to a job as a political researcher to a job as an MP, without having to have any experience of the world outside the political bubble.  Allowing only people who for 10 years have earned their livings outside politics to stand as MPs will help to cure us of our identikit politicians, and bring back into political life individuals whose political views are formed not only by the party line, but by work, by management, by teaching, by battle: by life.",
