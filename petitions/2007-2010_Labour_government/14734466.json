            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Most shops keep their doors open in all weathers, placing powerful heaters in the ceiling to provide a heated curtain of air.  Automatic doors are set to remain open and ordinary doors are often locked in the open position.  Some heated shops are designed to be effectively doorless.\n\nRequiring heated shops to keep their doors closed unless customers are actively passing through them would save a considerable amount of energy and send a small signal to end the illusion that no change in lifestyle is needed to reduce CO2 emissions and combat climate change.\n\nRequiring all shops to keep their doors closed will ensure a level playing field in competition between shops and save them a lot of money.\n\nBy signing the petition now there is some hope that action could be taken by next winter.",
