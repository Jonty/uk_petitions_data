            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Currently, many mobile phone handsets and other mobile devices are sold with a \"SIM lock\". This means that it will only work with a single network provider in the UK. This practice restricts consumer choice and competition in the industry. It prevents consumers from shopping around at the end of a contract or during their use of a prepay phone.\n\nBoth contract and prepay customers have covered the cost of the handset (either immediately or during the contract's duration), so there is no claim over the handset by the provider.\n\nUnlocking can be expensive, risky to the handset, and has spawned some websites and businesses that deliberately mislead consumers.\n\nLocking handsets is anti-competitive, restrictive and encourages unscrupulous business practice, and is already illegal elsewhere in the world.\n\nAny device sold that can take a SIM card to work on a mobile phone network should not be locked to a single network provider.",
