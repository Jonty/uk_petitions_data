            "background": "This petition is being created because nothing is being done by Neath Port Talbot Council or South Wales Police even after numerous complaints. There are a number of reasons why the events should be banned, they are - \n1) Riders have been seen to urinate in public.\n2) Riders have been seen to throw litter.\n3) Riders have shown a lack of respect for those living along the course by shouting outside the houses.\n4) They can be a danger to drivers because they don not always obey the highway code.\n5) They bicycles make a loud noise which ruins the enjoyment of sitting in our gardens.\nThe people living along the courses should have a say in whether or not there should be cycle races and not cycling clubs. Upon researching road bicycle racing, it has become evident that the above issues are common along the majority of courses in the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States.",
