            "background": "My partner and I decided to create this petition so that parents and their children have a designated bus to travel on. I have found that I myself have had trouble with many buses and drivers because of having a pram and a young baby. Some drivers refuse to let you on while others will not wait for you to fold your pram or there simply is not a bus that has the room to accomodate the space for a pram. My partner and I feel that there should be a designated bus per town that caters for parents with children in prams, the majority of the spaces on the bus should be used to accomodate prams, there should be two seats per pram space.\nI have found that many mothers have trouble with bus drivers and buses every day. It causes parents to have to walk long distances, pay alot of money for taxis to get to specific places or to .walk home in the rain making their children susceptible to illness. I feel that these type of buses will benefit all families with prams r pushchairs. It will give them more access to buses that will accomodate them.",
