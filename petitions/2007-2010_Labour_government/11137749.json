            "background": "The UK fuel prices have now finally started to fall, and the government is planning a TEMPORARY cut in the VAT rate from 17.5% to 15%. HOWEVER, they are also going to PERMANENTLY add 2p per litre fuel duty to both petrol and diesel!\n\nThe increase in fuel duty will also increase the cost of fuel by more than just 2p, as VAT is also applied to the fuel duty and not just the cost of the fuel.\n\nOur economy is driven on fuel, from the food, clothes, etc we buy, to the cost faced by the population in the form of transport either by car, motorcycle, bus, or train.\n\nIf the 2p a litre duty increase is not abolished, it will simply force up prices on everything we buy. This economy is on the edge of ruin, don't let the government push us further over the edge",
