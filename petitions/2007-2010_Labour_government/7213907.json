            "background": "Users of the M3 and M25 will be aware of the \"Roadworks\" on the M3 Southbound carraigeway restricting traffic to 1 lane southbound on the M3 so that 2 lanes of traffic can join from the M25.  This is controlled by just over a mile of average speed camera management.\n\nInitially this appeared to be Roadworks that overran, then it appeared the Highways agency had simply forgotten to move it.  Now when calling the Highways agency they are planning on making it permenant as it was a \"successful\" traffic management test.\n\nThis has created a very dangerous and accident prone exit to the M25 clockwise at Junction 12.  It has caused traffic backed up on the M25 and M3.  This appears to the public to be an unsuccessful test and we petition for this to be investigated/withdrawn on the grounds of safety and bad traffic management.\n\nThe reason this has gone un-noticed on the M25 is it conincided with the completion of the Heathrow Terminal 4 works, so the road has stayed as bad.",
