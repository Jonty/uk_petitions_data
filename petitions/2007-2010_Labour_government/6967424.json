            "background": "I call on the British government to boycott the '08 Olympic games in response to this disgraceful situation.\nOver the past three months, land disputes involving violent forced evictions have occurred in more than half of China's 31 provinces.\n\nAs President Hu Jintao tries to consolidate his hold on power in the run up to the 17th Communist Party Congress in the autumn, and before next year's Olympic Games, his idea of a \"harmonious society\" is looking ever shakier.\nOn any given day across China there are dozens, or even hundreds of protests like this and most of them are about land. People hate being cast out of their homes more than anything else.\n\nThe government in Beijing says it wants a harmonious society but many - if not most - land disputes end up like this, with forced eviction and demolition. Petioners are being rounded up and imprisioned without trial.",
