            "background": "The recent freezing temperatures have made attending school extremely dangerous for the children of Oakfield School in Fetcham Surrey.  \n\nThe freezing temperatures have meant black ice has formed on the bends outside the school resulting in several vehicles crashing through the school fences and ploughing into the grass area where pupils as young as 7 congregate.\n\nTell me prime minister what is the price of a childs life?\n\nWhat you don\u2019t know!\n\nAsk Surrey County Council, as they have said they cannot afford to grit this road as its only a low priority road.\n\nThe school sits on a 90 degree bend. Every time the temperatures drop the road freezes, children slip over and cars skid and loose control.\n\nIf these latest incidents had happened 90 minutes later it would have been like bowling, with our children as the pins!\n\nWhy must a child die before you take preventative measures to keep our children safe?\n\nI accept roads must be prioritised for gritting, but surely if there is a school which regularly has its children put at risk it should be a higher priority.\n\nPlease make councils grit roads outside schools.",
