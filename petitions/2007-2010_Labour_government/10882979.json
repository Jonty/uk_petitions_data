        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "As we all know the Government have decoded to give the banks 500 billion pounds to help with the current economic downfall, However if you were to think about where this money is going then you will soon come to the same conclusion as I have, This money will just end up sat in the banks not doing an awful lot, So what i propose is this, There are currently 61 million people residing within our country, that works out to \u00a380,000 per person. Surely if this money was distributed in this way it would kick start the economy a lot faster than giving it to the banks that caused the problems in the first place, If every person in the Country was giving this money then they would all do the same thing....SPEND....and that's what this country needs, people would pay off there debt,buy new cars, eat out more, travel to family/ friends so buy more fuel, They would hit the high streets consumerism would rise 100 fold, The Economy would see the benefit within a few days, Not over the next 7 months as currently expected. Thank you for taking the time to read this.\n\nPaul Wood",
