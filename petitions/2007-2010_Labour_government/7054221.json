            "background": "With increasing numbers of people unable to afford to buy a home to live in, buy to let investors are able to purchase residential properties which they have little or no interest in upgrading and let them out for a premium. The government should act to force landlords to insulate and upgrade homes to bring them in line with more modern standards. Such action would help reduce carbon emissions through greater energy efficiency, may reduce the cost of living for those who can not afford to buy property or save towards it, and may help slow the buy to let investment portion of the house price boom.",
