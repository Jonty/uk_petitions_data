            "background": "According to a recent news report Eon are considering building two nuclear power stations at Kingsnorth and Grain in Medway although they have denied this. The government wants more nuclear power stations and Eon are prepared to build them according to the report at their current sites which are in highly populated areas. Do we want this for our children and our grandchildren? Babies are still being born with birth defects in Chernobyl.\n\nMedway is fast becoming a toxic dumping ground with highly explosive toxic chemicals being stored at Chatham too. \n\nWhy spend billions on re-developing the area when there is a potential for our whole landscape to be wiped out. With terrorism featuring so highly in our society nowadays, why would they want to develop nuclear power in such highly populated areas?\n\nLets work together and say NO like we did to the airport. We want more for our community, don't we?",
