            "background": "Since 1997 New Labour has been heading in a direction that many loyal party members and supporters feel is far removed from the ideological basis of the real Labour Party. Under Gordon Brown there was the faintest hint that we may return to the core value base that still appeals to millions of true Labour supporters. But so far this has not happended and voters now feel isolated from the party.\nPlease act quickly to save the Labour Party by:\n-dropping the privatisation agenda, \n-re-building the welfare state, \n-stop the budgetary constraint that is crippling the public sector, \n-stop school league tables,\n-reform the education system\n-fair and just treatment of young people,\n-stop the widening gap between rich and poor through a fair taxation system.\n-Proper support for the elderly through a fair pension system.\n\nPlease re-position Labour as the Centre Left Party, that way I may vote Labour at the next general election.",
