            "background": "Enough is enough. The horrific murder of another innocent child on our streets must realise a swift and effective response from the government. The punishment must fit the crime and criminals must be made to live in fear of a system that is in place to protect the rights of the law abiding British citizen. Those convicted of a crime will forfeit their human rights and persistant offenders must be removed from society. The government must act now to release emergency funds to build more prisons, get more police on our streets and give greater powers to the courts to remove the vermin from society. We beg you to act now before the fabric of our great British society is destroyed forever. We must protect our innocents!!",
