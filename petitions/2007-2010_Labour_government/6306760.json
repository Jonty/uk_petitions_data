            "background": "I live in the Hounslow borough and come under Hounslow homes for re-housing. I pay full rent and council tax and live with my working partner and our 1 boy with ADHD and 3 girls in a 2 bed maisonette in Feltham,Middlesex. I have been told to bid for a 3 bed property in the \"locata\" in band B (been that band for 3 years)but because there are more than 5 people in my household I am not eligable, and not allowed a 4 bed property so therefore in limbo with no where to go. This is not fair and there are others in simalar conditions to me whom I know feel the same.  There should be an allocated amount of suitable properties for Tenants as well as homeseekers.  If you are in a similar position stand with me and together we can change the housing system for the better.",
