            "background": "At present if a Police Officer is attacked in the line of his or her duty the offending person will be arrested for assault on that police officer.  If a police dog is attacked in the line of their duty no action is taken unless damage has been caused - the arrest can only be for criminal damage.  We would like to see a change in the law that of a Police Dog is attacked then the offender should be arrested for assault on that Police Dog.  I bring to light an incident that happened in January 2008 in Swindon, Wiltshire where a Police Dog Handler and his Dog were Stabbed and a 2nd officer received knife rellated injuries.  The offender has been sentanced for the attack on the Police Officer and the Criminal Damage to the Police Dog",
