            "action": ",along with Central Government, look favourably on a request by Barrow in Furness Borough Council for funding to erect further sea defences to the beach directly in front of our residential chalet park (West Shore Park, Walney Island, Cumbria). The continuing erosion of the foreshore on the adjoining beach and the undermining of the access road to the wildlife reserve in this area is causing grave concern to the residents of the park (who are mainly very old people), and visitors to the local area. The estimated cost of these temporary defences is approximately \u00a370.000, which weighed against the safety of the residents and their homes (329 homes), is a very small price to pay.",
