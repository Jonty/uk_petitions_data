            "background": "We believe that Hospitals should be healthy environments that promote healthy and healing practises and attitudes. People should be able to visit hospitals without having their health compromised by being exposed to Tobacco smoke. We believe Hospitals should be considered as a special case when it comes to coverage of the smoking ban as the grounds they are situated in are an extended part of the premises themselves. It is very difficult to visit Hospitals without being a pedestrian in these grounds and risk passive smoking. If anywhere should be a safe healthy environment that does not tolerate unhealthy practises it should be a Hospital.",
