            "background": "Why on earth should non-UK subjects be voting in our lands?  Do you really think someone from a EU state or from a Commonwealth country, all able to register and vote in every election local to national, will be in tune with what the indigenous population want?  Can immigrants from non-'western' lands really understand our culture whilst adhering to their former lives in speech, dress, religious observances, or world view?  Of course not: therefore I suggest they  need to have been subjects of Her Majesty, living fully, freely and lawfully among us for at least 10 years before being allowed the privilege of voting.  Here are the ancestral lands of the English, Scots, Welsh and Irish, and simply must evolve the way we (or those like us) choose, and not be inteferred with by any other political interest or organisation.",
