            "background": "The Woolwich ferry service being offered has become terrible and unreliable. There are 4 ramps to access the boats, but for almost 10 months in a year\u2019s time, one or two of the ramps do not work. For e.g. at present one of the ramp in the 'Newham' access is not working since last October. It appears that some sort of repair work is going on, but the repair did not even start until February this year, which clearly signifies that the repair work was not planned in advance. This leaves the commuter in despair, as this need to be understood that the Woolwich ferry is the only way to cross the river between the Blackwell and the Dartford tunnels. On top of it, the ferry service is reduced to one boat quite often, despite the fact that that there are three boats available and any repair could be planned so that at least two boats are running at all times. I know the service is free of charge, but that does not mean that it would work in such a state that it\u2019s of no use to the public.",
