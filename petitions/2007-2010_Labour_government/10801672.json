As a parent I am shocked that a think tank would even want to expose young children to sex at an age below 12 especailly where pedofillia is so rife.\n\nPlease protect our children from immoral views and sexual content while they are young.\nI understand that homosexual people have rights and I respect their right but is their right to show young children as young as 5 how to have sex,\nRegards\n\nDwight",
