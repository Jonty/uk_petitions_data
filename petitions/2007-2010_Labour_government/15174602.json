        "background": "we believe that the cost of the disposal of goods should be shifted from council tax payers to the manufacturers or importers of the goods. The cost of the disposal would then be reflected in the purchase price. This will help to change our 'throwaway' culture by giving  manufactures an incentive to make items which can be recycled or repaired rather than disposed of.",
