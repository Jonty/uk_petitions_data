The current ones warn of having detected illegal activity on your account. The link address it shows looks genuine, but hovering over it reveals a completely different destination.\nThese need special action, not just hitting a \"spam\" button. But it is almost impossible to alert either the email provider, or maybe even more importantly the bank concerned. They claim to care, but it is far from this impression they give, and need more encouragement to do so.",
