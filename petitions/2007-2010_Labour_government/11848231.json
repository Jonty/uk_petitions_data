            "background": "We the undersigned are appalled and distressed at the ongoing decline in family values and the constant pressure from minority groups to coerce the silent majority to accept grotesque and distorted views which debase a civilised society.\n\nWhile the rights of the individual must be protected, it is not right that extremist individual views take precedence over rules established and valued in all true civilisations and great religions.\n\nIt is shameful that our Government not only condones but actually encourages relationships outside of the family and seeks to obscure this by bullying in the workplace and the home by \"politically correct\" activists.\n\nWe the undersigned abhor the constant debasement of basic family values and demand that action is taken to restore these to a place of precedence within  British society.",
