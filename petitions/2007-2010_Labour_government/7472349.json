        "action": "promote Contraction & Convergence as an equitable system to regulate carbon emissions for both developing and developed countries",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Contraction & Convergence (C&C) is a way of globally sharing responsibility for climate change which is both flexible and fair to developing and developed countries. \nIt works by reducing the carbon shares of over-emitting countries until they converge with the [temporarily rising] shares of poorer under-emitting countries.\nC&C starts by setting a limit for the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere which is only slightly above the present level. It then schedules a global contraction of human CO2 emissions to keep within that limit on a per capita basis. \nThereby it shares internationally the future entitlements to emit on a basis that is equitable i.e. proportional to the populations of the countries in the agreement.\nAlso it will potentially stimulate investment in renewable energy and improve the prospects of all parties as poorer countries will be able to sell their surplus shares to wealthier nations through a carbon trade.",
