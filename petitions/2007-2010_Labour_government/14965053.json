            "background": "I understand the need for the BBC to be funded for news/news related programmes, and important documentaries; to ensure that they are not influenced by the money of sponsors and provide an impartial service, and to ensure that programmes that make a real difference such as spotlight, continue.  However, why should this be extended to other programmes?  I certainly do not mind watching advertisements on other channels if it means I do not have to pay as much of a license fee.  Personally I dont watch BBC channels all that often, and I'm sure others are in the same boat.  I don't believe I should have to pay for you all to watch Eastenders, I'm sure another channel will take it up.  There's no need for this, the BBC is a great news provider and that is the only job which it should do.",
