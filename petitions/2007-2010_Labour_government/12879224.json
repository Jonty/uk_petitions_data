            "background": "Please change the law regarding council house tenancy succession.at present the law states a tenancy can only be passed on once.Ours was passed onto my mother when my father died.\nHaving lost my mother just over a month ago , my brother and I are now facing eviction from our home of 38 years, due to this ridiculous law and the bullying tactics of our local council.Other people should be made aware of this law and the council cant wait to try and move you when you inform them of the tenancy holders death.very insensitive at a time when you are dealing with a loss and sorting out affairs without having to worry about how long you are going to have a roof over your head.",
