            "background": "In light of the removal of \u201cheight restrictions\u201d Police sadly command less respect. I\u2019m an Asian PCSO who\u2019s 5 foot 6 inches . By British standards I\u2019m small compared to most white officers but police in my country, India are on average the same size as me yet still deal with drunk and violent Europeans. \n\nHow? They use 1 meter long sticks originally introduced by the British colonial administration that feared that a mostly Asian manned police force would have problems apprehending European Criminals who would generally be larger in size. This was a genuine worry as the white population at the time was larger than it is now and was growing.\n\nThe 1 meter stick was introduced to counter this problem. Once again the police face a very similar problem for very similar reasons. The 1 meter stick also avoids confrontation situations escalating as the sight of a policeman holding his large stick is enough to make one behave ones self. In an age of increasing crime the need for this deterrent is needed more than ever.",
