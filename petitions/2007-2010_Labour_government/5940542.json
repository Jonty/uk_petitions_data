            "background": "Due to the current flooding in Yorkshire, the Midlands and the Avon basin. I propose our Government should scrap the plans for the Olympics and spend the allocated money shoring up our flood defences nationwide in a 10 year programme (especially as we are plannning yet more new homes on flood plains) \nAnd also seen as the government are blaming the current situation on global warming we should not be hosting  an event like the olympics due to the amount of carbon the devleopment and travel and the event itself will put into the atmosphere.",
