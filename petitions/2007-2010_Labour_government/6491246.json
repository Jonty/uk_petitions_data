        "background": "At the moment, the Ministry of Defence has made budget cuts, meaning that the number of personnel in Her Majesty's Armed Forces, is decreasing. This is absolutely unacceptable as the British Armed Forces are already stretched. Increasing the amount of money given to the MOD increases the number of troops, and also increases and improves the equipment and services for the Armed Services personnel. It also mean's that the Cadet Forces can enjoy more activities.",
