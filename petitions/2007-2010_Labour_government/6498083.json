            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) wants to extend its powers so it would be able to raid bank and building society accounts for unpaid tax, without having to make its case before a judge and obtain a court order. Your home could also be at risk: HMRC could put a charge on your property if you didn't pay your tax, again without seeking sanction from a court. It would be dangerous because the burden of proof would be shifted. It would be up to taxpayers to prove their innocence, rather than HMRC to establish their guilt.\nSadly, the taxman is often guilty of getting it wrong. The National Audit Office recently criticised HMRC for errors in the PAYE system. It estimates that 5 million out of 30 million people are paying the wrong amount of tax. Surely the taxman could make better use of its existing - and extensive - powers.\nThe taxman should also be held accountable for ANY mistakes it makes and full re-imbursement and compensation should be made to pay the loss and damage that has occurred.",
