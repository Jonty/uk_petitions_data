        "background": "This petition is to ask the Prime Minister to dedicate funding for a University in Hereford, Herefordshire England. The building of a University would enable future genereations of Herefordians between 18 and 30 to be better educated and seek better paid employment in the city they grew up in and love, as opposed to having to move away from family and friends to seek alternative education choices.\n\nIn recent surveys, Hereford city suffers with low skill levels and low wage earning potential for young people and we petition the Prime Minister to help change this so that Hereford can truly be a centre of excellence in education and training.",
