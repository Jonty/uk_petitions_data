If the pre-1997 ex-servicemen are given pensions equal to British soldiers and Gurkhas soldiers serving after 1997, they will have no need to migrate to the UK in search of secondary employment.  They will happily retire in Nepal.  Priority needs to be given to the 18,000 retired Gurkhas who do not qualify for Army pensions, roughly 10,000 of whom survive on Welfare Pensions of just \u00a329 per month, and 8,000 who receive no income whatsoever, because there is no state pension in Nepal.  Many of these elderly men are living in destitution.",
