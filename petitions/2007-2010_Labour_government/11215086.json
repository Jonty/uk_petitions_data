        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I strongly disagree of the proposed building of the Energy Recovery Facility (ERF) or incinerator. There are better alternatives to deal with our waste and greener methods are emerging every day, using recycled packaging and bio-degradable materials, make it compulsory to businesses to reduce packaging, re-cycle bottles back to producers, metals back to manufacturers, just a different way of waste management is needed.\nIt will have devastating impact on Shrewsbury as a town and the local Shropshire businesses and our agriculture greenbelt.The problem is the amount of waste, that is what needs to be addressed,to dispose of waste in the soil is not a long term solution, building incinerators as an easy/only option is irresponsible politically and technically to our community and future generations.Sustainability will become the key issue for survival,lets give recycling the chance it needs to grow.We need re-educating and get rid of the throw away society we are living in.",
