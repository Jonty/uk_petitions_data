        "background": "Fuel prices are rising faster now than at this time last year. Many of us are hanging onto solvency by the skin of our teeth and need transport to continue to work. While the public transport infrastructure is unusable for most vehicle commuters, it is unreasonable to expect us to have to pay a massively inflated penalty-tax just to enable us to get to work every day. Please show us all that you care Mr. Brown by doing something positive for the ordinary people and punish someone else for a change.",
