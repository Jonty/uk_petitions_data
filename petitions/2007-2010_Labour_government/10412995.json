            "background": "We are tired of paying for services that never materialise. We demand the government to order all local authorities and councils to immediately uphold their duties of maintaining our road network. Using Edinburgh as an example, the road system has become so neglected that a local newspaper has had for a number of years a section called \"Get it Sorted\" where some of the capital's roads are shown in the state they are and shown how long they have been left in a dangerous state for the public. We demand the government take action to force neglecting councils to repair ALL DAMAGED AND DANGEROUS sections of road in their areas of responsibility as the current state of british roads is hazardous to say the least and this service of repair and maintenance has already been payed for the citizens of the United Kingdom",
