            "background": "In Pinderfields Hospital, Wakefield, West Yorkshire and many other areas of the NHS, the practice of same-sex attendance lounges has been adopted.\n\nThis means that patients arrive at hospital in the early morning (or mid afternoon) together and are made to sit in same-sex attendance lounges prior to their operation. They are called by the nurse and made to change into open backed gowns, support stockings and their own dressing gown and sent back to their seats to sit with other semi-dressed patients for a long wait (six hours typical) in a cold, not-too-clean or comfortable waiting room.\n\nPatients of all ages are made to drag their belongings back and forth and are often very distressed with being alone, undressed and surrounded by strangers.\n\nSome patients are sent home as no bed can be sourced and made to repeat the process over and over again.\n\nOur patients deserve DIGNITY - this is not dignified. \n\nPlease sign this petition to have this 'cattle market' practice abolished at Pinderfields Hospital Wakefield and in the NHS as a whole.",
