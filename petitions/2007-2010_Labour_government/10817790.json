The elderly are at risk of freezing, effecting their health and wellbeing.  People on low incomes now have to choose between paying the bill and eating properly.\nAll this is happening while the utility companies are reporting unimaginable profits of billions. \nThis is an injustice to the everyday person who needs their services not out of choice but necessity.\nIt is time for the government to take control of the utility companies. Do the decent thing and keep Britain warm.",
