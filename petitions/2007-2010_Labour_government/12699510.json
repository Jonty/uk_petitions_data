            "background": "A serving member of the Armed Forces can buy a concession card which offers rail travel at a reduced rate.\n \nOnce they are discharged at a percentage disability of less than 80% they lose this valuable assistance.\n\nMany disabled ex servicemen and women are restricted in their earning potential and there is a real need for concessions on a much wider front.  \n\nVarious national campaigns are gathering pace to rectify this unfair situation.\n\nThese are to be applauded, but their proposals can sometimes be too prescriptive and definitions of qualification could in time, prove to be too narrow and complicated.\n\nI would not like to see a solution which was anomalous or lead to potential abuse.\n\nTherefore, I would like your support in bringing this situation to the attention of those with the power to act, with a view to making whatever concessions are practicable.\n\nThe minimum solution should be an extension of the forces railcard system which has already set a precedent and has an established administrative system.\n\nThe perfect and most generous solution would be a nationwide extension of the free travel card for disabled veterans which is currently available within the London area",
