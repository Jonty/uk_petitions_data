            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "It is currently the responsibility of local authorities to clear snow and ice from pavements and footpaths.  When faced with severe winter conditions (January 2010) it is not feasible for local authorities to discharge this responsibility within an acceptable time period.  If property owners/occupiers are responsible for this task the action required in extreme conditions will be spread more appropriately.  Steps should be taken to ensure that property owners/occupiers cannot be sued for any accidents occurring on pavements and footpaths they have or have not cleared - at present people are taking no action on snow/ice clearance as it may make them liable for any subsequent accidents.  Local authorities should be empowered to apply fines where no reasonable action has been taken to clear pavements and footpaths within sensible limits.",
