            "background": "The increased protection of children under modern law has lead to a reduction in the respect of children for adults and an increase in violent and unruly behaviour among British youths. \n\nThis signatories of this petition recommend that corporal punishments such as the belt be restored for restricted use by appropriate authorities such as schools and police forces. \n\nAppropriate restrictions would be required and could include use being limited to certain authorised persons within an institution, witnesses being required to prevent excessive force, and full reports being submitted in each instance to prevent over-use or vindictive, unjustified use. \n\nThese measures would allow teachers and other adults in positions of responsibility to regain control over children, who presently recognise no boundaries as they are aware that they are untouchable under law. \n\nIn many cases this would provide an early \"curbing\" of unacceptable behaviour before it has the chance to get out of hand, allowing the development of socially responsible characters.",
