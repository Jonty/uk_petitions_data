            "background": "On a PM's salary of nearly \u00a3200k, we fail to understand why the UK taxpayer should pick up the tab for cleaning of PM Brown's second home and ask that he repays this elective expense.  Indeed, we ask that all second home allowances for MPs be scrapped and the system reformed so that only London-based rent/hotel accommodation expenses be claimable, up to a set limit recommended by independent financial review. Any furniture/durables purchased at taxpayer expense should remain in ownership of the UK Government, to be loaned to future MPs for London accommodations, sold, or donated to NHS Hospitals, care homes, or local housing authorities for furnishing of low income housing.",
