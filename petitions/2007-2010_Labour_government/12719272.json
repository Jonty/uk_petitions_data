            "background": "Martial Arts have gained considerable popularity in recent years but unfortunately retains a stigma which if unchallenged poses a serious obstacle to young athletes. The inclusion of Mixed Martial Arts in the Olympics would demonstrate that society accepts the incredible skill involved thus removing the stigma.Including Mixed Martial Arts in the Olympic Games would also provide an outlet for young athletes as well as providing young people with positive role models to aspire to. Inclusion would also increase the chances of Great Britain achieving recognition in the field of international sport. Finally the inclusion would provide individuals who may not otherwise engage in sporting activity with an alternative outlet which may go some way to curb the obesity crisis.",
