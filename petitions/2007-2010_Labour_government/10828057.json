            "background": "Since the government has already established the principal of retrospective taxation and since these individuals have presided on the destruction of the wealth of savers, pensioners and shareholders while enriching themselves considerably in recent years I propose that the government shall retrospectively tax them.  This tax shall be based on the previous 6 years bonuses and pension contributions and taxed at the percentage loss in the share price of the business they worked for between 12 months ago and now.  The directors, officers and executives of such businesses must put the stakeholders and shareholders of such businesses at the highest regard long term or be made to later suffer the same consequences that they caused to be inflicted on those stakeholders.",
