            "background": "I have, like many others spent a great deal of my time separating my household waste into the various bins so it can be recycled to do my bit towards helping the environment. I recently read a disturbing report however, on how British Recycling companies are selling our household plastic waste to China as it is more cost effective then recycling it here in the UK. The plastics are compressed, baled and shipped to towns such as Lianjiao in southern China\u2019s Guangdong Province. There Lianjiao\u2019s inhabitants make their meagre living melting the plastic over furnaces that shoot plumes of toxic smoke directly into their faces to produced small plastic chips that can be re-used. Waste from the reprocessing plants pours directly into the streams, rivers and poisonous smoke fills the air. Plastic waste is now one of Britain\u2019s top exports to China. I feel uterly discusted that after all my effort towards recycling, it is shipped to china and burn't with serious consequences to the environment. The government needs to ensure that all our plastic waste is processed in the UK in the most environmentally friendly way as possible.",
