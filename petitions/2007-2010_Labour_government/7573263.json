            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The UK Wholesale Gas and Electricity Markets are amongst the most volatile of all world commodity markets partly because of speculation by organisations completely unconnected with the UK energy supply industry - such as Banks and Financial Institutes. Since February 2007, UK Wholesale Gas Prices have increased by around 80% at a time when major new gas import projects have been completed and there is a massive overhang in supply capacity. The result is that UK domestic and commercial energy consumers are experiencing energy cost increases at a time when prices should be at least stabilising if not going down. Legislating to exclude any organisation from buying into the UK wholesale energy markets except those directly connected with it promises to reduce energy costs to all UK energy consumers and to deliver more stable energy costs to the benefit of all UK energy consumers.",
