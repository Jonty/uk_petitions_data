            "background": "Often when you apply for a job, there is a disclaimer saying if you are unsuccessful, the prospective employer will keep your details for a maximum of 6 months and then destroy them.\n\nAn employer who has chosen to reject an applicant has absolutely no need for these details and they should be forced by law to destroy them immediately after the decision has been made to reject the applicant. Failure to do so should result in stiff penalties.\n\nIt really adds insult to injury when you have been told you have been unsuccessful in an application for a job you dreamed of getting, only for the prospective employer to keep hold of all your confidential details for up to 6 months. There is just no need for this, and it should be made a serious crime.",
