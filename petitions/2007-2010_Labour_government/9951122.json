            "background": "Within this democratic country we all have the responsibility to state what we are not willing to accept. MPs need to be trustworthy otherwise we will build a nation of distrust; which seems to be expanding already. There are many people who work within government positions in receipt of low or limited pay for the work that is done; and these people have to be (and pride their self in being) reliable and trust worthy to serve members of the public. This should be an extremely 'firm' requirement of any MPs. It is absolutely unacceptable that these so-called reliable MPs use government money to line the pockets of the family or their-selves and get away with light punishment.",
