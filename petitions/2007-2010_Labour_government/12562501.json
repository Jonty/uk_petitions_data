He first commentated on the Eurovision Song Contest for UK television coverage in 1973, then again in 1978 and every year since 1980 (except when hosting the event in 1998).\n\nHis dry, sardonic wit has truly become one of if not the most enjoyable aspect of Eurovision for millions of UK viewers.\n\nThe proposed replacement, Graham Norton, is funny himself, but it wouldn't be the same without Wogan.",
