            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The FA have disgustingly ruled that Grays Athletic should pay jailed Ashley Sestanovich \u00a314,000 in unpaid wages for the period after he was jailed for his part in an armed robbery where Thomas Fahey was shot and killed.  Since joining the football club Ashley Sestanovich had previously been involved in just 3 training sessions and 20 minutes of a friendly match. Grays Athletic have been advised that if they do not pay the outstanding money then the FA will suspend them from all football competitions. The club currently has a counter claim going through the County Courts and an offer was made to The FA that they hold the money owed until such time that the case is bought to conclusion; however, they refused to even consider this and demanded that the money is paid directly to Mr Sestanovich.  Please sign this petition to show your objections against this awful ruling?",
