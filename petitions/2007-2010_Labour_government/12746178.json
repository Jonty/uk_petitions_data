            "background": "Change the planning rules with regard to erecting wooden fencing around a garden. A female OAP,with a disabled daughter in CLevedon,paid to have a fence around the side of her house, Highways had no objection,the coundil say it has to be moved back 0.05 of a metre as it is near a pathway.\nThe fence is for her security and her disabled daughter,previously there was 30 foot conifers which were an eyesore and difficult to maintain. Beaurocracy seems to have gone mad, 271 other premises have these fences but she must\neither move hers back or take it down and build a 6 foot brick wall. Where is the logic.This is Somerset county council for Clevedon district.",
