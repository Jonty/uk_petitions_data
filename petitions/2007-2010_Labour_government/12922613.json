            "background": "At present the Motability Component of the Disability Living Allowance is not available for children under the age of 3.  \n\nWe feel that disabled children under the age of 3 require the use of a reliable vehicle as much, if not more than, an adult, for what can often be daily hospital visits.\n\nOur daughter was diagnosed with a terminal illness and upon enquiring on the Motability Component we were told children under the age of 3 can be transported via a pram or pushchair, therefore there is no need for a car.  We found this extremely frustrating, expecially as our own vehicle was unreliable and we lived half hour drive away from the nearest hospital.\n\nSince our daughter passed away we have become involved in charity work to try and improve the quality of life for many terminally ill and disabled children, and we have found that many other parents would greatly benefit from the use of a reliable vehicle.",
