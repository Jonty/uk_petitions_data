            "background": "this government is hell bent on making every motorist a fineable criminal because it can't balance the books using conventional funding like council tax and income tax. What is the countrywide practice of reducing dual carriageway and urban speed limits to 50 mph designed to do other than entrap people on once familiar routes? If it is to reduce casualties it needs to be 30mph or less according to current government advertising. This is purely to make money! Also it would reduce acccidents if lorries and cars could do the same speeds, both types of vehicle are designed to far exceed the suggested limits of the law which were formed from legislation designed to suit vehicles from the 1960's",
