        "background": "Stop Banks giving high levels of credit, especially on  credit cards and mortgages on variable rates. Make all credit agreements fixed or tracker.\n\nWith the Bank of England base rate at 0.5%, why are banks sharply increasing interest rates to their existing customers saddled with balances on their credit cards or needing a new mortgage deal?\n\nHikes of 15% or even 25% above the original agreed rate are regularly being made to long term credit card holders.\n\nTo avoid the often very high standard variable rates, exorbitant arrangement fees are being charged to customers to buy a new mortgage deal every 2 or 3 years.\n\nMany members of the public are now saddled with massive interest charges that could not have been for-seen especially as base rates fell.\n\nThe Banks have the right to charge you any rate they like at any time with 30 days notice. Variable rates need to stop. Make all credit agreements fixed or tracker.",
