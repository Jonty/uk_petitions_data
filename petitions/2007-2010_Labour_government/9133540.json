        "background": "Bring back this Great Brittish political institution. Todays front benches are full of frightfully boring 'yes' men, who lack the personality and charisma of those gone before. Todays current climate of spin, political correctness gone mad, the 'war' on terror and other now regular poitical u turns and clangers, would be gold dust for the very tallented writers. Spiting image was what first got me and no doubt thousands of other 80's teenagers interested in politics and would possibly re-ignite interest in politics especially in todays young people. It would also provide some needed accountablitiy from those in government and opposition, after all were paying for them, some much more than others, and we may as well get a laugh at 'their' expense.",
