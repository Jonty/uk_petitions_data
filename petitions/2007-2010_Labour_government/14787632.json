        "background": "The E-Petitions service is good but it could be through some simple changes such as:\nUser accounts \u2013 Would enable a greater community aspect to the site and quicker signing of petitions.\nThe ability to track petitions \u2013 Often petitions are signed and forgotten about, this would allow signed petitions to be tracked.\nDiscussions sections for each petition \u2013 The comments section for petitions are small and often greater discussion on a subject may help develop an issue.\nSub categories and areas for specific issues \u2013 There are already broad categories but these could have sub categories and specific areas for complex subject. This would enable better searching for petitions and if RSS feeds were provided for these it would allow people to be updated on areas of specific interest to them. \nThe ability to vote against a petition \u2013 Would allow people to voice their concern against petitions rather than having to create a petition against a petition.",
