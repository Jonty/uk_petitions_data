            "background": "As a leeds resident I feel compelled to voice the comments of Leeds. Leeds is rapidly becoming a slum in some areas. The streets are littered with household waste piled high in most places. Recycling has been suspended unless Leeds residents take their recyclable items to various sites in Leeds. The Vermin population is growing. The Swine flu epedemic advertisements display to the population of the uk 'catch it, Kill it, Bin it', Well we are doing as advised here in Leeds but when Dogs tear open Bags in the streets and infected tissues are blowing freely in the wind it kind of defetes all the NHS advise. This situation has been allowed to go on for far too long and needs direct and constructive intervention. I urge all Leeds residents to sign this petition, use your voice to help resolve this huge mess were in, after all it's a service we have all paid for which were not receiving.",
