            "background": "Speed cameras are a useless tax on the motorists with some cameras being calibrated every six months sometimes the information can be wrong leading to fines for the innocent party, Speed or safety cameras as they are known to the government are not there for the safety of our motorists if any thing they are a hazard, as research shows only 9% of accidents are caused by speeding, most of the rest are driving with out due care and attention and lack of rest so penalise them for a change and if speed cameras are needed place them outside of schools if they are so called safety cameras and did you know that soem people pay more in income tax a year than what the government get from speed offences so it is not as if there really getting much anyway so get rid of them i'm sure the non sunday drivers will agree!!! :)",
