            "background": "In light of the Sheffield United player Chris Morgan's challenge on Ian Hume it is evident that The FA need to review its disciplinary system. Chris Morgan was booked for a challenge which has left Hume in hospital with a fractured skull. As he was booked The FA claim that they cannot punish the player further. If the legislation in place does not allow further punishment than is is clear that the legislation needs changing. This is not just a footballing matter. Morgan's challenge is illegal in any walk of life. It is not the intention of this petition to mix both sport and the state as this would be detrimental to sport in this country but if The FA does not has strong legislation in place surely this is inevitable. Please lend your support and believe that change can be achieved.",
