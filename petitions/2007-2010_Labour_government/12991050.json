        "background": "Since the decision in the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal - RN Zimbabwe - the Home Office has, either consciously or unconsciously, attempted to redress what it perceives to be an imbalance in the scrutiny and assessment of applications for asylum from Zimbabweans by rejecting them without proper consideration. \n\nThe singling out of Zimbabweans in this way is discriminatory and an affront to the principles of protecting the rights of innocent people who are fleeing violence and persecution that are enshrined in the European Convention for Human Rights Act and the Human Rights Act.\n\nThe Home Office should make a fair assessment of each and every application and, in the case of Zimbabwean asylum seekers, accept that:\n\n1. The case of RN Zimbabwe ought to be properly applied and \n2. that Zimbabweans cannot be removed and, therefore, grant humanitarian protection to Zimbabweans and allow them to live and work in the UK with dignity.",
