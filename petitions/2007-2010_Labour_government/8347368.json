            "background": "Vasily Aleksanyan was arrested in 2006 just days after he was appointed Vice President of Yukos. He was imprisoned on charges of embezzlement and money laundering. \n\nHe had contracted HIV AIDS, and so required antiretroviral therapy. \n\nMr Aleksanyan is being denied life-saving medical treatment and his condition is now critical. There are reports that he has been put in a prison wing for people with infectious diseases.\n\nRussia has ignored repeated injunctions from the European Court of Human Rights requiring that Mr Aleksanyan be hospitalized in a specialist AIDS clinic. \n\nWe call on the prime minister to:\n* publicly call for his treatment\n* lobby the Russian government to uphold the judgement of the ECHR",
