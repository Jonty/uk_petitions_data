        "background": "Enough is enough...Eurosport have lost coverage of the 2009 Moto GP season, the BBC have exclusive rights.\n\nWell I can't be doing with being forced to watch the season with Steve Parrish and that Charlie bloke commentating....talk about dull, dumbed down and passionless.... Parrish drones on and says how the rider is \"Tapping the power on out of the corners\" about 300 times every GP. Rubbish\n\nAs a Public Funded body the BBC should be forced to hire Julian Ryder, Toby Moody and Randy Mamola from Eurosport....3 experts who give a great show during the Moto GP and who are genuine bike enthusiasts.  Suzi Perri can keep her job though as I like her.\n\nCome on BBC....you know it makes sense.",
