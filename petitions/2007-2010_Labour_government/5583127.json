            "background": "Currently, the British Army is under massive strain whilst conducting Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.  It is not helped that when back in  their garrison towns in the UK and Germany, commanders at sub unit level are dimminishing the quality of life of troops in between Operations.  It is appreciated that training has to continue at a high tempo to support future operations, however, the degrading of a quality of life for soldiers in between Operations is having a massive effect on morale.  I am currently serving with a unit in Germany and morale amongst the JNCO's is at rock bottom.  I feel that if their are no changes in the very near future, we will see a lot of our current JNCO's applying to terminate their colour Service.  We are seeing a trend now where Senior soldiers are actually only having to do five or six years service.  We do not have the same level of experience and we are not retaining the quality.  We need a binding contract that gives a quality of life when not on Operations, so that when we do deploy, the hardships are not as blatant.",
