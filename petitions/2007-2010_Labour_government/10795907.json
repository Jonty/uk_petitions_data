            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I propose the government, instead of paying for and/or helping with the costs of loft insulation,cavity wall insulation,double-glazed windows,etc., installs solar panels for heating, hot water and all electrical appliances within the home. (I already have double-glazing, loft insulation and wall cavity insulation and it does not make the slightest bit of difference to my energy bills - I still pay over \u00a31,000 per year for my 2 bed terrace - and thats before the prices started to rise.  How many of you are finding the same?)  This will be more economical and a safer alternative to fossil fuels or nuclear power in the long run. for the disabled, long-term sick, the elderly and parents of young children, all single parents with children under the age of 18 years and all council tenants out of work, for the government to fund this installation, at no cost to the tenant/home owner.  For those who work, means test them as to how much they could put towards the cost... implementing a repayment scheme for the installation of the solar panels.",
