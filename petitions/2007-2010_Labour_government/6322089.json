            "background": "Fisheries throughout the country have voiced their concern that the greatest current threat to their stocks is the killing, and eating of their fish (mainly carp) by individuals who profess to not understanding the laws of the country and rules of a particular fishery. An angler caught fishing without a license can face a huge fine and have his equipment confiscated, so why do the Enviromental Agency approach this issue with little more than nonchalant approach? This problem needs addressing urgently",
