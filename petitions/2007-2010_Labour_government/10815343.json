        "background": "Our current crop of politicians have NEVER been found guilty of any accusation of sleaze, continually being described as 'having broken no rules'.  This is clearly because they are investigating themselves and colluding over the result of any investigation.  Taxpayers are being taken for a ride and since they are the people bearing the cost and consequences of of the sleazy activity being perpetrated, then it is they who should conduct the investigation.",
