            "background": "The BNP are a racist party who are fooling the British public. They are promoting British jobs for British people, where as it is clear that this is just a tactic. Their aim is to cause hatred and civil war. They believe there is nothing wrong with rape, hate gay people and aim to break the link between Britain with the rest of the world. If they are not stopped Britain will become a war zone. The government is already aware that this party is a danger to Britain so we request for this party to be banned before it is too late. If the BNP were to gain further seats there would be an increase in crime, rape and murder. We wish for our families, our children to have a great future not one where they are involved within a civil war.",
