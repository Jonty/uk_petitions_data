        "background": "55mph (88kph) is the most economic speed.At that speed most cars can achieve perhaps 50mpg. At 70 consumption increases dramatically to perhaps only 35.The majority of motorists only drive a short distance to work and might add only a few minutes to their overall journey time. But they would dramatically reduce their fuel costs, reduce emissions, reduce wear and tear and  importantly reduce the severity of road accidents.\nDoes not that make sense and put money in our pockets?",
