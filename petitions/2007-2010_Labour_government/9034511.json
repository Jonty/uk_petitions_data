            "background": "I support the idea of informing the public on the dangers of drugs. However, I would like to raise a few points.\n\nFirstly, almost all FRANK adverts focus on Cannabis (with a select few discussing MDMA and other pills). They don't however, ever discuss statistics (which there are, thankfully, plenty of on the site). There is also a large possibility that in the FRANK campaigns that demonise cannabis use. The public will be uninformed or unaware of the far greater dangers posed by heroin, cocaine , barbiturates and indeed alcohol (which for some unknown reason, is still allowed to be advertised, despite being the third most dangerous drug).\n\nI call for the government to focus it's attentions on tackling drugs which pose a far greater risk to the user than Cannabis, though there should also be objective information provided on Cannabis. Also, as a side point to this petition, alcohol advertising should be banned immediately, and proper warnings put out to the public about the risks of alcoholism, which are far greater than those of Cannabis dependency.",
