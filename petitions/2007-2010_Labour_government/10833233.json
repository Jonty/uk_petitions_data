We all know these are very bad for you in large amounts and are the major cause of Britain's obesity crisis and the atrocious state of this country's oral health. If these products were taxed more, less people would buy them because they would become more expensive and be less able to compete with other healthier products. This decrease in popularity would mean more businesses would offer healthier products and thus more businesses would also start to make healthier products. Therefore everyone wins, cheaper prices for the healthier products we buy and an incentive for the big food companies to make their products healthier as it would mean more people would buy them and keep their profits up in this time of economic despair. It would also help to end our great country\u2019s obesity crisis in young children to which many unhealthy products are still advertised and improve the nation's oral health which is good news for everyone, what could be better?",
