        "background": "The goverment no longer offers a program to vaccinate all children against TB (via the BCG) even though the number of cases is on the rise in the UK. Only children from families with a history of TB or children from families which have immigrated to the UK are offered the BCG free of charge, as they are at the most risk. I personally had to pay to have it done privately, at a cost fo \u00a350. I would like the goverment to once again offer this jab free of charge to all children as it is by no means a disease of the past. The BCG is still required to travel abroad to many countries, the more people that are vaccinated the less likely it will return to the UK. It is cheaper to prevent than treat.",
