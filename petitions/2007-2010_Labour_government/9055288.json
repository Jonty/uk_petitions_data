            "background": "The NUT recently decide to boycott Army recruitment in schools. The MOD should not be recruiting child soldiers using cynical videos. Our armed forces should recruit adults who are at least 21 years old.\n\nThe MOD deliberately chooses to target children and the vunerable because they know they can be bullied, moulded and not question orders no matter how dubious. They are too young to understand international politics and complex global issues.\n\nThe MOD is recruiting into an institution that now has a track record of contempt for its personnel. Recruits have been bullied to the point of suicide as shown at Deepcut. They are not given adequate equipment, accomodation and treatment for their injuries or surving partners. The treatment of the loyal Gurkhas, Porton Down, Gulf War Syndrome sufferers, depleted uranium munitions exposure are examples of this contempt.  The MOD is now having to turn to the desperate of other countries to recruit. The UK citizens have seen enough and have had enough.",
