            "background": "recent local coverage shows that those living in Gravesham area would not be entitled to a reduced toll charge for using the Dartford/QE2 crossing on the M25 motorway. This crossing is the first opportunity to cross the river Thames and for it to increase to \u00a31.50 each way is too high. The catchment area for reduced toll fees should be extended to a 15 mile radius on both sides of the crossing or ideally it should be made free-of-charge. The slight reduction for TAG users is not significant but serves for those that use them as a convenient method of payment. To reduce congestion scrap the toll alltogether",
