        "background": "Given that nicotine addiction is controlled by receptors in the brain rather than being merely a dependency habit, it is generally considered an illness.\n\nMost smokers do not continue to smoke by choice but are addicted to a substance that is considered by even recovering heroin addicts far more difficult to break away from.\n\nThe Disability Discrimination Act makes it unlawful to discriminate against people with disability and illness.  Breaking away from smoking addiction does cause material stresses and alterations to normal lifestyle and as such, smokers should not be discriminated against for failure to give up smoking but should be given equal facilities as for non-smokers",
