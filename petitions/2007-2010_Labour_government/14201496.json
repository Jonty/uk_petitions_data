            "background": "This petition calls for the Government (specifically the UK Border Agency) to put an end to the practice of imprisoning the children of failed asylum seekers in immigration removal centres. As one of the most marginalised groups in society, these children already occupy an extremely vulnerable position. They have committed no offence under UK law, yet are treated like criminals. The mental stresses and strains created by the UK's system of immigration removal centres have been well documented by the Royal Colleges of Paediatrics and Child Health, as well as leading child psychiatrists. Is child imprisonment really the image the UK Government wants to project abroad? It doesn't prevent people attempting to seek asylum here and can only damage this country's reputation around the world.  \n\nFor these reasons, I urge you to sign this petition.",
