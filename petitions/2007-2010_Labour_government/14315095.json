            "background": "The Department for Communities and Local Government has recently appointed 13 advisers from various religious positions to comment on various \"big issues\". Church attendance is at an all-time low, most people disagree with the religious position on many issues such as contraception, abortion, homosexuality and euthanasia. This is not representative.\n\nAlso, where is the voice of the non-religious in this? These issues affect everyone. I propose that this group of advisers is dissolved and a more representative group containing both a range of those with and those without faith is created. This new group should also be democratically elected.",
