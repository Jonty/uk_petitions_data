            "background": "The recent investigations in the KCOM company states that they do not hold a monopoly over Broadband for the Hull area but due to the higher wholesale prices (Price Fixing) for ADSL compared to the rest of the country. Competition will not enter the area stating it does not make any economic and viable sense. This then stifles any competition in the area and affectively creating the monopoly that we see today. Resulting in us (the customers) being left with the choice of one provider with limited and costly connections isolating us from other providers which offer more competative rates.",
