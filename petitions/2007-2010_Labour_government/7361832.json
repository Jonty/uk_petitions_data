        "background": "I suggest that the government create a member led Football Association.  \n\nThe new people's FA will have charity status.  It will be owned by its share holders - the FA members - who can become a member for \u00a3100.  Each member will have voting rights to appoint the FA board and the new England manager.  Only by creating a democratic, fan owned, FA, can we save our national game from humilation, corporate greed and salvage some pride back for England's national football team.",
