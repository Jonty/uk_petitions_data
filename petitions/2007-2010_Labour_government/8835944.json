Zoe and Moshi are just 13 years of age. They escaped Zimbabwe in July 2001 from harrowing circumstances which they had to endure whilst living the Zimbabwe under the \u201ccare\u201d of an abusive father. Under the laws of any other European state this would not be allowed. If we do not act now these two innocent young children and their mother shall suffer once again. They need your help.",
