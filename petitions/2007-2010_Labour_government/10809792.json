        "action": "Remove the expectation that 50% of students will attend a university, and provide more vocationally-based learning schemes.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Currently the government is aiming that 50% of students will attend a  university. \n\nHowever, only approximately 30% of students are achieving 5 A*-C  passes at GCSE.  \n\nTherefore there is the government's intention to ensure that 40% of the student university population are demonstrably not academically-inclined.   \n\nThis is a gross waste of a scarce education resource. \nIt will make it harder for those with the abilities to get their appropriate place at a university.\nIt will also cause a significant part of the student population to needlessly be both disappointed and in debt. \n\nProviding further vocational training courses / apprenticeships will improve the ability of Great Britain plc to pull its own weight in the future,  without relying on mass immigration of trained artisans, who may be better employed serving their own countries.",
