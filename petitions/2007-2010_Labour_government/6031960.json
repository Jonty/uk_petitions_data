            "background": "Crest Nicholson,  a national builder, is currently completing a building project in Woodmancote , near Cheltenham in Gloucestershire.  There have been many contentious issues with existing local residents during the development of the Woodmancote site, but none has caused more universal condemnation than the perceived eyesore that has been created where the building work intrude upon Bushcombe Lane. The unnecessarily high profile of the houses, their closeness to the Lane are totally out of keeping with the rest of the housing in the lane. This, together with the introduction of an ill conceived and potentially unsafe pedestrian access have turned a beautiful semi rural setting into a disgraceful blot on the landscape. The developers their Architects, and the Tewkesbury Borough Council stolidly refused to enter into any sort of dialogue or communication with the local residents.",
