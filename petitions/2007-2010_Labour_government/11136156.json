            "background": "During this period of economic uncertainty the government is planning billions of pounds worth of investment (Gordons fiscal stimulus).  I propose the building of 2 international rail terminals, one in the Northwest and another in Scotland.  These will provide jobs to the building industry and help achieve UK\u2019s carbon commitments by removing freight from the roads.  Once the recession is over these new transport links will provide the northwest and Scotland key economic transport links reaching further into the rest of Europe.",
