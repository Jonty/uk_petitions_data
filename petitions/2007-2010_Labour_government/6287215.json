        "background": "Given the operational difficulties of deploying Prince William and Prince Harry to combat zones, their officer training and background would be better utilised within the UK. A secondment from the British Army to either the RLNI or Coast Guard would enhance their skills and would be a great boost to both organisations - ensuring that the money invested in their training benefits local communities and all seamen in trouble around our shores.",
