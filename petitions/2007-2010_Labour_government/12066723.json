        "background": "Cardiff County Council are planning to close Eglwys Newydd Primary School, we are against this because; The only reason for these proposals is political, to raise finance from the sale of the prime development land at Eglwys Newydd. Will your child get a place? - the proposed new primary would accommodate 420 pupils. There are currently over 600 on roll at Eglwys Newydd and Eglwys Wen. In the region of 180 children may be forced to move to alternative schools. Whitchurch High would decrease from a 12 form entry to 9, would your child be guaranteed a place? Catchment areas would be redrawn to force take up at other schools. Children's education will be disrupted. \nWhy spend millions (a ball park figure of around \u00a310m has been unofficially suggested) on a new building.\nExperienced Teachers and Staff will not be guaranteed their jobs at the new school. We already have a deficit of green spaces compared to other suburbs.\nThis petition has been created to campaign against these reorganization proposals, to do this we need the support of the local community, pupils, ex pupils & businesses in Whitchurch. & AM's / MP's !",
