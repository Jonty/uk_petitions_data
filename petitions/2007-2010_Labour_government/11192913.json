            "background": "On a recent visit to Madam Tussauds I was horrified to see a wax statue of Robert Mugabe, especially as this was in the same area as J F Kennedy and Nelson Mandela.  I am, therefore, petitioning the government to get this removed.  I would suggest that it is relocated in the Chamber of Horrors, together with fellow murderers such as Jack the Ripper.  Or, better still, have the statue melted down and turned into candles. These could then be sent to Zimbabwe.  In a country which receives, on average, 5-6 hours electricity per day, these could provide the much needed light at the end of the tunnel.",
