            "background": "We request the Government introduce emergency legislation to regulate business activity and protect British jobs and counter the negative impact of globalisation from outsourcing.In this sense, protection against widening social unrest and instability must consider the impact of sending work to other countries during an economic recession.\nThe Government have a 'duty of care' to its own indigenous population who must during these times take precedence over EU and other national interests. In this sense, protectionist policies are immediately called for to avoid serious damage being inflicted on social infrastructures.",
