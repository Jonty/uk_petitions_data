            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This week, the CBI suggested that university students should pay more for their tuition fees. The increased figures suggested were between \u00a35,000 and \u00a320,000 per year. The average student debt at the end of university is currently between \u00a317000 and \u00a325000. In this recession, the suggestion to charge students even more for their vital education, rather than taking fairer measures, such as public spending cuts or caps on bank bosses bonuses is, in truth, ludicrous. Universities have spent the past decade trying to eradicate social divides amongst their students; a rise in fees would undo all this work, and return universities to an elitist nature. We therefore urge that, should a rise in fees be essential, it is limited to under \u00a34000 per annum.",
