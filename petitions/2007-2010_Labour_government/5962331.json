        "background": "As you may know across parks across the country children use swings and roundabouts and many other things to play on.Many of these create/use movement similar to that of windfarms and other renewable energy source.I propose that they are connected up so they produce power,although not much power would be created by one park alone most villages across the country have at least 1 park and many have more so it would produce lots of energy and would not effect the childrens enjoyment and is an environmentally friendly power source.",
