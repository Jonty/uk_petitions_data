            "background": "\"The British government is considering plans to strip South Africa of its 'visa-free' status this year because of rampant corruption in the Department of Home Affairs.\nSouth Africa leapt to the top of the British government's visa 'hit list' last month following a British trial which heard that at least 6000 illegal Asian immigrants had been smuggled in on South African passports.\" -The South African press: Mail & Guardian/The Citizen/IOL News. \n\nThe UK government's initial response - to impose a visa on SA visitors - indicates the seriousness with which it views this. As South Africans, we also recognise these concerns and hope the UK government's sentiments spur the South African government into decisive action in ridding its Home Affairs department of corruption.\n\nHowever this course of action is fundamentally unjust as it punishes the majority of honest South Africans for government's blunders.\n\nAs South Africans, we therefore call on the British government to consider careful screening of SA visitors instead of imposing a blanket visa requirement.",
