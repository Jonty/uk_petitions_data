            "background": "We, the public, are paying Trading Standards to police counterfeiting offences under criminal law. This benefits the large brand corporations who are largely offshore and who pay no UK tax. All damages as a result of counterfeiting are recoverable in UK civil courts. Why should the public purse pay for legal action in support of protecting these companies' purely commercial interests? Trading Standards command a huge budget to look after these private sector interests.Trading Standard's size could be reduced or they could prosecute 'rogue traders' in the UK more frequently. As it is, individual members of the public have to finance their own civil actions for recompense from traders who breach regulations while global corporations use public funds. This cannot be right.",
