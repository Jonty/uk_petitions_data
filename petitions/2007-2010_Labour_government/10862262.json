        "background": "Following the Channel Tunnel Fire it is imperative to reinstate the Train Ferry vessel Nord pas de Calais to run from Dover Western Docks to Dunkerque for the transportation of Hazardous Chemicals between the United Kingdom and France.  Road haulage and fire risks in the Eurotunnel would be reduced, by rail and sea transport. Rail freight of chemicals ought to for safety ply the English Channel instead of travel in HGVs on Eurotunnel wagons  in the Chunnel.",
