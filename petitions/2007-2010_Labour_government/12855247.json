Voting is a hard-won privelige, people have forgoten this and are effectively as disenfranchised as they were when only the upper-classes had the vote. Measures need to be taken to overcome apathy, and to show the incumbent politicians just what level of popular support they have. 40% of the votes cast is meaningless if only 20% of the population could be bothered to vote. It goes without saying that it should be made as easy to vote as is possible: postal and internet voting should be an option for all.",
