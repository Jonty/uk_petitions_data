        "background": "The HST 125s which run up and down the country all year round in any weather have now all been updated with new engines which mean they can run for another 30 years. The trains are capable of 140mph if the line allows it. Therefore instead of using funds to build a new train which will cost lot of money with very little actual gain why not spend the money developing the current fleet.",
