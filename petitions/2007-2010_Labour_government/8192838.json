            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Again we are told that violent crime is the lowest it's been for years and that the situation is improving.  We've banned hanguns, made it illegal to carry knives.  Unfortunately none of this and other current legislation will prevent violent criminals committing violent crimes.  CRIMINALS DO NOT OBEY LAWS AND LEGISLATION.\nUnfortunatley I believe that the current society is past saving, the only way to deal with the current 'race' of violent criminals is damage limitation: harder punishment and extra policing.\nMy proposal to the govournment is to treat the problem at source.  Use our money (the tax payer) to actively encourage the victims of violent crime to hold educational seminars in primary schools throughout the whole of the UK, twice annually.\nI believe that by educating children before they become criminals themselves, about the effects of violent crime and witness first hand the impact it has on the victim's and their families would be a positive step in the right direction.  The objective: Breed-out the violent criminals over time.",
