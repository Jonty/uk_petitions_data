            "background": "Having got into debt in the first instance to get through University, the individual finds as incomes increase (only very marginally may I add) the burden of repaying student loan debt, very difficult affecting their ability to buy a property,rent a property, pay general bills etc etc. If repayments on student loans were caped at an affordable amount, it would make life much easier to plan for. Id suggest the maximum repayment for individuals should be \u00a375 a month. Over a lifetime of work therefore (25 years say) the student would most likely repay most, if not all, student loans debt. \u00a375 pounds is still a significant amount of money.",
