        "background": "Over the last decade, the democratic freedoms that we have been used to, have been whittled away. Stringent anti-terrorism legislation has been used to spy on some British people for alleged non-terror related activity. The Police have raided Parliament, and arrested a senior Opposition politician. We need an independent review of what legislative/organisational changes have driven this, and what recommendations are necessary to address this. If this is to be perceived as being independent, this can not be performed by someone who is closely attached to the government in power, and both Paddy Ashdown and John Major are widely respected figures who would approach this from an independent persepctive.",
