            "background": "If rentals could be assured for (say) 5 - 10 years, could an amount equivalent to the tax relief which used to be given for mortgages, be collected to provide a lump sum as down payment for a mortgage. \nIt would be neccessary to guard against fraund (e.g. children renting from their parents) The rents would need to be registered at the outset, to be sure that no artifical inflation is used to make unreasonable claims. I think that this should be administered via the tax system, and only one application per person in a lifetime.",
