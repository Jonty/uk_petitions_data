            "background": "There are plans for the car parks in Dulverton, Somerset, to be managed in future by the County not the Town Council. Apart from taking away the local control and devolution which is encouraged in all recent legislation, there will be cuts in local services, increased charges and congestion, loss of trade to the town, and a less sustainable local community.",
