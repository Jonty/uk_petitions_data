        "background": "TV broadcasts are increasingly being disfigured by the addition of digital on-screen logos (\"DOGs\") which identify the channel.  We are told that these provide brand awareness, assist with tuning, and that viewers generally welcome them.  I contend that the visual intrusion caused by these logos far exceeds any benefit they may bring to the viewer, and there is no tuning benefit in the era of digital TV.  No evidence has been produced to backup the assertion that viewers approve of the logos.  They must GO.",
