            "background": "All too often at motorcycle gatherings around the country there is a police presence to prevent excessive speeding and dangerous driving however all to often the police are in secluded areas, that causes more problems. I petition the Prime Minister to stop this action, safety is compromised if police are not on view and are hidden away out of sight. If police need to have a presence it should be a visible one for riders to take note of there particular riding habiits and it will reduce the urge to speed.",
