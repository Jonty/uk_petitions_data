            "background": "We believe that Single Sex education establishments should be banned, We believe that while statistics show minor advantage to single sex education, they also lead to a culture of gender separation, sexism and backward views regarding the roles of individuals in society.\n\nAll boys schools produce disproportionally large numbers of individuals in high positions in Government, Media and Business and, due to sexist attitudes earned in later their youth, exacerbate this imbalance. Removal of single sex institutions would lead to young men and women to learn the role of both genders in a professional environment rather than creating segregation.\nThe benefits of such a set up is far greater than any negative implications.",
