The Electorial Administration Act is unjust, excluding the public from involvment with their own pollitical system.\n\nFurthermore, the Electorial Administration Act is unlawful. The 1689 Bill of Rights, which clearly and unambiguously states that\n\n'That election of members of Parliament ought to be free.'\n\nAny parliament so corrupted that illegal fees are charged for election unto that parliament is, therefore, unlawful, and any statues produced by said parliament shall not be recognised by the free-men of the UK.",
