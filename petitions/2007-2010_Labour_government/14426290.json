In practical terms it\u2019s a situation which can only be resolved by negotiation or mediation. \n\nHowever, the negotiations have been an unequal contest, and what has happened is that the Government of a tiny country of less than 400,000 people has been bullied by its neighbours, especially the UK and the Netherlands.\n\nConsider what it would mean for us (increasing the sums of money at stake to reflect our far greater population). We would be proposing to repay a \u00a3700 billion loan. We would be suggesting that we should divert 10% of our taxes from public expenditure to repaying debt.\n\nWe would not accept it, and neither should it be imposed on the people of Iceland.",
