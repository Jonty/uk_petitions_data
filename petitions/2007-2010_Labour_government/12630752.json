            "background": "Mps are right to call for The Speakers resignation and a need for more transparency e.g The Speakers attempt to block details of MPs' \u00a35m-a-year travel expenses being released under the Freedom of Information Act. I personally had no idea MPs could claim such ridiculous amounts and with Micheal Martin at the helm I doubt he'd go out of his way to fix what is so obviously broken, therefore this petition is to get rid of The speaker and to show that the people will no longer ignore how wasteful these \"civil servants\" and the system they abuse have become.",
