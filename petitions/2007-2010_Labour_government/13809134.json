            "background": "Primates are still allowed to be kept as pets in the UK, this is not right. These animals are highly intelligent, group animals and should not be kept in cages in peoples houses. They belong in their natural environment. They are not baby substitutes and can be dangerous. The law currently allows many species of captive bred animals to be sold and kept as pets in the UK, but there is no way to tell where the animals came from. Even if they are captive-bred, primates need very specialist care and are susceptible to metabolic diseases if not fed the correct diet. Some primate species do require licensing under the Dangerous Wildlife Legislation, but this type of legislation is hard to enforce. Therefore, rather than have wishy-washy legislation that only partially protects some species, why not have a total ban on keeping these beautiful creatures as pets? The RSPCA are on board, we just need the Government to follow!",
