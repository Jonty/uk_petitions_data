            "background": "This judge has proved he is a human being, something sadly lacking the judges we have in this country who are appointed under a system of disgusting 'old boy' patronage and not in any way based on how they deal with offenders.  This country needs to start doling out punishments which fit the crime and Judge Graddick has proved that he is able to do that.  This man is badly needed by the non-criminal population of this country, because of the way criminals and criminality is being nurtured and rewarded by the lack of any probitive action against criminals by our political leaders.",
