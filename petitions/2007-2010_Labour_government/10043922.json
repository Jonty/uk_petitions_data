        "background": "Arts Council England has recently abandoned the \u201carm\u2019s length policy\u201d and is now shaping the artistic landscape according to fashion and its own \u201cstrategic objectives\u201d.  As a precursor to this it abolished artist peer panels and monitoring, and officers are now answerable only to themselves.  We urge the government to take a firm hand on this issue.  We want to see a reassertion of respect for the artist and a perspective that assumes the practitioner to be at the centre of artistic process in all disciplines.  We want to see peer panels and monitoring reinstated as soon as is practically possible.",
