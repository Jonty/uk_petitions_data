            "background": "Our armed forces are some of the most dedicated and professional personnel in the world. They are currently serving across the globe for the interests of our nation. However, due to the fact that there is no trade union or some other representative neutral body that can have the average soldier heard, gross instances of corruption and maltreatment occur without any chance of representation. This is outrageous and I speak on behalf of all the soldiers that have fought for our country to have only found that they are victim to some form of bureacratic injustice from the unbending military authorities.",
