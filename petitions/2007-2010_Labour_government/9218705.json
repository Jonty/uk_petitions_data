        "action": "Change immigration laws so immigrants have to work accumulatively 5 years before being allowed to claim any benefit or use NHS",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "After looking at the true sense of the problem within the UK and understanding only 8p per immigrant is adding to the economy its apparent we have to do something.  If stopping immigration isn\u2019t the answer then implementing a system to make Britain a lesser target for health care or benefit seekers is the only answer.  \n\nI propose a faultless legal contract, that once nationality has been granted, they can only use the benefits system i.e. NHS, Job seekers or any tax payers money, if they have worked and added to the economy for a cumulative number of at least 5 years and paid an additional fee of \u00a32000.00 to the government for deportation in case of any illegal propaganda that is found out by the government or its bodies.\n\nI also propose that long term job seekers or benefit seekers, say 6 months, that are able to work should be made to clean the streets or do jobs they might not consider otherwise.  If they refuse to work any of the proposed jobs then benefits will be suspended.",
