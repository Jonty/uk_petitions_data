Police offers were treated in a disgusting manner and these fans have ruined the beutiful game with their unruly behaviour. The Rangers fans' showed the authorities absolutly no respect. All English fans are tarnished with the same brush and us as English football fans that want to attend games to enjoy the sport and not cause un-neccessary trouble do not want to be branded as 'hooligans' and 'thugs' inthe same way these Rangers fans have proven themselves to be.",
