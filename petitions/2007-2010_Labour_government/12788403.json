            "background": "The current planning rules give a maximum guidance on parking provision for new developments. The assumption is that people do not want cars. This assumption is wrong the consequence being that people do own cars and it makes streets inaccesible, cluttered and encourages crime. A change to the planning regulations will prevent this, and make new developments more spacious.",
