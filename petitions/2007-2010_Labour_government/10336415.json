        "background": "During the last few weeks The Six Mile River, Northern Ireland has seen the biggest ever fish kill of its kind. Millions of fish were killed due to local businesses careless disposal of chemical waste, NOTHING has been done about it. Further more if the culprits were caught a small fine would be the final result. What we need now is an organisation to fight for the protection of these rivers and ensure higher fines and prison sentences are imposed on the perpetrators, at the moment it is cheaper for those responsible to pay a light fine than to properly and legally dispose of this waste which ends up in Lough Neagh (a major supply of our drinking water).",
