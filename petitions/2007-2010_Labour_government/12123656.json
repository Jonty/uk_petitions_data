But it must be immediate. To wait until the next general election is unacceptable.\n\nAll MP's expenses must be stopped immediately until a thorough and transparent investigation in undertaken by an external auditor. MP's investigating MP's will not appease the public.\n\nAny MP found to be abusing the system, must return every penny they have claimed.",
