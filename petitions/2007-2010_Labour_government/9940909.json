The mounting cost of food and fuel itself is excruciating for people now. There are thousands of parents live around the proposed congestion charge place who wants to take their children to school and nursery and just imagine how much will affect them paying 1200 pounds per year for that reason alone. We have to remember one thing these people are not celebrities or high earned employers. Please scrap the proposal for sake of poor and middle class of people of this region.",
