They certainly do not deserve it, especially as they have paid themselves such large sums in previous years.\nMaybe set a similar limit to Obama, say half a million pounds maximum total remuneration (even this is too much).  If they don't like it, are they really going to get another job after such poor performance?\nLet them feel lucky they still have a job, unlike many people who now don't!",
