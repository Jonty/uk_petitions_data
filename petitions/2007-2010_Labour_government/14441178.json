If they want a medal they should do at least 6 months frontline service - just like all the brave soldiers out there.\nStart making medals for the families who have lost their loved ones, the people who have served their country and are no longer able to be in active service.\nThese medals you are handing out are a disgrace and it makes a mockery of the boys & girls who still await their medals months after their tours.",
