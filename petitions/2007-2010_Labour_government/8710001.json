            "background": "The organisation known as Cafcass is a unfair and very biased organisation which does not look into all the fact when making a decision on whether a parent can usually see a child or not.\nIn this modern age there is no room for a organisation like cafcass to exist and this should be replaced by a councellor who looks at all the facts and meet all the relatives of the children involved including step parents, grandparents and relatives instead of making a decision on what one disgruntled parent might say. Also cafcass have recently made decisions which in many cases have completely banned Fathers and in some cases Mothers from seeing their children - Children are then abandoned by Cafcass and this in turn is creating a society where is is becoming the norm for children to grow up without knowing both parents. This must not be allowed to continue for the sake of the children and a better fairer system must be created which is fair to both parents and children alike",
