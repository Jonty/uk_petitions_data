            "background": "Pay-by-phone has been pushed in Westminster City Council, yet this form of payment is socially exclusive, towards people without mobile phones or credit cards, or do not want a mobile phone, or cannot get a credit card due to their status, an example being a 16 year old riding a moped who is now excluded from parking legally and is at risk of receiving a parking ticket.\n\nThis method of payment for parking services also goes against Dept. of Transport - Operational Guidance to Local Authorities: Parking Policy and Enforcement: Traffic Management Act 2004\n\n\"It is important that authorities do not introduce a system that inadvertently discriminates against some sections of the population. The system should allow motorists to pay by whatever method is most convenient to them, including: cash; cheques sent by post with out a cheque guarantee card; cheque supported by a cheque guarantee card at a payments centre; Sterling travellers' cheque; and debit or credit card in person, by phone or via internet\"\n\nIt is also unfair to get people to pre-register with the scheme and store their details on computer systems that are not even in the UK.",
