            "background": "We pay over 50p per litre of fuel to the government yet our road network is underfunded to the tune of \u00a31bn a year, or 50% of their required budget. On top of this councils are spending \u00a350m on compensation claims for damaged vehicles and personal injuries. Yet, on average, it takes 61 years for a given road to be resurfaced in England. We call on the government to spend the money we pay to use the roads on repairing them to a condition which is satisfactory and safe to all road users. From fuel duty alone the government receives over \u00a326bn per year, and they receive another \u00a35bn from vehicle exercise duty. Is it too much to ask that an adequate amount of this is spent repairing our roads?",
