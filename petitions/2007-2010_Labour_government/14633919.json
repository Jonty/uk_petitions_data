            "background": "Tailgating is driving so closely to a vehicle in front that it would be impossible to avoid a pileup in the event that the front car has to stop suddenly.  It is an aggressive form of behaviour and can be very intimidating, particularly if the following vehicle is a lorry.  The police should take vigorous action when it is seen, supported by the law which should specify a minimum 12-month driving ban for the offender.",
