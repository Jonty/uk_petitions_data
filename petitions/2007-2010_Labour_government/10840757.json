This is to the cost of the tax payer and \u00a3300million could be spent better elsewhere.  Why can't these children use the facilities at libraries and schools, which is much more beneficial to more people.  Also who is to say that the access to internet at home will prove productive to the children as we cannot guaruntee that it will not be abused.",
