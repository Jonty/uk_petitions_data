Just ask people involved with the programme Bad Lads Army  they turned those lads into different people they learnt respect for others. So why not give it a trial period. After all it works in other countries and they don't seem to have the young people problems on the scale we seem to have in this country. Bring back respect and reasonable behaviour so we can feel safe on our streets. People can then feel that we can hold a coversation with the younger generation and not get a mouth full of abuse.",
