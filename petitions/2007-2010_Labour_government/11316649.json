        "background": "Here in the u.k we are allowed to throw away our rubbish for free.  In Switzerland, each rubbish bag must be marked with a sticker at the cost of about one euro per sticker. As a result, the Swiss think twice about throwing a can of coke or plastic bottle into the rubbish instead of into the recycling bin.  I believe bringing in a system similar to the one the Swiss use will dramatically reduce household waste and lead to an increase in recycling.",
