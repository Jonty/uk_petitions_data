            "background": "These plans are just a stealth tax on the motorist, and will do little to reduce the death toll on the UK's roads. Many of these roads that are susceptible to this new speed limit are, in the right conditions, perfectly safe to drive on at 60mph. \n\nWhy not spend the money on improving the driving test standard, as can be seen by the lower death tolls in Scandinavian countries such as Norway and Sweden, where the driving test is almost impossible compared to our doddle of a test. \n\nThe money should also be spent on encouraging people to use common sense when driving and not to take un-necessary risks.",
