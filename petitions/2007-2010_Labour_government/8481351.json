        "action": "ensure that the Premier League do not take the national sport away from its fans",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Premier League have proposed plans to add one additional overseas fixture to each Premier League team's fixture list.\n\nThe only people who will benefit from this circus are the Premier League's chief executive and the money-grabbing owners of the clubs.\n\nSomething must be done to ensure that our beloved sport is not franchised, prostituted and sold to the highest bidder.\n\nAndy Burnham, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport has said: \"The implications of this proposal go beyond the Premier League.\"\n\nHe added: \"Playing an extra game also raises questions about the integrity of our competition.\n\n\"The Premier League brings great benefits to Britain. But its success today is established on the tradition of local club support, built up over generations. The game must never forget its roots.\"\n\nMillions of people up and down the country watch football every week, so to sell just one fixture sets a distrubing precedent for the future of the game in this country.\n\nTogether there is a chance that we can make a difference and keep Premier League football in its home country, where it belongs.",
