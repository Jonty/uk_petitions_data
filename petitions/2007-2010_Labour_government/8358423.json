            "background": "Canadian singer/songwtiter Neil Young  is now in his 42nd year as a major artist in the music world. It would be fair to say he is now an icon with no equal. he has remained a Canadian citizen despite living in the USA for decades, in fact he now makes a point telling everyone this at his US concerts. He is also vehemently anti drugs (Sir Paul & Sir Mick were not!!) Recognition is long overdue! It's time to make him Sir Neil. Yes what we are asking for is a Knighthood for the man. He deserves it.",
