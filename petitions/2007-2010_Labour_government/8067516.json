            "background": "At the moment People with mental health problems leave hospital after having their medication sorted out to help them lead a normal life. But after a few weeks some clients decide that they are well and stop taking their medication.Now they are out in the community there is very little follow up. After a few weeks of no or little medication the clients mental state deteriates and in some cases they cause harm to themselves and others.In America clients are paid to take their medication which is monitored to make sure it happens.Some of the most severe cases just need a two weekly injection called a depot which helps them immmensly. If part of their disability allowance was held back until they got their medication it would cut down on admissions to hospital and make their life in the community a lot better and safer.",
