            "action": "Both stimulate the Building Market and provide a means for House Purchase by introducing a market wide scheme where the Bank or Building Society will retain a minimum share of the Property thus removing the difficult task for many of obtaining a deposit. The recent financial crisis has removed almost all deals available to purchasers at the same time the house prices have remained relatively high. Such a scheme already exists in Scotland but called LIFT and is backed by the Scottish Goverment. I believe that a nationwide scheme operated through the main providers and backed by the Goverment would be a way of stimulating this market for all concerned.",
