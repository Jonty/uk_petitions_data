What should be a story of economic development as is the rest of Asia, we see a country of incredible poverty. The WHO (World Health Organisation) have said that per head of population only $10 is spent on health. One NGO has said it may be nearer $0.50. It is a country which in 1990 elected the NLD, lead by Aung Sun Suu Kyi who has been imprisoned for 11 years, into power. But was ignored by the generals. 1988,the last time such protests took place over 3000 people died, murdered by the army. We must do something. Sign this petition",
