        "background": "This is an unfair tax and should be scraped. The majority of Britain already has Broadband which has had to be paid for by its subscribers and therefore the introduction of a \"broadband tax\" is deemed to be unfair and unjust and any costs for the development of broadband to outlaying areas should be met by the Internet Service Providers and Telecommunication companies who will be the ones who will benefit from providing these services. Furthermore we urge the Prime Minister to consider and full and public consulation into the Digital Britain report and such consultation should be widely publicised.",
