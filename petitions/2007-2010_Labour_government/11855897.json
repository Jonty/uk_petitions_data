If they were to try to help these indusrties rather than systematically run them into the ground or desert them and leave them to fend for themselves until they can say 'this industry isn't working, lets sell it!' maybe we could put the 'Great' back into 'Great Britain' and have a set of state companies we could once again be proud of.",
