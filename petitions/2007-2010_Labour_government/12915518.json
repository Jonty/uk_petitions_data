        "action": "introduce a new \u201cCouncil Super tax\u201d to be levied on the very highest value properties based on their value in excess of the threshold of the top council tax band.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "After a decade of unprecedented prosperity for the wealthiest in society, many have accumulated vast fortunes built on the back of the bogus boom created by some of their number. Much of this wealth has been capitalised into properties with astronomical values.\nTo preserve civic infrastructure and community cohesion a new \u201cCouncil Super tax\u201d should be introduced to maintain Local Authority finances. On first assessment it would be charged to the property owner at 1% on that part of a residence\u2019s council tax valuation that exceeds the top council tax band threshold and thereafter be indexed annually by the RPI.\nTo appease many band H property owners a new super band I could be introduced commencing at 50% above the current upper limit and the new super tax would commence above this threshold.\nThe tax would be easy to incept involving the revaluation of a very small proportion of properties. The tax would be very difficult to avoid and strict rules would prevent bogus subdivision of properties into lower value units. I anticipate that several billions of pounds might be raised annually.",
