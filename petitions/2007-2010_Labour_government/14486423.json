            "background": "Tier 4 student visas system needs reforming. The current system shifts responsibility away from the government by giving some of the responsibility of managing immigration to schools that recruit the student. Given the potential risk that the current system poses we are petitioning that as a part of the point system a risk factor is added based on previous immigration history in the UK, any criminal history, country of nationality, and anything in the background that might indicate a higher risk. In addition, we ask that the number of students that come from high-risk countries are limited. Third we ask that student visas are limited to no more than four years with the requirement that the student returns home if after completing their studies they do not qualify for Tier 1 General or Tier 1 Post-Study visas. Finally, we ask that students that pose a high risk are not allowed to undertake certain studies such as engineering, natural sciences, or medicine.",
