        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Dunham Toll bridge toll gates are unprotected from the weather and are on a slope making it dangerous for motorcyclists to stop and hand over cash to the attendants.  Motorcycles have no handbrake so the machine has to be balanced and held in place whilst removing gloves to find 10p - all the more dangerous in inclement weather as visors mist up, gloves are difficult to put back on wet hands,etc.",
