            "background": "I am a gay teenager and I have been subjected to bullying at my school in Scotland. But it's not just in Scotland that bullying of LGBT pupils happens, it's all over Britain that this sick act happens. Everyone is equal no matter what their sexuality is. All the people who think that it's unholy, I'm sorry but it's how God made us, and we are not ashamed. It's so upsetting being bullied because you are different from someone else because they are straight.. how does that work? They are different to you but would LGBT pupils bully a straight person? No! Because there is no need. I have straight friends so I don't hate or dislike or disapprove of hetrosexual people. Bullying of LGBT pupil and people is not fun, it's disgusting and I think the Government should put a stop to this!\nLove Mark xx",
