        "background": "Dog owners are generally decent people. But with the increased wave of small violent dogs, those used by some as 'Status Symbols', has come a tendancy to not put them on leads in public places. Amazingly I have come across some who do not even have a lead for their dog.\nIt's not about your dog being dangerous or violent, it's just aboutcommon courtesy and manners. My dog was in season recently and the amount of dogs I had to fend off with my foot was appalling.",
