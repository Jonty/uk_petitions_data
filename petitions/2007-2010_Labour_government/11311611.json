            "background": "This is not a bail-out: This well-run company is not asking for hand-outs, but loans or guarantees at commercial rates to enable it to get on with developing high quality cars.\n\nTata invests heavily in JLR: JLR itself made a \u00a3327 million operating profit in 2007 and \u00a3310 million operating profit in the first half of 2008. Tata is a socially responsible owner and has invested heavily in JLR since acquiring it in June 2008.\n\nIt\u2019s the green choice: JLR accounts for 50% of all R&D in the UK auto industry, working with suppliers and universities to cut carbon emissions. It has an investment programme of around \u00a3800 million in environmental technologies. The UK\u2019s industrial future needs high value engineering skills, which could be lost forever if JLR fails.\n\nJLR is the heart of UK manufacturing: It supports 15,000 jobs in its own business as well as 60,000 at suppliers and dealers.  JLR spends \u00a32.5 billion a year with suppliers and exports over \u00a34 billion in products.\n\nThe deal makes financial sense: Lost income (income tax, VAT, etc) could cost the taxpayer \u00a32 billion. A loan or loan guarantee, would be less than \u00a31 billion, repaid at commercial rates within a year to 18 months.",
