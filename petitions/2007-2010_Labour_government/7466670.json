            "background": "The things that people fail their driving tests for today are shocking and costly. People failed for not driving fast enough or going too fast, changing gear at the wrong time, and not pulling out fast enough! Things we know we all do every day the list is endless and ridiculous. Also these tests cost up to \u00a3100 not to mention the \u00a325 lessons, And for those who do pass do you really drive as perfect as you do in your test? And who takes notice of most of the things you were taught? Like reverse round a corner, constant mirror checking and speeding. It needs to change; it needs to be easier to pass.",
