            "background": "John Smeaton is a baggage handler at Glasgow International Airport. He became involved in thwarting a would-be terrorist attack on the airport and later gave television interviews to the BBC, ITV and CNN which were broadcast worldwide.\n\nIn television interviews, Smeaton said his first thought after witnessing the attack was:\n\u201cWhat's the score? I've got to get this sorted.\u201d\n\nAfter he saw the police grappling with one of the attackers, he thought:\n\u201cYou\u2019re no hitting the Polis mate, there's nae chance.\u201d\n\nand described his actions:\n\u201cSo I ran straight towards the guy, we're all trying to get a kick-in at him, take a boot to subdue the guy.\u201d\n\nAsked by ITV News what his message to terrorists was, he said\n\u201cGlasgow doesn't accept this. That's just Glasgow; we'll set about ye.\"\n\nThis man has shown that as Britons we are not going to stand back and accept terrorism and for that we believe he should be honoured appropriately",
