            "background": "i believe that the expansion of Heathrow is an unwise decision.  We are currently without high speed train services between our major cities while many European nations have wisely invested in such infrastructure. A lot of Heathrows air traffic is in the form of short haul flights from Paris, Glasgow etc.  A plus side from such a vast amount of spending on such an ambitious public project would be job security for many tens of thousands of people.  A project such as this would be extremelly expensive and require many years to be completed.  There would be many benefits however such as creation of new jobs and job security for thousands; less short duration flights at airports as people would have another alternative; shortening of travel time between say Glasgow to London (remember flying includes all time sitting around in the airport, getting there, security....etc); something worthwhile for the future, far more economically friendly, and far more environmentally friendly (trains = electricity = green sources....planes do not).",
