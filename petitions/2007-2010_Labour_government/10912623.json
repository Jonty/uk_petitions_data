            "action": "- SET CENTRAL LONDON FREE - Set Central London free from the Congestion Charge and any Workplace Parking Levies. Abolish the current scheme, refuse any council or Mayor TIF or other application, oppose any further congestion charging and any parking taxes in Central London, provide no funding for them, and require a referendum before the council or Mayor can introduce them.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "SAY NO to any congestion charges or workplace parking charges IN CENTRAL LONDON.\n\nSet Central London and its roads and surroundings free. No road pricing taxes here. No workplace parking charges. No new council taxes on parking. No new road tolls. No tax on travel. No government bribes to coerce travellers onto inconvenient and expensive public transport.\n\nCongestion charging is very inconvenient for the user. The Central London scheme only makes a profit due to penalties. Other schemes could lead to unexpected large debts with no way to dispute them. How can a driver know in advance how much a journey will cost?\n\nRoad pricing and workplace parking charges are not about reducing congestion, but pricing private cars off the road. They damage business, commuting and social activity. They hurt most those least able to pay. They require a vast expensive and intrusive monitoring system. This is an intolerable interference with our freedom.\n\nIf the council or Mayor is determined to press ahead, then let the people of Central London decide in a fair referendum whether they want any congestion charging or new parking taxes.",
