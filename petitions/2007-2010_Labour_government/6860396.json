Some of the 'residents' were buried 150 years ago and the recent ones were buried 1961. Many cemeteries are under threat, ancestors dug up and blocks of flats built on top, this is outrageous and must not happen to any more of our precious ancestors resting place. Tower Hamlets is no different we must act now to preserve this Cemetery and put an end to ant speculation regarding it's future. Some of us still have 'recent' residents there and tend to their graves regularly, it would be heartbreaking to lose those loved ones resting places.",
