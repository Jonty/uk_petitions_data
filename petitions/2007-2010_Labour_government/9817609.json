Bring the control of prices under government bodies who can raise/cut taxes and tariffs on products to encourage/discourage their use. Bodies that assess the safety/health of products could do the work, tariffs would pay for these extended duties. In practical terms, environmentally friendly versions of products (such as recycled toilet roll) would be kept cheaper than the alternatives. Unnecessary gadgets where there is a perfectly good manual products such as electric hedge trimmers would have a tariff such as 100% put on them. Unnecessary products such as plug in air fresheners would have a tariff such as 200% put on them. Unhealthy foods would have tariffs added to make them less attractive.\n\nA fundamental change is needed.",
