        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This is in response to a petition asking for these to be doubled for immigrants.  It's an obviously racist petition which repeats all the xenophobic - and unsourced! - statements of the tabloids about how much immigrants are (allegedy!) costing the country in the provision of various government services.  Don't BRITISH people - who, as I have pointed out at least twice before, did nothing to ensure being British - use government services? specifically all of us who were born here have benefited, all our lives, from free education and the provision of health at least to the extent of free visits to GPs and hospital.\n\nMost immigrants earn far less than most indigenous British people so how would they be able to afford to pay more tax and N.I.?  These deductions from salaries should continue to be graduated according to INCOME ONLY and NO OTHER factor.",
