        "action": "End the monitoring of international students in UK higher education",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Under a new series of rules in the UK, universities must monitor international students & report information back to UK Boarder Agency (UKBA). The trigger to report to UKBA is when a student \u2018misses 10 interactions\u2019. This means attendance at lectures, seminars & tutorials etc. It will have direct effects on the whole higher education system. Many universities are planning to apply the rules to all students to avoid imposing differential treatment; we are concerned this will impact on international students negatively, too.\n\nWe find the new system a violation of human rights & civil liberties. We want the Prime Minister to end this monitoring & to restore the human rights of \u2018liberty\u2019, \u2018no punishment without law\u2019, and \u2018the right to education\u2019.\n\nWe want the Prime Minister to send out information leaflets to all affected, detailing in clear language what the scheme entails & how it can be followed without infringing rights or compromising the quality of schooling.\nWe believe that the UK\u2019s excellence in higher education is owed in no small part to the diverse nature of its students & academic staff; this measure is a huge step backwards for the education system.",
