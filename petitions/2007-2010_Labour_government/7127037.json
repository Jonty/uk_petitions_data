            "background": "Despite tight regulations by the FSA, Loan companies are still selling costly payment protection insurance to consumers. this product can be purchased independant of any loan at a far reduced cost, and without any conflict of interest. How can a loan company with insurance targets be trusted to sell an appropriate product to a consumer, when their is such temptation to steer them into buying  a product that has the greatest financial gain for the commission based salesperson. Working within the industry I am aware of how inflated the premiums are, and how salespeople are still selling PPI in such a way that makes it hard for customers to say no.",
