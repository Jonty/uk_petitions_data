We would like to draw attention in particular to the findings of the report of 27th June 1994 Public Enquiry  submitted by A. R. Boyland who stated; Accordingly I have come to the conclusion on the principle issue that the proposed MSA would harm the character and appearance of the surrounding countryside, including views from public viewpoints on the hills overlooking it, and that such harm is not outweighed by the needs of motorists for an MSA on this site.",
