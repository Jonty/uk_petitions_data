            "background": "Access to many Government Agencies (NHS Direct, Customs & Revenue, DVLA), and Public Service Agencies (BBC)are increasingly being provided via NGN (Non Geographic Numbers).\n\nThis petition is to ask the Government to ensure that these agencies provide a Geographic Number for the following reasons.\n\n1. Many Landline operators provide an Inclusive Call Plan meaning that all Geographic Numbers called are charge free. 0845 numbers are chargeable and therefore contravene the Governments own guidelines (see statement below)\n\n2. Calling a NGN from a mobile phone or call box incurs an excessive fee (40-50p per minute in some cases) compared to calling from a landline and again contravenes the guidelines.\n\nThe government's position on call charges as extracted from the response to petion 15215 \"Ngn-use-by-gps\" is...\n\n..However, the message from the Department of Health has made it very clear to NHS organisations that patients should not be expected to pay more than the equivalent of a local call to contact their GPs.\n\nPlease therefore provide a Geographic number for important services.",
