        "background": "As the Prime Minister is no doubt aware,for a variety of reasons, many groups of people within this country, for a variety of reasons find it necessary to use prepayment meters for the supply of gas and electricity.The tariffs charged by the energy companies for the use of prepayment meters are significantly higher than those charged for monthly or quarterly billing, and this situation adversely affects those sections of the community least able to heat and light their homes adequately.I would therefore request that the Prime Minister makes a formal request to the energy companies to address this inequity as a matter of urgency.",
