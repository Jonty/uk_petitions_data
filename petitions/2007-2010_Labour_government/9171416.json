Quote BBC News: \"Lord Justice Scott Baker had told the jury that it was \"blindingly obvious\" her former butler had lied to them\". The inquest into Diana's death has cost millions of pounds while Paul Burrell's complicity in this matter seems to have been for his own personal gain. The prime minister should call upon the Metropolitan Police to collect evidence already available from the inquest while it is still fresh and charge Paul Burrell as soon as he re-enters the country.",
