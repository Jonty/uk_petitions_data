            "background": "This University has wasted 2 years of my and many other students life. There are so many things wrong with this University I do not know where to start. From not being able to timetable correctly, cancelled modules your year tutor does not know about, cancelled exams by giving wrong paper. Most of all though the fact that every lecture slide in certain classes is blantantly plagiarized from wikipedia which should be against the law. It is a disgrace and students should be given their fees back. I tried to apply to University abroad and it does not accept Abertay as proper qualification, though It takes into account my high school grades and college diploma.\nIf nothing is done about Abertay then it proves what many think that the government does not care about the standard of its education system.",
