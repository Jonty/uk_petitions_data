            "background": "Every pound of private sector investment generates more economic growth than a pound of public sector investment spent to reduce economic contraction.\n\nThe Government is keen to get lending going again but has required the Banks to re-capitalise. The withdrawal of funds from the system has led to a collapse of asset values which is spiraling out of control.  \n\nThe absence of cash is destroying the economy. At the same time, the Government wants to find effective ways of injecting capital into the economy. \n\nBut it owns banks which have the ability to offer mortgages and small business loans.  It needs EITHER to use them immediately to distribute the capital raised in Bond Auctions - or to explain to the Country why this can't be done. It seems so obvious.",
