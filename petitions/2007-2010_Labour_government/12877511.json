            "background": "A local petition against the proposed Eco community development at Rackheath in Norfolk has shown that all of the villagers in Salhouse, the village most impacted by this proposal, are against this development.  They are against it for the following reasons:\n\n1. The land is good grade agricultural land that will be needed for food production for the UK over the next decades as research shows that most countries will have to be self sufficient in food production by the middle of this century.\n2. The sustainability credential are flawed particularly the plans for small scale onshore wind turbines and the plans for large-scale bio mass generation.\n3. The local transport system, even with Section 106 enhancements, will not be able to cope with the inevitable increase in motor transportation.\n4. There are no strategic plans for the local Primary Care Trust to build or commission additional primary and secondary health care facilities.\n\nWe would like you to sign this petition to illustrate your opposition to these proposals.  Thank you.",
