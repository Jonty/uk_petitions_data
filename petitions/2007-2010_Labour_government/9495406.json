        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Suffolk Coastal District Council has received an application no C/08/0652 for an intensive poultry unit at the old gravel pit, Thorington, Suffolk from the company Hillfairs. The unit would house 340,000 birds, to be intensively reared in 6 buildings. There are incomplete/vague proposals regarding waste and carcass disposal. ) The application will impact on the environment and the residents\u2019 standard of living causing pollution, distress and nuisance. Supermarkets cannot meet the demand for FREE RANGE poultry. Where is the logic in such a massive intensive unit? The 2007 outbreak of Avian Flu in Suffolk was only few miles away in Holton. It takes one bird to be infected in an intensive unit to have an epidemic of biblical proportions. The Minsmere Bird Reserve is very close to this site. The site has a colony of Great Crested Newts, European Protected Species plus UK Protected Species. This proposal goes against the ethics of the Greenest County. Please help us keep Thorington safe for everyone now and in the future and encourage ethical farming.",
