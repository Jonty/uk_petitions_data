            "background": "The British government has repeatedly affirmed its commitment to the two-state solution. However, this commitment is nothing more than lip service to a popular idea if it does not involve putting pressure on the Israeli government to end the human rights abuses that are being perpetrated against Palestinians. (We also include ethnic Palestinians who hold Israeli citizenship and who have to live with numerous injustices and inequalities.)\n\nThese human rights abuses include, but are not restricted to, illegal house demolitions, land seizures, and an inequality between Israeli Jewish and Israeli Arab state-funded schools that is deliberately maintained. The onus for change must fall on the occupying power - the nation-state where 50% of citizens are not forced to rely on food aid and can move about freely.\n\nAs Israel prepares to celebrate the anniversary of its creation, we call on the British government to condemn the abuses and injustices that began with that creation and persist to this day. Only when these uncomfortable truths are acknowledged and addressed will a two-state solution even be possible.",
