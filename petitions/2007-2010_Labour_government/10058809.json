            "background": "Infertile couples in the UK are currently required to pay a licensing fee to HFEA for every non-NHS cycle of treatment they undergo. This is an absolutely shameful tax on people with a health condition, who are already discriminated against by the NHS and are already paying tax to fund an NHS which is supposed to offer them up to three cycles of IVF in return, but typically only offers one. NO OTHER HEALTH TREATMENT IS TAXED IN SUCH A WAY AND WE DEMAND IT STOPS NOW.",
