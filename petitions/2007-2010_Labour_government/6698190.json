        "background": "Around Sept 29th it was said - 'The Government will ask police to tackle sex-trafficking next week but is refusing to provide extra funds for the fight against the fastest-growing area of organised crime.'\n\nThe girls trafficked into this country can be locked up in houses never to leave, and forced to sleep with up to 40 men each day. Punishment is being beaten with whatever is at hand, and placed in baths if ice water for long periods. Once their wounds are healed enough they are sent back to work again.\n\nThis should NEVER be allowed in today's world especially within the British society.",
