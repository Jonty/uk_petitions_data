            "background": "In July 2005 Margaret Haywood a nurse carried a secret camera around the Royal Sussex Hospital in Brighton, she highlighted the gross neglect that elderly patients received. This week the Nursing and Midwifery Council decided to strike her off, so she can longer work as a nurse. This makes total nonsense of all the talk about openness and transparency in the NHS. Cover-up is the order of the game. Please dont allow this happen, remember we will all be old one day!!!!",
