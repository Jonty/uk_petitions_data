        "background": "Insurance claims are taxed, meaning that the Inland Revenue stand to profit from the recent flooding across the United Kingdom. Weather events in 2007, not limited to summer flooding, have brought financial hardship to many businesses and families, struggling to find the extra costs which they are liable for due to excess on their policies. We the great people of Britain ask one simple thing from the government, to have a heart and to take this revenue raised from repair costs and help families and business find the extra money which they are liable for on their policies. Why should the tax system gain from such an unprecedented disaster, when it will drive many people into serious financial hardship? Given the scale of the issue and the exceptional circumstance of the summer floods of 2007, will the government accept that the tax system should help rather than hinder society recover in such a dire set of circumstances? We can\u2019t stop climate change so help us cope with it!",
