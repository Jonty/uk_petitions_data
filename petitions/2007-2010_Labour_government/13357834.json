We are meant to live in a democratic society but time after time we are seeing that the most important decisions relating to finance, education,housing, benefits and all public services etc are made without any or little public input. I also think it is a cheek that gordon brown our current prime minister got into power without being elected by the people. Stop this and ask for more power as a collective. We do not live in a democracy any more and that is a shame for the future generations.",
