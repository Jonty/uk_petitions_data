            "background": "I believe that it unfair and an act of ageism that the minimum wage for a 16 and 17 year old is \u00a33.30 an hour compared to the adult minimum wage of \u00a35.20 an hour. For example i am 16 and work in a shop at the weekend and my employers luckily pay me \u00a34.08 an hour but i work with adults who do just as much work as me and the same hours but because they are as little as 2 years older than me they earn an extra \u00a31.50 an hour. I believe it is an act of ageism because it is now against to make a joke of someone because of there age so surely it is ageism to pay someone less because of there age.",
