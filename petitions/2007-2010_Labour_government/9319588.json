            "background": "On 23rd April 2008 it was announced that MEPs had voted that a report into MEPs' expenses would not be published.  Inevitably this leads one to assume that there is much they do not want to be revealed.  This lack of accountability is totally unacceptable in a democratic society and the report should be a matter of public record.  Tax payers have the right to know how their money is being spent.",
