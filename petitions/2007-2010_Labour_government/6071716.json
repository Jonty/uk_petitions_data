On airlines it's 12, at theme parks it seems to be dependent on how tall you are, on buses, who knows? seems to depend on the whim of the individual drivers. This is total nonesense. A child is a child until they can legally finish full time education (currently 16). This proposal is for the government to legislate that all businesses must NOT charge for adult tickets for anything until a child is 16.",
