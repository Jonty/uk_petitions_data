            "background": "To bring us into line with other European countries, the government have stated that the introduction of a new bank holiday is up for public debate.\n\nSo far, suggestions for this have ranged from National Patrons days, religeous days to historical days.\n\nTo please everybody I believe that every employee should be granted their birthday off, or nearest day to it if it falls on a non working day, regardless of employment status.\n\nI believe it would create a feel good factor as nobody likes to go in work on their birthday, not bring the country to a standstill for a day, easy to administer for employers and would not have any political, nationalistic or religeous attachment to it.",
