        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "There is concern within government that there will not be funds to cover pensions in years to come, currently there is a deficit within the public sector of \u00a3425bn.\nI propose to cap the pension received from those within public service, government and council to \u00a350,000 per annum.  Any existing pensions greater than the capped figure, should be reduced annually by 5% until the figure reaches the capped rate. Persons receiving over \u00a3100K pensions would take 8 to 10 years to reach the capped rate. \nThe capped figure should rise annually by the rate of inflation.\nI feel that whilst certain members of the public sector have been paid vastly inflated salaries and this will stop this from continuing into the future unchallenged.\nFailure to act now will mean each working person in this country will need to pay \u00a38,500K extra tax during their working career to meet the current shortfall, this will rise if nothing is done.",
