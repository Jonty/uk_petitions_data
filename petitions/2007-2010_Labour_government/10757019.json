As yet the British government has not replied.\n\nId like to apply pressure at the very least to the British government and the EU and possibly the world to stop wasting money on junkets and other wasteful things and divert funding to Guyana. Please help to save both a wonderful ecosystem and a part of this planets lungs for us and future generations.",
