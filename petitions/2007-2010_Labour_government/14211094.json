            "background": "dear mr brown \nplease make the goverment enforce a law that makes employers,employ people who are unemployed first, rather than people who already have a job.i find very frustrating that people that have a job go for another job.and in most cases because the person applying for the job has a job already it stands them in better sted and the one who is unemployed dosent get a look in.\nalso why has it become so inportant to have a piece of paper that says you can do the job. i say this because i have been welding for over 20 years and i can do all forms of welding mig tig oxey/acet arc etc but because i dont have a certificate to say i can do this employers dont even ask me in for an interview is there anything that can be done about this also sorry for any spelling mistakes",
