        "action": "introduce a system whereby local councils are held accountable for Penalty Charge Notices illegally issued in their name",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "With the number of Penalty Charge Notices being successfully appealed it is apparent that local councils are ignoring their duty towards both residents and visitors.  Local authorities need to introduce safeguards to ensure that tickets are not issued in their name where no offence has been committed, for example in cases where signs or markings are missing or incorrect.\n\nWhere councils have been made aware of errors and have failed to act on them, there should be a simple means for motorists to call them to account for their errors, with a straightforward method for a) getting their PCN(s) cancelled en masse and b) calling for the council to cease issuing tickets for non-offences.\n\nCouncils currently have almost unlimited and unchecked authority to issue PCNs, and motorists are forced to spend months fighting even a single one.  Local authorities should be required by law to cease issuing tickets for which there is no legal justification, as this is a perfect example of extortion.",
