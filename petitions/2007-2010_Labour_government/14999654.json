            "background": "The Burmese people urgently need our Government's and our Allies' support to help rid this proud nation of its malevolent despots, the Army Generals, whose proven oppression and brutality, persecution of citizens, pseodo-democratic fixed elections, human rights suppression and imprisonment of all political opposition candidates like the activist Aung San Suu Kyi (Nobel Prize Winner)by a regime that has long since ignored UN human rights resolutions must now be forced, by whatever means, to release their people from enforced bondage. Britain should use its influence with its allies to cut off the supply of arms to this brutal regime and use all means possible to campaign to restore proper democracy and justice.",
