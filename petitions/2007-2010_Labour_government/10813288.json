            "background": "I find it most annoying to keep seeing Volvo cars programmed to keep there lights on during daylight hours. \nThere is no need for them to have them on. \nI have no problem if there is a need, i.e. fog, heavy rain act.\nThey are distracting for other road users; This could lead to an accident.\nI believe this is just a sales gimmick, to attract people\u2019s attention to Volvos. It needs someone to make Volvo stop exporting cars to our country with there lights programmed to stay on. If you support me then please campaign by flashing your headlights to every Volvo with its lights on. This would soon make their owners take their cars to the agent to revert them to the British way.",
