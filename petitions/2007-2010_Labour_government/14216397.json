He is quoted as saying if his alleged claim of WMD was unfounded he would have pursued the war regardless. Falsifying facts to achieve a personal goal on this scale  is in fundamental oposition to the rule of international law. There is a case to answer. It should follow it's natural course in moral and legal impunity with a view to securing a conviction.",
