Most suspended cuts at around the 2% - 3% mark. We petition the government to prevent them from imediately increasing thier rates as soon as the Bank of England increase the base rate from 0.5%. They should not be allowed to increase rates until they reach the level at which they stopped passing on the benefit of the cuts to thier customers.",
