            "background": "The Metropolitian Borough of Sandwell should become part of the City of Birmingham, and the two local authorities should be merged. Sandwell's public services are poor, and it's schools underperform. Sandwell's public spaces are unkept, it's main roads littered and dirty and it's leisure facilities underfunded. Public money is wasted on schemes such as 'The Public' and other redevelopment schemes are expensive and painfully slow. Birmingham, by contrast is a popular, well run historical city which needs expansion to ensure it can compete on a global scale. If Sandwell is removed from the national map, the six towns which make up the borough can retrieve their strong local identities and be part of a larger, more forward thinking city.",
