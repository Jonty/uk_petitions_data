            "background": "Hastings has gone from having one of the best skatepark facilities in the late 80's to one off the worst in the south east. In 2000 HBC promised to provide a new permanent skatepark, an installed a temporary wooden park that was set to last  only a year. Fast forward 8 years and Hastings still have the same temporary skatepark but it is in such a dangerous and neglected state, that we do not feel safe using it. We urge HBC to deliver on there promises and fund a permanent concrete park that not only the users of today can enjoy but for future generations.",
