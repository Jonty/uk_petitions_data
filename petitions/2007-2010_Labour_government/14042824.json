            "background": "In the winter, it gets very cold and more importantly wet. As a pupil, my feet suffer during the winter period. I often arrive at school with completely wet feet and find them hard to warm up during the day. Last year, there was severe snow and we were still expected to wear school shoes at school. 'The way round it' the teachers volunteered 'is to wear your boots to school, change into your shoes and then rechange at the end of the day'. How ridiculous is that? Why not just let us wear sensible, warm black boots?",
