        "action": "Grant Free Government- funded off-peak rail travel in England for resident pensioners aged over sixty five years",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This would match the offer of free bus travel which is spreading the counties. It would give the elderly another mode of transport encouraging them to use rail rather than car(which is 7 to 10 times as polluting) thus reducing the carbon-footprint.There are also many elderly who do not have cars of their own. It would tap excess capacity on the railways at off-peak times making peak times more viable for others and encourage Rail Franchisees to develop services further .At present many Counties offer free bus passes but only offer a free senior rail pass as an alternative.",
