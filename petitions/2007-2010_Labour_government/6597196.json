            "background": "Over the past few decades Britain has been slowly de-generating into a 'puppet society'. not only are we seen as mere puppets by the US and the EU but our traditions and values are slowly being lost.\nThe majority people who live in Britain - The White British are treated as a miniority (so to speak) as more and more new immigrants demand more laws to benefit them... and to take things off us 'original British.'\n(soon it is estimated that 3 of roughly 30 children in every class at school, will not speak English! what kind of a joke is this! aswell as costing the taxpayer a huge amount of money on interpreters etc it is de-moralising our society.) you can see the opinion of the British public is changing, because of crime waves which engulf our cities and immagrints who refuse to learn our language yet think its ok to 'scrounge' off our Government.  \n\nBy no means am i a Racist but we need to think of ourselves and our country first before helping others and other countries.\n\nPlease... Make Britain... British again.",
