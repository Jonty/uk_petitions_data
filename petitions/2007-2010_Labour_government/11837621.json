        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In February 1993 Jamie Bulger, aged 3 was taken from a Liverpool shopping centre by two 10-year-old boys, Jon Venables and Robert Thompson. They took Jamie on a walk for over 2 and half miles, stopping to torture him on the way. Finally they stopped at a railway track where they brutally kicked him, threw stones at him, rubbed paint in his eyes, pushed batteries up his anus and cut his fingers off with scissors. Other mutilations were inflicted but not reported in the press. The torture was so horrendous that Jamie's mother was forbidden to identify his body. They left his beaten body on the railway tracks so a train could run him over to hide the mess they had created. These two boys understood what they did was wrong - trying to make it look like an accident. \nThis week Lady Justice Butler-Sloss has awarded the two boys(now men) anonymity for the rest of their lives when they leave custody with new identities. They are being relocated to Australia. They will also leave custody early only serving just over half of their sentence. They disgustingly and violently took Jamie's life away and in return they each get a new life!",
