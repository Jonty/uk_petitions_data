            "background": "This Petition is for support against the Labour Governments' years of mass uncontrolled immigration in to the UK which has meant British people priced out of British jobs,and helped as in the recent House of Lords report force House prices to become 10x average earnings-where as historicly before Labour it was 4X. The UK has become the migrant work capital of the world.With all the money the foreign workers recieve repatriated to their home countries,while the British in their own country stay on the Dole.",
