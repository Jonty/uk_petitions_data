Animals ranging from dogs & cats to guinea pigs, rabbits & fancy rats etc. Many animals who have been \"farmed\" in these conditions suffer deformities, poor health & shorter lifespans because of the way they have entered the world & because of deficient gene lineage not addressed by farm style breeders...Many of these pets also find themselves as needless \"live food\" for reptiles such as snakes as pet shops do not home check potential purchasers...Live feeding is cruel & needless...\nPlease help stop this unjustifiable suffering...Stop the sale of live animals from pet shops...  Please sign the petition & make your voice heard...",
