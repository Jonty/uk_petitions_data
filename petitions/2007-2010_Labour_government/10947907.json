            "background": "The current positioning is that Societies such as the (PRS) Performing Rights Society has the right to charge twice for thier material. The first charge is to the radio station for the right to play the track. The station then place it in the public domain i.e. airways or internet and then the society charge businesses in the form of licences to then allow thier staff to listen to radios in private non public areas. I believe that the legislation should be changed to reflect that once material is placed in the public domain the material is only renumerated a second time if used by businesses in their predominantly designated customer areas to increase custom and direct revenue. This means that general workers are then not denied their human rights of improving their own working conditions, such as listening to radios without headphones which could be dangerous.",
