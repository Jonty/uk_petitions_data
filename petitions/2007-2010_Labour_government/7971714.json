Bankruptcy is not always a viable option as it can bar one from certain jobs or make it much harder to buy a house in the future.  Many of them will have made honest efforts to repay their debts and make fair offers for lump-sum payments.  If these people can clearly demonstrate they have made honest efforts to meet their obligations and that they will not make the same mistakes again they should be able to either have their debt's written off with nothing more to pay or for them to pay no more than 25% of the total balance to settle the debt.  This option should only be made to each person once and if they get in the same position again should be made bankrupt.",
