        "background": "2008 resistance trends show the proportion of cases resistant to any first line drug rose from 5.6% to 7.9%. Outside London a significant increase in resistance to one drug, isoniazid, was linked to immigration, an AOL report suggests.\n\nMany patients came from sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent where they may have developed immunity to the drug. To date it had involved more than 300 cases, including many prison inmates and drug users. The isoniazid problem in London was blamed on poor transmission control.\n\nMore than 8,000 TB infections were reported in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in 2006.\n\nThe researchers, led by Dr Michelle Kruijshaar from the Health Protection Agency in London, concluded: \"The observed increases highlight the need for early case detection, rapid testing of susceptibility to drugs, and improved treatment completion.\" In a more global mobile world, the petitioner is calling for a\nworldwide database of health records, to link between health institutions and co - ordiante treatment regimes. It may even be that one drug resistance is related to another, reducing the efficacy of drugs.",
