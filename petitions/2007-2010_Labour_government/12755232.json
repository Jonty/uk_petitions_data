            "background": "Facing the exhaustion of IP addresses in our current IPv4 system, which is due to happen in anything under 3 years, our Internet Service Providers (ISPs) should be deploying the newer and more sophisticated IPv6 technology and providing it to customers and businesses, enabling the creation of new unseen services and future-proofing Internet access in the UK. Currently no major providers have started to deploy IPv6 which puts us at risk of falling behind in terms of communication tech development and stability.",
