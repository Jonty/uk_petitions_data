            "background": "After a period of public consultation Southampton City Primary Care Trust has decided - against the wishes of over 70% of the population - to add fluoride to the water supply of Southampton and the surrounding area. The long term effects of fluoride are not fully known, but there is evidence to cast doubt on its safety. Despite this we will be forced by our HEALTH AUTHORITY to drink, bathe and cook with water tainted with this potentially dangerous substance\nRemember: \n- we were consulted and the majority of respondents were against the decision, and despite this they decided to go ahead\n- we cannot filter, boil, or otherwise remove this from our water\n- if we need fluoride there are products including toothpaste and mouthwash readily available\n- by having this added to our water supply we lose the freedom of choice whether or not to consume fluoride",
