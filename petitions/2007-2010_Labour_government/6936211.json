            "background": "to set up a national protocol for the endoscopic surveillance of individuals who have a genetic predisposition to bowel cancer. At present there is a huge disparity in the standard of care from one hospital to another. Families living with illnesses such as Familial Adenomatous polyposis are not receiving regular upper and lower endoscopies to screen for cancers. Without this screening the majority of people with this illness will not live past 40.  I would like a clearly defined surveillance regime that is practiced throughout the NHS so that patients with hereditary bowel cancers receive the same standard of care where ever they might live.",
