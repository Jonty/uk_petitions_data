            "background": "The Home Information Pack was phased-in during the last six months of 2007.  It had an immediate effect in reducing the supply of properties  to coming the market beginning with four bedroomed houses, then three bedroomed property and now all housing. This was predicted by property professionals, solicitors, financial institutions and many members of Parliament and the government ignored all warnings.  In the light of the current crisis, all unnecessary bureaucracy that adversely impacts on the operation of the housing market should be withdrawn.",
