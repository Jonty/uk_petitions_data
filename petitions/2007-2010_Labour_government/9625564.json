            "background": "Older diesel campervans are caught up in legislation aimed at commercial and domestic daily commuters. Campervan owners who live in London, take public transport for their day-to-day travel & do less than 4000 miles per year, and who do this in preference to taking cheap (but infinitely more polluting) flights every holiday are being unfairly charged and should at least get a discount, if not a full exemption.",
