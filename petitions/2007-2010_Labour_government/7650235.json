        "background": "The government responded to a recent petition for them to be honest about Climate Change with the statement that \"The Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) leaves us in no doubt that human activities are responsible for climate change\"\n\nThe Summary for Policymakers, a document approved by governments following negotiations on its wording, states that \"Most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations\", where \"very likely\" means \"more than 90% likely\".\n\nEven this, a more political than scientific document, leaves us with significant doubt that human activities are responsible for climate change. The inclusion of \"Most of...\" and \"very likely\" means this report is not definitive and should not be used as the basis for punitive taxation.",
