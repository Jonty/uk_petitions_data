        "background": "People in this generation are becoming so lazy, all you need to do now to watch movies or listern to music (whether legal or illegal) is sit at your computer, you can even order this evenings food by using the internet. \n\nAs more and more people take to the internet and download movies and music illegally it has a negative effect on the Movie and Music industry; meaning that both the movie and music industry both lose revenue. \n\nSecondly CD's which play and contain music are by far a better by than mp3's. With a CD you on some occasions get a bonus DVD. You don't get that with an mp3. With a CD you get the physical CD and sometimes a booklet in the CD case which you don't get on a mp3. There are many more benefits for CD's than there are for mp3's, however mp3's still cost a large amount of money considering your  paying for something which you can only see on a computer screen, which pushes people to illegal websites. \n\nIn my opinion mp3 download and file sharing websites should be shut down completely. \n\nPlease Mr. Prime Minister could you take action against file sharing and mp3 download websites. Thank you",
