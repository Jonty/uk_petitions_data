When or if a man succeeds as I did we must pay regardless  if you have 50 percent of the financial costs and time spent with them. Because of the current crisis regarding spiraling costs and taxes, I like many others are having problems keeping everything together. While the Mother gets the state money for the children, the Father does not and must bring the children up in abject poverty while the Mother maybe earning considerable more money. This government was supposed to be for the people, to bring new hope for all and equality, but yet you support inequality for Men.",
