The energy wasted, light pollution generated and tax payers money  frittered away by this totally useless activity is substantial to say the least. Whilst enhanced planning legislation is the way forward in the long term, the Government could make immediate inroads (and take some moral high ground) by issuing instructions to all public bodies over which it can exert influence that no building should be illuminated (either externally or internally)when it is closed (i.e. outside of normal working hours) unless there are significant and demonstrable overriding  safety considerations.",
