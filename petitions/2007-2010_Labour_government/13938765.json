        "action": "legislate to ban shops from fixing doors open in cold weather which generates massive amounts of unnecessary and easily avoidable of carbon dioxide",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Most shops keep their doors open in winter, releasing massive amounts of heat, and hence causing large quantities of carbon dioxide. With our current understanding of climate change, this is completely irresponsible and makes a mockery of government encouragement to individuals to make homes more energy efficient. \n\nWithout legislation, no shop will act unilaterally, as they would be at a disadvantage compared to their neighbour, but if all shops are forced to act, they will not lose out, as consumers will still buy the same amount of stuff. For this reason, legislation is necessary. \n\nIn addition, shops will benefit from greatly reduced heating bills. \n\nThe legislation could take a form such as \"When the exterior temperature is less than 15 degrees (temperature to be negotiated), doors must be set so that they return to a closed position if no person is passing through\"",
