These charges do not reflect the true cost of these services, and are often not clearly indicated to the tenant early in the letting process. These fees also affect the poorer tenant more, as they are fixed charges.\n\nWe petition the prime minister to bring in legislation to ban these large charges for standard services. These services should be free, or should only reflect their true cost.",
