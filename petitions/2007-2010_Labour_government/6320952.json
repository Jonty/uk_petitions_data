It is also not possible for corporations and individuals to continue to accept the increases in 'stealth' taxes to subsides public service jobs.  Please recognise that corporations and individuals have the choice to go to wherever it is more competitive.  So far most think that it is good to stick things out but there is a breaking point.  Start by dealing with the NHS and the Prison office dispute.",
