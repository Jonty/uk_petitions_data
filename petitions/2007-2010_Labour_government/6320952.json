        "background": "despite the Labour party's alliance with the unions (and Gordon's desire to be re-elected), it is not possible for the UK to continue to increase its total spend (INCLUDING FINAL SALARY PENSIONS and JOB SECURITY) on public services at the current rate and urgent measures are needed to control costs.  It is also not possible for corporations and individuals to continue to accept the increases in 'stealth' taxes to subsides public service jobs.  Please recognise that corporations and individuals have the choice to go to wherever it is more competitive.  So far most think that it is good to stick things out but there is a breaking point.  Start by dealing with the NHS and the Prison office dispute.",
