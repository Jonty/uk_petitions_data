            "background": "Prime Minister,\n\nI propose that the NHS allow the drug Lapatinib to be made available to all HER2+ breast cancer sufferers. \n\nCurrently the drug can be only approved by our local NHS trust with a letter from an Oncologist explaining exceptional circumstances, for instance a young mother - this should not be the case. Access to medicine should be for all, the selection process should not prioritise cost to NHS but benefit to patient in the first instance.\n\nMoney is an obvious concern as the drug is expensive, I propose that the government offer a top-up scheme for cancer patients to allow them the opportunity to get the drug or to reconsider funding amounts for other areas such as drug rehabilitation as it's self inflicted and has a high chance of failure.",
