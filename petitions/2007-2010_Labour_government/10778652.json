            "background": "compared to many other countries in the world ours is blatently lagging behind when it comes to litter management.  Fortnightly collection and weak enforcement is leading to increased flytipping and dropping of litter.  Token gestures have gone on for too long, if you litter you should pay the price, everyone knows it is illegal so there is no excuse.  In the states there is a fine of nearly \u00a3600 for littering, here it is only 10% of this and only when they are caught!",
