Even with 50% off it'll still cost several times more to have it fitted\n\nThe only people left are the few old people with no close family to help install it who'll be completely ripped off.\n\nTake VAT off all insulation.\n\nProvide recycled insulation created from our rubbish to us at cost price.",
