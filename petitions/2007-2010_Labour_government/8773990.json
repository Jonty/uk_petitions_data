        "background": "The current system means that people from backgrounds where the parents earn less than \u00a325000 can claim a full maintenence grant to encourage them into higher education and to make it more affordable.\n\nThis seems an admirable cause, until you find that ALL GRADUATES PAY THEIR LOAN BACK AS A PROPORTION OF INCOME after graduation. Background therefore has no influence on financing university.\n\nHowever, the loan is still not high enough and the government expects parents from higher earning families to support their children. Once 18, a person is an ADULT and should not have to rely on the help of a parent, and the parent may not wish to support what they wish to do.\n\nThe government also uses the RPI as the inflation rate to pay back the loan, rather than the CPI which it uses as its official measure. This means graduates must pay more than what the government quotes as inflation rates.\n\nTherefore this petition proposes a higher loan, funding this by scrapping the grant, and ensuring that the \u00a315000 threshold increases at the rate of inflation like the fees do, while also changing to the CPI as the rate at which the loan is paid back.",
