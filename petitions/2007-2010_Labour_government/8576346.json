            "background": "Ken Livingston has done enough damage to London and has cost Londoners enough money. Had he been Mayor a few hundred years ago he may have been lynched and beheaded. This is a bit harsh, so we think it would be better to just lock him in the Tower until he promises to leave London alone. The GLA mark 2 is just another layer of bureaucracy costing more money, that the already heavily taxed Londoners have to finance. Get rid of it altogether.",
