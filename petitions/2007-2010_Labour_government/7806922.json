            "background": "Additionally, to compel refunds to me made through the Direct Debit Scheme.\n\nAlmost ubiquitously, companies which collect payment by direct debit make credit account (for example after account closure) refunds by cheque and even then typically only after a written request.\n\nThe net result is that customers often do not receive their credit balances when an account is closed particularly after death when new account holders do not have the correct paperwork.\n\nFurthermore there are too many fraudulently operating companies which continue to collect direct debit payments after customers have closed their accounts. This should be discouraged by means of a penalty system as, currently, there is none.\n\nFunds are fraudulently kept by companies whose customers fail to claim their credit account balances.",
