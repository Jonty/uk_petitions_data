            "background": "With the cost of unleaded fuel now at \u00a31 a litre, the cost of fuel is a huge burden on the average working person in Britain. For a number of reasons we rely on the car. Public transport does not get you directly from your house to your work, is often unreliable and always over priced. Safe cycle paths are virtually non-existent in most cities, with the famous British climate making cycling and walking less appealing in winter months. This leaves the car as the favoured mode of transport. Fuel tax should be reduced, with a fair price of 80p/litre introduced until a viable alternative to the car exists in the UK.",
