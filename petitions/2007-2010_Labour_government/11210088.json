We have seen only the beginning of the fall out of his failed policies and delusional ideology. It is time to make history and stand beside the people of Zimbabwe in their time of need.\n\nIt is long overdue time for Mr Mugabe to go. We call upon Mr Brown and the British Government to do everything possible to remove Mr Mugabe from power and to deliver aid to the Zimbabwean people right now in their suffering.",
