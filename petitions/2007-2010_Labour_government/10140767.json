            "background": "We do not believe that the establishment of an new private school in Hospital Lane, Norwich is in the interests of the local community. It will result in a significant increase of traffic throughout the day in a residential area. The welfare and safety of local school children in the area who attend Lakenham Primary School and the Hewett School will be adversely affected due to the increased level of traffic and the extra hazards that arise.\n \nWe believe that establishing a new private school in such close proximity to the local state primary school will impact negatively on pupil recruitment at Lakenham Primary School. The proposed private school will have a divisive effect on the work Lakenham Primary School is undertaking to present the school as a nucleus for community projects.",
