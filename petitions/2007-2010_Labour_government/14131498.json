        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "There are many great improvements coming to the train services from Medway to London, however this has come at a very serious cost. \n\nCurrently the last train which runs from Medway to London (via Greenhithe, Gravesend and Dartford) leaves Chatham at 00.11.  From the 13th December the last train will depart Chatham before 23.00, over an hour earlier.\n\nThis will have a huge impact on people who require the links to the various stations along the line at that late time of night for a number of reasons from socialising to work purposes.\n\nI hope you can support the petition and that we can have this valuable late night public transport link re-instated.",
