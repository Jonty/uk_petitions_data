            "background": "Common Sense means don't spend more than you earn, and use reliable parenting strategies (adults, not children are in charge).\n\nThere are eports of a six-year-old charged with sexual harassment for kissing a classmate; teens suspended from school for using mouthwash; and a teacher fired for telling off a kid.\n\nCommon Sense failed when parents attacked teachers for doing their job in disciplining their children. It declined even further when schools had to get parental consent to give medication to a kid, but could not inform the parents when a daughter fell pregnant and wanted an abortion.\n\nCommon Sense vanished as religion went commerical; and criminals got better treatment than their victims. It cowered when you lost the right to defend yourself from a burglar and the burglar sued you for assault...  Then a woman failed to realize that a steaming cup of coffee was hot. She spilt it in her lap, and won her court case.",
