        "background": "In response to a petition by ( Simon Lee Jackson \u2013 Deadline to sign up by: 06 May 2008 \u2013 Signatures: 17,962), this is a counter petition.\n\nThe 15 point deduction applied at the start of the 2007/8 football season is a fair and just punishment for a club, or more specifically a chairman, aiming to circumvent rules put in place to protect all fans of football, our national sport. It is not in the3 interests of sport generally as it has been done purely for financial gain.\n\nMany local small businesses have been driven to the wall and others made to struggle all for reasons that are not sporting.\n\nI believe this move by the football league to be wholly justified and completely fair.",
