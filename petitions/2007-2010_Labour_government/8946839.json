            "background": "The government has removed the right for students wishing to study a second undergraduate degree to receive a student loan.\n\nInitially it was still possible to apply for the maintenance loan facility but this option has now also been removed. This leaves a critical funding shortfall for second degree students as private trusts will only fund postgraduate level qualifications.\n\nIf the government wishes to encourage the education of the nation they are severely restricting the ability to study at university by introducing this policy.",
