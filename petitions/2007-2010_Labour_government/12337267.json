            "background": "Margaret Haywood has been struck off for trying to draw attention to poor care in the NHS.Many caring nurses have to endure poor conditions to do their job, and patients suffer as a result. The NMC is not protecting the public by punishing Ms Haywood - it is empire building. We nurses need to know we can bring information about poor care into the public domain without being sacked. Ms Haywood is doing what Florence Nightingale once did - informing the public of terrible conditions for patients.",
