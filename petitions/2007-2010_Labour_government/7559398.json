            "background": "Dear Prime Minister,\n\nThis is to show our objection towards the plans to merge Ysgol Santes Helen in Caernarfon. As parents of two Children who are students of Ysgol Santes Helen, I wish to inform that this is causing a great concern to our children and this will in fact affect them very much. This cannot merger cannot be justified because the other proposed school to merge with is miles away from Caernarfon town and is a English Medium School whereas Ysgol Santes Helen is a Welsh Medium School and will make it difficult for students, parents and School Staff as well.\nI would like to emphasise that YSGOL SANTES HELEN is not a failing school. A merger will have shared finances, staff and time that would influence the children a lot. We are concerned that changes could damage education standards and local communities. \nThis school is providing a very good education to its pupils in a happy atmosphere, \n So, we request you to fully review the effects of such a move and to regard the local values. \n\nThanking you\nKottilath Sam Mathew & Annie George",
