            "background": "One of the main reasons for the problems we now face  is the sudden spike in the price of oil, hitting over $140 a barrel at one point. Although it has eased for the moment it is inevitable that as reserves dwindle the price will go ever higher. Therefore we need to become energy self-sufficient as soon as possible with the only long term options being renewables.  The problem of course is that as we\u2019ve seen, when financial chaos hits there will be other demands on our money, so we need to give this priority the moment things are back to normal.",
