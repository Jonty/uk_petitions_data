        "background": "Dear Minister,\n\nIt seems to me that all of us (including our MPs) are concerned with increasing knife attacks violences but for some reason we (the law makers) are reluctant to enact toughest laws that would terrify the criminals in this country. We want a peaceful society. We want criminals to be in the jail for very long time. If we need to make huge jails, let us make it. Please do not give an idea to the criminals that we do not have adequate space in the jail. We have vast protected territories outside the main land (ie, in indian ocean and in the caribbeans) where we can construct vast jails to confine offenders like gun and knife attackers.",
