        "background": "Why is it that members and non members of parliament can get tax payers money to buy luxury items and travel costs when we the working class have to pay for all we want, no coffers for us to use willy-nilly at others expense.  We put you there to serve us not to use our taxes for things you should pay for yourself, groceries, taxis and buying luxery items for a 2nd home. I have always maintained that you are all out to line your own pockets at who evers cost as long as it is not your own, this latest news confirms it. I am living on \u00a38000 after tax and the tax I pay is used for the above, it makes a mockery of me the way it used indiscriminately for wrongful use.",
