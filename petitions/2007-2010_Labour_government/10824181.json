Nuns are raped and burned, locals are killed, churches and religious institution are damaged. Violence on christians is spreading from one state to another.\n \nTill now nothing is telecast on BBC IN U.K. If anything happens to Muslim community it is in the forefront of BBC NEWS. Why not help a minority who are in difficult time in India.\n \nHope you will do the needfull.",
