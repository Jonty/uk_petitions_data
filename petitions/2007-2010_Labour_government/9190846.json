        "action": "Ban the connection of outdoor heaters to electricity supplies charged at standard tariffs.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Many people object to the wastage of energy by heating fresh air. Rather than ban outdoor heaters altogether, a compromise could be reached by insisting that any energy used in this way is generated as cleanly as possible, minimising the effect on the environment. \n\nThe electricity would have to be purchased on a \"green\" tariff. The supply company would have to obtain a certificate from the department of the environment to prove that they satisfy the requirements of a \"green\" tariff. I believe this would be better than an outright ban as it would generate investment in green energy technology from persons who may otherwise have little regard for the environment. \n\nFurthermore, any outdoor heater in a public place may not be left switched on for longer than 5 minutes while unattended. This will force businesses to install coin-operated meters that allow 5 minutes of heat at a time, thus passing the cost directly to the end user of the energy.",
