This petition is to request an independent inquiry, who's findings will be made publicly available, into the cause and effect of government policy on waiting lists and other targets versus the basic good running of all hospitals in the UK, and specifically the hospitals run by the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust.  It is imperative that hospitals' primary target is the health and wellbeing of patients.  An independent inquiry is needed to see if government policy has had a perverse effect on this prime function so that changes in policy can be considered.",
