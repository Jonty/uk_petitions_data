        "background": "Police officers risk their lives and health in the execution of their duty to protect the public and the freedoms that the United Kingdom have. Police officers should have the protection of the law when they have been assaulted and not have charges 'plea bargained' off. There needs to be a deterrent for potential criminals who want to assault the police. In order to make the 'streets' safer there a certain level of respect towards the police needs to be established. Therefore it is proposed that a law should be passed which increases the sentence or punishment towards a police assault.",
