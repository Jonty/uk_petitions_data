            "background": "TETRA stands for TErrestrial Trunked RAdio. It is the new national police radio system, operated mainly by O2 under the brand name of Airwave. Planned since early 1990, the contract was given in March 2000 to BT and Motorola, without going to tender. Since that time, BT has split its business and the Airwave contract went to the section of the company that deals with mobile networks. This was initially called O2, then mmO2, and now back to O2. However, since the contract was awarded, the European Commission has found the British Government guilty of unlawfully limiting the contract to tender to TETRA systems only and in our opinion guaranteeing the contract to O2. The existing contract is unlawful as it contravenes European competition laws as defined in the treaty of Rome.\n\nTHESE FREQUENCIES ARE HARMFUL AND SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED FOR USE GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF SCIENTISTS THAT HAVE OPPOSED THEM!!!",
