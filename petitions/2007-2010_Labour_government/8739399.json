            "background": "Keep Britain British and if immigrants cannot accept our law or way or life then they should return home to their own country. Our country is becoming less British every day and our resources are being swallowed up by all the immigrants coming into this country instead of being used on our old people, homeless, housing, hospitals and the youth of our country who are our future. Immigrants get preferential treatment over our own citizens and the government wonders why there is racism. How can everyone you speak to think and feel the same and yet the government fails to acknowledge this. I think Gordon Brown should take a leaf out of the Prime Minister of Australia's book and stand up for the British people and put the Great back into Britain, instead they are taking away our Britishness and we are not suppose to say or do anything for fear of being politically incorrect. I want all British people to stand up to the government and ask for a Britain that is British and not a multi cultural society that is dragging this country into the gutter. Mr Brown if you want to win the next election STOP IMMIGRATION and start listening to your people and you will hear what this country really wants.",
