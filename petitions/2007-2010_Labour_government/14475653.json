I have written numerous times to Tony Blair asking for a meeting. My requests have been ignored or denied. I think it is disgraceful that you are now trying to bar me from the hearing that I have sought for so long. It is a decision I cannot accept. I am concerned that it may be that I have been excluded because I have campaigned so publicly for more than five years for this inquiry.\"",
