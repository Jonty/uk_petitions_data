        "background": "As an adopted child, myself I have found for many years that the lack of easy and basic access to my original birth records is having a detrimental effect on some aspects of my life.  At 24 there have been numerous times when a doctor has asked me about family history and as an adoptee, I have to say that I do not know. Obviously, with these types of issues I believe I have a right to know if the evidence is there.  I feel it is unfair that we should have limited access to records because we are adopted as it was not a decision adopted children have a say in. It is a failure in the current system. The lack of rights also makes it harder to trace our real parents even to trace the names of birth parents is a major task. I believe that the birth records should not be changed when a child is adopted as this is mostly done for the benefit of the new parents rather than the child.",
