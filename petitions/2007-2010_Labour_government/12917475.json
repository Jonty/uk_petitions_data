        "background": "A Castle Doctrine is a legal concept arising from English Common Law that designates one's place of residence (or any place legally occupied, such as one's car or place of work) as a place in which one enjoys protection from illegal trespassing and violent attack. \n\nIt then goes on to give a person the legal right to use deadly force to defend that place (his/her \"castle\"), and/or any other innocent persons legally inside it, from violent attack or an intrusion which may lead to violent attack. \n\nIn a legal context, therefore, use of deadly force which actually results in death may be defended as justifiable homicide under the Castle Doctrine.\n\nPlease introduce a Castle Doctrine law so that we defend ourselves both inside and outside of our homes without fear of prosecution.",
