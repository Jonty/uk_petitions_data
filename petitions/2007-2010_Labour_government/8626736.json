        "background": "Several british citizens were injured and otherwise affected by terrorist activity in Saudi Arabia during the early part of the new millenium, 2000 and 2001 in particular.\nThey have been unable to find legal representation to fight their cases, and have never been compensated for their losses.\nThey have had to struggle on in their lives, carrying the extra burden of the injuries and losses they sustained in the terrorist attacks.\nThis is a ludicrous situation, as for something as simple as tripping on an uneven paving slab can result in an individual being compensated., yet being blown up by a car bomb will not. How can this possibly be right?\nThese individuals will suffer for the rest of their lives because of these attacks. \nAre they any less deserving of being compensated than the victims of the September 11th 2001 attacks? [9/11]\nRemember that there now exists the possibility for terrorist attacks on anyone, anywhere, anytime, without warning.\nNext time it could be you, or somebody you know and love.\nHow would you cope?",
