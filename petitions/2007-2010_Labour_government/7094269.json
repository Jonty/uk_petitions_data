I decided to go to the vets to ask for a treatment on two occassions over the two years.  In comparison to the previouse year, I paid 400% more for these basic drugs.  The basic drugs are actually for humans.\n\nI paid: \n\nFirst year   - \u00a34.50\nSecond Year  - \u00a342.50\n\nThis is extortion.... We must regulate this process now; we all have pets and eventually it will hit us all.....!",
