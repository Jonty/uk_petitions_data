        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Britain is currently 41st fastest average download speed in the world. And in a time where Brtitain is asking to become 'Digital Britain' we are behind the rest of the world. Where Britain pioneered for an industrial revolution, why aren't we pioneering a digital revolution with a complete overhaul of our internet service. We are still currently being served by copper wires, where as other countries in the World have completely upgraded their infrastructure to fibre obtics. South Korea is currently getting an average of 19.67mb/s making it the world leader, where Britain is currently getting a nationwide average of 4.92 mb/s, leagues behind the rest of Europe and indeed the world. If we are to survive the 21st Century and to ensure that we do not get too far behind the rest of the world. My average internet speed at home is 0.05mb/s which is well below the international average, and indeed the UK's average. A complete overhaul of the UK's digital infrastructure will ensure millions of british people get a satisfactory internet speed for the price they pay.",
