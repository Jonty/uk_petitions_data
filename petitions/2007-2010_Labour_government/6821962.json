        "action": "ensure the government accepts its responsibility for postal services in this country by virtue of its ownership of the Royal Mail.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The same level of commitment as that shown over Northern Rock, should be evident regarding the future of Government owned Royal Mail.\nThe Royal Mail is central to modern and flourishing economy of this country. The Government should ensure a speedy and productive outcome of urgent talks to resolve this dispute and guarantee the future of Royal Mail services, rewarding appropriately the loyalty and professionalism of its workforce.\nUrging postal workers to accept a decline in their pensions, terms & conditions, massive redundancies, is not the answer. Government should ensure that Royal Mail address the concerns of their employees urgently; refraining from forcing through draconian measures, guaranteed to isolate the workforce and create industrial unrest as it has attempted recently.\nWe call upon the PM to ensure the government supports the Royal Mail, introduces modernisation which has the backing of the workforce, improves the mail services to the country, ensures a thriving and modern Royal Mail, whilst maintaining and improving the working conditions of its employers and the future sustainability of jobs within the Royal Mail.",
