            "background": "How many times do you see drivers sitting in the middle lane of the motorway, the third \"fast\" lane congested with cars trying to overtake and yet the inside \"first\" lane is virtually empty?\n\nI put forward that all newly passed drivers MUST be have to take additional lessons or a motorway test to prove that they can drive safely and competently at the much faster speeds and use motorway lanes properly.\n\nThere are simply too many new drivers on the roads each year to allow such poor driving without creating far worse congestion and accidents.",
