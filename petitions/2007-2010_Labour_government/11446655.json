            "background": "As the Olympics in London will produce a frenzy of loyalty to Great Britain, do you think it might be appropriate to have a major publicity campaign pointing out the correct way to fly the Union Jack? \n\nThe flag can often be seen being waved by hundreds of children at various televised events, many of which are up-side down which is an insult to the Crown!\n\nAs the majority of these flags are probably imported, perhaps we should also stop any imports at the border and send them back with a polite messgae pointing out the error!!\n\nI am sure other countries in the world have more respect for their flags than we do and would probably scream if their's were flown up-side down - we should educate our children to know the difference and have some respect for our Union Jack and our great country",
