            "background": "We live in a nanny state in which stupidity is often rewarded. A judge and jury should be required to assess  whether a citizen has used basic commonsense within the context of the situation and case under consideration. Failure to use  commonsense should be treated as contributory negligence. This applies to both the accused and the accuser. That may require the individual's level of commonsense to be professionally assessed. This requirement might well reduce the number of spurious claims for compensation and criminals claiming against their victims.",
