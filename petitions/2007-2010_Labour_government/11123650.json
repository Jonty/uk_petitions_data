            "background": "At present, the maximum student loan available to students recieving no other support is \u00a34510. \n\nAs the government claims this money is sufficient to support students for 12 months, (reducing the entitlement accordingly in the final year) full-time students are not permitted to claim any other benefits.\n\nOver a 12 month period, it is easy for rent to absorb say, \u00a33500 of this money, leaving students with only \u00a320 per week to live on. This is less than half of what someone would get if they were receiving JSA and housing benefit/LHA.\n\nStudents work hard and make sacrifices in an attempt to gain qualifications that will make them useful members of their community, so why does the government feel it is acceptable to offer them less support than somebody who for whatever reason, does nothing at all to earn their money?",
