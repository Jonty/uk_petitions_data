            "background": "Medical universities in the UK, and of course in the entire world are very competitive to get into, and although this allows the universities to choose applicants that they feel will be the best in all aspects of medicine, I also feel that this means many good candidates do not get the chance to study medicine, owing to the lack of medical university places available.\nWhat I would like to see happen is medical universities either increasing places on their regular Bachelor of Medicine degrees, or introducing or expanding an alternative course such as Foundation Medicine.",
