            "background": "Simplification of the tax system by removal of the 10% band can be achieved without disadvantaging anyone, by charging the lower half of last year's 10% band at 0% and the upper half at 20%.  Failing to index last year's personal allowances, including the start of the 40% band, will provide funds for redistribution to low income households without penalising those with no children or out of work through being retired",
