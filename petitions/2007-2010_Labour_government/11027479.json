            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In 1997 the Prime Minister as Chancellor raided the pension funds of ordinary working people in a short sighted money grabbing spree and against advice. Subsequently the level of pension funds has fallen from bad to worse and the current economic downturn has severely compounded the problem. The money was never the government's to take; it had been set aside to pay for retirement in a country thats State Pension scheme does not provide a living income. The raid was akin to legalised theft. Those facing retirement in the short term can expect a grim future and it is time for the Prime Minister to rectify his previous misdemeanors and return this money to its rightful owners, either by direct injection of cash into the pension funds or by substantially increasing tax relief on pensioners income.",
