There is no need for I.T Recruitment Agencies at all. \n\nThe bosses hiring the workers should be taught how to assess potential candidates themselves. \n\nFor example the NHS would thousands by recruitng I.T workers themselves rather than Outsourcing to an agency and wasting money.\n\nThe money saved could pay a nurses wages. The NHS is only one example.",
