            "background": "Using Bournemouth as an example, a new set of bus lanes is being produced near the hospital, causing chaos at a re-designed junction which worked a lot better before the authorities started screwing with it.  Ambulances are often stuck in a 300m long jam for ten minutes, and it is rare to see buses using these lanes properly, if at all.  Open bus lanes to all traffic during congestion times (7.30am-9.30am, 4pm-6pm).  Also, the roads in the area are a disgrace. Poor markings & signs, potholes, poor surfacing etc.  Stop wasting the billions you extort through road fund licenses and spend it where its really needed!",
