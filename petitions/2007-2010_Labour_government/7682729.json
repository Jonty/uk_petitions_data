            "background": "Non dependant deductions are applied to housing and council tax benefit depending on the income of all non dependants in the household. To be on housing and council tax benefit you need to be on a low income. Due to the rise in house prices over the last years, there are more and more young people living with their parents as they are unable to get onto the property ladder.  As their parents loose a proportion or all of their housing benefit it is up to the non dependant to pay the rent.  This is slowing down any advancement to the property market.  If total abolishment is not possible we would like the starting age for non dependant deductions to be raised to 25",
