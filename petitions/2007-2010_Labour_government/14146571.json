            "background": "Since mid-November, First Capital Connect drivers have been working to rule, which has meant a 50% reduction in timetabled services on the Thameslink Route.\nSeason ticket hodlers are not being reimbursed.  The franchise was awarded by and is regulated by the Department for Transport.\nMany thousands of lives are being affected.  School children are unable to travel and the cost to businesses due staff lateness is also not taken in to consideration.\nWorst of all, season ticket holders who pay for a service a year in advance, are still expected to pay for 100% of a service.\nConsumers should expect a fairer deal from a company that rakes in millions in profit.",
