Our priority must be more jobs, not more houses. \n\nPressing ahead with nationally determined regional housing targets which are already out of date and meaningless in the current economic climate is a mistake.\n\nMy petition calls upon Government to suspend the current top-down imposition of excessive housing targets through the Regional Spatial Strategy.",
