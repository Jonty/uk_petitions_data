        "background": "Many Xbox 360 owners have paid \u00a3280 for a console that soon fails with the dreaded \"3 red lights\".\n\nAnnoyingly, this often occurs after the 1 year warranty  forcing consumers to pay out another \u00a387 for Microsoft to repair the console.\n\nMicrosoft state the failure rate is 3-5%. However, all indications point it to be higher than this. One website, with 1000s of participants have shown a failure rate of 66%.\n\nThere is clearly a reliabilty problem with the console and Microsoft have shown no effort to fix it. Action needs to  be taken. At the very least, refunds for repairs and free repairs for all console owners.",
