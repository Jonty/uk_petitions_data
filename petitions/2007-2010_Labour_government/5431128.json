However, all indications point it to be higher than this. One website, with 1000s of participants have shown a failure rate of 66%.\n\nThere is clearly a reliabilty problem with the console and Microsoft have shown no effort to fix it. Action needs to  be taken. At the very least, refunds for repairs and free repairs for all console owners.",
