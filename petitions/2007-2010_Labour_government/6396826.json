            "background": "What people earn is a _private_ matter. People can use published figures as an indicator of market rates, but any more than that is always the result of negotiation between the individual employee and employer.\n\"low\" salaries exist because people keep accepting these jobs without question and/or because the employers simply cannot afford any more. Either no job at all or one offered at a lower salary.\n\"high\" salaries exist because there are limited numbers of people with the required knowledge/experience. The so-called \"extremely high salaries\" exist because so much disappears in tax.\nPeople look at what their net (after all taxes, social security etc deductions) will be. The gross salaries bear no relation to what people actually see in their bank accounts at the end of the month.\nIt is even possible in the UK to have a lower gross salary than someone else yet the net salary is higher. This results because of the unfair tax system ie not the _same_ percentage rate for _all_ salary levels.",
