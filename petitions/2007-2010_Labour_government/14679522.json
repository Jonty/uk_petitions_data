        "background": "There is currently a national speed limit of 70mph on dual carriageways and 60mph on all other roads where there is no alternative speed limit set. If a national speed limit of 30mph was introduced for villages this would both improve road safety and save money in the provision of speed limit signs. It could easily be put in place by decreeing that, as one passes a Village/Town Nameplate, it becomes 30mph and all that is needed is another Village/Town Nameplate with a line through it (similer to those in France)to end the limit.",
