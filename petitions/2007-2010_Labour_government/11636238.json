            "background": "I fully support the petition that we should reduce or negate the unfair variability of Government Funding that Surrey receives compared to Northern Counties.  Why should the population of Surrey be penalised when we are all under a great deal of financial pressure at this particular point in time.  I am a Chair of Governors of a Junior school in Farnham Surrey and have been denied capital funding for the last four years to expand our Special Needs Unit and replace some wooden classrooms built in the 1970\u2019s which are totally unsuitable for today\u2019s teaching standards.  All capital has been sidelined to secondary education and we have tried our best to save from our own Budget funding plus request  help from local charities. We are now within 10% of our target and without further funding we will have to cancel our project which goes against the logic that we could be helping to keep a Building Co in business plus employees during the current financial crisis.  Could the Prime Minister help us to overcome this problem.",
