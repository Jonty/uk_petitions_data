            "background": "Leeds United have had fifteen points deducted for there latest crime against football. Everyone seems to forget that their fans invaded the pitch on the last day of last season and the game had to be halted for reasons of safety. Surely this was a points deductable offence? Not to mention the original ten point administration ban, that should have been for this season not the end of the last one. Leeds United should be docked 30 points. Please support my petition",
