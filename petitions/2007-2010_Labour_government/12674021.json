No wonder the Government said it didn\u2019t know how much revenue it earned from IR35 when asked in Parliament and elsewhere.\n\nIt is raising just \u00a31.5m a year from the tax, a tiny amount in terms of the tax burden. Some people spend more than that on a party. The Government had expected to raise \u00a3220m a year in National Insurance contributions alone \u2013 never mind the extra income tax.\n\nIt is time to get of this pointless regulation.",
