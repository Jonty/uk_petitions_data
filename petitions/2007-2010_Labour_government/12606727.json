            "background": "It has been widely reported that Fiat are looking to buy \"Vauxhall\". Behind the headline it is clear that Fiat want to buy GM Europe and its Opel brand, and there is no interest in Vauxhall plants. If Fiat buys GM EU, Vauxhall plants will close.\nThe British Government seems to be taking its usual \"Laisser Faire\" attitude while the German government holds talks with Fiat to protect its own workers. \nThe British government must be seen in public tackling this issue.\nWe cannot keep on letting british manufacturing jobs be lost to other European factories. Manufacturing in the UK must be protected with the same fervour as the Germans and French",
