            "background": "The burden of care for these victims falls on the NHS, local authorities and unpaid family members, many of whom have their own illnesses and disabilities.\nThis extract from a BBC News report explains the problem: \u201cResearchers from Oxford University compared the cost of caring for a person with dementia to the cost of dealing with cancer, heart disease or stroke - the three main causes of death in the UK. Each dementia patient, they found, costs the economy \u00a327,647 each year - nearly five times more than a cancer patient and eight times more than those with heart disease. \nWith \u00a3600m a year, cancer research funding was 12 x the \u00a350m devoted to dementia, while heart disease received 3 times as much. Only stroke research received less. Calculations showed that for every cancer patient, \u00a3295 is spent on research, compared with just \u00a361 for each person with dementia.\u201d\nMy own father-in-law died as a result of dementia after three years of mental and physical degradation. He was cared for 1 hour a day by two professional carers required to overcome his verbal and physical violence - and for most of the other 23 hours by his 82-year-old wife with occasional family support.",
