            "background": "The introduction of DSR are now being used to determine Top Rated Seller status. This system allows everyone to abuse it leaving reputable companies to suffer at the hands of rival companies. At which point, again the sellers hands are tied. \nThere should be a time when these businesses have the legal right to ask for a detailed view of the DSR to be made available in order for issues to be corrected. eBay refuse point blank to provide this information when they encourage sellers frequently to contact buyers direct in regards to the change of unjustified feedback left.\nAll data produced on eBay in regards to individual seller activities and buyer submissions should be accessible by the seller.  \nThe feedback system shows clearly the reason for an increase or decrease of percentages so why should the DSR be private? Doubt is rising daily in regards to the legitimate scoring of DSR.\nEqual rights for the sellers who are the foundation of eBay since it started should ideally be taken in to account. The buyer is fuelled with countless ammunition to obtain by the means of fraud or to ruin the reputation that has taken some businesses years to build.",
