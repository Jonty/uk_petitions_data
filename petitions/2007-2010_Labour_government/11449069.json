            "background": "I have been eating-disordered for about 16 years now and despite being in hospital numerous times and attending my GP on regular occasions, my eating disorder had remained undiagnosed until about 2 years ago. I am now awaiting treatment, but the treatment is slow and many doctors and nurses are not sympathetic, treating it as a \"made-up\" disorder, and many younger sufferers are ignored because of their age and inability to articulate what they feel is wrong with them. I feel eating disorders should be treatedon par with physical disorders and doctors should be educated and discouraged from making damaging comments to such patients, comments I have had experience of many times in the past.",
