            "background": "As of June 2009, Henry Allingham (113) and Harry Patch (111 soon) are 2 out of the only 5 remaining World War One veterans in the world. They represent all those brave men and women who served for their country in the war. Henry Allingham, despite being over the age of 110 has worked hard to share his memories and views with the younger generation so not to forget the courage and bravery that all veterans showed. These men are an inspiration to us all. Let's not forget these men and recognise their devotion to their country by bestowing a knighthood upon them - time is running short.",
