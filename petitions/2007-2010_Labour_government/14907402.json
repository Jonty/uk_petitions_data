            "background": "Disabled adults reliant on private transport face higher disadvantage as petrol prices rise. Rurally dispersed disabled adults are particularly disadvantaged by higher pricing and increased mileage. Lack of public transport in rural areas and inaccessiblity of public transport systems if available, create a context where disabled adults must rely on private transportation.  As prices increase, disabled adults already on low or no income, face increased social exclusion and increased dependency on statutory or charitable intervention. Choice is removed.  I urge the Government to provide disabled adults with a concessionary petrol pass, ensuring quality of life for those hardest hit and the least 'enabled'.",
