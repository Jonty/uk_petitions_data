Funding was made available by Kent to the Trust in order to employ a person to provide a Family Support Service.Funding ended April 2009. The Family Support Service has always been entirely dependant on money raised for this purpose.  We have been unable to get any other grant giving body to give us the \u00a384,000 approx.that we need per year to continue to provide this free service for people and their families. This service is vital for families with autistic children in Kent. It is impartial and helps parents find their way within the various systems, i.e. schools, social services, DLA, mtgs. Parents need this service and are desperatly trying to raise awareness and funding for this service to continue. This service also allows parents to help each other. Please sign to allow this vital resource to continue! We need this service!",
