Races are short - usually four laps of an outdoor 70-90 metre circuit, lasting around 35-40 seconds \u2013 and physical contact is both legal and often necessary. Four riders contest a race, usually in pairs from opposing clubs. \nThe Riders: Top riders are explosive sprinters \u2013 but they also have stamina to enable them to keep going through a long match. Skill levels are high with slick starting, cornering and passing techniques essential. Strength is also required during contact with other riders.\n\nThe Bikes: Cycle Speedway Bikes are as simple as BMX or Track bikes \u2013 there are no gears, brakes, brackets, quick-release fittings, etc. Frames are often converted from mountain-bikes. Clothing is pretty conservative \u2013 most riders cover themselves from the neck down to protect against falls - and, of course, a helmet must be worn. Contact is expected, so many riders wear additional protection such as knee, elbow and hip pads.",
