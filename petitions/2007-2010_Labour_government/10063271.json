            "background": "Josie as a result of incorrect advice given from a home official now faces the prospect of deportation to South Africa which will mean the family unit that is has been here in the UK in the UK for the last 7 years legally will be forced apart if it is decided to deport Josie. This issue has arisen due to the fact that when Josie arrived in the UK she was a dependent on her mother and now she is now financially independent from her mother, paying taxes and intergrating well within society.",
