We petition the Government to set up sustainable long term  strategies, guided by experts who together understand the wider picture. We need absolute transparency and zero tolerance for those who cheat the system. Government must lift the spirit of the nation and give confidence and a future to the young so that they can find work, achieve a high quality of life and a good standard of living, independently of their middle class parents who currently support them in every way, but at what cost?",
