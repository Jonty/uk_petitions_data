            "background": "All Faith Schools should be banned. Religios education in our state schools should be bannned also. Schools are for the purpose of the educatation of children in the 3 Rs and other subjects. Religion should not be imposed on children before they are old enough to understand. Religion in a multi culteral society is divisive and in some cases dangerous if religion is used to justify acts of violence. Children should be free to grow into adults without the shackles of any religious ideology. Let them choose for themselves if they want to belong to a religion when they are old enough to understand, instead of being brainwashed into believing something that cannot be proven scientifically. There is ample scope to practise religion in the home and at places of worship, learning time should not be wasted in this way where children could be learning other subjects that are more important to their education and life skills.",
