            "background": "This is a problem which I have noticed time and time again.  Women who would like to take their husband's surname when they marry find that they can only legally use the masculine version in this country (e.g. an eastern european surname requiring the addition of \"ova\" for the feminine version, or changing the end vowel from \"i\" to \"a\"). British institutions (typically banks etc) will not recognise this as the same surname and require a change by deed poll for the woman to be allowed to use it.",
