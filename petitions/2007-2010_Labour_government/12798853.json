            "background": "Amend the regulations for Disability Living Allowance and Carers Allowance so that disabled individuals who continue to face additional costs as a result of their disability can continue to receive the benefit while they are in hospital and that a person who is in receipt of Carer's Allowance who continues to care for a person on DLA while they are in hospital for more than 35 hours a week can continue to receive Carer's Allowance.  At present, those with severe disability and serious health problems loose benefit due to repeated hospital admissions.  Parents of seriously disabled children are expected to continue to provide a high level of care for their children when they are in hospital and to meet exceptional costs, but all benefits stop because the child is in hospital.",
