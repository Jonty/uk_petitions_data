A paltry 14 million was given to help the North of which only 1 million actually was made available to alleviate the suffering of people who have lost everything.\n\nYet we will pour billions into Olympics to satisfy the ego's of a few. With Jowell as Minister in charge we've no chance of controlling costs. \n\nWe will lose face yes, but who cares, give it to Paris or Barcelona",
