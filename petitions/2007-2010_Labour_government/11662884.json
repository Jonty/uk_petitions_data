        "background": "Slough Borough Council would like to demolish Slough\u2019s Historic Town Hall for more unwanted flats. This landmark building is admired by thousands as they pass through Slough each day.\n\nWith its high profile A4 location opposite Salt Hill Park, stately and imposing fa\u00e7ade, flag pole, cedar tree and gardens, it is not just a scene of beauty but a focus of civic pride and democracy and a legacy for future generations. \n\nIt is irreplaceable and inspirational and is the perfect distraction from any criticism of Slough. It even received specific admiration from Sir John Betjeman.\n\nIt was designed by leading 1930s architects, C. H. James & S. R. Pierce in collaboration with celebrated sculptor, Reg Butler. It is in superb condition and period features such as marble columns, floors and staircases and oak panelling are intact. It also contains a War Memorial.\n\nFollowing listing, it would make an excellent venue for Slough Museum. The Council can still make millions from selling the larger modern extension to the rear as the Historic Town Hall forms only 19.15% of the site. \n\nThe government\u2019s adviser, English Heritage has recommended Grade II listing. The government must now list it now.",
