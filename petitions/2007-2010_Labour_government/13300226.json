        "background": "The closure of the Accident & Emergency unit at Bishop Auckland General Hospital is due to be completed on October 1st 2009. The result of this will be to risk the lives of people across a wide area of County Durham. There will be an increase in the time taken to transport the injured to hospital, endangering lives and disenfranchising friends and relatives who will find it more difficult to visit their loved ones. This decision will also place a serious burden upon the A&E services at University Hospital North Durham and Darlington Memorial Hospital as well as bringing into question the sustainability of Bishop Auckland General Hospital.",
