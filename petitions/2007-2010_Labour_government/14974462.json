        "background": "This petition calls on the Prime Minister to stop discrimination in language job postings / adverts against non-native speakers in the UK. Those applicants who feel they are confident in their language skills should not be put off by employers asking that the applicant is a \"native.\"  There are thousands of British born graduates of modern foreign languages every year who may well be fluent in their spoken language and who may well have better grammatical knowledge of the language than a native speaker. Even if an employer favours an applicant whose first language is say French or Spanish, the term \"native\" is still not appropriate, since not all natives of both countries speak these languages as a first language, consider the Basque, Catalan and Corsicans, not to mention the speakers of the regional dialects of both states. Furthermore, citizens of officially bilingual countries like Belgium, Switzerland and Canada would not easily fall into either category. How would one define native in the case of an English Canadian from Ottawa who is fluent in French and a French Canadian who speaks Joual (dialect of Montreal)?",
