        "background": "The Comic Sans font is abused by website owners everywhere. It is designed for comics, NOT for writing entire pages. It looks awful, and should be banned.\n\nOther problem with Comic Sans is that it is difficult to read compared to serif fonts, and therefore people with seeing impairments cannot read it.\n\nIt should be banned from all UK-hosted websites, as this is all that is within the power of the prime minister. This is in the hope that other countries will follow this lead.",
