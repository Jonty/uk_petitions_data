They should pass on bank of England interest rates cuts and should not be allowed to increase there interest rates to off set any bank of England rate cut. This is just another case of the British public being ripped of by greedy companies i.e. petroleum, utilities companies to mention a few. Make a stand lets say enough is enough.",
