            "background": "It was on October 10th 1947 , I recently learned , that I and others, were illegally coerced into embarking,on the SS Ormonde, to Fremantle in West Aust as child migrants !On the 22nd of June 1948 , I also recently learned that the Empire Windrush,disembarked 492 foreigners from Jamaica at Tilbury, where I and others were forcibly deported from,only 8 months before! A peer , Mickey Clynch, died earlier this year sir, in Aust . His CARER told the world ! No mother,no father,no sisters,no brothers,no aunties no one!As with me , he probably had never heard of this rust bucket,the Empire Windrush, that had our replacements aboard.I ask you sir , to bellow to the world that the British were indeed GUTLESS in throwing their offspring out of this country and into the arms of paedophiles and slave drivers, whilst complete foreigners from Jamaica , India , Sri Lanka , Pakistan , Guyana , Iran , Iraq and many other freeloaders were introduced as replacements for ourselves who GOD gave this land to ! Please admit to GUTLESSNESS,of the British, and a questionable ethic!This land is mine !",
