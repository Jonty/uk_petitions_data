        "background": "Pay as you throw schemes for waste disposal are the latest buzz word. Recently, politicians have taken the line that \"pay as you throw\" is common practice in other European countries, so it is acceptable to introduce it here, without tackling the route cause of the problem. Whilst householders should be encouraged to recycle a higher proportion of their waste, more should be done to reduce the amount of packaging that is produced in the first place. Have you ever bought a child a Barbie doll or any other toy from a high street toy shop?\nFar too much fresh food comes packaged, supermarkets should be targetted with reducing the amount of packaging that is on products. \nIntroducing Pay as you throw will encourage flytipping, which will ultimately cost UK taxpayers more, as Councils are forced to clean up.",
