People value their time and have commitments; why should they have to spend that sort of time waiting at home (and probably not even daring to go to the loo because ten to one that's when the delivery would be made) just because the company can't give a narrower time-scale?  They should remember that it is the orders of the people they are inconveniencing in this way that are keeping their companies afloat!",
