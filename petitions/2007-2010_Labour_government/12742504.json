            "background": "The decision to reduce the speed limit on rural roads is, in my view, ludicrous. I feel that lowering the limit will have no impact on the accident rate. If people have crashed when the limit was 60, there is a high probability that they were doing over the limit. So lowering it to 50 mph or 40 mph will have no affect. I also know for a fact that within Warwickshire county council, the department that sets speed limits, and deal with road safety in the afore mentioned area opposed the changes. However as it was government policy it was passed. This should not be the case. I do agree with lowering the limit through villages, and certainly near rural schools to 40 or less, however after the hazard has been passed, then the limit should be returned to 60.",
