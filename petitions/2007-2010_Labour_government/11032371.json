            "background": "As a potential nursing student next year, I have been looking into the support avaliable for us. Yes we get the bursary but alot of student nurses are struggling with there rent which they have to find out of there bursarys. Housing benefit have refused many student nurses any help with rent, Im very worried now as my rent is high due to being in private housing due to the lack of council propertys. Does this mean me and many other students are going to have to turn our backs on our dream of helping other people?",
