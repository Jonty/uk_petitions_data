            "background": "The EU is taking more money from us than we get back. At the same time they are taking away our sovereignty, and forcing our farmers, Courts, and Business to spend money on Bureaucracy, which is just plain stupid in these difficult times. They are also trying to enforce Sharia Law on our Courts. We want a British Government to decide on British issues, not a bunch of faceless EU politicians whom we did not elect, and whom we cannot vote out. \n\nWe are told that the EU provides thousands of jobs, but it did not prevent the Peugeot plant closing in the Midlands, and at the same time the EU forces us to take on hundreds of thousands immigrants, who the then qualify for housing benefits, and family allowance at huge cost to our welfare system.",
