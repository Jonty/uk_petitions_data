        "background": "People earning less than \u00a318000 pa and under the age of 65 will not be compensated for the loss of the 10% rate of income tax . People over 65 have seen a massive increase in their personal allowance which more than compensates them.\n\nIs it fair that someone who has retired before normal retirement (65) on a modest company pension will see their tax bill double. Most early retired people will have the annual increment on their pension negated by the loss of this rate, how are we supposed to keep up with cost of living without a rise in income. Once again this government has not thought through the full consequences of their action and once again the poorest member's of society will suffer.",
