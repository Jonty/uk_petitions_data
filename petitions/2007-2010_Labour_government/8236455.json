            "background": "As someone with ongoing Mental Health Issues I live in Sheltered Accommodation and claim sickness benefits. I hope in time to return back to work on a part time basis since I am only young. However I have the increasing worry that as a council tenant I could lose my home if I return to work because I would no longer be claiming Incapacity Benefit. My long term Mental Health Problems mean I will never fully recover but I feel I still should have the opportunity to work without the worry my home could be taken off me if I choose to go back to work.",
