He can then see his own children burned to death by the \"war veterans\" as they have only in the last few days done to others- without penalty. \n\nWe appreciate  the British Ambassador has done sterling work in Zimbabwe to reveal the true state of affairs there but he must run the risk of a \"tit for tat\" expulsion in view of the gravity of the situation.     \n\n\"All that requires for evil to flourish is that good men do nothing\"",
