        "background": "If the airfield at Little Rissington in Gloucestershire was to re-open as a major civil airfield it would be a boost to the local economy and local area. The airfield is a historic site because the Red Arrows used to be stationed there at one time. It has the same history as Kemble and I would really like to see civil flying from Little Rissington. This would be very popular both with people in the local community and aviation enthusiasts all over the country.",
