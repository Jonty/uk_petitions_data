Firstly, American customary measures are different than our imperial measures; we have introduced our imperial measures in 1824 - AFTER America became independent from Britain. Secondly, the US is now being slowly but continually metricated. It's also untrue that imp. measures are British; most of them were imposed by the Romans and even their abbrevations such as lb and oz are Italian.",
