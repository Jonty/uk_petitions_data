            "background": "The current labour government is only in power as Tony Blair was the leader at the last election. This government has failed to deliver on its election promises and has shown and continues to show utter contempt for the armed forces and the public services that keep the British public safe and care for them when they are in need of help. The current government was chosen by the people, and Mr Brown should do the right thing and let the people decide again. But as we all know, he will not as he is scared and all he wants to do is remain in office. We call on Mr Brown to do the right the thing.......call a general election, and allow the British public, those whom you are supposed to serve, decide who they want as a government.",
