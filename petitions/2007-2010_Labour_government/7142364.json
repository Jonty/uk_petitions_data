Withdrawal symptoms can include\n\nElectric Shock and \"brain shiver\" sensations. These sensations may represent significant alteration of neuronal activity in the central nervous system.\n\nOther symptoms include confusion, impaired coordination, sensory disturbances, vertigo, delirium, strokelike symptoms, and depersonalization. Patients that miss medication for more than 24 hours can experience the \"electric shock\" \"brain shiver / popping\" and general confusion. The maker states that this medication is non addictive.\n\nTyping \"venlafaxine withdrawal\" into any search engine will reveal support groups and medical abstract to support this claim.",
