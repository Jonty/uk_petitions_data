Pay specific attention to sections B, C and I.\n\n4. Fraud by abuse of position\n\n(1) A person is in breach of this section if he\u2014\n\n(a) occupies a position in which he is expected to safeguard, or not to act against, the financial interests of another person,\n\n(b) dishonestly abuses that position, and\n\n(c) intends, by means of the abuse of that position\u2014\n\n(i) to make a gain for himself or another, or\n\n(ii) to cause loss to another or to expose another to a risk of loss.\n\n(2) A person may be regarded as having abused his position even though his conduct consisted of an omission rather than an act.\n\nMP\u2019s and their expenses are just like benefit thieves. Lets bring them to account.",
