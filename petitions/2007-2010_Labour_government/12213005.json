It goes on to say: \"Another UK study found that more than 50% of LGB men and women who had been bullied at school contemplated self-harm or suicide, while 40% had made at least one attempt to self-harm. A further study found that more than 20% had attempted suicide.\"...If we are to prevent a significant percentage of our children being victimised, led into self-hatred, self-harm and suicide attempts, then teachers should be teaching that being homosexual is a perfectly reasonable thing to be.\" - Phil Beadle, via.
