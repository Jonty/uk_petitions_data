        "background": "Libraries are places of information and relaxation.  They should be a refuge for the alienated and excluded, and a source of help for the whole community.  \n\nMuch of their worth is based as much on staff and on atmosphere as well as on book stock.  Uniformed staff will mitigate against a welcoming atmosphere and against the excluded feeling comfortable.  Visiting a library will become more like visiting a police station, and the human touch will be lightened.\n\nMoney should not be wasted on uniforms when it could be spent on books.",
