            "background": "One reason London won the 2012 Olympics was that - allegedly! - we wanted it so much.  The reason for this perception (which, in my experience at least, was completely incorrect) is that  everywhere you went in London you were urged to back the bid but there were no facilities to register opposition to it.  \n\nThe purpose of this petition, therefore, is an attempt to ensure that the same does not happen with the 2018 World Cup bid.  If the majority of people want it that's fair enough but those of us who don't want it should be able to have our say too.",
