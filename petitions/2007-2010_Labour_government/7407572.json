            "background": "I have created this petition to bring to the attention of this Government the fact that media in general, and television media in particular, allows the use of the phrase \"Oh My God\" as a common expression of surprise. No control is exercised as to context or repetition and therefore the use of the word \"God\" is devalued and reduced to meaninglessness.\n\nAs a Christian and a believer in a deity I call God I find that the use of the phrase in the media is disrespectful of my Christian beliefs and in general offensive to my faith. I call upon the Prime Minister to severely curtail or prevent the use of this phrase.\n\nIn terms of other world religions it is clear that it would be an enormous offence to insert the name of other deities into the phrase \"Oh My ....\", when used in the gratuitous manner previously described, therefore parity with them is all that is required.",
