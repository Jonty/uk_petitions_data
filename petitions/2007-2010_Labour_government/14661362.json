            "background": "On the 5th February 2010 there was another fatal accident on the A329M a car crossed from one carriageway to the other and had a head-on collision. In the last decade many fatal accidents have occurred for the same reason, deaths avoidable if the road had crash barriers between its two carriageways.\nThe A329M is believed to be the only motorway in the country without such barriers. The reason is that the road is managed by Wokingham Council and not the Highways Agency. The Council has applied for government funding for the provision of crash barriers and for two years they have been unsuccessful. Funding required to install the barriers is estimated to be \u00a34m. The monetary cost of a fatal accident (if we can price a human life) is estimated to be \u00a31m so even for purely financial reasons it makes sense for the barriers to be fitted.\nThis petition asks the PM to directly intervene to prevent further deaths on this road, one of the main entry routes into Reading and used by thousands of commuters and families everyday. We ask him to ensure immediate adoption of the A329M by the Highways Agency and upgrading of the road to the same safety standards as other motorways.",
