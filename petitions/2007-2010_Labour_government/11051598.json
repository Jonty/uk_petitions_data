How many more children have to die before these people accept that they ARE NOT doing their jobs properly and they are not protecting children the way they should be?\nSharon Shoesmith's statement that they 'had done all they could' has only angered us further - the woman obviously should not be in charge of these things if she thinks this was inevitable.\nSo, I put it to you that these people should not be allowed to work for the safety of the UK's children - as they are quite apparently not capable of doing so.\nPlease, don't let anymore innocent children die because of neglect, not only by their parents but by social services",
