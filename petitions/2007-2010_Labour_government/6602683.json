Although initial filing can be done online, a lot of time is wasted because of the insistence for documents to be filed by post.\n\nThis petition urges the Prime Minister and his government to consider whether innovation is being tackled in an innovative way, and to ensure that the Patent Office is reformed to ensure modern and efficient operation.",
