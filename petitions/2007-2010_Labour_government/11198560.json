I have randomly read through numerous closed and rejected petitions on this site and I could not find any that the government reply was \"we agree\". If the petition doesn't fit with government policy it is fobbed off or rejected. If the government is not interested in the publics point of view then stop fooling us with this waste of space E-Petitions site.",
