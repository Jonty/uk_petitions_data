        "background": "This is in response to a petition which alleges that while medical staff for PHYSICAL conditions have been laid off psychiatry is fully funded.  I have yet to see any evidence of this; and, in fact, in my Local Authority mental health services are taking the brunt of cuts necessitated by freezing Council Tax.  \n\nPsychiatric conditions seem not to be as well understood as physical conditions but they are just as serious, disabling, and debilating as physical conditions of equivalent severity.  In fact as someone suffering from clinical anxiety and Asperger Syndrome I often feel I would be treated with FAR more sympathy if a had a visible PHYSICAL disability.",
