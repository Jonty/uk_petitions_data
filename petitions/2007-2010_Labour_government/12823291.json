Children are growing up in a perfumed chemical fog.  The products are linked with\n\n\u2022 skin, eye and lung irritation\n\u2022 impaired thinking\n\u2022 allergy\n\u2022 earache\n\u2022 obesity\n\u2022 vomiting\n\u2022 diarrhoea\n\u2022 urinary infection\n\u2022 hormone disruption\n\u2022 depression\n\u2022 immune and nervous system damage\n\u2022 genital deformity\n\u2022 genetic mutation\n\nPerfumes may be harming bees, which are vital for food production.\n\nWe request the government to prohibit the release of artificial perfumes; require labels on artificially-perfumed products stating that the chemicals are untested and may harm adults, children and foetuses; make manufacturers stop using artificial perfumes, including 'masking fragrances'; ban the importation of artificially-perfumed products; fund research ON HUMANS into health risks of artificial perfumes; and clarify existing legislation to define artificial perfume release as pollution, neighbour nuisance and anti-social behaviour.",
