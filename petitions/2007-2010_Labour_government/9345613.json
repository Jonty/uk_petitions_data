        "background": "This project is doomed to failure due to the trackbed now being blocked in numerous places. The cost of going around any blockages is massive.\n\nThe railway would spoil what is the best part of the Lake District.\n\nMany peoples homes back onto this railway and the railway would cause noise and nuisance.\n\nThere is no need for a railway, the A66 runs well inside its capacity with cars, buses and taxis.\n\nLets put a stop to this madcap idea to reopen the railway.",
