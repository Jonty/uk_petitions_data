With no one taking the affects of global warming seriously, i have created this petition for people who want to do something to protect our planet.  The prime minister should also do more world wide to persuade other countries to do much more on the matter.\n\nI ask for new plans to be put in place worldwide, and a huge recycling incentive to be put into place worldwide.  The burning of rainforests must also be stopped.\n\nDo we want to have our planet for our children to live on? or not?  Its up to you.",
