        "background": "millions of pound worth of car tax are being lost each year through east European cars that are using our roads but not paying any car tax for the privilege.\nI am calling on the Primeminister to make it law that all east European cars must register at point of entry and make it a criminal offence (just like any British road user) not to have a current tax disc for stay's over 1 month.\nBy registering cars it will then be possible to track down cars that are driving without tax, insurance or MOT.\nNot only will this create revenue  for the government but it will also crack down on uninsured  drivers from eastern Europe who cost the British insurance industry and car owners millions of pounds each year.",
