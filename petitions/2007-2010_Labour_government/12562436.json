            "background": "The petitions aim is to send a message to the government that we do not want any part of education privatised especially not that concerning the education of vulnerable and possibly 'troubled' children. The NUT (National Union of Teachers) is also against the proposal. There is currently a trial featuring 12 PRU's being run by 12 private companies. Private companies will have control over PRU's and will have the ability to change the cirruculum, they will inevitebly cut corners so they can cut costs. Privatising education is not the way to go.",
