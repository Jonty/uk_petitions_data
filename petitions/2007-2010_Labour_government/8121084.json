            "background": "In October 2007 Cadbury chocolates brought back the Wispa due to popular demand but only on a trial period.  Most retailers have now run out of stock.  Please help to convince Cadbury that the Wispa should be a permanent product and embodies the era of 1980's Britain and surely the fact that stocks have ran out already proves that this chocolate bar must be kept in permanent production.",
