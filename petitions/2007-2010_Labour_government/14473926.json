        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "\u00a3500,000 it cost 14 years ago to build a market hall for the people of Bromsgrove to buy lower priced goods and to use it as a facility for social events. The council have decided to now demolish it to create more car parking spaces. The decision was not made by consulting the people of Bromsgrove, 100 questionaire cards were sent out and two thirds said they did not want a market. But The Save the Market campaigners collected 1500 plus signitures to say the people 'did' want the market. Due to the petition, the council decided to have a public meeting on 19th January 2009, but no one was allowed to speak and the application was thrown out. This council is wasting our money. We want the market saved, please sign our petition saying you want to save the market here in Bromsgrove.",
