            "background": "As a young Primary teacher myself, I was appalled and shocked to hear of a fellow teacher's plight in Sudan. After many years of teaching here in the UK, she went abroad to pass that teaching on to those children in Sudan that don't have the same opportunities. She is paying for this with her freedom. The British Government should be doing a whole lot more to bring Gillian Gibbons home; please, after all her years of dedication to the UK, this is the very least she is owed by this country. FREE GILLIAN GIBBONS NOW!",
