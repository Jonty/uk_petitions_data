            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Currently in the UK if a UK driver is hit by a foreign lorry there is very little chance of successfully claiming against the lorry driver. There is simply not the procedure there to be able to get the drivers details from the country they are from needed to successfully process the claim. However, if a UK driver hits another driver abroad the DVLA can be contacted and their details are easily gained and the claim made against them.\n\nIt is therefore time for this to change. The trauma of being hit by a lorry is something few people who have experienced it will ever forget, but to have a lengthy and usually unsuccessful fight to try and simply get the appropriate compensation is frankly unacceptable and down right unfair.\n\nThis petition is therefore asking the government to change this policy and make it easier for UK drivers to have a fair chance when such an incident occurs.",
