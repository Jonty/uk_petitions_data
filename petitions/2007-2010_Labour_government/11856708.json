        "background": "Clause 12.1 of the CAP code, which binds advertisers to criteria such as substantiation and truthfulness in messages they present to the public, states: \n\n\"12.1 Any advertisement or direct marketing communication, whenever published or distributed, whose principal function is to influence voters in local, regional, national or international elections or referendums is exempt from the Code.\"\n\nWe believe that allowing the code to be waived for such a fundamental purpose as influencing voters flies in the face of the principles of democracy, and that clause 12.1 should be removed, and political advertisements bound to the same standards of truth and substantiation as all other advertising.",
