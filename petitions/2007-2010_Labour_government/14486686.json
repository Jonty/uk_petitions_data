            "background": "We call upon the UK Government to take immediate action to improve the lives of the UK\u2019s 100,000 people living with MS by committing to delivering on their rights to:\n- Quality and specialist health care throughout life, including fair access to the right drugs and treatments.\n- Personalised care and support, wheelchairs and enabling equipment to live independently.\n- Support in and out of work, and support for carers.\n\nMS is a complex, unpredictable condition with no known cure. MS can have a serious and progressive impact on a person\u2019s physical, emotional and mental wellbeing, and can lead to severe and permanent disability. Across the UK, serious inequalities in access to drugs, treatments, enabling equipment and support services mean that people with MS are being denied their entitlements every day. We believe that the Government has a duty to ensure that every person with MS in the UK gets the quality care and support they need in order to live their lives to the full.",
