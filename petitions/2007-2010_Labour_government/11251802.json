        "background": "Royal Mail is not for sale; be it on a minority shares basis or complete privatisation. History shows that privatisation in whatever form leads to increased prices for the customer and reduced/scaled-back services. We want Royal Mail to become profitable within the public sector, wholly-owned by the Government. Without the need for TNT. What can TNT do that Royal Mail cant? The answer is nothing and this excercise will only serve to strip out valuable public assets. Let us all gain from a healthy, profitable, 100% Government-Owned Royal Mail.",
