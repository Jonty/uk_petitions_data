            "background": "By completely doing away with cheques,you are taking away peoples liberties in the way people prefer to  pay for the services they use,\nlike small businesses, market holders, etc,and for those who have no use of a computer for online services. \nFor smaller businesses to have the chip and pin service would be completely to expensive (more profit for the banks) and inpractical for them to use. Some feel that chip and pin not secure.last option would be cash, meaning that people would have to carry larger amounts of cash around with them, leading to more issues.\nSo come on banks, stop making excuses, like it cost to much to process,its a cost cutting exercise in the long run.",
