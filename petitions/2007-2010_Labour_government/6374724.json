            "background": "The technology exists to enable us to completely automate the running of the Underground trains on London's Tube network. Indeed similar technology is currently already used on the DLR service. \n\nThe Government needs to break the strangleholds that Unions like RMT have on it. When Rail Unions are allowed to bring the capital to a stand still over issues such as job insecurity which the rest of us simply have to live with then change is overdue.\n\nAutomating the Underground network would increase reliability and efficiency. It would also release a great deal of inflated salary money which could be invested back into improving the infrastructure.\n\nLondon needs a transport system capable of meeting the demands of the 21st Century and the Tube is a vital component.",
