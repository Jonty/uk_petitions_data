            "background": "Currently the free childcare placement is only available at the start of the term following the childs first birthday. In some cases this means that the child is almost 3 1/2 years old before the free place becomes available. This is too long and unfair on those who have children days after the cut off. It does not promote parents to return to employment nor encourage inclusion into the early development schemes the government promotes.",
