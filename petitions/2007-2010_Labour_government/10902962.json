        "background": "This petition is for the outright banning of the BNP in a way seen in the earlier part of the 20th century for other far right parties. This is because the BNP are a front for racist and unreasonable people. There main purpose is to cause trouble and incite racial hatred and there is no place for them in a decent, civil and democratic society like Britain where every individual is treated with the same respect regardless of race, gender or sexuality etc.",
