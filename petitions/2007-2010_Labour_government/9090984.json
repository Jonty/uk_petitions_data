            "background": "When airlines \"lose\" (misplace) luggage through their own fault, they sell it off at an auction, where it is picked up by people who search through the luggage and resell it to the original owner. This is behaviour which should be illegal. Not only does the airline lose the luggage (and makes no effort to find the original owner) but it gains by selling the luggage.",
