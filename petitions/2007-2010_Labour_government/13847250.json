            "background": "The UK airline industry has become unique in forcing the majority of customers to pay excessive charges just to pay for their flights. It is now even common for airlines to charge when payment is made using a debit card. In this case the banks charge 15p - 50p per tranaction and yet a consumer buying 2 x \u00a3200 flights will be forced to pay over \u00a313 just for paying for the flights. The loophole of offering zero charges for paying with Visa Electron is not acceptable as they are virtually impossible to obtain in the UK.\n\nAs such we the undersigned wish the insist on fair payment charges",
