This is a catastrophic decision and will not only leave blood on the MPs hands as people will die in traffic on their way to Worthing, but will also see local economy suffer as surrounding private hospitals such as the Chichester Nuffield, will also be forced to close as they rely on trauma patients from St Richards.",
