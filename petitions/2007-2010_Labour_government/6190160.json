            "background": "This IS similar, but it is NOT identical, to the previous petition advocating a higher minimum wage; because it specifically refers to the maximum hours stated in the Working Time Directive.  It was created in response to a petition asking for the Working Time Directive to be abolished (I think; something similar anyway) on the grounds that this Directive means some people are unable to earn a living wage.  Leaving aside the fact that I thought Britain had opted out of the W.T.D. surely a 48-hour week is long enough - if not far too long - to have to work; after time needed for meals, sleep, etc. how much time would be left for any sort of leisure or other relaxation?  We should be able to work to live, not live to work, or what sort of life is it?  We are humans; not beasts of burden.",
