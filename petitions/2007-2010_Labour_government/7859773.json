            "background": "I urge the people of this country to sign this petition in the hope that it will force this and any future government to see economic sense and cancel the 2012 UK Olympics. The costs are already getting out of control. Originally 9.3 bn, now 12bn. What will the final bill be to the tax payer, 15bn plus ?. Lets spend that money on something which will benefit the whole country for generations to come like improving our schools, the Tube network, the NHS etc",
