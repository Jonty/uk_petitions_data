            "background": "The Oakbank & Fieldway area of New Addington has seen crime and abuse rise rapidly recently. \nThe main problems are gang related. \nWith youths ranging from 9 to 18 yr olds roaming the streets after dark causing havoc. \nCars are being smashed into, homes are being targeted with eggs and stones. \nVerbal abuse is shouted daily to residents. \nThe lighting in the area is sparse and dull. There are no CCTV's to record any evidence. \nPolice patrols are sparse. \nWe need better street lighting, CCTV cameras and more police patrols. \nWe do not feel safe in our own homes at the moment which is every citizens right to do so.",
