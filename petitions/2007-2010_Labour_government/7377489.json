        "background": "To ensure commitment to the UK, all prospective immigrants would be vetted for security, medical, linguistic, educational and psychological suitability for military service, which would then be compulsory within 6 months of arriving in the UK, or upon reaching the age of 18 years, and would be for a minimum of 2 years. There would be no alternatives to the armed forces. Those unable to meet the required standards would not be permitted to enter the UK.There would continue to be exceptions for proven cases of asylum, compassionate and other grounds which currently allow immigration and a right of appeal would still exist",
