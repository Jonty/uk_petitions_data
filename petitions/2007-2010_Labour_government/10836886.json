            "background": "Doctor's currently make charges for signing a variety of forms.  Some weight loss systems require a signature from their doctor's confirming medical history.  These charges are as high as \u00a330 thereby deterring many from attempting to lose weight.  Given the rise of obesity levels in the UK, we feel a doctor\u2019s signature to assist in weight loss should come free under the NHS.",
