        "action": "legislate for the nationalization of the national money supply in the interest of bringing stability and sustainability to the economic system and more fairness to citizens. To achieve this by empowering the Bank of England alone to create debt-free money and for the government to put this money to use for public investment and also to any means that will channel a fairer share of national wealth to each citizen. This reform will involve the restriction of commercial banks to the retailing of loans, making it illegal for them to create money.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Whilst it is illegal for anyone to create money in the form of coins and banknotes,  banks create bank account money (often called \u2018credit\u2019) which forms 95% of the public money supply. It is a product of private production as they create it from nothing. Much of this money has been directed to speculative use for asset-buying where profits accumulated quickly but evaporated when the asset bubbles burst. Productive uses of money for manufacturing, public investment and services were less favoured - as is  especially being seen now.  \n\nCurrently, government spending beyond taxation receipts has to be borrowed and this commits taxpayers to interest payments into the future. Savings would accrue if debt-free money were created by the central bank (Bank of England) and given to the government to spend on its democratically determined, sustainable development projects. Because no interest would be payable, inflationary pressures would ease and more projects might be undertaken. Through this reform the national wealth would be spread in a fairer way. \n\nWith similar measures promoted by the G20, the world economic scene would rapidly be repaired and transformed.",
