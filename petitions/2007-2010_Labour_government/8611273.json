            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Many 18 year olds congregate with under 18\u2019s.  An 18 year old who has not broken away from adolescent behaviour would be legally allowed to buy alcohol who would then supply it to their underage friends.\nRising the legal age to 21 would cut down the amount of alcohol bought and supplied to under 18\u2019s.\nThis is based on the idea that a person who is 21 is LESS likely to congregate with under 18\u2019s therefore the supply chain will be cut. We believe that by the time a person has reached 21, maturity will have taken hold of most people.\nIf the law required a person to be 21 to buy alcohol the adolescent 18 year old would NOT be able to buy alcohol and supply it to their underage friends. \nAlthough this measure would not totally eradicate problems with youths drinking we believe that it would go a long way to reducing problems we see on our streets night after night",
