            "background": "This petition is in reference to recent news of Britain starting to pull out of Afghanistan next year. We (the public) have been told that we are in Afghanistan to stop Taliban, insurgents and the overall terror threat on this country. However we are now being told we are going to start pulling troops out next year just as the threat level is raised to 'severe'. The Afghan Army is not ready to take on the Taliban by themselves, and they won't for a fair few years to come. If we pull out and the Taliban rise again and take back provinces that our soldiers have died for then all those lives were lost for nothing. We need something big to show for our countries sacrifice. We need to start deploying more troops out there next year, not pulling them out.",
