            "background": "The fact that the Government shyed away from the 'expenses' vote, shows complete contempt for the views of the electorate. No where else in public service can anyone vote on their own salary and expenses. Coupled to this the fact they want their expenses to 'clouded' from pubic scrutiny shows that MP's are totally deviod from the real life problems the electorate faces. We would like G. Brown to support a new vote and use the 'whip process' to ensure his party support his views, and not as they did in the last vote",
