            "background": "Employers can can currently exclude smokers from applying for jobs by advertising for non-smokers only. Smokers also have no protection from being dismissed from their jobs simply because they are smokers. This is unfair and should be illegal. Other minority groups, such as homosexuals, and ethnic peoples, are protected by law but smokers are not. A recent plea to the dept of Work and Pensions was refused. Labour Minister Stephen Timms said a law to protect certain groups should only be made if it would not be better addressed through non-legislative measures such as guidance or voluntary codes. Smokers should have the same rights as other minority groups and a Govt that has already shown itself to be an obsessive law-maker should now introduce legislation and prove it is not encouraging discrimination towards a certain British group.",
