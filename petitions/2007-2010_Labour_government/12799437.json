            "background": "In 1536, the Act of Union brought England and Wales together, united into one.  We believe that Wales should have full identity as a sovereign status as the people of Wales were forced into this union by force.\n\nWhen Wales was brought into the Union it had never had separate sovereign status like Scotland and Ireland\n\nWe have our language, our flag and different sense of values that sometimes sets us apart from many other Countries.  \n\nWe have been given a Welsh Assembly to keep the masses quiet, but majority of decisions still have to be passed by Westminster.\n\nWe appreciate this, but we still would like to be classed as a Country and not a Suburb of England.",
