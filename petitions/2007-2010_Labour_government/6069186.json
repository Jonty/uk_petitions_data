            "background": "0844, 0845, 0870 or 0871 Telephone Numbers\n\nThese phone numbers are popping into use everywhere. Many phone companies have deals for their customers where they get 24/7 free UK calls to landlines. Not much good if you're faced with a 0844, 0845, 0870 or 0871 number which will cost you up to 10p per minute to call. My phone company charges me \u00a315 per month and I get unlimited UK landline calls 24/7. No use if I am forced to use the 0844, 0845, 0870 or 0871. \n\nThe tax offices are on them, so are health departments, DVLA, Insurance companies, airlines . . . the lot. They do this because they share the minute rate profits with the phone company. How about that? The DVLA and the Inland Revenue (to name just two government services) are making profits because you need to call them . . \n\nGive the users a choice - if they are on a deal with their phone company - they use the geographical number. If not then the 0844, 0845, 0870 and 0871 may be used.\n\nThis is the fairest approach.",
