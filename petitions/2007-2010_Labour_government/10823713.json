It is verging on fraud.\n\nShort term strategies for banks are unacceptable, they are institutions, which, are supposed to be the backbones of our society. I would like to propose that in order to be an executive of a bank, or a dealer in 'the city', you should have to join a register in order that your credibility is understood by all. \n\nThese reckless bankers have been 'playing' with our economies for nothing other than their own personal gain.\n\nThe entire world depends on banks for stability, this is about to be lost. Once we start losing stability, then it is fairly safe to assume that wars of some sort will be around the corner.\n\nThe government needs to act, and act long term for the stability of all.",
