We are British and english is our native tongue - and for all members of a community to understand what is being advertised within their community is vital.\n\nWhether it is an advert for a local playgroup or a notice displayed by the local Police aimed at an ethnic minority - a translation will allow all members of the community to be involved and feel valued - not discriminated against and disadvantaged as is the case at the moment.  We cannot possibly hope to become a united society when language and therefore understanding, divide us.",
