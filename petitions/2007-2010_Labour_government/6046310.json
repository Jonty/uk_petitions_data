            "background": "On the continent, they have a system of limiting opportunities for goods vehicles to overtake.\n\nIt is our contention that goods vehicles being allowed to crawl past one another on the UK's motorway system forces faster moving cars to converge on the outside lane thereby causing traffic to slow and the inevitable ripple effect. This creates an hazzard to all motorway users.\n\nThe signers of this petition wish the government to introduce a continental style ban on goods vehicles overtaking on stretches of motorway where it is deemed dangerous to other traffic.",
