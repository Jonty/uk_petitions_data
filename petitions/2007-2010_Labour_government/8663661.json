Not only would this make it a safer place to be \"fireworks can be dangerous, unfortunately each year around a thousand people are injured by fireworks in Britain\" (quote from HSE web Site), but also prevent fireworks being let off at random times of the day & night,by anti-social individulas causing distress to both us and animals.",
