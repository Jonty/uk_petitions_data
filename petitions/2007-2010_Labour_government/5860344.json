However, despite the millions of pounds that Bloomsbury publishing have made from this and other titles, the cost of the Large Print version for those with sight difficulties will be \u00a340. For a children's book which could easily be sold at a far lower price, given the relatively small numbers of the titles needed and the vast amount of money made on the other titles, this seems like exploitation and profiteering.\n\nGiven that information has to be made available for people in alternative formats without penalty this should also be the case with books.",
