The British nation has for years applied commen sense to it's law making and exhibited tolerance, even appeasment, to satisfy, what are still a minority community, in our midst. This would appear not to be enough. Having served in our armed forces AND having lived in an Islamic country, I fail to see ANY benefit of \"adopting\" what is essentially an islamic ideal in our still majority Christian country. The only effect can be a wider disharmony (where one group are treated differently to the rest). Please see sense and put this matter to bed once and for all.",
