            "background": "There are few traditions in this country that still convey the true meaning of the event as does Sussex Bonfire, most well known in Lewes but also other Sussex towns and villages. Through a mixture of misunderstanding, political correctness and health and safety fanaticism many have tried and continue to try, to ban or sanitise this gloriously & uniquely British tradition. If they succeed then we will be left with yet another event like Christmas where the true meaning has been, or almost been, lost and commercialised. \n\nWe strongly feel that traditions like this should be enshrined in legislation that prevents their ban or alteration of the way they have been carried out for hundreds of years and preserves the rights of our people to carry them on. \n\nFor those that do not like the noise, the fireworks on the street or the effigies the answer is simple \u2013 do not go. \n\nLong live Sussex Bonfire & all this country\u2019s ancient traditions \u2013 let\u2019s see a government stand up for our traditions and preserve them in legislation so they can never be lost forever.",
