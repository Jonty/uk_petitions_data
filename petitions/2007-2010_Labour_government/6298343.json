But this is often completely untrue - the Prime Minister can sing \"We're going to hang out the washing on the Siegfried line\" while standing in a barrel of custard if he wants to and to suggest otherwise is entirely wrong. I don't see why he couldn't pass a law to stop the Yanks calling us Brits. I thought Blair was mates with Blur. \n\nFrankly, with their powers, the government should be able to do anything. Stopping Simon Edwards with the new anti-terrorist powers should be a piece of cake and to not have done so is to endanger the public.",
