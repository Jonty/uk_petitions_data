            "background": "Just before the Mayor of London was elected the Government signed two 30 year Public Private Partnership contracts for the renewal of the London Underground. This was in the face of opposition from the Mayor of London. The Governmant said it was aiming to transfer the risk of an overspend from the public purse to the private sector. With one of the consortiums who were awarded a contract, Metronet, petitioning for administration there is a possibility it may eventually go into receivership. If this happens the public purse will not only have been liable for the cost of the contract (money spent to transfer risk) but also for the \u00a32bn overspend. It is important that this liability is met by central Government - and not by Londoners who overwhelmingly rejected the PPP at the ballot box. The Government should ensure that from now on ALL aspects of London's transport remain firmly devolved and in the hands of the Mayor of London.",
