            "background": "Even here, on E-Petitions, Transport and Infrastructure is a combined category. \n\nAdding the word 'Public' to the word \"Transport\" doesn't alter the primary function or concept of it. Transport conveys freight and, in the case of 'Public Transport', that freight is human. There is no good reason why human freight should be expected to contribute toward its own transportation while every other form of freight is exempt.\n\n'Public Transport' transports 'human resources' and customers to and from all kinds of places of business including shops, offices and factories as well as leisure and entertainment businesses. \n\nThese are the intended and actual beneficiaries of the public transport service and having business pay for it, directly, should make far more economic sense than the current system which is unnecessarily complex, inefficient and, also, iniquitous. \n\nIn addition to being fairer, free public transport would, I believe, be far more universally utilised and lead to great strides being made towards relevant 'Green' Government targets.",
