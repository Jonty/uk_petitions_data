            "background": "On buses and more so on commuter trains, passengers use two adjoining seats to accommodate one body and its baggage.  This deprives passengers joining the journey from getting seated without a search or question to sit down.  The seated body is reluctant to free up the seat on which bags are placed.  None of the luggage racks above the seats is loaded with personal baggage.  I want the Government to push for and support train company campaigns aimed at their travelling users that say put bags on the racks or the floor, not on the seats.  I ask the Government to introduce enforceable regulations that govern better management of train and bus accommodation in this way.",
