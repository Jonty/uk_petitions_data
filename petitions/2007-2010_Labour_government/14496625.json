            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The Skipton building society, and other lending institutions, have raised their Standard Variable Rate when the Bank of England rate is unchanged. This allows them to widen the gap between savings rates and lending rates at the expense of borrowers, and in defiance of the economic conditions set by the Bank of England - effectively allowing them to make bigger profits. In the case of the Skipton, this is particularly high-handed because they guaranteed borrowers that their SVR would not be more than 3% above the Bank of England rate at the time they took out their mortgages. Because of the credit crunch, lenders have restricted lending criteria, and house prices have fallen, so many borrowers cannot move to another lender as they no longer meet the criteria for a new mortgage. Hence borrowers are being ripped off to line the pockets of the bank.",
