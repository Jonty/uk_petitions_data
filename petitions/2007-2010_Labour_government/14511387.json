            "background": "The German and French governments have started to encourage people to upgrade away from the browser Internet Explorer 6 (IE6).\n\nIE6 has some security flaws that leave users vulnerable.  These two governments have let their populations know that an upgrade will keep them safer online.  We should follow them.\n\nWhen the UK government does this, most of Europe will follow.  That will create some pressure on the US to do so too.\n\nMost creative and software development companies are forced by government department clients to build websites for IE6 when most of the industry has moved on.\n\nCompanies insist that they need IE6 support because government departments use it and won't be able to see their sites or services without it.  \n\nUpgrading would be a massive task for government, but if the public is encouraged to lead the way and the government follows, that would create the momentum needed.\n\nIE6 'end of life' was extended to 2014 by governments and business not ready (or willing) to upgrade.  This cycle should be broken and innovation and security given their proper place.",
