        "background": "The Food Standards Agency is advising the government yet again that folic acid should be added to our bread on a mandatory basis, despite this previous advice on their own website \"Unless you are pregnant or thinking of having a baby, you should be able to get all the folate you need by eating a varied and balanced diet.\" (see link http://www.eatwell.gov.uk/healthydiet/nutritionessentials/vitaminsandminerals/folicacid/) They have now changed this advice. Why? For more information on the risks of ingesting synthetically produced folic acid check the Institute of Food Research article on http://www.ifr.ac.uk/media/Newsreleases/071030folic_acid_fortification.html. \n\nPlease sign and stop this request for mass medication becoming law.",
