            "background": "We, the public are disgusted and outraged by the death of yet another child, who was on the supposed child protection list. The people that deny blame are the ones to blame! i.e. the Doctor and the Head of Social Services. This tragedy could've been prevented! What happened to the new protection laws made in 2000 after the death of 8 years old Victoria Climbie in the same area? THIS MUST STOP! More action needs to be taken and these poor children need justice!!!",
