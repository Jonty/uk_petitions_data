        "background": "A \u00a340'000 pay rise on basic pay given to MP's during a time of financial instability and spiraling inflation is a snub to all citizens of Britain. The self awarded pay rise (even with the removal of the second home allowance)is an increase above and beyond anything that any 'normal' person would receive over many years. We pay these MP's wages from our own hard earned, over taxed wages, and are not being compensated for the current financial burden being imposed on every citizen in the UK by the incompetent running of the british economy.",
