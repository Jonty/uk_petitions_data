            "background": "Discrimination against single people should be regarded as a serious matter, with legislative protection against it. \n\nIt is not a crime to be single but single people usually have to pay more for poorer quality deals. Many social opportunities are denied to single people, such as dining out and holidays, with advertisements for so much 'per couple' and nothing for singles. Where holidays are advertised, single people have a poorer choice of accommodation, pay more for the privilege and are assumed to be looking for a partner.\n\nCouncil tax is based on a couple living together and penalises single occupancy with a 25% surcharge (the single person 'discount'). In some towns, single occupancy of vehicles is also being penalised.\n \nThis should all be regarded as unacceptable to any right-thinking English person but, often, a 'blind eye' is turned to very common single person discrimination. \n\nAny form of discrimination is still discrimination and the rights of single people ought to treated seriously and subsumed into the appropriately amended legislation.",
