            "background": "All too often when/where cycle lanes are provided there are no parking restrictions, or restrictions are removed whilst the cycle lane is present. The result of this is that the lane is rendered unusable during peak travel periods by parked cars and cyclists are forced into busy (oversubscribed) roads. If parking restrictions where imposed it would make it easier to commute to and from work by bike and safer for younger riders.",
