We petition the prime minister to replace the current system with an additional license category \u2018restricted\u2019 which will expire in one year should the license holder fail to pass a driving test whilst in possession of a restricted license. If the license expires then the license holder may then apply for a provisional license and become a learner driver again. If a driving test is passed whilst on a restricted license then the driver may return to a full license.\nA system of endorsements may still be retained for those who commit further offences whilst on a restricted licence. \nThis is a system requiring the retesting of careless and dangerous drivers.",
