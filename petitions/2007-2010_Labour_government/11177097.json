            "background": "The problem with the recession is that no-one actually has any money, so a small VAT cut won't make people spend more. It's just going to put the country into debt for no reason. Also note that food and energy bills aren't affected, which are the two items people are struggling to pay right now.\n\nThe smart thing to do would have been to lower taxes in time for Christmas but raise VAT to, say 20%, to partially compensate for the shortfall (people don't notice a 2.5p in the pound difference as you will soon see). This would get people spending a lot more and make them feel more confident about the future. They will be able to spend now but still put money aside for safety. It's win-win.",
