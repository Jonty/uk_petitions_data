            "background": "At a time when PM Gordon Brown is quite rightly planning to agree ambitious climate-change targets , it would be counter-productive to expand Heathrow Airport and with it air travel. We should instead be considering ways of curtailing flying, worldwide, as it consumes vast amounts of that diminishing resource oil and is a huge cause of carbon emissions. The short term economic gains from airport expansion will be as nothing when we or our children reap the rewards of catastrophic climate change.",
