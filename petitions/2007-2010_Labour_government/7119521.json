            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The principal and governors of Seaford Head Community College have decided, without any consultation with staff, parents or students, to suspend the sixth form in September 2008.\nAlthough the school has been through a difficult period, numbers in the sixth form are rising, and this year's year 11 are expected to do well at GCSE, suggesting more will want to stay at the school.\nThe suspension, which can continue indefinitely, will force students to travel across the county and beyond for further education, with consequent strain on public transport networks and the environment.\nWe believe that a town of Seaford's size and wide catchment area can support a sixth form and call on the Government to intervene to ensure its future.",
