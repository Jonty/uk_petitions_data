        "action": "enforce the child support agency system to transfer all those currently being tested on the old system to the new system designed in 2003 which was designed to be fairer on payments being made and that the same will be applied when the system is due to change again in 2011.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In 2003 the Child Support Agency transferred onto a new scheme where payments were 5% of earnings. This ensured that parents of the child still gained money to help towards the costs of looking after their child/children. Under the old system fathers were assessed on their maintenance costs which results in higher payments. As of today only people who have applied on or after the 3rd of March 2003 have been put onto this new system. I ask that all should be treated the same. \nI ask this as recently a friend of mine and her partner have been reassessed to include my her earnings and she has been made to pay nearly \u00a36,000 to a woman she doesn\u2019t know and a child that\u2019s not her. Despite having three children herself one of which she is supporting through university.  On the new system this couldn\u2019t happen, i ask for your support to ensure all are treated the same,Thank You.",
