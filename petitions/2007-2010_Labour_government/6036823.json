            "background": "As highlighted by Panorama on the BBC, this clearly shows how Bullying has escalated out of control.\nThe internet remains an uncensored source of information and openly features graphic portrayal of violence committed by children/teenagers.\nThe only institution that has the jurisdiction to censor or control the websites is the government, they have to take responsibility and take a stand for the sake of the children of this country. If this is what the next generation is being exposed to now, at such a vulnerable age imagine the consequences for the future.",
