Now that the facts used to justify removing 3 children from their parents have been shown to be unsafe,the case for the adoption has been lost.The three children should be back with their own flesh and blood because there is a miscarriage of natural justice being allowed to happen if they do not.How can anyone stand by and allow this to happen?",
