Beforehand, visitors were not told to wash their hands or use the antiseptic gel on entering the ward,  It was simply left up to the visitors to use it if they so wished.  I would like to see all visitors having to wash hands and use the gel as a matter of course before being allowed entry into any ward in a N.H.S. hospital.  I would like to see all staff being made to wash hands after seeing to each individual patient and not just using the gel which is ineffective again C.Diff.",
