            "background": "Alan Johnson has shown that he is not fit to hold office by his treatment of the scientific community. He has deliberately ignored good scientific research in order to pander to hysterical right-wing daily mail readers.\n\nThis shows a massive lack of judgement on his part and renders him unfit to govern. \n\nThe huge effect on both the current scientific community and children being encouraged to take up science has been irreparably damaged by a man looking out for his own political ends rather then the safety of people in the UK",
