            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The closure of our village Post Office will have a profound effect on the lives of everyone in our community since it is the focal point of the village for most people.   Most villagers do not need to drive to our post office whereas to go elsewhere there would be no alternative, and then there are those that even this is unavailable to! The most vulnerable in any community are the first to feel the effect of changes such as this, but also the least able to protest. People with small businesses or who are working from home in the village, local farmers who use the post office and shop EVERY day will have their efficiency undermined.  The Post Office provides a public service that is immeasurable and without which the heart is torn out of village life across the country.  The social and environmental costs must be recognised by the Government before it is too late.",
