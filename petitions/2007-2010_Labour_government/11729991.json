        "background": "Recent revelations over the amount of money being removed from the income tax take to pay for first class travel for public employees indicates that there is absolutely no respect for the fact that taxpayers have no option not to pay their taxes, against threat of criminalisation.  There is absolutely NO reason why any public employee should use any but the cheapest form of travel on public business.  Any person travelling at the expense of the taxpayer who wishes to upgrade their travel status may do so at their own expense but should NOT then be allowed to set that expense against their annual income tax liability.",
