        "background": "Tens of thousands of Sri Lankan citizens are currently living in IDP camps in the north of Sri Lanka under the protection of the Sri Lankan Armed Forces. Several allegations of human rights abuses within these camps have been reported, but the Sri Lankan government denies all these charges. Media access however is strictly controlled in these areas, and as a result the truth about what is going on is kept hidden. We believe the British Government should act to create transparency on this issue, as there is no valid reason for keeping the media out.",
