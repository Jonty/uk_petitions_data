Will representation rights be the same, on EU, national and international issues ?\nGiven that 180, 000 ballots how will the new Scottish parliament learn from the experience ? Given the comments of Canadian elections expert, Ron Gould, that \"voters were treated as an afterthought\", please confirm that MPs are not here solely to win elections, but debate in parliamentary forums.\n\nWe the undersigned believe that govt is by the people for the people. Govt is the people.",
