            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I think that 16 year olds should be allowed to purchase alcohol from public places. I believe that this would substantially reduce the amount of teenage alcholism and binge drinking in the UK. In other countries, children are allowed to drink alcohol such as wine with their parents in public quite freely and if this was introduced, it would reduce the amount of temptation that teenagers and young people have, to taste alcohol behind the backs of their parents or guardians. Also, illegal drugs are a lot easier for young people to purchase than alcohol is, so I also believe that this would help to reduce the amount of drug addiction and solvent abuse in the UK. Young people are allowed to sample alcohol at home with the knowledge of their guardians, so why should this be any different in public? I understand that the sensibility of the young people might be an issue and they might not know when to stop, so I think that merchants should only be able to sell 2 units of alcohol maximum to a person below 18 years of age.",
