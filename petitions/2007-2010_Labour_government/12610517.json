            "background": "Why should Members of Parliament be above the law. Why should anyone in Parliament, be they a Minister or a Back Bencher be  able to misuse their expenses without any sanctions. If this were a commercial company those caught would at the very least be sacked, if not also arrested by the Police and prosecuted. Instead what we see are MP's saying sorry and paying the money back. The only thing that they are sorry about is that they have been caught out!!",
