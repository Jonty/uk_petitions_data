            "background": "The purchase of alcohol by teenagers and the ease with which some under 18 year olds gain access to bars and clubs should be countered by the introduction of mandatory identification checking by anyone who appears under the age of 30.  The current system adopted in most areas of challenging those who appear under 21 does not work and this should be raised to 30 to avoid any confusion and ensure that no under 18's are present in alcohol licenced venues.",
