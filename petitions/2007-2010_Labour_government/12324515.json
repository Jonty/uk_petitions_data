I earned \u00a3380 p/w after tax and now I receive \u00a3155 benefit made up of income support and carers allowance. Carers in our position must save the govvernment millions, if not billions, of pounds so therefore we should be rewarded a higher benefit to cope with everyday living and expenses. We are living well below the breadline. I want to know who feels the same.",
