            "background": "Gary MacKinnon has not had charges put before a court, nevermind had a fair trial, before being denied his God-given right to both, and to have them in his homeland. Instead the US Government has voiced charges unopposed as it has sought his extradition- granted. If the British Goverment regarded the above morally justifiable then it would be morally corrupt. As the British Goverment is a just democratic government elected by the people it will halt this gross infraction of fundamental human rights of one of its own, now. Gary MacKinnon is one of The People and The Government protects its people. If Gary goes to the US he will be supermaxed and subject to extremely harsh conditions of sensory deprivation for the rest of his life. No light, no communication, solitary confinement, for the rest of his life. Are you ready to allow this to happen to one of your own? What would make you allow this to happen to one of your children?",
