        "background": "I live in Belsize Park, North-West London.  We used to have FOUR local post offices but two were closed some years ago (including one in the most convenient location: the main road/high street).  Now I learn that BOTH the others have been earmarked for closure; leaving us NONE AT ALL in the town.  I feel this is wrong and that there should be AT LEAST one post office in every town or village; also that many of the services which have been taken away from post offices, such as renewal of T.V. licences etc., should be reinstated to make the retention of post offices more worthwhile.",
