            "background": "Sharia law is a body of religious laws based upon Muslim teachings and the Qur'an. Unlike current UK law it is not created by democratically elected officials. If the UK was to ever adopt Sharia law it would mean the beginning of the end of democracy within The United Kingdom. It would mean that that we could no longer say that we live in a free and democratic country.\n\nThe aim of this petition is to ask the government to agree that Sharia law will never be adopted in this country as religious law should not be used to govern any peoples within The United Kingdom",
