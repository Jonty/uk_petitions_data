            "background": "In the current situation it will be financially impossible for the state to purchase the homes of all families at risk of repossession in order to prevent them from being evicted. For any given vulnerable household at risk of repossession, government should agree a sum that it will pay to acquire a percentage of the house\u2019s value; the sum will represent the value of arrears on secured debts plus sufficient money to pay those debts for 12 months. Government will then agree with the occupier a timescale (no more than five years) for the occupier to buy out the government share or to refinance it over a period of time to return the house to full private ownership.",
