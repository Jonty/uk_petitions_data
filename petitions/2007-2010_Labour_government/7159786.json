            "background": "Amongst new fears that Israel is going to bomb Iran it is necessary to take action in order to stabilise the region.\n\nIran, as a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is entitled under article IV of the treaty to pursue a civilian nuclear program. Denying them this right based on political prejudices is immoral and hypocritical. There is no evidence that Iran is pursuing nuclear Weapons.\n\nIsrael on the other hand is known have an active nuclear weapons program and has consistently denied UN weapons inspectors access to their facilities. With the new hostilities it is now necessary to put pressure on Israel to halt their pursuit of Weapons of Mass Destruction and attempt to avoid a potentially horrific conflict in the middle east.\n\nWe should not rule out military action against Israel if they attack Iran.",
