As a partner of a Royal Marine this is a cause close to my heart and far too many of our men and women are being sent to war to help make the world a safer place without sufficient equipment.  There are just EIGHT chinook helicopters available to our troops, yet there are currently 9000 soldiers in Afghan risking their lives everyday!  Britain has ordered 280 mastiff vehicles, yet these were rejected by the pentagon as unsafe for American troops.  Our brave soldiers are expected to fight a war whilst being poorly equipped and it is WRONG! The people responsible should be ASHAMED of themselves, I for one am disgusted!  If the Government spent as much on our troops as they do on their 'expenses' our lads would stand a better chance!  Our troops are risking their lives everyday, without moaning or upset, they experience stuff of nightmares, please help me give them a voice and sign my petition!",
