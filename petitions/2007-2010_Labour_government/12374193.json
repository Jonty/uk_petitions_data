            "background": "Council Tax is used to provide local services.\n\nAlthough residents benefit from services outside the immediate area of their homes,some services are not provided on unadopted roads (e.g. maintenance of roads, litter collection, emergency repairs to sewers and street lighting; and landscape maintenance). Residents therefore have to rely on the developers to undertake such work, which can take a long while, and standards can vary considerably in quality.\n\nCouncil tax should be proportionate to the levels and standards of service provided by the local and water authorities.\n\nResidents selling homes on unadopted roads may be required to deposit considerable sums of money as a bond to cover repairs etc. to unadopted roads. This undermines the value of homes and could be considered an additional tax.",
