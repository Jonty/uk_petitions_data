            "background": "We petition the government to demand the immediate resignation of Peter Horrocks and David Stead from the BBC for hosting a debate on whether homosexuals should be executed.  This is a direct invitation to increased hate crime and has made gay people across the country feel threatened. It implies that there are two, equally valid sides to this debate. The BBC has given a platform for people who believe gay people should be murdered, despite never giving a platform to other biggots, for example people who believe in the murder of any other minority group.  As licence payers we demand that the BBC should be held accountable for the risk it has exposed gay people to.",
