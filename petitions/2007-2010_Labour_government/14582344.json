            "background": "The criteria universities use to pick between applicants are often opaque and vague. University prospectuses often only state small parts of the criteria (specific A-Levels and grades required) without disclosing how factors such as A-Levels chosen, GCSEs, educational context, personal statements and references are evaluated alongside the grade requirements. \n\nLack of transparency has an impact on social mobility as many students are put off by rumours of \"secret\" criteria (eg. needing all A*s at GCSE to get into Oxford) or are misled about the suitability of particular A-Levels.\n\nFurthermore among top universities applicants meeting the public criteria often far outnumber places available. This results in disappointment for many who are inevitably rejected and cannot understand the reasons for rejection. \n\nWith more transparent admissions criteria students could better target their applications to suitable universities and also appreciate the reasons behind any rejections they may receive.",
