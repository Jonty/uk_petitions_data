Without this consultant, conventional medicine had been unsuccessful in diagnosis.\n\nThe Primary Care Trust are now trying to force her to change consultant, although only the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital has the required facilities for her needs.\n\nPatients have the right to choose treatment and I believe that they should not be forced to move when obviously receiving good treatment, which has made significant advances in her diagnosis.",
