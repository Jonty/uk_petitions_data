            "background": "News has emerged in the last fortnight that there are plans to close Blackpool Opera House in the future. \n\nThe country\u2019s largest theatre, with a seating capacity of almost 3000, the Opera House is a famous venue which has seen performances from the world\u2019s greatest entertainers and shows, ever since it opened in 1939. \n\nHollywood stars such as Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland and Bob Hope have all graced the Opera House stage. More recently, stars including Shirley Bassey, Tom Jones, Ronan Keating, Jim Davidson and Peter Kay have performed to sell-out audiences here. \n\nWe need to save this wonderful venue from closure and improve the way it is run, or yet another of the UK's much loved theatres will go dark.",
