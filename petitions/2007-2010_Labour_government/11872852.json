            "background": "We believe that senior figures working in the public sector who make a mess of their jobs, and that includes yourself, should have their pension reduced to the level of the basic state pension. You have almost bankrupted this country, given more of our sovereignty away to the European Union, lied to us when you said we would have a referendum on the European Constitution, sent our forces to fight in two illegal wars and as we know there are many more things you have done. You do not deserve a pension any higher than the basic state pension.",
