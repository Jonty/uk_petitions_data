            "background": "The government is famous for spending millions on IT projects.  A task goes out to an IT firm, which for example may pay six workers \u00a350ph for 10 weeks work, and yet bill the government upto 10 times that amount.\nI call for more if not all IT projects to be carried out in-house.  The workers could be paid twice their private-sector rates and the government would still be financially better off.",
