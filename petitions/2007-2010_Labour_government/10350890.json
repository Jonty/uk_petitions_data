I AND OTHER PARENTS ALIKE NATIONALLY SPEND \u00a330 MILLION EVERY YEAR IN THE UK ON VARIOUS TREATMENTS,  \n\nTHERE USED TO BE NIT NURSES, HARDLY ANYONE IN SCHOOL HAD HEADLICE, AND IF THEY DID THEY WERE SENT HOME THERE AND THEN! \n\nBUT HOW CAN IT EVER STOP? MAYBE NEVER, BUT THIS COULD BE PUT IN CONTROLL. WHATS THE POINT IN TRYING WHEN FOR EVERY 1 TREATING, THERE ARE PROBABLY 4 FAMILIES, NOT BOTHERING OR NOT EVEN REALISING NITS ARE INFESTED, AND ALSO NOT REALLY KNOWING WHAT TO DO.\n\nI CALL ON THE GOVERNMENT, AND THE EDUCATION AUTHORITY, TO WORK HAND IN HAND AND BRING PLANS TO RE-INTRODUCE THE LOVELY NIT NURSE BACK. COUNTLESS FAMILIES I TALK TO, AGREE WITH THIS.\n\nSO JOIN ME PLEASE, I PLEAD YOU, BECAUSE I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF FINE COMBING EVERY 3 DAYS. AND BEING PARANOID OF GETTING TOO CLOSE TO MY 8 YR OLD, INCASE I GET HEAD LICE TOO.\n\nMANY THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT, I FEEL ENRAGED AND PASSIONATE ENOUGH TO SEE THIS THROUGH. IF WE ALL VOICE OUR OPINION, THEN MAYBE, JUST MAYBE WE WILL BE LISTENED TO.\n\nKIND REGARDS\n\nBETH ROBERTS",
