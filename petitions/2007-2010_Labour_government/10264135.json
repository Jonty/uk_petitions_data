Actually the British people are a very good reason not to allow this to happen. It is unacceptable to have even suggested it. This is Britain with British laws and British courts, I request we keep it this way unless we want to lose everything this country has worked and fought for. Do not allow 'Judges' to make decisions like this. We are a democratic country, the people will decide whatever the Government enforce.",
