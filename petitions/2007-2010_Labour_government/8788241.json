            "background": "Nut allergies kill - and fast. A sufferer can go into anaphylactic shock without even eating a nut and can die within minutes. \n\nAnaphylactic children are particularly at risk. Non-sufferers in the classroom may be ignorant of the risks or even uncaring of the consequences. \n\nDespite this the Government has no national policy to safeguard anaphylactic children within state schools. LEAs have no blanket policy and whether nuts are brought into school or used in school meals/lessons is down to the discretion of each school. \n\nMy anaphylactic niece is due to start secondary school in September. The LEA stated that they had made \"extensive investigations\" and that there was no school with a no nut policy in the whole county. However we've found one school in the county which does have a no nut policy - and foresee a struggle to get a place there and provision for transport for my niece to attend the only school which can reasonably be expected to prevent her from dying. We call upon the Government to install a no nut policy into every state school so that each child is safe and is not discriminated against.",
