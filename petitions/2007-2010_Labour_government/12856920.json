            "background": "Thames Valley University\u2019s Slough campus (TVU) is to be shut in 2010 and the site covered with 1598 flats. An end to higher education will be a severe blow to this growing town. Slough\u2019s population has poor skills but how can this be improved if the university closes? Whatever happened to Education, Education, Education? \n\nThe closure of TVU is just one element of the dreadful \u2018Heart of Slough\u2019 scheme, which involves the demolition of Slough Bus Station made famous by BBC\u2019s \u2018The Office\u2019 and the much admired library, to be replaced by a smaller library with reduced facilities.\n\nNot only is this scheme unsustainable, wasteful and disruptive but it is deluded to think that you solve a town\u2019s problems by tearing it to pieces and flooding it with a ghetto of flats and empty offices. The offices and flats may not be built due to the recession and empty property tax, leaving unsightly building sites.\n\nA measure of the wastefulness is the demolition of TVU\u2019s library designed by Richard Rogers and only completed in 1996 at a cost of \u00a33.6 million!\n\nThe final insult is that this is costing \u00a317.52 million of public money. This should be spent on upgrading and keeping TVU in Slough.",
