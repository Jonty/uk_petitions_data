            "background": "Mr Kumarasiri is a post oligarch who holds a policy of not serving those who refuse to learn to speak English, and who thereby create delays and confusion in his post office for other customers.\nMr Kumarasiri is precisely the kind of person this country is crying out for, he has integrated wholly within Britain, taken its language, its customs, its values and its flag as his own.\nHe has since been forced out by a vocal minority of politically correct troublemakers from his job.\nThis is wholly unfair and we request the PM voices his public support (for once) for a man who has done his utmost to become part of our country.\nReinstate Mr Kumarasiri, Now!\n\nThank you.",
