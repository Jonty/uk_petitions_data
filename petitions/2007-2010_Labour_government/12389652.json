        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Council Estate Leaseholders are charged double the market value for major works.Laws allow leaseholders little control on council decisions and if the charges cannot be paid, leaseholders are invited by the councils to sell their homes loosing their right to shelter,while council tenants'rights to housing stay intact.This is discriminatory.In fact,leaseholders are taxpayer contributing to the social housing system. Councils have the power to dispose of leaseholders money to their liking, irrispective of leaseholders spending ability. In Rouel RoadEstate, SE16, major works on communal boiler costed almost \u00a36m. The leaseholders bill was to \u00a32,400 each,\u00a3 300 above the average cost for individual installation of a gas boiler. Councils heating fuel charges for the year were almost \u00a31,000, \u00a3 400 above average household. Unnecessary extra costs of \u00a3700 have been incurred in the year.It is proposed that councils repay leaseholders the difference between actual charge and market value of major works,calculated as the average quotes submitted by leaseholders further to receiving a s.20 notice.",
