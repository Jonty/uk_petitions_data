        "background": "We urge the government to rethink its Equalities law protecting mothers who breastfeed in public. This law is only effective for babies 6 months and under. Babies over this age have just as much need for both the ingredients and immunities in breast milk AND the psychological benefits of affectionate mother love which are unique to breastfeeding. The cut-off age of six months will only serve to make breastfeeding even more open to ignorance and misinformation. It perpetuates the belief that breastfeeding after six months is not important. WHO recommends a minimum (not maximum!) of six months EXCLUSIVE breastfeeding and both WHO and UNICEF recommend a minimum of two years breastfeeding.",
