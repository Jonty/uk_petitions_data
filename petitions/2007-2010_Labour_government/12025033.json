        "background": "All were high profile cases; all were avoidable tragedies. Although all appear outwardly different they all share the common thread of secret hearings and secret courts closed to the press and public.\n\nSuppressing news is suppressing justice. \n\nBaby P, Khyra Ishaq, and Victoria Climbie had to be exceptional to break through the wall of silence.\n \nNo father or mother likes to see their child cruelly taken from them, be it by death or the courts.\n\nSecrecy lowers the standard of the professionals. The children of the UK deserve the higher standards that openness would in fact bring.\n\nWe therefore ask you to embrace Lord Denning\u2019s view that it is the judge and\ncourt professionals who are as much on trial as any defendant and allow the\nClayton v Clayton verdict to stand.",
