            "background": "Please support us to Keep Passfield Post Office Open.  A thriving P.O. outlet serving the villages of Passfield, Conford, Standford, Hollywater, Bramshott and beyond, in rural Hampshire, isn't just a post office but a lifeline to residents, in the absence of regular bus services.  Despite its profitability, Royal Mail seeks to close it based purely on its location and that of 2 alternative P.O. outlets each approx 2 miles distant but reached via a treacherous winding country road with no footpath to one and interspersed walkway to the other, along the same hazardous road. Having previously lost all our village amenities including: schools, shops, bakery and pub, the post office is the last bastion and the communities' hub.  Closure will result in isolation for our elderly residents and the not so elderly and for the car-less too.  Please sign our petition.",
