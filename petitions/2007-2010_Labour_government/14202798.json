        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The prison terms handed down to Mr Munir Hussain and his brother Tokeer for their response to the violent burglary of Mr Hussain's home and the attack on his family are an affront to basic principles of justice, morality and common sense. Munir and Tokeer should be released from prison immediately and their criminal convictions quashed.\n\nJudge John Reddihough, who sentenced Munir and Tokeer, is an example of a liberal element within the judiciary that so desperately needs to be changed before the criminal element in this country can be properly dealt with. Judge Reddihough may be seen by many as a disgrace to the bench and to the legal profession and should be removed from his position forthwith.\n\nIn addition to the above actions, the prime minister should immediately introduce a bill shifting the balance away from a legal system geared against the rights of the law abiding majority.",
