            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "It appears that it is the policy of the police to refuse to actively investigate fraud committed by builders.  They routinely claim the matter is just a civil dispute, often claiming that \"you are just a dissatisfied customer\" or \"it is not a crime for a builder to be incompetent\".  This attitude prevails even when: (1) money is taken and no work is done in exchange; (2) they deliberately use cheap and unsuitable materials, often leaving the house unsafe; (3) workers have been sacked for refusing to carry out work in a manner that is clearly dangerous; thus demonstrating that builders know it is wrong.  Many know that they won't be punished and CCJs are often impossible to enforce.  The foregoing equally applies to all other tradespeople who deal directly with the public.",
