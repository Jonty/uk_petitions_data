            "background": "The use of dog collars should be banned and all dogs should wear a harness instead.\nBecause dog collars are very tight around the dog's neck and jerk their neck when pulled and therefore must damage the dogs neck when pulled. And the dog collar must make it difficult for the dog to breath and pant when exercising and running and also make it difficult for the dog to swallow aswell.\nAlso owners might forget to take their dog's collar off when they get home from their walk, so the dog would feel a throat constrition and then would not be able to relax as much as when he or she is not wearing his or her collar.",
