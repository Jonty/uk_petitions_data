            "background": "The average worker in the UK gets 5 weeks holiday per year, the average shool child gets in excess of 14 weeks per year. With both parents working, there is a minimum short-fall of 4 weeks per year, and with teacher training days being held midweek during school time this is eaten into even further. The excess costs to many parents in child care, or the imposition on families takes its toll. I petition that the school holidays are reduced in duration, and that teacher training days are not held during term time. The resulting educational days a child spends at school can only be goof for all.",
