            "background": "many parents think by law that you have to send your child to school. this is not the case. due to the increase in bullying of school children which can lead to suicide and other school related problems many parents would like to keep their children at home but think school is compulsory and i would urge the prime minister to possibly supply a monthly payment to home educating parents, who feel it is no longer safe for their child to attend school. this could be done possibly by an increase in family tax credits.suely if you are willing to fund a child in a school environment, this could also be applied to education at home.   if you require further information on home education please visit-www.education-otherwise.org.uk",
