            "background": "National ice cream day is celebrated unofficially on the 3rd sunday of every July (ice cream month). In 1984, President Ronald Reagan designated July as National Ice Cream Month and the third Sunday of the month as National Ice Cream Day. He recognized ice cream as a fun and nutritious food that is enjoyed by a full 90% of the nation's population. In the proclamation, President Reagan called for all people of the United States to observe these events with \"appropriate ceremonies and activities.\"\n\nWe would like the day, and possibly month, to be made some sort of holiday for us people to enjoy.",
