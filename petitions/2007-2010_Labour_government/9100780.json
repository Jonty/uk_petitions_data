            "background": "Far too often justice is not done because the police decide not to present a case to the CPS. This frequently arises because there is a lack of joined-up policing with incidents being treated in isolation.\n\nThere is an endemic reluctance to apply the Protection from Harassment Act allowing perpetrators of serial antisocial behaviour to destroy their victims quality of life. We need true national standards not ad lib local decision-making.\n\nUnfortunately it seems the police are more concerned with covering their own backs by applying The Human Rights Act to protect perpetrators thus denying victims particularly in the case of antisocial behaviour a chance of obtaining justice.\n  \nThis imbalance has to end.  Antisocial behaviour is on the increase and the police are failing the law-abiding majority.",
