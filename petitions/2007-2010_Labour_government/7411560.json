            "background": "British Energy has named eight of its sites as possible locations for next-generation nuclear plants. \nThe firm earmarked Sizewell in Suffolk, Hinkley in Somerset, Bradwell in Essex and Dungeness in Kent for development. \n\nIt also named Heysham in Lancashire, Torness in East Lothian, Hunterston in Ayrshire and Hartlepool. \n\nThe firm said flood defence and coast protection could make nuclear power possible at all eight sites. The UK is to define its nuclear policy in 2008. \n\nThe news was part of a review of site work needed to counter the impact of climate change. \n\nThere have been concerns that rising sea water and increasingly heavy rains could threaten power stations on coastal sites. \n\nThis is just plain stupid and the short sightedness is ridiculous.  There must be alternative, cleaner and safer ways.",
