        "background": "Small companies make up 99% of all businesses in the UK yet the government often fails to take into account the views of the people running and working for these firms when formulating new regulations, updating existing rules or planning future strategies. As a result, entrepreneurs working hard to make their small firms a success are hardest hit by the costs of compliance. We call on the prime minister to guarantee and demonstrate that no more regulations will be passed or policies will be planned without consultation of small businesses.",
