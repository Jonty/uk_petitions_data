            "background": "Naturists often face negative discrimination, both in the workplace and in their local communities.\n\nThe government should protect the rights of naturists and should aim to educate the general population about the merits of naturists in the community.  Naturists are interesting, down-to-earth people and I think they deserve protecting.  Why should they have to travel to campsites in France to exercise their lifestyle choices?  Everyone has a right to live their life how they like, obviously excluding murder/assaults etc.  \n\nNaturists are not 'dirty'; this is a common misconception.\n\nThe lack of public education surrounding the pursuit of the Naturist only serves to stiffle the population-diversity of our nation.",
