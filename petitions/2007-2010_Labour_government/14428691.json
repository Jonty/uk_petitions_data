            "background": "We propose that the UK GSCE curriculum should allow extracurricular activities to count as partial fulfilment of a full GCSE qualification. Similar to the American system where one year of a sport is partial fulfillment to a high-school diploma, we propose that students from year 9 of secondary school should be given the opportunity of achieving a full GCSE qualification through a combination of P.E. sessions during school hours and participation of extra-curricular activities such as clubs, teams and personal training. By offering a credible incentive that is nationally recognised, we hope to increase the number 12-19 year olds participating in sport.",
