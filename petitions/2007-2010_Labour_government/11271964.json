        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The drivers are given cash to cover the toll fees but it is standard practice for them to keep this money and use the country lanes, which are often narrow single track lanes, to avoid crossing the Severn Bridge. They drive at high speed at all hours of day and night with no thought for residents nor wildlife. Given the availability of secure contactless payment cards such as Barclaycard Oyster, which could be swiped at tollgate readers, they should be using these instead of cutting corners to the detriment of the Forest.",
