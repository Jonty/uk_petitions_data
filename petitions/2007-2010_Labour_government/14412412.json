            "background": "i would like the prime minister to make the benefits system more fairer than it is now.\n\ni had to medically retire due to ill health at a young age and i claim DLA at the highest level, with incapacity benenfit. i could apply for income support to top up my payments but as i had worked for over 20 years and i recieve a pension, i am not entitled to income support and the passport for other benefits. i still have to pay tax, 25% housing and council tax which is totally unfair.\n\nI have a friend who is a lone parent and gets all the benefits laid on plate for her even thou, she has never worked a day in her life, but i am penalised for having worked. Do you agree that this is unfair and changes should be made to the benefits system ensuring that those people who have worked are not worse off due to having worked.",
