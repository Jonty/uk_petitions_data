            "action": "tale action over significant international concern over news reports emerging from Sri Lanka about the activities of the Sri Lankan Defence forces in the Jaffna Peninsula.  Reports from the UN Office for Humanitarian Aid and the ICRC suggest that significant numbers of innocent civilians are dying and being injured by shelling conducted by Sri Lankan Defence Forces.  We call upon the UK Government through the Foreign Secretary, the Commonwealth of Nations and the EU to send observers to the area and to take steps to immediately counsel the Sri Lankan Government of the requirements in International jurisprudence to respect and protect the human rights of around 250,000 people living in the Jaffna Peninsula who are non combatants in the conflict with the Tamil Tigers.",

            "background": "The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay is reportedly  deeply concerned by reports of the rapidly deteriorating conditions facing a quarter of a million civilians trapped in the conflict zone in northern Sri Lanka, and of alleged human rights abuses and a significant number of civilian casualties, as well as the huge displacement. Pillay also expressed concern at the highly restricted access to the Vanni region for aid agencies and impartial outside observers, including journalists and human rights monitors. Pillay said. \u201cThe lack of access for independent monitors, humanitarian workers and the media only adds to concerns that the situation may be even worse than we realize,\u201d.  The High Commissioner also condemned the fact that safe zones promised by the Government have subsequently been subjected to bombardment leading to civilian casualties.",
