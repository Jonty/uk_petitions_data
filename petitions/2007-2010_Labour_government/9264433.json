            "background": "Since OAP's have been granted free travel on island busses, fares have been increased to an extortionate amount. The student rider system did reduce them to 50p, but this has seen a 100% rise to \u00a31 recently. For adults there is a minimum fee of \u00a32. To travel 1 mile on a bus for 4 adults costs \u00a38, but a taxi costs \u00a33.80. This must change if the government is serious about the threat of global warming and reducing emmisions it must act-NOW!!!",
