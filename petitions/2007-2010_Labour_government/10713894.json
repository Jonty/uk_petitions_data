        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Currently when the owners of leasehold properties decide to exercise the Right to Manage, Right to Enfranchise or want to extend their lease, they are liable for the landlords 'reasonable costs' in the process.  Should the lessees dispute these costs when they are passed on, the matter can be decided by a Leasehold Valuation Tribunal.  However the LVT decide reasonableness by whether the Landlord would pay the bills were s/he liable for them personally.  In many cases the Landlord's solicitor will produce a letter stating that the landlord would pay the hourly rates and therefore the LVT's rationale is satisfied.  This is nonsensical as many landlords and legal firms have a close relationship and can easily conspire to satisfy this criteria leaving lessees to pay inflated landlord's costs.  Their is no sensible reason why the government could not give capped figures of reasonable costs, for simple legal processes, barring very exceptional circumstances (on which the LVT would then pass judgment if required).  Without fixed guidelines the LVT will continue to let down lessees by finding in favour of exploitation by landlords and their legal partners.",
