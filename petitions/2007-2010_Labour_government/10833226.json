            "background": "The idea of a Worcester Parkway station at the intersection of the Birmingham to Bristol, and London to Worcester lines was suggested about 30 years ago, but today the proposal is more convincing than ever. Worcester has been a fast growing city over the last 15 years and is set to rapidly expand further in the near future.\n\nWorcester's two stations are both in the city centre at present but neither are on the mainline linking Birmingham and Bristol. This makes Worcestershire the only county in England not to have a station on a mainline that runs through it. Building a Worcester Parkway station accompanied with a park & ride would cut congestion both in the city and on the M5 & M42.",
