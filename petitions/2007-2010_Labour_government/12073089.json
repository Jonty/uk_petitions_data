            "background": "After those offensive protests by some muslims in Luton, it must surely be time to introduce a law whereby if the banners carried say such things as soldiers are baby killers, soldiers go to hell etc, then as this is offensive to all right minded people then persons carrying such things are jailed. These protesters stir up racial tension. If these people are found not to have been born here they should also face immediate deportation to thier country of origan. This does not prevent peoples right to peacrful protest, just those whose protests are deemed offensive",
