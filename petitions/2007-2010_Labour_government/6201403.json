The inequality in the Family Courts are so biased in favour of the Mother that the infrastructure of \"The Family\" is in decline because of the pathetic Courts allowing only fortnightly contact and not penalising the Mother when contact is obstructed.\n\nThe Family Court needs to be open to the media so that cases can be scutinised by other Barristers and that re-trials can take place due to discrimination.",
