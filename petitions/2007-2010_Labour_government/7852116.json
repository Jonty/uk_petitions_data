So let's stop all of the legislation based on the global warming agenda. (e.g. banning traditional lighbulbs, making HIPs focus on energy efficiency, over taxing gas-guzzlers etc..) Government should encourage open thought and people to make their own choices, but not introduce legislative burdens based on the latest unproven fad.",
