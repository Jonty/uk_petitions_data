        "background": "There is no scientific PROOF that global warming is caused by any man-made activity. We are overestimating the human's ability to affect the world. So let's stop all of the legislation based on the global warming agenda. (e.g. banning traditional lighbulbs, making HIPs focus on energy efficiency, over taxing gas-guzzlers etc..) Government should encourage open thought and people to make their own choices, but not introduce legislative burdens based on the latest unproven fad.",
