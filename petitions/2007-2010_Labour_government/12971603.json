            "background": "In the media culture in which we live, we are constantly bombarded by messages trying to influence our decisions about what items to buy. This barrage of information has resulted in a consumer culture no longer able to make rational decisions on what they spend their money on, nor being able to access any reliable information on the products they are buying. Media campaigns have had enormous influence over the market and this influence is in basic denial of the idea of freedom of choice on which the whole capitalist system is supposedly based. The small print at the bottom of adverts is not enough, we need dedicated consumer protection so that the public can really make informed decisions on which products they wish to buy. Protect our right to information by stopping the deceitful and deliberate misrepresentation of products by putting this policy into practice.",
