            "background": "To stop the irresposable destuction of the world's remaining virgin Rainforest's by often illegal logging barons. In many countries eg. Papue New Guinea of which supposed to be under the rule of HM the Queen and the British Empire,Asian Logging Companies have moved in who have no regard for the value of the unique wildlife being destroyed or the habitat they occupy.Also the Prime Minister of Guyana has said to the British Prime Minister that if the British Government will pay to them carbon credits, they will be able to keep their Rainforest's in tact.Both of these countries have recently had surveys conducted by a team of scientist's and naturalist's who stress that these Forest's are unique and should be protected. In any case without these sort of rainforest's, the human race will perish as they are 'The Lungs Of The World'. Mr Brown, we must think of our children, your children, our Grand Children, your Grand Children! If this nation had the same compassion for this topic as they do for football and soap opera's, then this would have been brought to the top of the priority list years ago. Please take this message to the Copenhagen Summitt in December.",
