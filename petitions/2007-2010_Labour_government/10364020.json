Tolls are also paid in most country's on the continent. Stickers are bought to use the roads in Switzerland, we in Britain should do the same as this would be very easy to manage, and we should use a lot of the money to increase the pleasure of our driving, and probably by the amount of vehicles that come into the country, and possibly do not even buy fuel, reduce our road tax.",
