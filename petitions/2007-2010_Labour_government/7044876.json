            "background": "We believe that marriage is sacrid and Holy unto God,and that NO man,power,or Government should have the right to split up a legally binding and loving marriage.Under the new immigrations laws,if a British citizen marries a non british citizen the immigrating person is given a 2 year Visa for limited leave to remain.After 2 years of marriage,they must then obtain another Visa for Unlimited to remain.In addition to this Visa they must now pass a test,or face deportation,and thus a break in the marriage.We believe this is UNJUST and unconstutional,and violates the rights of married persons,and the sanctity of marriage.We further do not believe it is right that a loving,legal marriage be torn apart due to ones ability to pass a test,and would emplore that this ruling be changed.Afterall,the wedding vows do state \"Til DEATH (not government) do part\"",
