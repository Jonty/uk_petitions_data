            "background": "I would be absolutely delighted to have Lord Carter and Gordon Brown attending my office and shadowing me for two weeks work experience which would include frequent trips to police stations. Only then will they realise how overworked and underpaid we are and only then will they realise how much wasted time and money is spent by the police and CPS. I would even consider allowing Lord Cater and Mr Brown to spend the nights in my company and deal with the ridiculous middle of the night calls received by the police stations.I wonder whether then they would accept that being woken up for \u00a331.45 is fair and just. And to think, they want to slash our fees even more?",
