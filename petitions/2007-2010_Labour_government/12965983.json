            "background": "Under-threes have not been included in the swine flu priority vaccination list as, allegedly, they are confined at home and less likely to be exposed to or spread the virus. \n\nThis is a fallacy and betrayal of our babies and toddlers. Many of our under 3's are in nurseries. Equally, the vast majority have siblings who are exposed to large groups in school environments.\n\nThe young have been identified as most at risk due to lack of genernal flu immunity.\n\n3 to 16 year olds are list priority because in Britain around half of those infected are under the age of 20, while worldwide the average age of victims is 19. \n\nThis is a similar pattern to the Spanish flu outbreak in 18 -20 where the young took the brunt of the pandemic which killed up to 100million. \n\nBabies and toddlers have less immunity than older children. Please sign this petition to have our babies and toddlers included in the priority vaccination list.",
