            "background": "We would like Swansea council to withdraw its proposal to fell the Monkey Puzzle Tree as part of its approval of landscaping works at the proposed Llwyn Derw Welsh Medium Primary School. In all, a total of approximately 125 LETTERS and a PETITION OF OBJECTION with 171 names have been received OBJECTING to the felling of the tree on the following grounds; \n\u00b7\tMagnificent, unique, impressive and irreplaceable landmark visible from many viewpoints, has been there for 150 years.\n\u00b7\tInitially there was an undertaking to retain it, its removal should have come to light much earlier in the planning process.  Application was approved on the basis it was being retained.\n\u00b7\tIs at odds with aims of Swansea Biodiversity Partnerships set up by the Council.\n\u00b7\tComparison with syringes is completely misleading and emotive.\n\u00b7\tTree has not posed an impediment to other planning permissions.\n\u00b7\tTree is a vulnerable and endangered species.",
