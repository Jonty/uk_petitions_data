        "background": "Dear Gordon\n\nOne thing I would strongly ask you to look at is to abolish the TV license, no one likes it! HAS ANYONE?\n\nIt\u2019s a stupid fee to bear on people, when the BBC makes millions and millions of pounds from selling its concepts to the world.\n\nITV, C4 and the others do not charge so as why should they?\n\nI strongly believe if you abolish it, it would firstly stop the ridiculous wages given to its bosses and make it stand up on its own (IT SHOULD DO IT ANYWAY).\n\nand it would win you a popular vote from millions of british citizens who like me believe this is a pointless fee.\n\nA thought to ponder.",
