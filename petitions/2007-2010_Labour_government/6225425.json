        "background": "This idea of experimenting on human embryos, to create human/anmimal hybrids is a serious offence against human dignity and God.  This would achieve what even the infamous 'Dr' Mengele in the death camps during the second world war, failed to do.  It is a fact that humans are humans and animals are animals. It is deeply unethical, and makes the ordinary person feel sick.\nThere is marked progress on the work of adult stem cells, and this will hopefully continue.",
