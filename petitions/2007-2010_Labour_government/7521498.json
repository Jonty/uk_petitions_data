            "background": "The current system of administrative justice in England is causing significant injustice and hardship  to many of this country\u2019s citizens. The current system does not embrace the principles of natural justice and it is doubtful if it is even compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.  Currently the only option open to a Public Authority or a Complainant, should they disagree with an Ombudsman\u2019s decision, is a judicial review. That option is severely limited in scope and in any event is well beyond the financial means of the average citizen. Introducing an Appeal Tribunal would guarantee a much fairer system of administrative justice in England.",
