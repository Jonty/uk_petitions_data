        "background": "Ricky Gervais indicated recently he was asked to appear in the 3rd planned series of NBC's Heroes (as shown on BBC Two).  We the undersigned would like to petition the Prime Minister to ensure this does not happen; we feel Ricky Gervais would taint this otherwise excellent programme with his presence.  Since the BBC is a public body, which whilst not under direct government control is under some level of government oversight, we feel this issue needs to be raised.",
