We the undersigned would like to petition the Prime Minister to ensure this does not happen; we feel Ricky Gervais would taint this otherwise excellent programme with his presence.  Since the BBC is a public body, which whilst not under direct government control is under some level of government oversight, we feel this issue needs to be raised.",
