            "background": "I propose a change in the law on common Assault to protect members of the public from being dragged through the courts because they have tried to detain someone they suspect of criminal or anti-social activity. The law needs to be changed to be on the side of the well meaning citizen and if no physical injury is caused then no charge of Assault can be brought. This will protect well meaning members of the public who are public spirited and try to do the right thing in protecting life and property.",
