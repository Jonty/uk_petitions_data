Some government communication is fine and keeps the people informed, but a 40% increase in the run up to an election and costly taxpayer funded visits to marginal seats are not right. Examples include: the policing pledge advert, a cabinet visit with senior ministers organising a party event, spending \u00a31 million advertising a government website.",
