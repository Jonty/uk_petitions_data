            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The Prime Minister has yet to confirm his attendance at this seminal conference to tackle climate change. His attendance would show the world that the UK takes the threat of irreversible climate change seriously, and is committed to doing something about it. It would also encourage other world leaders to attend, making it a higher profile event and helping the push for a strong and fair climate deal. Such a deal would commit the global community to tough climate targets, while ensuring that developing countries have the means to develop in the sustainable way which we failed to achieve.\n\nThis petition has been set up by four young people who have been selected by UNICEF UK to represent the UK at the Children's Climate Forum in Copenhagen prior to the UN Conference.",
