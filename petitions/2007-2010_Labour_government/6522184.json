            "background": "It is alleged in the Sunday Mail 23 September 2007 that two politicians are claiming forty four thousand pounds towards a second home, due to a loophole in the law. I would ask the Prime Minister to see that this loophole is closed. A great many British citizens are having to survive on wages/income of ten to twelve thousand pounds a year and still have to pay tax. Is it fair that this tax is used for this purpose?",
