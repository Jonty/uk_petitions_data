        "background": "We propose that the name for the UK unit of currency should be changed to the same as that is used in Vietnam. We feel that this would emphasise the UK's commitment to raise the profile of smaller Asian economies. We therefore believe that changing the name of the UK unit of currency to the Great British Dong or GBD would be a good starting point.",
