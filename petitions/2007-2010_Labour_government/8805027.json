            "background": "Outside London, bus services are not regulated.  Bus companies seem to do exactly what they like: compete with each other on the 'profitable' and 'desirable' routes, cut back services on a whim and regularly increase fares.  Companies do not co-operate with each other, therefore a city cannot create a decent integrated bus system, making many journeys extremely expensive (you may have to use two companies for your journey).\n\nLocal authorities are seemingly powerless and can only plead with the companies to put on and continue with routes.\n\nIf Britain is to have a modern, clean and efficient public transport system. I believe the government needs to properly regulate bus services",
