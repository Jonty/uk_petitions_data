Offenders commit murder and other violent crimes, serve some time, are let out and re-offend.  There are many families who have experience of the justice system.  Most are not reassured by it.  There is no punishment.  The focus should be on the victim's rights, currently it is the perpertrator the system focuses on. We want rebalance.  Listen to us.",
