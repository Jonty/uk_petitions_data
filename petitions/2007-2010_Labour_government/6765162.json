        "background": "Watching Scottish BBC television on hogmanay last year 2006/7 I was very dismayed that the presentation portrayed the Scottish people were very sad and did not have any happiness at this time of year. This television programme is transmitted to countries all over the world who look to the Scottish people who express themselves with fun and happiness. Where has all the fast Highland dancing and the music with the accordian and violin gone and the celebrations being enjoyed with the full joy and exuberance for which the Scottish people are renowned. \nPerhaps this petition should have the support of the Prime Minister then we may get the Scottish BBC managers to get something done. Lets have the hoot and traditional Scottish music back on our T.v screens at this happy time.",
