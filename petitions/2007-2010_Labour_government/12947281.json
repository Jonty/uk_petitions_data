Both men face no charges, have never been tried and are eligible for release. Both men have ties to the UK. Mr Aamer's wife and four children - the youngest of whom he has never seen - are British nationals. The UK must use its close relationship with the US and its commitment to the rule of law to help President Obama close down this illegal prison which he has termed \u201ca misguided experiment\u201d.",
