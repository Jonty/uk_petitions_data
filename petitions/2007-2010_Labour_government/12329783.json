            "background": "Funding provided through government departments is strictly time-limited and has many targets to monitor. Often (possibly always), the start funding is delayed through no fault of the charity. Because there is no guarantee at this point that the funding will materialise, the project cannot begin until the funding begins. The monitoring process slows down the project, using up as much as a third of the available time in some cases. The end date cannot be changed in general.\n\n \n\nIf a project can show that it is approaching sustainability at the end of its funding period, and that there is a need for the services it provides, there should be a way of extending the grant funding for a further period to enable the project to reach sustainability and continue as long as the need exists, rather than allowing valuable work and staff to be lost simply because there was not enough time at the end.",
