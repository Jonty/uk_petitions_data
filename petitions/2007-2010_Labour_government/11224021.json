        "background": "It has recently come to light that many of the UK ISPs are filtering content that they are delivering to users. It is suggested by this petition that this is not acceptible. The monitoring of information that would be useful to police or security services is one thing, but for the ISPs themselves to be entrusted with governing what is acceptible to view according to their own critera is something that the undersigned find unacceptable.",
