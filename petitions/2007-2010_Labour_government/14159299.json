        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Brown Edge is quiet and has an exceptionally low crime rate. The plans to build an allotment site in a quiet, limited access residential area by 6 'locals' is outrageous. This will attract thieves and put local houses at risk, unnecessary traffic and cause issues which should not have to be suffered by the vulnerable and elderly local residents which could also effectively lower house prices in the midst of a recession. The allotment could be put in a much better location anywhere out of the village. All houses in Brown Edge have respectable plots of land and there are other local allotment sites to use in the surrounding area. Please put a stop to this selfish proposal and show your support by signing this petition",
