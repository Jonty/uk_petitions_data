        "background": "On the 14th January, 2009, Graham Stringer made comments claiming that dyslexia is a \"fiction\", and is a free pass to money and help for people with the condition, insinuating that anyone who has difficulty reading and writing is faking it for sympathy and handouts.\n\nThis petition is aimed at asking the Prime Minister to discipline this Labour backbencher for his discriminatory comments towards those with learning difficulties. Those members of the public who are dyslexic, dyspraxic or have any other learning difficulty would not be given equal rights due to Graham Stringer's discriminatory proposals.\n\nThe Government as a whole support trying to tackle the issue of dyslexia - this backbencher should learn the hard way and be made to teach in a specialist school.",
