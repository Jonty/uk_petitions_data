That is why every weekend millions of people get taxis home, stay at friends, walk etc. A zero level alcohol ban would mean that no one would be able to have a few drinks in the night and drive the next day just in case they have a non dangerous but minimal level of alcohol in their system. This would effect everyone who has ever had a drink",
