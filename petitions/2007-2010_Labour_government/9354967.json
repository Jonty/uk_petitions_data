            "background": "Government plans to provide fewer test centres for motorcyclists are going to discriminate against riders living in rural areas.\n  Instead of the stated 45 minutes travelling time, or 20 miles, to a test centre being a maximum, it is now becoming obvious that this is not the case, riders in rural areas may have to travel in excess of this, possibly up to 100 miles (each way).  This is totally unreasonable as these riders may also have to pay for accommodation overnight in the city where the test centre is located.\n  Also, the government, by introducing this ill thought out policy, are putting people who run rural training schools out of business.\n  Taking the above into consideration, the government should increase the amount of proposed test centres, so that there is equal access for all, not just for people who live in high density population areas.",
