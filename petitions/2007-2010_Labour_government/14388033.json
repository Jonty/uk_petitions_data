Come off it. Plan for it.\n\nHarsh winters happen. The Government should buy in 1 months supply of gritsalt and store it in MOD locations for such harsh winters. This would act as a contingency reserve for the councils \"6 days\" stocks.\n\nBeing miserly with salting is false economy. Schools close, Works close, the UK closes. \n\nAt least stop saying the weather is \"Unprecedented\". It is precedented. It is merely \"rare\".",
