            "background": "More and more companies are now only contactable through these numbers. Including GP surgeries and it is simply unfair to charge for this service. When you have a contract for anytime free calls. The last thing you need is more charges from using these numbers. There are far too many of them now. Often you have to wait and the call has been a waste of time and money, if you don't get satisfaction. High time to STOP these, before we find all the numbers are now starting with 08.... If you feel as strongly as I do about this then please sign my petition. Thank you.",
