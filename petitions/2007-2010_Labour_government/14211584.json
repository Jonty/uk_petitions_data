The council (Redcar and Cleveland) won't help with transport fees - the bus fares are currently \u00a313 a week which is \u00a352 a month, on top of having to pay for College fees. What is unfair is seeing my College friends waste their EMA on rubbish. Worse still, is the fact THE THRESHOLD HAS NOT GONE UP IN THREE YEARS WHEN PEOPLE'S WAGES HAVE GONE UP.",
