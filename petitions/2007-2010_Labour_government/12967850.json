            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Access to Tiverton Parkway railway station relies on a junction from the dual-carriageway A361 that assumes that all traffic comes from/departs to the South and the nearby M5. Travellers from Tiverton and the North-West have no slip road from the A361 and must drive an extra kilometre to Junction 27 on the M5 in order to do a U-turn and double back to the station. Even more ludicrously, they must do the same deviation to depart back to Tiverton.\nThis causes unnecessary driving time to reach the station, congestion at Junction 27 intersection and extra fuel consumption/pollution. At least half the travellers using Tiverton Parkway come from Tiverton and the surrounding district. If the government is serious about reducing greenhouse gases, road improvements, rather than 'green taxes' are essential.",
