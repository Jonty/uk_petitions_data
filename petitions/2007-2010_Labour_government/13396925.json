        "background": "\"long old poke ain't it\" with reference Plymouth to Newcastle in the telly add which will remain nameless, to be honest yes it is, you have to ask is football really worth the congestion and the damage to the environment your cars and exhausts are creating for 90 minutes of over-paid footballers kicking a ball about? I say no it is not and it is time you paid for the damage you are doing to the environment, currently as a nation we are also in trouble financially, football is a frivolity an unnecessary pastime if you can afford to pay to drive from Plymouth to Newcastle and afford to pay inflated entry charges  then you can afford say a fiver added to the gate fee for the environment? and help boost the countries coffers - for all of those that are going to argue against this by shouting what about the fans that support Manchester united when living in Plymouth for example well perhaps you are right and we should add the tax to home tickets sold away from the gate as well to encourage supporting the local teams and not van nostrilboy just because its fashionable, point taken?",
