The walk in Center in Dussindale is a very popular and well used facility which is always busy and well used. They are open at times which suites busy families (early morning, evenings, weekends etc) They should not be closed to help the local PCT save \u00a3100,000 pounds, instead they should look at other ways to provide the same level of service and care to the community.",
