Not to belittle either set of tragedies, but the Govt. should encourage media outlets to keep these stories in perspective. Another example, the 30th June attack on Glasgow terminal; the average plumber's white van is probably more dangerous than the supposed \"bombs\". Even the drivers of the \"bomb\" didn't get seriously hurt. The same amount of damage done could have been achieved by a 16 year old on an ASBO! The Govt. needs to encourage responsible reporting in this arena, instead of using such reporting as an excuse to push draconian laws and ignore far more deadly societal problems like road deaths and poor health services.",
