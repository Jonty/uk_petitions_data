            "background": "I am fed up with Gordon Brown, Harriet Harman and Peter Mandelson and other members of this Labour Government continually saying \"authoritatively\" that what the country wants is for them to deal with the economic crisis and to sort out the expenses and constitutional issues.  I recognise that we want these sorted out but not this bunch of discredited politicians who no longer have a credible mandate.  What I believe the country wants is a new government, of whatever persuasion, to get a clear mandate from the country to accomplish this.  I further believe that we need a group of politicians who say what they mean in a way that we can all understand and not this one that spins, speaks in half truths (if that) and then interprets what they say in a way we didn\u2019t understand it to be in the first place. Without a current opioion poll this is an opportunity to let them know what we, the electorate, really want.",
