        "background": "I am a reasonable, tax paying and law abiding member of the public. My husband and I work extremely hard for a reasonable salary, we work long hours and save to be able to pay for what we have. However, like much of the UK, I feel that we are being penalised with the increasing rises in fuel, energy, food, council tax and mortgage rates. \n\nI feel powerless because whilst I am struggling to pay for these items, my hands are tied because I need them. They are not a luxury. I must buy petrol to get to work to earn my wage, I must buy food to feed my family, I must heat my house to keep us warm, I must pay my mortgage or lose my house, I must pay for the people who do not wish to work, I must pay my council tax or be taken to court.\n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m like everyone else \u2013 I cannot make a difference, my voice will not be heard and I have no choice but to continue to make ends meet as best I can to provide for my family. But what if it could be different?\n\nPlease sign this petition to show your discontent and please leave a reasoned comment if you wish. I may not be a loud voice alone, but collectively, we must be heard. The hardworking people of this country are reaching the end of their patience.",
