            "background": "Jade Goody, the mother-of-two, who received her cancer diagnosis on the Indian version of the reality show which thrust her into the public eye, decided early on that she would fight her battle with the disease publicly.\n\nAs the disease quickly took hold and spread to her liver, groin and bowel, it became clear Goody was not to recover.\n\nOriginally from Bermondsey, south London, Jade was keen to raise public awareness of the disease and prevent other women from suffering her fate.\n\nMr Clifford added: \"Jade has been very vocal because of what happened to her.\n\n\"Her message is, don't let what happened to me happen to you'. What she has been saying publicly has had a huge effect out there on public awareness.\"\n\nWe petition the Prime Minister to grant Jade Goode a posthumous honour to this brave lady who fought so hard against her illness and died with her dignity intact.",
