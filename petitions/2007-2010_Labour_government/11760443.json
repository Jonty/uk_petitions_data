            "background": "The government should enact laws to protect consumers from software developers who release software that is not ready for the market or games that on release need patching from release. These products are no better than a TV manufacturer selling a TV that does not work properly. There are laws in place to protect us from this but not from the hordes of software which each year is sold that is not in a finished state. This should not be the case, the buying public needs to be sure that the software or game they buy works from the off not when the developers get round to making a patch some two to three month after release. This problem seems to get worse year by year and if action is not taken by the government then eventually the consumer will not be able to find any software that is in a finished complete condition. Action is needed now to control the industry before it gets out of total control.",
