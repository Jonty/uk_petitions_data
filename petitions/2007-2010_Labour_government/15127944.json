            "background": "Burlington House is Dover's worst eyesore and stands in the way of a major town centre regeneration project. Its owners currently enjoy a 100% exemption for business rates on the grounds that it is unfit for occupation and is therefore deemed to have been demolished. However it still stands. We ask the Government, through the Valuation Office Agency, to remove this exemption until such time as the building has actually been demolished, and to assess the site owners for business rates until such time as demolition has been completed.",
