            "background": "In order to preserve the integrity of the Stock Exchange and the financial systems we all rely upon, make it illegal to short sell stock exchange securities - that is the practice where shares are borrowed from long term holders, sold and then rebought at a lower price, thereby maintaining the number of shares held but a profit is booked. Such trading, whether on the back of rumours or not, manipulates the market to the detriment of almost everyone else.",
