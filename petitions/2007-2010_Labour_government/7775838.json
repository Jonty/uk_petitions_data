            "background": "This Petition is aimed at restoring the broadcast of Pandora Radio, an internet radio station (www.pandora.com), in the UK. Due to licensing organisations requesting too high a fee a broadcaster of new music, who by nature introduce many listeners to music which they have not heard before, Pandora cannot continue broadcasting as it is not economically viable. This is an example of why piracy is on the increase as modern forms of communication are ignored by the record companies on economic grounds, which seem to produce a bad deal for both the consumer and the artist. We request that the government acts in order to find an amicable solution, which would be beneficial for both parties and the music industry at large.",
