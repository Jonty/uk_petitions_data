            "background": "To protect UK manufacturing jobs and the recession hit motor industry from complete collapse the Government must reduce the level of VAT on the sale of all new motor vehicles manufactured in the UK to 1%. This reduction must be fairly offered across the board to all vehicles regardless of engine size.\n\nTo avoid potential deflation while buyers wait for the reduction in the VAT payable the reduction must be backdated to January 1st 2009.\n\nThe reduction in the VAT burden on consumers is cheaper than paying for tens of thousands of people out of work claiming benefits and the collapse of the remaining manufacturing sector in the UK. \n\nThis reduction will demonstrate the Government is serious about protecting jobs and industry.",
