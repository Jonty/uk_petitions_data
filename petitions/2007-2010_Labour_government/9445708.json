        "action": "combine the current maternity and paternity leave allowances into a single allowance that may be flexibly split between both partners as they choose.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The current large differences between maternity and paternity leave deny families the right to choose how best to care for their children and impose an outdated stereotype of family life. New parents should have the right to split existing leave as suits their circumstances. The family, not the government, is best placed to say what leave they would take.\n\nShared leave entitlement works well in countries such as Sweden and Iceland. These countries all have much greater equality of men and women in the workplace than the UK. By allowing either the mother or her partner to take leave, unwanted financial incentives to discriminate against women at work are removed.\n\nFlexible leave for new parents will give families more control over their financial situation at an important time, but because this proposal is about how parents share leave, rather than creating more leave, most businesses will not have significant extra costs (and some may even pay less).",
