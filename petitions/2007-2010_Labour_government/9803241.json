        "background": "I am incensed by news today (2nd June) that BAA have allowed a security guard and his supervisor to force a traveller to remove his T shirt at T5 because they dont like the picture.  Such appalling behaviour must be stopped by direct action of the Prime Minister, and furthermore the security supervisor should be reprimanded  immediately. BAA - being a public funded organisation - requires the oversight by the prime minister in matters of such significance as this.",
