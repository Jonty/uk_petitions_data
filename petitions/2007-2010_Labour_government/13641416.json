        "background": "Boys have always been violent. But in the old days it was channeled through sport, games and the military. It operated within a legal framework and was about the protection of family and home.\n\nGrand Theft Auto teaches boys to break the law and redirect their violence towards the socially destructive, the selfish and the sociopathic and to treat women as prostitutes to be used, abused and killed.\n\nWhen the latest version was released last year, the MP Keith Vaz said: \u2018It\u2019s highly likely that younger children are going to get access to this game. A young person\u2019s mind is impressionable and the interactive violence is going to have an impact on them.\u2019\n\nWe really have no idea of the long-term effects of this game.\n\nOn New Year's Day, at 12 noon, we are holding a GTA Mass Destruction Day. All over Britain, Women of Mass Destruction will join us in destroying and dumping these discs. It will be supported by members of Take a Break's two social networks, chums4mums and Mums' Army.",
