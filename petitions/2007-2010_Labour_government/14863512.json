            "background": "There is anecdotal evidence that mistakes made by HMRC have affected thousands of tax-payers. It is clear to us that the whole tax credits and benefits systems are unfit for purpose\nThe whole system needs to be re-organised to be simple and fair, the government need to go back to the drawing board.  Anything other than current system would be better.\nFor example, we propose a system whereby;\n1 Everyone is entitled to a minimum income, but out of that you must pay for everything benefits would previously have paid for. Housing, prescritions etc\n2 For every child in a household there is a set amount\n3 If you have a disability which results in an increase in cost of living (equipment/care), this is paid for by the government directly\n4 For every pound you earn your tax credits income will be reduced by 50p\nThat way; \n1 It will be more beneficial to work\n2 It will be more beneficial to live as a couple or in a family unit with two adults\n3 It will be harder to falsely claim disability benefit",
