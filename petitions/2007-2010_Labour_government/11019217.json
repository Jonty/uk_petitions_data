            "background": "Over the summer, the price of oil went to near $140 per barrel. Accordingly, petrol prices increased. Since then, prices have fallen to below $60 per barrel. Prices at the pump are not falling proportionately (accounting for tax) and several fuel companies are posting large profits.\n\nGas companies raised prices throughout last year and told us, the public, that the price of gas was linked to the price of oil. So far, gas bills are not becoming cheaper.\n\nWill the Prime Minister impose larger capital gains taxes on those fuel companies who continue to make large profits? Furthermore, will the Prime Minister take measures to ensure that any punitive charges are not passed on to the customer?",
