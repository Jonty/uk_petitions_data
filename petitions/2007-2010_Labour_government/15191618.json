        "background": "The report in the Sunday Times dated 28 March 2010, 'Generals told to travel 2nd class' is treating our armed forces as second class.   I don't have an issue with such travel constraints being placed on people in the public service, however what I find hard to comprehend is that such a constraint can be applied to senior figures in our armed forces, whilst not being applied across the public sector - i.e. including civil servants, members of parliament and quangos.  This really does seem to imply that the armed forces are 'second class' citizens, in relation to other public servants and it reflects as a devaluation of the men and women in our armed services across all their ranks.  It would appear that some public servants are more equal than others?",
