            "background": "Please privatise Channel Four and the BBC. No one needs, and no one wants, to be told by the government what to think, and it is not polite for the state-owned BBC and Channel Four to claim that only it is telling the truth. Such privatisation would not be unprecedented - 20 years ago, when France was governed by a _socialist_ (Mitterand), the most-viewed TV channel, TF1, was privatised.\n\nBritain's public debt is now 43% of GDP, i.e. almost half of gross domestic product. The Treasury could use that cash to shrink the debt burden.",
