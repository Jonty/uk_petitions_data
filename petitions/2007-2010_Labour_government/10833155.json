        "background": "Global Radio, who recently bought GCap Media (who own many local commercial  radio stations) have proposed to rebrand The One Network stations, who still have their own names, into Heart Stations, with no connection to the actual history and heritage. This will damage listener numbers and take away some of the region's pride.\n\nThis rebrand could happen in 12-18 months and could wipe out local commercial radio in England.",
