            "background": "This petition is to demand that the Mortgage Code be re-enacted and that all mortgage and investment products are covered by regulation under the Financial Services Authority especially with regard to the buy to let market in order to stop the unscrupulous practices between Mortgage Lenders and Brokers so that transactions are truely transparent and that 'Umbrella' mortage companies such as Paragon Group etc are made cupable for the mass loss of the rental housing market due to their collusion to collect fees and charges and their apparent ability to arrest rents, furniture and the main assets without any recourse to legal protection for the owners from the UK Law System. This should include all Valuers and Surveyer firms who maintain any connection with Estate Agency firms or Receivers of Rent firms and/or have common directors with Lenders, Banks etc",
