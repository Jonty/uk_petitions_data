        "background": "One of Leicester's most successful comprehensive schools says it is under threat after plans were revealed to sell off its playing fields.\nSt Paul's Catholic School, in Evington, is built on a site owned by the independent Leicester Grammar Junior School,which it uses for sport and outdoor education.\nHowever, the grammar school is relocating this summer, and has turned down St Paul's bid to buy the land, in favour of selling it to developers.\nSt Paul's head  Francis Doherty wrote: \"Our governing body has made a bid to buy the Grammar School buildings and surrounding area and our governors' plans for redevelopment of this part of the site are well under way.\n\"Unfortunately, an option now being considered by Leicester Grammar is to seek a change of use of the site from educational land to residential and to build numerous houses on the playing fields and tennis courts, as well as turning Evington Hall,into flats.\n\"If this change of use is granted, St Paul's would have serious viability problems.",
