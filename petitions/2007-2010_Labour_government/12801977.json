We therefore expect the inquiry into the Iraq war to be held in public with full disclosure to us at all times.  The Inquiry being held to be open, honest and not whitewashed as in previous inquiries.  The facts to be laid bare for all to see and blame apportioned accordingly to those at fault. \n\nThe fact that this enquiry is to be held in secret and the results to be published after the election only goes to prove that nothing has changed and the promised openness is a sham offer trying to fool us.  We will not be fooled Mr Brown",
