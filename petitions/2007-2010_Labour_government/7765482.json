            "background": "I would like large companys that generate unnecessary junk mail to be targetted to stop. It will reduce the impace on the environment at source and lessen the need to recycle. Also companys that package retail products should be targetted to reduce the amount of packaging used for products. The re-cycle bins after christmas have been full. Again, if this was stopped at source it would reduce initial damage to the environment by reducing the need for materials to make the packaging and lessen the need for re-cycling dowm the line.",
