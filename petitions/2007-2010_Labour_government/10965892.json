        "background": "As the Bank Holidays stand in Britain, there is a preponderance towards the early part of the year, leaving four months each year without a Bank Holiday. Declaring the Monday before the clocks go back each Autumn as a Bank Holiday would not only give the health benefits of a long weekend for adults at the same time as (most) schools have their half-term, it would also give working people a chance to finish any outside domestic chores in daylight.",
