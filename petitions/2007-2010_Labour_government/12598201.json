            "background": "At the moment The prime minister is setting up an enquiry into the expenses claimed by MPs for last four year this Enquiry will cost who knows what? If a member of the general public was found guilty of claiming any type of benefit falsley then they would be made to pay all their benefits back probably since they first claimed them going back many years in most cases. In order to be fair and to start off anew on a clean slate and to save tax payers money being wasted further . i believe all expese payouts should be payed back for last 12 months regardless of their validity in order to bring a swift end to this Farcical situation.",
