            "background": "The Royal Navy currently has no proper air superiority fighter. This means was it to be involved in a situation such as the falklands the fleet would be sitting ducks. Currently we only have GR9 and GR7 harriers which are RAF and RN and made for ground attack not fighter aircraft. When we take order of our new carriers itll be atleast another 5 years before we take order of the planes. In the current climate this would mean we would only have 4 or 5 aircraft on a deck that can hold 20. Therefore i urge the Government to buy back the sea harrier FA2 that were sold to india to ensure the safety and security of the fleet aswell as increasing flexibility as the harrier force is over stretched.",
