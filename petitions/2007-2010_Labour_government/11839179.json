            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The young drivers of today suffer heavy blows when paying for car insurance. Currently the average per month (Using statistics I collected) for male drivers aged 17-18 is \u00a3240 a Month. Along with running costs of petrol and general wear of the vehicle. This comes as a very hard to manage situation. If the person is in full time education, as I have found myself, It is very hard to manage that, plus your out of college work plus work to pay for the running of the vehicle. I myself pay \u00a3275 per month on a 1.2 litre unmodified car. Working on the same basis as EMA but used solely for the running of a car I think help needs to be implemented as it puts a lot of stress on the youth.",
