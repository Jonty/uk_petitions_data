            "background": "The legend that is Bob Hoskins has been providing top class acting entertainment since 1972, starring in nearly 100 films and TV series as well as finding time to be Director and Producer.\n\nHis talents range from playing serious roles such as 'Harold', the 1980's London gangster who's life falls apart around him in the classic 1980 film \"The Long Good Friday\", to comedic appearances in films such as \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" and \"Hook\".\n\nSo as thanks to this great man, who over the years has come to be affectionately known as \"Bobo\", for his services to acting over the years, I propose we sign this petition to bestow upon him the great honour of becoming a 'Sir'.",
