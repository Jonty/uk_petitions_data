Since petrol reached the \u00a31 a litre mark, the price has risen by 1p almost DAILY. But if prices were displayed in gallons, would retailers DARE to raise their prices by 4 1/2p each time? Of course not. But by raising a litre by 1p, that is exactly what they are doing. And apart from this, I demand the RIGHT to buy any commodity by whatever measurement I choose!",
