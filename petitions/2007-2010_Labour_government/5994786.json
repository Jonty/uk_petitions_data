Being a one-way street, motorists have no choice but to then pull over further up the road by the crossing.  There are no signs warning motorists not to stop and nothing to warn them of a camera presence.\n\nWhilst violent crime is constamtly rising in Ealing and other Boroughs, our Councils are still persecuting the motorists!",
