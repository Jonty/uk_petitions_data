            "background": "Foie Gras is the fatty liver of geese and ducks produced by forcing a metal tube down their throat and force feeding them while they are already bloated.\nThose who are able to live through the 2-3 week torture await a painfull slaughter. It has been banned in Chicago, California, Wolf Gang Puck has denounced it and Israel does not even export ducks to France anymore because of their brutal foie gras production. The ducks are constricted in cages where they can not even turn around nor move backwards. Some ducks have even been found buried up to their neck in the ground to restrict their movement even more. You don't have to be active in animal welfare to realize this is insanity and I'm ashamed that foie gras is so widely available. If you eat these foods be aware that these animals were literally tortured to death to produce your meal. And by eating fois gras you are supporting this practice. \nThis product needs to be banned from being imported and used in this country!",
