        "background": "As the majority of motoring accidents are (alledgedly) to, or caused by, people under the age of 25, and as most driving stupidity can be seen to be caused by people in this age group, a psychometric test should be devised to identify the high risk individuals and a driving licence to them should be refused until they reach either the age of 30, or undergo and pass a sensitisation course on the dangers of irresponsible driving.",
