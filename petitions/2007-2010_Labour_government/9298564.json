        "background": "Biofuels have been grown in order to meet EU targets on using green fuel for road transport. However, this so called 'green fuel' is being grown mainly in South East Asia and South America where rainforests are being cut down to create space for row upon row of foreign crops. The 2 main negative consequences of this are:\n\n1) In cutting down and burning the forests and in some cases draining the area, we are releasing more carbon into the atmosphere than we would by using oil. \n\n2)We are on the brink of losing whole ecosystems vital to some countries economies and even whole communities of indigenous people are being forced out of the forests. \n\nI am not saying biofuels cannot be used in the future, however for the time being we are not regulating the growth of such crops in countries like Sumatra and Indonesia.",
