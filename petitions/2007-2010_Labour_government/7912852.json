            "background": "Minimum wage for all workers above school leaving age should be raised to an equal level, ending the current highly exploitative & discriminatory attitude towards younger workers, which effectively generates an underclass of working 16-21 year olds in the UK.\n\nThe current system not only acts to the detriment of young workers, but also those over the age of 21. This system effectively requires workers over the age of 21 to hold 5 years of experience in order to remain competitive against younger inexperienced workers who can be legally lower paid.",
