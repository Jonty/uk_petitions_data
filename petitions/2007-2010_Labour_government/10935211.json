It is unfair to expect the most vulnerable in society to have to pay for their prescriptions at the same payment rate as the employed and well off in our society. There is a disparity between the those who can afford their presciptions, and those who are too poor to be able to pay. The sick should not have to pay for their medicine that is prescribed by the NHS. We call for greater fairness and access to medication. The current system is archaic and based on geographical location.",
