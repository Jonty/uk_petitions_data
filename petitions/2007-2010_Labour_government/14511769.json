I therefore ask for \"chemical castration for all convicted paedophiles.\" The Depo Provera injection is used in many countries as it diminshes all \"urges\" and is proven to be 95% effective which is more \"humane\" and has a higher success rate than physical castration. In other countries it is a parole requirement and our country should also be safeguarding our innocent children by doing the same.",
