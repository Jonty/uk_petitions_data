            "background": "Sharon Shoesmith abused her position in the social services system at Haringey Council when she failed to authorise Social workers placing Baby P with foster carers. She was thinking in a parent-focused manner and this led to further neglect and eventually death at the hands of his so-called carers. Baby P is another child to be let down by Haringey Council's social services in the last 10 years and for this they should face long term investigation. Both Victoria Climbi\u00e8 and Baby P were brutally murdered in events that could have been prevented were they not failed by the system and for this Haringey Council and Sharon Shoesmith should be brought to justice and have to face the consequences of there neglectful actions.",
