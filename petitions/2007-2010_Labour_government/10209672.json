            "background": "Following the introduction of the ban on smoking in public places,we have just had a smoking shelter erected at the rear of our property.We live next door to a Public House.\nWe can clearly view this shelter from our kitchen window.It is also approximately 2 feet from the rear of our garden.\nSurely if the Government passes a new legislation it should not have any impact whatsoever on the quality of life of residents.\nWe objected to the Council about the application made by the Licensee of the Public House for the erection of this smoking shelter but our concerns fell on deaf ears.\nSurely some sort of ruling should be introduced about the proximity of smoking shelters to residential properties and should be firmly adhered to by the Planning Departments/Environmental Health Departments before approval of such structures.",
