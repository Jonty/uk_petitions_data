This evening I am sitting here alone while my 4 yr old sleeps, terrified that they are going to do it to me! Only a few weeks ago, somebody smashed my cousin's car window and then put a firework inside and blew the car up! They are a great danger and should be banned or only allowed at controlled, professional displays.",
