            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The current system of paying housing benefits direct to tenants allows the widespread de-frauding of every British tax-payer. Many landlords that accept tenants in receipt of housing benefit do not receive the rent their tenant(s) have contractually agreed to pay. This simply could not happen under the old system of paying the landlord direct. The new system has created this problem where previously it COULD NOT exist. What's worse is that the government and local government (councils) are aware of this problem and DO NOTHING to prevent it or deter perpetrators. One could argue the government and local government are aiding and abetting this behaviour by willfully doing nothing. I define fraud as; to gain at anothers expense by willful deception. By the tenant willfully with-holding rent for any reason means they are gaining at the loss of the landlord. The benefit they are receiving is for the sole purpose of helping them fulfill their contractual obligation to the provider of their housing and it is often being used for other purposes. Housing benefits are made up from the taxes received from every British tax-payer so it's not just landlords that are losing out.",
