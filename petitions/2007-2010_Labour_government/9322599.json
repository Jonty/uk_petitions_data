            "background": "The WNDC comes up with lots of stupid ideas to waste money that could be better spent of services that will benefit the residents of Northampton. Past plans have included a 'Needle' by the railway station, and a guided bus system that fell flat but have been revived by them. Recently thay have come up with an idea to put a 'TAX' of \u00a320,000 on new houses, forcing the house prices higher still, and potentially making finding a home even more difficult for first time buyers.",
