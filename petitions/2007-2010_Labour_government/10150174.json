            "background": "The City Council are planning to close 4 of their swimming pools in order to build a 25 metre pool in the city centre. We welcome the building of the new facility but not the closure of the other 4 pools that serve a valuable service to the local communities. With free swimming for all coming in the near future pool closures is a backward step. It will almost certainly mean the closure of the well established Bingley Swimming Club and have serious concequences for another, Bradford Dolphins. At a time when swimming is considered one of the more healty sports the City Council are doing a severe injustice to the citizens of a City that produced an Olympic Champion in Bingley swimmer Adrian Moorhouse.",
