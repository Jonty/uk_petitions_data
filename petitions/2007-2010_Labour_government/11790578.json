            "background": "You cannot leave your house these days without being confronted by violence.\n\nKnife crime is up, and it seems nobody is bothered about taking lives.\n\nA security guard was stabbed just for turning a young person away at a club, i was confronted by a knife myself and i know girls who have been raped at knife point.\n\nThis counrty is turning into a pit.\n\nPeople complain of increased knife crime, deaths but also complain of not enough prison space.\n\nYou kill a man with a knife and you may get life, but will probably only do half of the sentence.\n\nIf a dog bites you it is put down, kids on the street carry knives and dont think twice about causing trouble because prison is just somewhere to go.\n\nBring back the death penalty for anyone that commits murder, rape or attempted murder.",
