            "background": "Lee Hughes was convicted of causing death by dangerous driving and served a short spell in prison before his release on 21/8/07.\n\nFootballers are role models to the whole community in todays society and although I am all for the rehabilitation of offenders, one should think carefully around people who are constantly in the media attention.\n\nI have nothing but sympathy for the family of the person who was killed and feel that Mr Hughes should not be permitted to reclaim his position which young children idolise. The fact that he held a big party on his release speaks volumes and does not generate the kind of image which is beneficial to society. I will boycott Oldham Athletic whilst Mr Hughes is employed by them.\n\nI value human life more than this.",
