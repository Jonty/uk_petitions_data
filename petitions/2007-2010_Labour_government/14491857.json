Recent child protection laws do not seem to recognise the difference between the naked human form(a beautiful thing) and pornography - thus affecting many previously legal works of art. \n\nThere is a clear difference between nudity and pornography. This difference needs to be legally recognised to protect innocent artists and their works, while keeping actual child pornography outlawed.",
