        "background": "People who have more than one vehicle should only have to pay for one tax disc, E.G. people who have got motorbikes or a second car in the household should only pay for the higher priced tax disc which should be changeable when they drive a different vehicle, because they only drive one vehicle at a time, which means the others are parked up and if they have got a driveway or garage the other vehicles are not on the road so why do they have to pay road tax to have a vehicle parked up.",
