            "background": "Motorised scooters are dangerous when rode by incapable people behind the wheel. At 7 and half month pregnant i was hit and pushed into shelving in a supermarket by one, because the guy was incapable of controlling it. They go speeding round the town, or in shops on them, not caring less for pedestrians, as they seem to think everyone else should move out the way for them. You see people drunk riding them, or those that cant judge distance etc. I petition a licence should be made essential for those buying one, just the same as a car. And anyone caught driving dangerously to have that licence revoked.\nAnyone who is caught drunk whilst driving one of these to be fined. It could be children getting hit by one of these in a crowded supermarket one day, all because the person behind the wheel either cant control it or goes full speed to get around quicker.",
