Our local MP supports it being pulled down. We Want the Prime minsister to step in and save our market. Many people have said it can be used for many other purposes but these applications has been ignored by the council.We are now collecting signatures from the people of Bromsgrove and we are about to arrange a better attraction to get our pint across to the council, this may well be a takeover of the market place. We have just paid 4.5% increase in council tax and the council want to use \u00a345,000 of this to knock the market down. The market is iwned by the council and in effect owned by the people, we have not been asked by the council.",
