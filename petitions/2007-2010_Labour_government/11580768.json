        "background": "Childbed fever is a serious form of postnatal septicaemia which can lead to toxic shock syndrome, organ failure and death.  In 2003-05 sepsis accounted for 14% of maternal deaths in the UK. A complication free delivery is no guarantee of safety from sepsis and any mother can be affected.\n\nMEOWS charts are a sheet on which observations (pulse, blood pressure, temperature) can be recorded. They are clear and provide a graphical way of quickly seeing a mother's health.\n\nBorderline and dangerous readings are entered in boxes coloured yellow and red respectively. One red or two yellows at one time call for early intervention, so a mother developing a critical condition will be treated before it is too late.\n\nSepsis is often already life threatening by the time it is clinically obvious: the best opportunity to intervene is based on the early warnings. It is not yet standard practice to use them in all NHS hospitals and there are no standard guidelines for the recognition and treatment of sepsis.",
