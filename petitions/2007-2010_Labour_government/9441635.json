By banning the domestic use of fireworks, this will stop them as being used a means of antisocial behaviour and severly reduce the number of accidents.  In turn, this will reduce pressure on publics services such as the police, NHS and possibly even the fire service at such times of the year.  Additionally, there will be no real need for health and safety advertisment.  This will enable taxes to be redirected/invested elsewhere.",
