        "background": "When looking at part time job adverts, it normally states the pay as pro rata. This is very confusing as companies classify anything between 35-48 hours a week as full time. So when you see a job saying doing 18.5k per week paying \u00a315k pro rata, you have no idea if you are doing 50% of the full time hours or 38.5% if the company's policy is 48 hours. The difference in pay for the example above is \u00a31725 per year, a lot of money for any part time work. It should be very simple to calculate how much a part time worker should get.",
