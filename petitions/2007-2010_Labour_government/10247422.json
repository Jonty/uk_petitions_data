            "background": "Open up King\u2019s Cross Station is the community-led campaign to keep east/west access to our local station. We are deeply saddened that redevelopment starting in 2008 will result in a closed Station. All current entrances will be removed and replaced by one new concourse opposite the main entrance to St Pancras International in Pancras Road. \nNetwork Rail has consistently failed to engage with the 17,000 people living on the north eastern side of the Station; the very people who will be shut out as a result of the redevelopment. A brick curtain will be sealed all along York Way, cutting our community off from its local stations and its sister communities in Somers Town and the south side of King\u2019s Cross.\nWe want Network Rail to provide us with a footbridge from the current Wharfdale Road/York Way entrance to the west wide of the Station. This will replace an original road bridge taking exactly this route, demolished in the 1950s. Network Rail refuse to even look at this option.",
