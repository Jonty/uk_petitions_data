        "background": "Wootton Bassett is a small Wiltshire town. It is usually the first community in the UK through which pass the corteges carrying the bodies of those Servicemen and women who die on operations overseas after the deceased  are flown back to the UK. The townspeople turn out to pay their respects for each of the fallen - and so they stand for all the people of all the villages, towns and cities of this country who owe a debt to those who have given their lives on operations in Her Majesty's armed forces. By petitioning for the creation of 'Royal Wootton Bassett', we all show our gratitude to the townspeople who stand to pay their tribute on our behalf.\n\nThis petition runs until the next Armed Forces Day.",
