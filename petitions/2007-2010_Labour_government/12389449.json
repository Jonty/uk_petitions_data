I now find that when myself and my family would like to take a holiday we have to take out a bank loan or a second mortgage just to go to spain for 2 weeks. Why is this ???. I think it is the \" old supply & demand yarn \". We will have to go in this period because it is the school holidays - so we will have to pay these over inflated prices.",
