            "background": "Mr. Gordon Brown promised that by the year 2010 all young people would have free access to the International Baccalaureate, a qualification recognized in over 300 countries that would raise the intelligence of our country and provide significant changes to our Education system.\n\nThis hasn't happened and looks unlikely.\n\nHowever, my personal belief is that the Prime Minister should fix a new target and stick to it.\n\nThis would encourage more people to study languages further, as well as open many more doors and provide several more opportunities, such as University Abroad.\n\nThis would also provide a choice for those who don't want to specialize in anything when they reach 6th Form age.\n\nThe IB would keep our children in Education longer and we want it NOW!",
