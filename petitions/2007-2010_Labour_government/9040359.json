        "background": "While taking my girlfriend to see the new Rambo film, I was shocked to find out that the cost of 2 cinema tickets was now \u00a317.00.\n\nIt is far cheaper to buy a film on DVD than actually go and see it in the cinema, and this could be part of the reason why the british film industry  is in such decline. Not only are the high costs keeping people out of the cinema, but the cost of purchasing refreshments is also too high.",
