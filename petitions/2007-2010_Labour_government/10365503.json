        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "As we become more energy-conscious it is important to know what you can do to save power - especially in home lighting. If manufacturers listed the lumen brightness rating on ALL products they would be easier to compare and this would encourage switching to more energy-efficient products.\n\nLEDs are 90% efficient, whereas normal incandescent bulbs can waste as much as 95% of power consumed.\n\nThe current system for comparison is to refer to equivalent light from incandescent bulbs e.g. \"As bright as a 60 watt bulb\" - this is an outdated measurement.\n\nIf all incandescent bulbs, halogen, flourescent and LED products listed their lumen rating they would be more easily compared.",
