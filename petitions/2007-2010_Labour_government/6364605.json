        "background": "In its most recent report, the Foreign Affairs Select Committee stated its concern \"that the Government does not appear to have provided any financial support to the UNHCR to assist the plight of [Iraqi] refugees between 2004 and 2006.\"\n\nIt further recommended \"that the Government provide financial assistance to Syria and Jordan to help them cope with Iraqi refugees.\"\n\nThis is beyond belief.\n\nThe Iraqi refugee crisis was precipitated by our illegal invasion of Iraq, thus giving us special responsibility to help.\n\nIn July, the spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) pointed out that, \"It is unconscionable that generous host countries be left on their own to deal with such a huge crisis.\"\n\nMost recently, The Daily Telegraph reported that \"Syria's infrastructure and government-run facilities are strained to breaking point by an Iraqi influx equivalent to almost 10 per cent of its population.\"\n\nThe UK's moral obligations are clear. The time to act is now.",
