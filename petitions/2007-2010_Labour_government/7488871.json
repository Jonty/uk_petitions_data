            "background": "The recent plan to introduce information booklets for juries in rape trials are a positive step. However, we need to educate people early on in life that no means no, and unless a man is 100% certain a woman consents, he must not continue sexual activity.\nToo many people believe rape myths such as that large numbers of women make false allegations, and that women should not wear and behave as they wish. \nPlease fund more research into public perceptions of rape.\nPlease undertake a major investigation into procedures followed at every step, from initial complaint to the police, to court. Only 12% of cases make it to court.\nRape trials often turn more into the alleged victim being on trial, with inappropriate irrelevant questioning on sexual history continuing, in some cases, despite this being banned except where actually relevant under section 41. Please ensure these rules are followed. The use of expert witnesses should be reconsidered. \nThe chance of a woman seeing her rapist convicted is just 5.7%. This is not good enough.   \n94% of rape victims show symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.",
