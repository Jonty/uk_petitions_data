I understand that they can be taken to a court for Misfeasance in public office, but the working class public cannot afford to do this and legal aid is very rarely available for it because of the cost, So can we make the Law enforceable against officer's that have been proven to Lie, whether it be to CPS senior officer's or within the case itself, or grant them Legal Aid to take to Court for Misfeasance of public office.",
