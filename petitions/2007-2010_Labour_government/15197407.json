        "action": "reduce investment in Trident and divert funding to the renewable energy sector",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The cost to renew Trident is approximated to be in excess of \u00a376 Billion. Directing the funding to renewable energy production will create numerous jobs and help lower the UK unemployment rate of 7.8%. Carbon emissions are up almost 40% higher than they were in 1990 (the Kyoto Protocol base year) and since 2000 they have been growing at a rate of 3% annually. To meet the IPCC\u2019s Fourth Assessment report target of 450 ppm stabilization, annual emissions will need to be reduced by an average rate of 4.9% between now and 2050. Absolute decoupling is essential. Major shifts of policy and investment is needed to achieve this. With the current global oil reserve depleting, it is vital that the UK invests in more sustainable energy. Currently renewable energy accounts for only 5% of the national energy sector. Expansions of renewable energy projects will create jobs and enable the UK government to achieve its carbon reduction target of 80% by 2050 a possibility.",
