            "background": "Having been a carer for my Mother & my husband, I appreciate the value of the blue badge for permanently disabled people. However, having been unable to walk for the past three months without severe pain,due to sciatica, I have great difficulty getting from a car park to a shop, where I can at least lean on a trolley. There must be many others in a similar position;I have been told that my condition is temporary but could last several more months.When does temporary become classed as permanent? In the meantime, I have the same problems as any permanently disabled person.I think a temporary badge should be available - renewable after 6 months if necessary.",
