            "background": "This is in opposition to a petition asking that social workers be made to place children with their families instead of being fostered.  The creator of that petition was reacting to her own situation as the grandmother of a child who had been fostered; maybe THIS WOMAN'S GRANDCHILD would be better off in the family but it BY NO MEANS follows that ALL children would be better off in THEIR families.  ANY fertile couple can conceive a child or children but there is absolutely NO guarantee that they will be suitable to CARE FOR this child/these children; I'm sure everyone would agree that the welfare of each individual child should be paramount.",
