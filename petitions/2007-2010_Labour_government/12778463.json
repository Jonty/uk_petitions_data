They have the same bills as everybody else but certainly not the same income and they need good food as all of us to survive and especially in colder weather.\nThose that have nothing more than the State Pension and have worked all their lives now have to count every penny and can not even afford a hoiliday,\nI suggest all State Pension for anyone on only that and less than \u00a320.000 savings and having proven to have worked for more than 30 years paying Tax and Nat Ins, should recieve no less than \u00a3250.00 per week to help survive and enjoy the last few years of their lives.",
