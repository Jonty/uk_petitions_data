            "background": "The majority of working people only do overtime because they need the extra money, however, when this has been taxed it's often hardly worth doing. Why not consider a general tax exemption for overtime and bonus payments even if only for a limited period? This would create extra cash for ordinary people and may help boost the economy as a whole. You would still get the tax from salaries.",
