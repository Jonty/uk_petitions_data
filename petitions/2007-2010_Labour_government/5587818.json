        "background": "EVERYONE should be protected from ANY sort of harassment which makes them feel intimidated; the fact that no violence has been used, as in the petition this one opposes, is less important than how the victim FEELS.  Many jobs are hard enough (hard work, boring, badly-paid, unpleasant conditions such as noise etc.) without being harassed at work as well!  \nThe creator of the original petition says men and women are different; presumably intending to imply that the harassment of which women complain isn't REALLY that serious (which feels to me like men saying \"What's the matter love?  Time of the month?  Or the Change?\"; i.e. the woman is just suffering from her hormones because it couldn't possibly be that the man has actually done something wrong!).  I feel, strongly, that this trivialises the issue and that this petition should be opposed.",
