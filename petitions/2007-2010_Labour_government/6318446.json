        "background": "Mark and Gary (aka Blackers and Scouse) of Chesters Dee 106.3 were contestants on Dales Supermarket Sweep.  The show was recored earlier this year but has still not been aired by ITV.  Originally ITV told Mark it would be shown on April 23rd 2007, he had 12 video recorders set to record this incredible moment.  Unfortunatly ITV instead played a different episode leaving the people of Chester close to tears and Mark B on the verge of a breakdown.\n\nA second date was given for the TV event of the decade.  That date was Monday 27th August 2007.  Mr Mark Blackman again set up various VCRs around the country to record this historic event but yet again was let down when there was no sign of him and Gary.\n\nPlease Mr Prime Minister, we beg you to get on the case and find out when ITV will show this epidode of TV Gold.\n\nThank you.",
