            "background": "Education is the key to getting people out of poverty and for them having a future that is both enjoyable and productive for themselves and the country. Long school holidays for younger pupils especially are unsettling. Those who have signed the petition think the summer holidays should be reduced to no more than  three weeks duration. this would also be a more  manageable period for those who have to continue working and leads to less stress in the family and bored children.",
