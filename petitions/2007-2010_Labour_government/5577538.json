There is no help or information at all for us or our families,who suffer with Fibromyalgia,cfs,cps. Being a mum is the hardest job in the world but, being a mum with fm amongst other things is suicidal!! we need help all of us. the only get out clause we have is the fibromyalgia asscotiation site. thats ridiculous in this country in the year 2007.",
