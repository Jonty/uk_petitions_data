            "background": "Dear Sir, Upon receiving our monthly private pension slips we are now a total of \u00a395 less each month due to the lack of consideration for pensioners and low paid workers. We come into the bracket of pensioners working part time to keep our vehicle on the road etc., We feel let down and wont be voting again for Labour . What happens when we find it difficult to pay council tax etc., One pension alone each month we pay \u00a368.20 thats terrible what kind of state are we living in. I bet you will fund a crisis in another country before returning the status of the 10% tax which you should do.\nMrs.E>Bowler",
