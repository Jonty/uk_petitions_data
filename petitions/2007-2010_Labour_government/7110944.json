            "background": "This is in response to a petition asking for the girl's parents to be informed; but everyone has views on pregnancy and, especially, abortion and it is inevitable that the parents of the individual girls will seek to impose their views on what she should do about the pregnancy.  There is also the point that children of emotionally-abusive parents can fear their reaction to ANYTHING - let alone an under-age pregnancy - so that a girl in that situation would almost certainly not tell her parents but she might be willing to talk to a professional social worker or counsellor.  This should only happen, however, if she wants it; it should be offered but if she already knows what she wants to do there should be no delay in acting on her decision.",
