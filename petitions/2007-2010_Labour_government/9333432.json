MY PETITION TO GORDON BROWN IS AS FOLLOWS.\"REDUCE THE THE WOMAN`S AGE TO 60 AND NOT 65 AS PROPOSED.\"\nMY ARGUMENT IS THAT I HAVE PAID INCOME TAX & NHI FOR 49 YEARS AND MY WIFE HAS PAID TAX FOR 43 YEARS AND OUR JOINT INCOME AT THE PRESENT TIME IS \u00a317248.18P AND I CALCULATE I SHALL BE PAYING OVER \u00a3500 IN TAX PER ANNUM WHEN MY OWN EARNINGS FOR THE YEAR ARE \u00a311329. WOULD YOU BE KIND ENOUGH TO RECONSIDER PLEASE AND STOP TAXING PEOPLE SUCH AS MY WIFE AND MYSELF AND ALTER THE PRESENT ALLOWANCE SO THAT THE ALLOWANCE FOR MARRIED WOMEN CAN BE CLAIMED WHEN THEY REACH THE AGE OF 60 AND NOT WAIT UNTIL THEY ARE 65\n \n \nFROM A VERY UNHAPPY TAX PAYER",
