            "background": "All children will have alcohol education in school. At the age of 18 years and above all individuals would take a test so they are better informed about alcohol and its effects. Once the test has been passed individuals are given a drinking license allowing them to purchase alcohol. For someone charged with an alcohol related offence then they will acquire points on their card. Above a certain number of points the drinking license can be removed. Individuals with an alcohol addiction have the option to give up their drinking license to reduce their access to alcohol and help in their recovery. Minimum pricing penalises individuals who drink responsibly from poorer communities whereas the drinking license would only penalise individuals who have demonstrated they cannot drink responsibly and have had recurrent offences relating to alcohol. The money obtained from minimum pricing is a profit to drinks companies whereas the money raised through drinking licenses can be put into alcohol education campaigns and treatment facilities.",
