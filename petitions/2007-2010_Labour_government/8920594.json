            "background": "De-merging the regiments merged by the SDR (how can so small regiments represent so large areas of the United Kingdom?), for example restoring the battalions of the Royal Regiment of Scotland to their rightful place as individual units.\n\nWe petition the Prime Minister to increase the size of the fleet (up from its current 25 to - at the very least - 32, possibly more) and to ensure that any replacement of naval vessels currently in progress (save the capital ships) is conducted on a like-for-like basis, i.e. six frigates are replaced by six frigates (or more)to ensure the fleet's commitments are met across the globe.\n\nWe peitition the Prime Minister to further ensure that RAF aircraft are replaced on a like-for-like basis, including aircraft retired under the SDR but not replaced (e.g. Canberras, whose valuable work now has to be done by much costlier Nimrods).\n\nIn addition, we request that the Government undoes what previous Governments have done in cutting back the Reserves: in particular, we would like to see the Royal Naval Reserve once again receive actual ships so that it can perform the useful tasks that it once did.",
