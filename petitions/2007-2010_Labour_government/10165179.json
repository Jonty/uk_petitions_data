            "action": "change the current method of calculating the end price of fuel for consumers: the current method adds VAT after Fuel Duty has been added to the retail price; VAT should be added to the retail price separately",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Currently, the cost of fuel at the pump (petrol and diesel) is charged according to the following formula:\n\nRetail Price (RP) + Fuel Duty (FD) + VAT\n\nThis is iniquitous as VAT should be charged on the retail price alone, as it is for all other goods or services. \n\nThe formula should be changed to:\n\nRP + (FD rate x RP) + (VAT% x RP) \n\nThis would end the double whammy of an increase in the retail price being doubly affected by the application of VAT on the RP + FD.\n\nI have included examples of the effect this would have on a theoretical fuel price, current VAT and FD rates and my own personal costs based on prices @ 20 June 2008.\n\nExample:\nCurrent calculation: \nRP = \u00a300.50 per litre\nFD = \u00a300.53\nVAT = 17.5%\nNet cost to consumer = \u00a31.21 per litre\n\nProposed calculation: \nRP = \u00a300.50 per litre\nFD = \u00a300.53\nVAT = 17.5%\nNet cost to consumer = \u00a31.12 per litre\n\nBased on my current fuel consumption of approx 51 litres of unleaded petrol per week for travel to/from work (90 mile round trip), this would reduce my fuel costs by approximately \u00a3216.2 per year \n\n(Based on current average price of \u00a31.19 per litre / 90 miles per day journey in a 1.2l 3 yr old car that is up to date with servicing and driven very much with an eye on the revs!)",
