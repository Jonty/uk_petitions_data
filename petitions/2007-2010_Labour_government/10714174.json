            "background": "Allow people over the course of thier working life to alter thier tax allowance so that when they have more disposable income they can lower thier tax allowance and this amount can go into thier state pension funds to top it up or save for future years when times are hard. This will allow them to achieve a higher state pension based on thier contributions OR when times are hard they can they can increase thier tax allowance if they have over contributed in previous years. This will also allow families to manage thier budgets more easily when times are hard in years to come or they decide to have a family and need a larger tax allowance! It is a self funding scheme managed by the individual and not the state! Giving people a more flexible life style to help manage the UPS and DOWNS of life!\nIE the \"credit crunch\"",
