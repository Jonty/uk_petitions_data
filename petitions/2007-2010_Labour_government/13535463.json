        "background": "From experience I have found that in particular exams  enough time is not allocated for all students to complete them to a satisfactory standard representative of thier ability. The results of these exams are life changing. \n Examination boards maintain that it is only a very small percentage of students that have such difficulties, however, I have good reason to believe many such students do not think it is worthwhile to report such difficulties to start with. As the head of examination boards at my school recently said \"They find a way to get out of it. If you make a complaint they blame you, saying you didn't finish because you didn't know the material well enough\".\n  This is discrimination that does not accurately represent a students academic ability, and should be put to a stop immediatley by independant verification.",
