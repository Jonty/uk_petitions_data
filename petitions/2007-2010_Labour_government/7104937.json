            "background": "After serving the country and getting medically discharged from the Armed Services, personnel are typicaly given three months notice to vacate their married quaters. Councils will not allow personnel on a housing list until a discharge form is seen. This is normally given 3-4 weeks after the date of the Medical Board at which they are told of the impending discharge. This narrows the time to get a counsil house to 2 months before being made homeless with a family. The average waiting list for them is 4-5 months because Armed Service personnel that are medicaly discharged are not deemed to be any different as a sucessful asylum seeker. Service personnel having been medicaly discharged serving the country should get more recognition for their sacrifice. They have given up their health to do thier duty so the country owes them at least the sound knowledge of a roof over the heads of their family.",
