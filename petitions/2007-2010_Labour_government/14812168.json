            "background": "Once upon a time we called a spade \u201ca spade\u201d and we all knew what it was, what it looked like and its uses.\n Once upon a time we called Parking Attendants \u201cParking Attendants\u201d and we knew what their job was. Then they morphed into \u201cTraffic Wardens\u201d although they had nothing to do with traffic, nor were they wardens.\n BUT since the Traffic Management Act 2004 Traffic Wardens have morphed into \u201cCivil Enforcement Officers\u201d \u2013 with different uniforms, depending on the local council\u2019s preference,  and a title which in no way relates to their function.  \n  WORSE, because they have this over-blown title, some councils are empowering  CEOs to issue fixed penalties for anti-social behaviour, environmental crime and locally enacted ordinances such as noise violations, in addition to parking violations.\n We demand that \u201cCivil Enforcement Officers\u201d are renamed \u201cTraffic Wardens\u201d with a standard nation-wide uniform so that we know who they are and limit them to their primary function.",
