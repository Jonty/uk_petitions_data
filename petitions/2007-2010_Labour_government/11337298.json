Yes this may be saving C02 emmisions and saving peoples money but will effect the reptile keeping hobby! Many keepers use 100watt + bulbs to actually keep the animals. If these were banned what would we do? We carn't use energy saving bulbs, they dont give of enough heat .. something must be done! We must be considered, both home keepers and zoo's!",
