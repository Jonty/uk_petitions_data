            "background": "Many companies make big profits from increasing prices for their product. Other companies pass those increases on and add a bit more for their own profit. And the Government does not criticise or fine them. But if it is you or me driving too fast, that is different. Why? \nWe should fine companies who raise prices. That way we can also lower taxes for companies who lower prices, or do not pass on rises.\nOf course, there are many people who will resist this. They will say that businesses need freedom to be efficient and profitable. Well, remember Northern Rock and Bear Stearns, and Enron- what did they do with their freedom? Also remember that the regulatory offices like Oftel are always telling companies to reduce prices- it does not seem to make the companies affected unprofitable or inefficient. \nIt can be done, and it should be done. \nThank you for reading this- if you like it, please ask others to support it. It really is time we consumers stood up for ourselves.",
