        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Companies that lease business's should not be allowed to force their tenants to purchasing goods from the letting company. Any business should be free to source its goods from the cheapest source and be able to supply the product is customers want. \n\nTying business to the lessees product range is anti competitive and not in the interest of the tenant or their customers. In certain areas (e.g. Pubcos who own a large proportion of public houses) it allows the leasing companies to effectively enforce a cartel to keep prices high. This is a factor in the discrepancy of the cost of alcohol between supermarkets and licensed properties. \n\nThese companies are just interested in risk reduction and profit maximisation. If they were really thought that their was a good profit to be made from the business then surely they would run the businesses themselves as employ managers to run them (much like chains such as Wetherspoons do).",
