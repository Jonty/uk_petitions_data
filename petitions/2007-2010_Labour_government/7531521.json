            "background": "It is been reported via email from a number of concerned people, that post office employees are not allowed to publicly advertise or offer a version of the Christmas Postage Stamps which is specifically religious, i.e. depicts an image of the Madonna.  It seems that this limits the legitimate expression of the celebration of a Primary Christian Festival (which is in part recognized by those of other faiths), which is also a British Holiday Season by law, and is clearly not secular in its inception.\nIt would be helpful if the the Post Office could be encouraged to be more honest about both its policy and practice regarding this matter, and make a public statement in the media to clarify their position.",
