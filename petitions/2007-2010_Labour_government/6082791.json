            "background": "As the EU expands huge numbers of foreign lories use the advantage of cheaper fuel from their own countries to compete within the UK with our own transport operators. Many either flout or do not understand our traffic laws. Drivers regularly break speed limits secure in the knowledge they will not be pursued across Europe for a speeding fine. The use of number plate recognition cameras at ports of entry would enable the lorry to be impounded on a subsequent visit until the fine is paid, regardless of who was driving the vehicle at the time of the offence. Some EU drivers regularly drive excessive hours and if stopped they will simply be taken off the road for a rest period. There should be a system to impound the vehicle for 72 hours and only release it on payment of a \u00a33,000 (or other) release fee.",
