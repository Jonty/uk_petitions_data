            "background": "My idea is to double/triple/increase as appropriate the stamp duty charge to purchasers of 2nd homes/buy to let/investment properties - that do not intend to make these their main or full time residence.\n\nA simple declaration could be made at the time of purchase enforcable by fines & cross checked with already held Govt records ( eg land registry & income tax etc similar to the previous mechanism for the \"MIRAS\" - mortgage interest relief at source scheme ).\n\nThis measure ( which could be considered with the possibility of reduction of stamp duty for 1st time buyers depending on the likely yield ) could form a simple weighting tool for restricting ballooning property prices in the most affected areas & making it more likely that the local population could afford to stay in the area.",
