Many people in Manchester are separated from their essential services, childcare, family or local shops by the motorway.  You can't choose what time you get an appointment or drop your children off before work.  This could affect many aspects of family life, meal times etc.  This will mainly affect the less well off.  Don't charge us Mancunians for living our lives.",
