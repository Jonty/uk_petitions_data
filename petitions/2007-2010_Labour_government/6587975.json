            "background": "I feel that the benefit system needs to be changed.\n\nChange the name from benefits. The word, \u2018benefits\u2019 has a positive connotation.\nThe word itself suggests that it's a good thing to be unemployed, an immigrant or a baby mill.\n\nVouchers not cash,\nthat can only be used by the holder, when producing a photo card.\nVouchers are only redeemable against essential items. Fags and booze are NOT purchasable by the voucher system. For that the person should get a job or a very good reason not to.\n\n* Reduce unemployment benefits, both monetary and tangible.\n* Limit child support to one child living in the UK.\n* Less money to non-working asylum seekers\n* Unemployed people pay rent for housing, and council tax.\n* No concessions at leisure facilities.\n* Ban or reduce the movement of money out of the UK from immigrant bank accounts.\n\nOffer benefits to workers.\n\n* Cheap public transport for commuting.\n* Housing assistance.\n* Reduced council tax.\n* Concessions at leisure facilities.\n* Reduced learning costs at college or university.\n\nUse benefits in the correct way.\nPut benefits where they should be.\nRedirect from unemployed and child benefits to public services.",
