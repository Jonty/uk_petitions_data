And the laws are there for a reason - to ensure fair play in the market, supervise and conduct the functions of state.\n\nConstruction giants Balfour Beatty and Carillion are among the 112 firms alleged to have taken part in a cartel to fix prices when bidding for business - in a free market there is no place for Communist quangoes inf avour of the construction industry, because it is the consumer (the governemt electorate, voters and houre consuemrs (ie US) who lose out). See to it, Rt Hon Yvette Cooper !",
