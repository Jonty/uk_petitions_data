            "background": "By law, polygamous marriages cannot be formally recognized by the state; Bigamy is illegal in Britain. Yet it appears that ministers are about the break the law by formally recognizing polygamous marriages and awarding state benefits to claimants from such marriages. All plans for such recognition and associated benefit payments should be withdrawn.\n\nWhen British citizens visit and live in other countries then we have to abide by the laws of those countries. The same applies for visitors and immigrants to Britain, they must comply with the laws of this country. It is a reciprocal arrangement to respect each other's laws and culture. So why is it that government ministers are proposing to openly endorse illegal acts and even reward people for breaking the law?",
