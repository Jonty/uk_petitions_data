            "background": "A common practice in video game advertisement nowadays is to show all or mainly representative game play footage which does not actually appear in the product (video game) being sold.  I think it is very misleading to the game buying public that this type of advertising is allowed, it seems by simply putting a small disclaimer at the bottom of the screen, that these companies can sell a product quite different to that being shown on screen.",
