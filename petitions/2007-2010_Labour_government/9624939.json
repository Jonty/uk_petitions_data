            "background": "The Govt. parades that the selective education system i.e. the 11 plus no longer exists, but it is still alive and well in many counties. It is an unfair, class dividing, undemorcratic and discriminating system where 10 year olds are compulsory subjected to a 2 day test on non verbal reasoning, thus determining their future prospects. There is no parental choice, no catchment areas, no second chances. If your parents have the money you can be coached from the age of six otherwise its just pot luck.There is no proof that these 50 questions can tell if a child is academically bright or is a genius. All this system does is fail the majority and benefit the minority of upper middle class parents who no longer want to pay private school fees. So stand up and be counted.",
