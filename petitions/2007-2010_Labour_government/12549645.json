            "background": "We concern peopple of and in Ghana want to bring to the notice of PM the human right abuses by this government in full awareness of president Mills. This human right abuse is a characteristic of NDC-1992-2000, as the party originated from previous PNDC military government. Soon as this government took over ghanaians, particularly opposition supporters have had their cars snatched, received all forms of media abuses, property destroyed by party militants/activists-especially in the north, others been dragged to court without due process of law. The president seems ineffective as he is unable to bring these situations under control. Ghana now cherish the UN human right charter and therefore want it fully pursued in the country. We concern people of ghana hope the PM will consider this issue as a very important matter among the lot during his meeting with the ghanaian president",
