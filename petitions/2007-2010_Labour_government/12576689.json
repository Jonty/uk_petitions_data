            "background": "The general 30 mph speed limit is fine for most built up or residential areas.\n\n20 mph is too slow for most roads.\n\nDrivers should be encouraged to use their judgement, not constantly watch their speedometer.\n\nIf there are lots of pedestrians about, say near a school, then 20 is too fast.\nWhen the the road is quiet, 20 is too slow.\n\n20 limits on road where 30 is allowed now would add 50% to journeys.\n\nThey would increase fuel consumption and pollution.\n\nLower limits encourage people to take chances and make it harder to predict what a vehicle will do.\n\nRoad safety and casualty reduction can be better improved by other measures.\n\nIf a 20 limit is really necessary, then this should be introduced on a individual case-by-case basis.\n\nSpeed limits should only be changed on an evidence-based analysis of accidents in the road in question, not an emotional reaction to a populist \ncampaign.",
