            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In the USA the TSA, a Government department, is responsible for the ensuring of compliance with the rules for access to all airports. \n\nIn the UK this job is done by the port operator or a subcontractor, and these staff not only have the CAA wa\\iting time targets to bear in mind but the fact tht their employers naturally want their staff to process passengers quickly so they can spend in the shops in the departure lounges, thereby creating more revenue for the port operator.\n\nThis policy of different companies operating security at different airports allows for a degree of difference in proceedures, causing confusion for the passengers. Whilst conforming to DfT regulations and being subject to random and regular checks the introduction of a more streamlined approach will ensure that there is better communications between ports with security related issues being more commonly discussed on a nationalk basis rather than airport operator one",
