            "background": "Barbecue's should be banned in all residential areas as they (a) cause unneccessary pollution (b) prevent other people from using their gardens when the weather is nice - a rare enough event in the UK (c) force other people to close their doors and windows when the weather is hot, otherwise the house stinks of barbecue fumes, including lighter fuel (d) the fumes from burning petroleum products that people use to light their barbecues are poisonous and an irritant.\n\nMost residential areas are already smokeless zones, so why are barbecues allowed? \n\nFor those who think this proposed ban infringes on their human rights to enjoy an \"innocent pleasure\", what about others' rights to enjoy a smokeless and stinkless life in their own home and back garden?",
