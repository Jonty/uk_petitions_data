        "background": "At present, after the birth of a baby, women may take up to nine months maternity leave while men may take only two weeks with paternity pay.  We would like to ask the Prime Minister to consider that it is an assumption to believe that all women will want to stay at home while their partners work, and would like to suggest that extended paternity leave for fathers be introduced, in order that men and women can have equal opportunities following the birth of their child, without prejudice stemming from antiquated stereotypes.",
