We would like to ask the Prime Minister to consider that it is an assumption to believe that all women will want to stay at home while their partners work, and would like to suggest that extended paternity leave for fathers be introduced, in order that men and women can have equal opportunities following the birth of their child, without prejudice stemming from antiquated stereotypes.",
