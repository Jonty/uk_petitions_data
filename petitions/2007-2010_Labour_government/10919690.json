            "background": "Increasingly, retailers are no longer accepting cheques for purchases, requiring payment by cash, debit or credit card. Pensioners whose only income is a State Pension do not have sufficient funds going into their accounts to be allowed Debit or Credit Cards by many banks. This forces them to have to carry cash for all purchases, which is particularly unsafe as they are a more vulnerable group. Banks should be made to issue debit cards to pensioners, which does not expose the banks to any financial risk, as there is no credit element involved, but makes life safer and easier for an important group within the population.",
