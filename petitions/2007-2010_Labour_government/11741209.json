We, the taxpayer, via HMG, now own substantial parts of several UK banks, into which we have ploughed billions of pounds. Now, we see billions more of our money being paid to the very people who got us into the current financial mess, at a time when tens of thousands of people are losing their jobs and facing severe cutbacks in their household budgets. Is this fair?",
