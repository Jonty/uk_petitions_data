            "background": "For many year women have had equal right on many things but there are thousands of men in the uk and millions in the world who prefer to wear skirts (NOT KILTS) or dresses.\nAlthough there is nothing illeagal in this (as far as i am aware) modern society shuns such men as pervets or deviants and this is unfair as it is against the terms of their human rights.\nIt should be the case that if women can wear what are percived to be mens clothes, i.e. trousers then why can the same not be said of men being allowed to wear skirts or dresses.\nModern society needs to wake up and look at it self and i would like the prime minister and the goverment to do something about this, perhaps make it a requirement for men to wear skirts or dresses for a month to see what women have ot go through and gives us men more freedom and a better understanding of what women go through",
