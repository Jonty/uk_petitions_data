            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "When the price of crude oil went up in the summer months to as much as 140 dollars a barrel, petrol prices increased astronomically to more than a pound a litre. Now that crude oil prices are down to about 70 dollars, how come petrol prices are not cut down to at least half of what they've been? The reduction in petrol price should be commensurate with the previous increase.\nI call on the govt to do all in its power to bring down petrol prices and alleviate the sufferings of the masses who have to spend so much to fuel their vehicles.",
