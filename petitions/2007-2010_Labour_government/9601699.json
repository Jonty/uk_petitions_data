            "background": "We all know the Government isn't serious about global warming, petrol prices, traffic congestion etc., but if it ever does decide to act, here are a few quick hits :-\n1. Actually enforce the current speed limits. If motorway traffic slowed from 85 to 70 mph, there would be a 10% saving straight away. We'd be safer too.\n2. Create secure parking areas at many major motorway and A road junctions. That would greatly assist car sharing for work and leisure.\n3. Remove the gas guzzling tanks from our roads. Use leadership to quell the fashion for these monsters, or legislation as a last resort.",
