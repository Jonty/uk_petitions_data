            "background": "Every district has its own scheme, different types of system for example where I live (Dartford) we have a large Green bin for household waste, a large black bin for cardboard/foil/plastics and a smaller box for glass. Two miles down the road their authority has a Green bin for garden waste, a brown bin for food waste a black bin for recyclables and a blue bin for all other rubbish. It's crazy. It's different everywhere you go. Unifying the system could mean lots of different authorities in close proximity could pool resources to save money and improve productivity and the environment",
