            "background": "LTTE is a terrorist organisation proscribed by many democratic nations and have been described by the FBI as the worlds most dangerous terrorist group who have perfected the use of suicide bombers. LTTE is known to operate credit card scamming, drug smuggling, gunrunning schemes and its\u2019 UK leader was convicted recently. Encouraged by the absence of courage to deal with this type of terrorism effectively and decisively, other terrorist groups have sought to emulate the LTTE. For over 26 years all Sri Lankans; Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims alike, lived and suffered LTTE terrorism; with the \u201cbasic human right to live\u201d, snuffed out of over 70,000 innocent and eminent persons. Consequently, this has blighted generations of Sri Lankans and made them refugees in countries like UK. Sri Lanka has achieved notable success in its fight against terrorism that no other Government can boast.  She is on the verge of sending a clear message to terrorist all over the world that terrorism does not succeed. It is therefore incumbent upon the civilised world to help Sri Lanka defeat and eradicate terrorism from its shores and not to embolden other budding terrorist to flourish.",
