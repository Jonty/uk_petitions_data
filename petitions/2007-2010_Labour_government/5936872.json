Surely we have a responsibility to attend to the well-being of these people and their families as our military presence in Iraq is reduced. Treating them as other refugees is insufficient and abandoning them is dishonourable. Denmark has set a good example by airlifting out the  Iraqi employees of the Danish armed services. This is an example we should follow.",
