            "background": "Arms, manufactured and sold, eventually lead to wars we cannot afford which waste perhaps 10% of world income and energy. This militarism must stop. We can end arms sales and cut our weapons production and use, forswear war and apologize for past ones. Arms can be bought back and destroyed, borders guaranteed by NATO, phased disarmament can occur among all blocs, and we can stand committed to end militarism fully with UN guarantees. We need an unarmed world.",
