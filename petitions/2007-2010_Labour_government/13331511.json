People work hard everyday from menial tasks to MP's and they function and pay for some disfunctional person to remain in a comatosed state. I believe it should be a requirement that to recieve UB40 you should be willing to proof that you are not a frequent drug user incapable of staying drug free to gain employment. If you should not agree, you should not be able to recieve UB40.",
