            "background": "I am asking the prime minister to consider banning all lone working in betting shops as i feel the licensing objectives in the gambling act are aimed more at profit for betting firms and customers and not aimed at protecting the employees of the companies. Protecting the vulnerable from harm should cover staff that have to work alone in shops for 5 hours straight, from opening in the morning by themselves or even left to close the shop at night by themselves like some companies make their staff do. Betting shops are targeted purely for the money in the shop as there is nothing else to steal from them which is why they differ from retail stores where most thefts are for items and makes attacks less violent than they are in betting shops where staff are regularly held at knifepoint and gunpoint with no protection in place in most of the shops. A shop double manned at all times would help to deter most robberies from happening as an attacker is more likely to target a shop where they know a person is working alone for a large number of hours.",
