            "background": "The Prime Minister has ruled out participating in a debate with the Leaders of the two Opposition Parties.  We urge Mr Brown to take part in such a debate, which has become established practice in some of the world's democracies - for example, in the USA and France.\n\nIn France, the recent Presidential Election - and, in part, the publicity around the debate between Mr Sarkozy and Ms Royal - led to an 85% turnout. This could only be dreamed of in the UK where apathy and disinterest in politics is at its highest.\n\nWe urge him to reconsider his position.",
