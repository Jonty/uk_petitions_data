A lot of teenagers can be very threatening and even resort to extreme vandalism and violence. The offenders themselves are not even sure of the motives behind their crimes, it is through boredom and because there is a complete lack of control and fear of punishment as the system is too easy and parents and teachers are too lenient.\nThere needs to be a lot stricter punishment of naughty pupils in schools and stricter laws against youngsters committing crimes.\nThere also needs to be more for teenagers to do and places to go.",
