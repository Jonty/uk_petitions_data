        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Many people in the public consider the Iraq and Afghanistan wars to be failures both economically and socially; hundreds of British soldiers have been killed whilst serving the government in these foreign nations and many more families have sent off their fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters and children to wars which have been fiercely contested by many in the public eye and in the government itself. It is our opinion that the government should hold a referendum with the people of the United Kingdom before such costly military action is taken in the future. Soldiers have had no choice but to go off and die in battle whilst the people who had the choice were the men in government; it has been frequently been said that this Government is out of touch with the country and that people's voices are often not heard. In situations of this utmost importance to the nation as a whole it is our view that it is necessary for the public's voice to be clearly heard in the matter.",
