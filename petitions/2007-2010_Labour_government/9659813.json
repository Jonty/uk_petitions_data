        "background": "It has got to the point where council employ plain clothes workers who instead of giving a warning and asking you to pick up the litter in the future just give a fine straight away. However, when it comes to tackling a group of rowdy youths they are less enthusiastic. It is easier to pick on soft targets such as mums taking their young children to the park.",
