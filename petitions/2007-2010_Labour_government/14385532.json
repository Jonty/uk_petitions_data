            "background": "When Thorium is used to generate power because most of it is \"burnt\" there is very little radioactive waste.\n\nMixing the fuel with molten salt allows for high temperature *low* pressure reactions systems that are far safer than current technologies. Allowing the salt to \"freeze\" (ie fall to room temperature) means you can effectively temporary switch off the reaction, and later restart it. \n\nIn addition this process cannot be weaponised and can be made in mobile units, ideal for \"axis of evil\" scenarios\n\nThorium needs far less processing and is far more abundant than other nuclear sources.\n\nWith comparatively very modest amounts of money this existing but out of fashion technology could provide safe and clean plentiful zero carbon power\n\nWe therefore call on the government to start a 1GW power station project as soon as is practicable",
