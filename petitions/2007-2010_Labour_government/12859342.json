            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "My ideas are to amend the consumer credit act to: \n1. create a regulated and independent (not related to credit agencies or banks) default registrar for credit agreements in default \n2. only allow a credit agreement to be registered as in default once, not multiple times currently prolonging the recovery date. \n3. ensure that when debts are sold on following a default, the consumer is informed in writing of the new arrangement and any agreement in place such as frozen interest is continued \n4. further regulate debt collection agencies to protect consumers from harassment and bullying \n5. allow SATISFIED defaults & CCJ's to be removed from the credit reference agencies after 3 years of the original registration not the current 6.\n6. fine the finance houses for publishing incorrect credit information or failing to remove defaults after they have lapsed.\n7. administration charges, handling fee's should not be allowed to be charged on accounts in default. \n8. Enhance the protection from bailiffs, ensure bailiffs are a matter of last resort and force companies to demonstrate proof that agreements have been proven and all reasonable ways of contacting the individual have exhausted.",
