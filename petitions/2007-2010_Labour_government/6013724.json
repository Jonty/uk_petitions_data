            "background": "The nation currently shows respect for our monarch by marking anniversaries such as the Queen's birthday with the flying of the Union flag on public buildings. \n\nThe government's proposals to fly the Union flag continuously will mean that royal anniversaries will no longer be specifically celebrated. Other commonwealth countries eg Australia have public holidays to celebrate our Queen's birthday. The least the British government should do is continue the tradition of raising a distinct flag in her honour.\n\nNote: This petition does not express an opinion on the general principle of the government's proposal. If the Union flag was flown continuously then a different flag could be raised on the current flag days.",
