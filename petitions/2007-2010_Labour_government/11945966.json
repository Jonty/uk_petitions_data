Government Customer Service needs to be greatly improved because the existing channels of communicating with MPs, Ministerial Departments, the Prime Minister and now through e-petitions are not working well enough.  There needs to be a government Customer Service Department to oversee all customer service matters ensuring that all customer feedback is processed with high levels of intelligence and that citizens get quality responses.",
