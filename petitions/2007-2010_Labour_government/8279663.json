        "background": "Some low cost airlines are currently charging customers debit/credit card fees for each sector (ie outgoing/ingoing) and for each passenger rather than add a single fee to the booking. In other words a booking for 4 return flights carries a charge of 8 times the normal debit/credit card fee which is excessive and unjustifiable.",
