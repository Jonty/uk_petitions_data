            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "ban the use of unmarked traffic cars as the use of these cars must contravene human rights .ie.entrapment.\nspeed cameras are required by law to been seen and signposted and also police officers carrying out speed checks have to wear hi-vis clothing.stealth cars are not acting in the public interest of safety etc,and are only used to increase government bank balances,these cars should only be used for undercover work involving car crime drugs etc,not general road policing by following motorist around until they make a mistake then handing out fixed penalties for driving slightly over the limit etc.please support this petition because marked traffic cars still are the best at policing the roads and been more visible creates the impression of more traffic officers on the roads.",
