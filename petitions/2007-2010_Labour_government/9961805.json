The law as it stands is fine, dogs to be kept under control either by voice control or lead.   Dogs allowed one or two bites before destruction in accordance with the old laws, dogs that just nip are in danger of being put to sleep, when they can be sorted out.  Dogs should not be exempt from going in parks or cemeteries.",
