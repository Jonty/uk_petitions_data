            "background": "This petition is to attempt to stop the excess amount of money most if not all our elected Politicians are currently claiming in regard to the 2nd home allowance and any other non work related expense they claim.\n\nMost other workers in the UK do not have an \u00a3141,000 salary and also an ability to claim additional expenses for having purchased a 2nd home to be closer to the house of commons or in the case of the taxpayer, being closer to their work in London rather than travelling by train or other means of transport for lengthy amounts of time to work on a daily basis. Most taxpayers who work in London can travel for almost 2 hours to and from work due to the cost of living closer to London, if these people can achieve this why can\u2019t our elected representatives.\n\nMy Petition is to attempt to get the expenses stopped that do not fit into work related matters that an MP does, including furnishing apartments and houses they have bought to be closer to work etc, any other citizen has to furnish these from their own pocket so why should elected officials have this additional allowance that is paid for by the taxpayer.\n\nPlease sign this petition in protest to these extra expenses that are given to MP\u2019s",
