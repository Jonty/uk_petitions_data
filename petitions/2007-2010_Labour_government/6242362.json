            "background": "At the moment every household in the country pays a council tax, this is for the police service, fire and rescue, with the bulk of the money going to the council. The rest of this goes to cover various services we all use, including the collection of refuse. I believe we pay enough towards these services and this goes up above inflation every year.I agree we should all be more careful in the amount of rubbish we throw away and recycle as much as we can. But I do not believe we should be charged any more, not unles the council will reduce the council tax. Fat chance, it is any excuse to bring in more revenue and squeeze us even further.",
