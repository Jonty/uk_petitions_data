            "background": "Despite being brought before the courts over their unlawful use of anti-terrorism legislation, especially the misuse of stop and search powers under section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000, the Police are continuing to use this legislation as a means to intimidate and harass peaceful protesters. Parliament\u2019s aim in drawing up this legislation was not to provide the Police with an opportunity to enter the political arena and stifle the fundamental right of free speech and the right to demonstrate. Continued misuse of these powers will bring both the Police and the law into disrepute, potentially criminalise swathes of the population and erode public support for future proposed legislation aimed at ensuring public safety and security.",
