Postal votes would be used and there would be one month to choose a candidate. \n\nThe person with the most votes would be Prime Minister and the 650 candidates with the most votes could attend parliament.\n\nRepresenatives' income & power to vote in parliament would be in direct proportion to the number of people that voted for them.\n\nIf they lose trust in their MP, voters can switch their representative, and therefore alter the representatives' income & power in parliament, at any time. Votes would change from a cross on a bit of paper to a contract of trust. \n\nParliament would become a proper market place for the best politicians and ideas, not about winning elections. \n\nUpgrade democracy to version 2!",
