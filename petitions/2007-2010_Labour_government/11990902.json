            "background": "A law is about to be passed to put vicars, bishops and priests in prison if they don't teach about gay marriages.\n\nThis is totally wrong these people are being targeted because of their religious convictions. The United Kingdom is suppose to be a society of freedom of speech. The Labour Party our becoming a dictatorship. If they can allow people to be put in prsion up to 7 or more years. \n\nThe Labour party have restricted people's human rights and freedom of speech. No law can change other people's religious values and views about how soceity should be. So put me in prison but by the grace of God I will bycott what you do and say. I don't share with you that God created a man and a man to be with each other or a woman and a woman. Only a man and woman can create another human life true fact.",
