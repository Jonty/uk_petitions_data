        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Please support the work of International Cruise Victims to introduce new UK & EU laws to protect passengers and crew on cruise ships. \n\nThis important legislation will follow on from the Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act 2009 recently passed in the House of Representatives in the United States. Introduced by Senator John Kerry and Congresswoman Doris Matsui, this important legislation will ensure the security and safety of passengers and crew but it is now time for us to progress this further by offering the same level of protection for those boarding cruise ships outside U.S. waters. \n\nCurrently no protection is afforded to those boarding cruise ships in the United Kingdom or Europe and this needs to change. We are therefore committed to raising a private members bill to mirror our success in the United States. The Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act 2010 [EU] would introduce the same mandatory requirements of the 2009 Act. \n\nIncidents of sexual attacks are common and we are aware of paedophiles now targeting cruise ships. A person is also lost at sea, on average every fortnight.\n\nPlease show your support and help protect others.\n\nThank you.",
