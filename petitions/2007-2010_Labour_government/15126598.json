I bet in poor visibility lack of headlights account for more accidents than speeding. \n2. indicators aren't an optional extra on cars so use them, at roundabouts and lane changing. People shouldn't have to second guess where you are going.\n3. Cameras on all traffic lights to stop the mentality of red meaning two more cars. \nIn all these cases where the law is ignored I would suggest a maximum fine of 1 point and \u00a3100 fine. (whatever the fine it must be strictly adhered to)\nThe emercency services use flashing lights as a warning they are coming. Nobody would ever suggest it would make more sense for them to drive fast with all lights turned off.",
