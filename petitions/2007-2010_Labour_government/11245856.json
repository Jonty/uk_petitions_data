        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Those areas that cannot currently receive Broadband (notspots) are being left behind by the telecoms service providers who are concentrating on Next Generation high speed broadband provision to those who already get broadband. Notspot homes are already disenfranchised and do not figure in the future strategy for the service providers - it seems it is not commercially viable for BT to provision broadband to outlying villages and hamlets. So, if the Telecoms companies will not invest, we need to rely on Government to help them make that investment. \n\nThe Digital Divide is already wide enough, but it will get even wider, as services that rely on high speed broadband provision become an essential part of the home.",
