            "background": "credit card interest rates are not at present bound by any governmental legislation. It is time government made certain laws about the maximum amount of interest, above the base rate that credit cards are allowed to trade at, this rate would of course be set by the government of the day and not the banks, At present credit card interest rates vary from 0% on transfer to over 30% this, particularly in times of financial unrest is not acceptable, although credit card companies work on a variable interest rate scheme, surely there should be some form of governmental interception to protect lenders.I would urge the government to accept this petition and implement it with immediate effect",
