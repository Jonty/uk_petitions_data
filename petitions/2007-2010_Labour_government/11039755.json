Go one penny over your overdraft, or be one penny short for a direct debit, and HBOS will charge you \u00a335.00, yet they rub our faces in it as not only tax payers, but HBOS customers.  This was a completely unnecessary, and ridiculously expensive action, which has left a very bitter taste in the mouths of every hard working person who's money is being used to bail out incompetent banking management.  Why, in the current financial climate, did HBOS management think it was appropriate to spend over a quarter of a million pounds on a freebie for their staff.",
