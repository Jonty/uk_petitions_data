        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Police and Legal system should be supporting rather than discouraging people from enforcing the law.\nPeople should obviously use appropriate force but the circumstances of the action must be emphasised, rather than an academic discussion by people who are not there about what is appropriate and what isn't.\n'Everyday' law and order can only be maintained by the general public, the community. It is just not possible for the Police to do this unless we had a policeman on every street corner.\nAt present the Police and Legal system work against the maintenance of law and order by discouraging the general public from enforcing the law. The British general public have shown time and again that they more than willing to 'have a go'. The main reason they don't do so more is that they are more worried about the legal consequences than they are about the criminals themselves.\nIt is the attitude of the Police and Legal system against 'having a go' that is responsible for the increase in general disorder on the streets and the increase in anti-social behaviour.",
