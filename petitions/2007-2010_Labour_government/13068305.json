            "background": "When the retirement age for women was changed from 60 to 65 it was phased in over the years. For those of us that are 60 this year we have a choice of deferring our state pension, if we want to carry on working. For those who are widows, already claiming widows benefit, that benefit has to be deferred too. So they have to claim their state pension and keep working in order to have an income to support themselves. If they have inherited 'additional pensions' from their husbands they have a higher state pension. Because they cannot claim an age related tax allowance until they are 65, they are taxed on their state pension as well as their earnings. The age related allowance would mean a difference of approximately \u00a33000 per year before tax.",
