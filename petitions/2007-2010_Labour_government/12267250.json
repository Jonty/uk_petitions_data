        "background": "The Canadian government has begun its annual war on seals. This year, sealers will beat and skin up to 338,200 of these gentle animals. Now more than ever before, it is vital to speak up and demand a permanent end to the cruel seal slaughter and to urge everyone you know to speak out as well.\n\nAll eyes are on Canada as it prepares to host the 2010 Winter Olympics. This extra attention will bring increased scrutiny and comes with the added responsibility of setting a positive example for the world. That's why we are calling on the Vancouver Olympic Organizing Committee to use its clout to help stop the Canadian seal slaughter.",
