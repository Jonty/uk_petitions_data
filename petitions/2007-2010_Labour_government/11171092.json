        "background": "Water utility regulation has failed. In an environment where utility companies are owned by multinationals with vast capital and therefore political influence (for example, research the links between Wessex Water or its Malaysian parent company YTL and the UK Labour Party on the internet) it is not realistic to expect regulation to be effective, and it isn\u2019t. For example, over the year Wessex Water\u2019s charges have increased by 9%, despite the fact that its profits have also increased by 6.2%. How can way above rate of inflation increases be allowed when a monopoly supplier is not only in profit, but steadily increasing its profits significantly above the rate of inflation year in and year out? The only solution is to create an open market in water supply, or to re-nationalise. In the current climate even paying your water bill feels like colluding with institutionalised robbery of society\u2019s most vulnerable.",
