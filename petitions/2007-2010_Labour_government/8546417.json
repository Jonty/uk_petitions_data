        "background": "It is increasingly recognised that painful punishment increases the risk of horse-related accidents. The horse occupies a unique position as it seems acceptable to strike and poke them to obtain behaviour modification, which would not be tolerated in other species (eg dogs). If whips and spurs were not allowed in competition then the need to use them in training would diminish.",
