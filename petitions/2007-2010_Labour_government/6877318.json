They will not work in poorly paid jobs because the government makes it too easy for them to get money for nothing. The jobs are out there, they just refuse point blank to take them. If the government gave everyone with an NI number, one weeks benefit for every full years contributions, and those benfits were worth having,ie you could afford your mortgage, then those paying into the system would feel they were having a benefit befitting them. There are too many people taking out and not enough putting in. When in genuine need, deserving cases are failed time and again, either denied the benefit or given so little they cannot survive.",
