            "background": "With all the debate about cutting costs and bankers bonuses, how ridiculous is it that a wholly state owned bank is wasting \u00a310 million on being the shirt sponsor for Newcastle United FC. People of England & Wales do not need reminding of the Northern Rock debacle or having the Northern Rock brand raised in their conciousness. This money should be used to pay down the debt Northern Rock owes the tax payer not financing overpaid footballers. We call on Gordon Brown to step in and halt this madness",
