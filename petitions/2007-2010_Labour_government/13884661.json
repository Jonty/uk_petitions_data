            "background": "I live in central London and get frustrated when I pay more than half my monthly salary towards my rent and people on housing benefits can get a nicer more expensive house given to them for free. I have a well paid full time job and I have to share a house with 2 other people as I cannot afford to live on my own in London. I hear from my partner who works for a large estate agency that people claiming housing benefits often come in with a \u00a3500 per week budget which is granted to them by the government. If they want to live in a nice area of town should they not get a job like the rest of us do so that we can afford these nice things? What incentive is this to get a job and work? none whatsoever. We need to change to get people back to work. They should have a maximum of \u00a3150 per week budget in central london then they would hate where they lived so much they would do anything (like get a job) to change their life.",
