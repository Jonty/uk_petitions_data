        "background": "This petition is to see if we can change the policy on coloured hair, tram lines and peircings in some secondary schools and colleges should be changed to allowing the students (And the teachers if they so wish) to have unnatural coloured hair, tram lines and peircings. Myself and a large number of other people believe that we should allow this in schools because it promotes individuality and self expression, students should be allowed to do what they wish to there bodys within reason. What colour hair you have or if you have more than one peircing in your ear or on your lip does not effect learning, it would probably help with a lot of peoples self confidence so that they will feel good about themselves more.",
