I am particuarly worried about the effect that this is having on the younger generation.  I think the media should reflect suitable standards and that trends such as the increase in swearing, graphic violence and sexually explicit material, with a trivialisation of subjects such as pornography, need to be regulated more stringently in order to protect our future generation.  It is a question of setting an example, not appealing to an audience.",
