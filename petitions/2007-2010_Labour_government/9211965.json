            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "It has long been the norm that social housing is for those who are unemployed.  Working members of society have gone on too long paying extortionate amounts of rent per calendar month whilst the lazy are accommodated, paying only \u00a32.50 per week in rent.  I myself have been told (by a HOUSING OFFICER) that I would be better off giving up my job and become pregnant to get social housing.  This is against my morals so will not be undertaken in any event! Tis time for change.  Would it not make sense to set the trend to \"those who work(save for exceptional cases of disability) will be rewarded\"?  Mighten that not encourage many a \"dosser\" to get a job if the criteria were set in favour of WORKING/CONTRIBUTING members of society? If working members of society were put at the forefront of the list to receive assistance, we would see many a dosser jump back in to work.  More people working, more revenue from tax?? More money to fund Cancer research? I thought governments like to make money! If the system is backwards, society is backwards. Sign if you do not want to fund the life of the lazy anymore. Sign in support of change.  How long will working members of society be forgotten?",
