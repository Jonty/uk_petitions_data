I FIND IT REVOLTING AND EVIL THAT THIS CAN HAPPEN, A MILLION OR SO WILL THINK TWICE BEFORE PUTTING ON THE HEATING, I BELIEVE, AS WOULD ANY HUMAN, THAT A PERSON'S DEPARTURE OUT OF THIS LIFE SHOULD BE HUMANE AND PLEASANT,AND DIGNIFIED. IT'S POSSIBLY PRIVATISATION THAT HAS CAUSED THIS EVIL. THESE MILLIONS OF ELDERLY PERSONS HAVE WORKED HARD ALL THEIR LIVES AND PAYED TAXES - ONLY TO FUIND THEMSELVES IN SUCH A REVOLTING SITUATION. I ASK ANYONE WITH A HEART TO SIGN THIS PETITION - AS IT COULD BE YOUR GRAN THAT IS ONE OF THE DEATH TOLL THIS WINTER. I ASK THE GOVERNMENT IF HAVE ANY OUNCE OF DECENCY OR HEART TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS CRISIS, AS TO IGNORE THIS WOULD BE CRIMINAL!",
