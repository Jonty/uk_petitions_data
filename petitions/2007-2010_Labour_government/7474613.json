            "background": "Abolish Car Tax and add the lost revenue to the price of petrol so that those who use the roads more, pay more.  This should produce a saving in car tax admin as well as being fairer to those who own more than one car, however can only drive one at any time, this reduces being taxed twice or more as is the present system.  Gas guzzlers use more fuel and would therefore pay more, haulage firms could receive tax rebates to keep them economic.",
