        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In light of Peak Oil we need radical action to reduce our dependence on oil. High fuel taxes are one of the measures we need to help deter any unnecessary use of fuel. Any cut in UK fuel taxes at this time would send quite the wrong message \u2013 that we can go on consuming oil as usual! We can\u2019t.\nFurther, the government must be more open and transparent about how it spends fuel tax revenue. There must be far greater investment in maintaining local services like village schools and post offices, and in guaranteeing that everyone has easy and affordable access to regular, reliable and high quality public transport. There must also be investment in measures to adapt to, and mitigate against climate change.",
