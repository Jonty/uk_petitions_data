        "background": "Britain is an island with limited resources. We have no option other than to compete with other nations and win (or at least not lose). Unfortunately, the nation is buried in a Nanny-State benefit-dependent culture which discourages the work-ethic and limits our ability (our desire even) to compete. Too many people can now make more money by staying at home than by going to work; the work-shy flagrantly play the benefit system to their advantage; young girls are encouraged to have children and live off the state and the world beats a path to our door for a bite of our overly generous benefit cherry. This at a time when the British National Debt, according to the respected  Centre for Policy Studies think-tank, exceeds \u00a31.3 trillion (three times higher than the figure our government would have us believe), an amount which means the nation\u2019s wealth is now exceeded by its debt.",
