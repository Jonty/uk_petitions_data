            "background": "The Baby P three have been convicted of \u201ccausing or allowing the death of a child\u201d carrying a maximum sentence of 14 years. \n\nHow could they be found innocent of manslaughter or murder when Victoria Climbie's carers were convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment?  Both Baby P and Victoria are dead as a result of deliberate systemetic physical abuse, so how can there be such a huge discrepancy in convictions?\n\nPlease ensure that Baby P gets justice by signing this petition to demand a retrial.\n\nThose who abused him and eventually killed him deserve no less than life imprisonment.",
