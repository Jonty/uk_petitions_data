I purpose that MP's should get the same wage as they currently get without the ludicrous  perks they have been exploiting. We the general public have had enough and it's time for all MP's to get their noses out of the trough and live in the real world as they expect us to do. Brown's attendance allowance should NOT be accepted as this would give MP's a larger slice of taxpayers cash.",
