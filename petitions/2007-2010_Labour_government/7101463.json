            "background": "At present, the good people of Britain have to do at least six different things to reduce the amount of unwanted advertisements they receive. Years of self-regulation by the direct marketing industry has not made it any easier for people to stop junk mail and the amount of junk posted through people\u2019s letterboxes is increasing year by year.\n\nThe British Government should therefore \u2018go Dutch\u2019 and introduce a simple and effective system of opting out of junk mail, similar to the highly successful scheme introduced in the Netherlands in 1994. In Holland, people register with the Mailing Preference Service to stop all (and not just some) addressed advertisements and to put a stop to all unaddressed junk mail the Dutch can get a readily available \u2018no junk mail\u2019 sticker.\n\nIntroducing such a system will put an end to unwanted advertisements, reduce waste and save trees.",
