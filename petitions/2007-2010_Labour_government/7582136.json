            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The recent decision to deport the Watford Football Club player, Al Bangura, to his country of birth Sierra Leone, goes against all forms of natural justice. Firstly the case to deport him is undermined by strong evidence that his life would be endangered on return by his native tribe. Secondly, in a time in which the country is actively seeking to deport 'undesirables', a young family man who plays professional football, bringing joy to many thousands, pays his taxes and is a valuable contributor to the local economy can hardly be considered as such unless other agendas are at work.\nSign this petition now.",
