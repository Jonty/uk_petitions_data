            "background": "Palm oil plantations in the tropics are now being planted on upland peat areas instead of rainforest.  Wind turbines in UK are often constructed on upland peat areas.  It has been established that the practice of draining these areas creates a short to medium-term carbon debt that may take centuries to clear, causing increase instead of reduction in environmental damage.  An accurate and public study of the amounts involved and the effect on carbon profile in the atmosphere is urgently needed before more damage is caused by these short-sighted policies.",
