It is a criminal act against MY HUMAN RIGHTS to use MY taxpayer pounds to keep him alive in this country after the killing he did, merely because he will be killed on returning to his own country.  THAT IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR ME OR OTHER TAXPAYERS, THAT IS A PROBLEM FOR HIM AND THE IRANIAN AUTHORITIES ALONE.  WE SHOULD NOT BE INTEREFERING IN IRANIAN MATTERS.  SEND HIM BACK TO IRAN IMMEDIATELY ON RELEASE IS WHAT I WOULD VOTE FOR.  THE PEOPLE MUST BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO STATE THEIR OPINION IN THIS MATTER.  GIVE US A REFERENDUM NOW.",
