            "background": "The length of the day, currently stands at 24 hours. This is not sufficient. If, like many of us do, you require to sleep for more than 6 hours a night then it is hard to acomplish much with a day, without oversleeping and ending up in some bizzare nocturnal routine. The human body is not designed to live with a 24 hour day- in neolithic times the standard day length was closer to 32 hours; and the most productive prehistoric societies, such as the Egyptions, had a 39 hour day. Surly much more can be done in a day consisting of a good 12 hours of darkness and sleep and then 20 hours of light.? Let us not follow in the tracks of the Maya, who reduced the day length to a mere 5 hours, in which time no one could either sleep sufficiently nor acomplish daily tasks to their fullest potential, resulting in the colapse of their civilisation.",
