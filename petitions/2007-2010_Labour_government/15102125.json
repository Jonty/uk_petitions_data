Regulations a few years \nlater made it clear that the tenant \nremained entitled to it even if other \napartments in their block had a \nchanged status and new tenants had to \npay a full licence. It appears that \nTV Licensing are refusing to abide by \nthis ruling and refuse even to \nrecognise documentary evidence about \na concessionary licence from its own \noffice.",
