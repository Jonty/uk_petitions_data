            "background": "Molten Salt Reactors (MSR) have the potential to solve many of the problems of current nuclear power stations. \nThey produce a fraction of the nuclear waste of conventional nuclear stations. The waste they do produce is mostly short lived (half life < 30 years). \nThey can use spent fuel from conventional nuclear stations and decommissioned weapons as fuel.\nThey don't create plutonium.\nThey are inherently safer than any gas or water cooled reactor as the primary circuit is not pressurised. The quantity of fuel in the reactor is less and they use the fuel much more efficiently.",
