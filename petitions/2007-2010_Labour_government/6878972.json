        "background": "Gordon Brown and his new Labour Government are planning a new levy on pub quizes and other entertainment.\n\nA secret memo will order council tax poopers to snoop all pubs offering entertainment such as quizes, darts, karaoke and other entertainments.\n\nThey plan to heavily tax those pubs supporting these harmless social activities thus forcing landlords to cancel them or raising the prices out of the reach of the common man and woman. \n\nThis tax is an absolute disgrace. Many landlords are under enough pressure with rising costs without this being added. We do have a life outside the home you know. Gordon Brown shouldn`t be allowed to put forward this proposal just because he is a sour puss at the mo.\n\nSign this petition and register your disgust.",
