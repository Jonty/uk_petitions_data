Our public pavements are covered in dog faeces and even our private gardens are contaminated by foul smelling cat urine and faeces, and there is nothing that we can do about it. Every owner of one of these pets should pay to have it DNA checked. Wardens should be employed to collect pet faeces and this should then be checked against the DNA database. The offending owners could then be easily located and prosecuted with the utmost vigour.",
