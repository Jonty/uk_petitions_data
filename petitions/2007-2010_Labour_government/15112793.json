            "background": "The use of Palm Oil in all types of products is causing devastation to our whole planet and putting beautiful innocent animals at great risk of becoming extinct such as the Orang-utans by destroying the rainforests which is the natural habitat of the Orang-utans, but won't be within around 10 years if we keep using Palm Oil as they will become depleted and eventually extinct.\n\nWe need to replace Palm Oil with sustainable Palm Oil and bring in a law that makes it illegal across the board for any companies etc to use Palm Oil in anything and substitute it for sustainable Palm Oil.\n\nAfter all we have a lot of green measures and taxes in place so the least we can do is protect the innocent in our beautiful world rather than destroy our world so we have nothing left.",
