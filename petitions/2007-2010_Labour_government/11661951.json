            "background": "In mainland Europe, children are introduced to alcohol at a very early age. They are given watered down beer and wine. Because of this, they appreciate alcoholic drinks and never get drunk. \n\nThen we are given advice not to give anyone under 15 any alcohol. This causes the binge drinking culture that the UK has and the mainland European countries don't have. If they do, it's on a very small scale compared to ours.\n\nIt's only fair for the UK govt to get advice from countries such as France and Spain on what medical advice they give out to parents. If the govt seriously wants to get rid of the binge drinking culture, they need to do this asap!",
