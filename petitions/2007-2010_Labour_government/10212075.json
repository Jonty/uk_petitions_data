            "action": "Delete from Labour's forthcoming 'Equalities Bill' that part which sanctions and promotes race and sex discrimination. The burden of injustice and suffering caused by this legislation is expected, and intended by the government, to fall primarily upon white males.                All discrimination is shameful and wrong. It can devastate the life of the person discriminated against. Each individual has a right to equal treatment.           If two candidates for a position are of equal merit then they should be decided between at random i.e. a coin should be tossed. Anything else is unfair and unjust.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In practice this bill would bring a culture change, allowing and encouraging a mindset which condones discrimination. It is social engineering at its worst.\n\nI note that there is already a petition calling for the whole bill to be thrown out. However, I think there is much good in the bill - including anti-age discrimination legislation and legislation which should lead to greater transparency on wages. Thus the government should simply amend the bill, eliminating the sections which sanction and promote race and sex discrimination.",
