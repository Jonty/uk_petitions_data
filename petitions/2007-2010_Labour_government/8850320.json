        "background": "The sale of alcoholic drink in petrol stations only serves to encourage and fuel,(excuse the pun), the over consumption of alcohol in this country.\nWe have a major issue surrounding the binge drinking culture that exists in this country. The easy availability of alcohol only makes this problem even worse.\nAlcohol should not be so easily available. To sell it in petrol stations is absurd and only encourages people to buy these products when they are 'on the move'and have not even planned their purchase. Not to mention the undoubtable connection between drinking and driving.\nAlcoholic products should only be available in supermarkets, where people go to do their shopping and not to re-fuel their vehicles!",
