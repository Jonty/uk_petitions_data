This petition is a call for assistance to students who would have been eligible for grants and had to opt for loans instead. We should not be made to suffer by the Government who removed the grant system, realised they had made a mistake and then decided to change back. This is highly unfair and a signature on this petition may initiate some action on subsidising the amount of loan repayable by these students.",
