            "background": "Healthy eating and wellbeing are highlighted in the media- don't get me wrong, I believe you are trying your best to help people! \nAs a sufferer of Anorexia though, it seems that the extreme obese epidemic over shadows the opposite extreme of Anorexia/ bulimia etc. The healthy ad promotions are very misleading to sufferers, emphasising that some foods (e.g. fat) are bad while others are good (e.g. fruit/veg). I have to tell myself that fat is not bad and is actually essential for the body to function- it's hard to believe that even on good days but when faced with these one sided promotions/ adverts/ tv programmes I feel overwhelmed and confused.\nI ask that for every 'healthy' ad (in aid to tackle obesity) there is an advert/ promotion to raise awareness of Anorexia and the need to strike a balance when apporaching the subject of food/ nutrion (i.e. in moderation everything is okay). Anorexia is a killer too, and people like me need more support!",
