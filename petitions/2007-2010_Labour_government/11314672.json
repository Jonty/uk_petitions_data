            "background": "We are calling on the Government to renew the debate on whether to adopt a system which would mean lighter evenings throughout the year. \n\nDouble Summer Time (DST), if introduced, would mean that the clocks would be set 1 hour ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) during the winter and 2 hours ahead in the summer - with the\nresult of lighter evenings but darker mornings. \n\nPossible benefits of DST for the country to be consider include:\n\n* Reduction in road accidents, particularly concerning children coming home from school.  \n* Increased revenue for tourism \n* Reduced energy consumption  \n* Increased participation in outdoor activities \n* Improved wellbeing\n\nChanging the system of timekeeping could bring substantial benefits and we believe that the Government should allow a proper debate in Parliament in order that the issues can be looked at in full detail with a view to a change taking place at the earliest opportunity.",
