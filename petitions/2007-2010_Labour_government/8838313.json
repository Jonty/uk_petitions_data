This is the only choice of care which people have to stay in their homes from their local council unless they can pay privately, so therefore often have to receive care from people with inadequate training or interpersonal skills.",

            "background": "Many stories are heard from people in need of care who have to put up with carers who provide inadequate,insensitive,inconsistent and unreliable care.  There are no organisations in place to stamp out unacceptable care (CSCI have no powers to close agencys and councils only suspend and re contract failing agencies as there are no alternatives)",
