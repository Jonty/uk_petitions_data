            "background": "The dominant glass suppliers (all non UK owned) to the UK are planning to significantly increase prices (by up to 50%). This will potentially drive small companies out of business, raising unemployment, and driving up building costs in an already depressed construciton industry. The increases are all of a similar magnitude, and have been anounced in the same period. By these actions the glass manufacturers would appear to be trying to profiteer at others expense during a recession, with the UK tax payer picking up the cost.",
