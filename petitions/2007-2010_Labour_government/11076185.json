        "background": "When the Parent With Care (PWC)is in receipt of Income Support, the amount they receive is reduced by the amount paid by the Non-Resident Parent (NRP) to the CSA. In effect it is considered to be income for the PWC rather than child maintenance. So the children never see it and the PWC, NRP and their children live in perpetual poverty. The child maintenance should be spent on the kids and not treated as income.",
