            "background": "Across the world, millions of children do extremely hazardous work in harmful conditions, putting their health, education, personal and social development, and even their lives at risk. \nMost children work because their families are poor and their labour is necessary for their survival. Discrimination on grounds including gender, race or religion also plays its part in why some children work.\nChildren are often employed and exploited because, compared to adults, they are more vulnerable, cheaper to hire and are less likely to demand higher wages or better working conditions. Some employers falsely argue that children are particularly suited to certain types of work because of their small size and \"nimble fingers\".\nTrafficking involves transporting people away        from the communities in which they live, by the threat or use of violence, deception, or coercion so they can be exploited as forced or enslaved workers for sex or labour.\nAcross Asia, tens of thousands of children from poor families are being sold into slavery so that customers can use them as prostitutes, as servants, as laborers. Time surveys the lives of region\u2019s youngest victims.",
