            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Worldwide we use about a trillion carrier bags each year which weigh approximately 50m tonnes and require 50m barrels of oil in their manufacture. If thats not bad enought, the majority of the bags imported into the UK are from Malaysia, China and Thailand, meaning thousands of more transport miles powered by fossil fuels.\n\nIt appears that 1 in 200 are used as bin liners or for wrapping waste, but means the other 199 go straight in the bin, they still go to landfill and take 1000 years to degrade.\n\nBangladesh was the first country to ban them despite the opposition of the local twenty six plastic bag manufacturers, and other countries have banned them, or imposed a tax. So why arn't we doing anything?\n\nEven though degradable carrier bags are currently being introduced in many supermarkets, they still require sunlight which is in short supply in landfill, so they are still there for the next 1000 years.",
