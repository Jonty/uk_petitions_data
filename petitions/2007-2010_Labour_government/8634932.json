            "background": "Every winter, Snake pass is closed to traffic because large lorries shed loads or skid because of icy conditions on this route. The road needs constant repair due to excessive wear by large vehicles, causing route closures, and the A57 is likely to require extensive closure this summer due to landslip, again caused by heavy vehicles. The 2 alternative cross Pennine routes, the A628 (Woodhead Pass) and the M62 are more suitable for heavy vehicles, as they are less undulating and have less steep gradients.",
