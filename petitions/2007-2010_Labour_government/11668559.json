        "background": "ITV plan to axe Sunday Night favourite 'Heartbeat'. The reasons for this have been widely reported, but seem to boil down to the fact that ice dancing shows are cheaper to produce than drama. Heartbeat has acheived 15 million viewers at its peak, it has been running since 1992 and still regularly acheives 5 million viewers.\nFive million viewers equals five million votes.\nWe urge the Prime Minister to review the financing arrangements for independent television broadcasters, such that they are able to continue to produce top quality drama. If the sole criteria for television production hours is price, then quality will obviously fall, and the independent channels will broadcast nothing but gameshows and adverts.\nThe BBC receives massive public subsidy, to produce top quality drama plus a lot of stuff that nobody watches. Some of this public subsidy should be given to ITV to subsidise quality drama.\nHeartbeat is a national institution, it serves as a reference point for todays politicians and policemen. They can see every Sunday night what real policing was and should still be. \nThere would be a lot more sympathy with this proposed subsidy than the recent bank bailouts.",
