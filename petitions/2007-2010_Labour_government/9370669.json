            "background": "The Land Registry currently has a massive business in selling the details of exactly how much people paid for their homes to third party companies and websites, who openly make this information available to the general public.\n\nWhen I purchased my home, I was of the understanding that the Land Registry recorded details of the transaction for land and property ownership records.  I did not know that a few years later myself and anyone else connected to the internet would be able to freely see exactly how much for and when I purchased my home.  At no point did the land registry seek my permission to disclose my data, and if they had, like many others I would have refused.\n\nI call on the government to put a stop to the land registries practice of selling sensitive information such as this companies who have no real, legitimate use for it, other than publicly disclosing it.  The information was collected for a completely different reason to how it is currently being used.",
