        "background": "The new pension increase is an insult to people who have worked all their lives . How does the Prime Minister think they can manage on an extra 34 pence a day , it won't even buy a pint of milk or a loaf . It is a disgrace  when they are giving  out money left right and centre to layabouts who have never worked or intend to work and who say they are better off on benefits . Surely this situation needs addressing  urgently before the elderly die of starvation or freeze to death because they can't afford to turn on their heating .",
