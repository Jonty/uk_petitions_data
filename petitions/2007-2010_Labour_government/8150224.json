            "background": "Bullying and discrimination in the workplace are in many instances commonplace, and expected.  It's ridiculous that in many workplaces it is EXPECTED that you will be given extra work to do if you return from an illness, and if you stand up for your rights you'll probably be given the jobs nobody else wants to do.  Sometimes its just because you're male, or female, or a different race, and it's a total disgrace.  I ask the Prime Minister to run an advertising campaign, threatening either massive fines, legal action, or in severe cases, prison time.  And I ask that a certain amount of under-cover workers and surveillance are sent in to catch supervisors and management out.  Because there simply is no other way of stopping it.  Bullying wrecks lives.",
