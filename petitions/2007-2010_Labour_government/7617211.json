Their lifes and that of their family are at risk. At the moment the proccess is a complicated one and not one of the people, that risked their lifes, have been offered safety in Britain, but some translaters have been tortured and murdered for their service to the British army and the rest live in fear of their lives and that of their children.\nTo many people die for red tape and the procrastination.",
