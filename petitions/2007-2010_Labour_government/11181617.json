If we want to repeat oe even have a better medal haul in 2012 then a cut to funding which has been promised but which is under threat.\n\nIt has been due to Lottery funding and more that our atheletes have increasingly done better and better since 1996. It would be a travesty if we did not excel in London 2012 amd it would be an embarrasment, and is Funding that is promised should be kept.",
