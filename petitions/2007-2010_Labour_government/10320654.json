Of course they need to be diligent for the good of the shareholders and the policyholders.\nBut statistics such as:\npercentage of claims paid, number of claims rejected, speed of claim settlement etc. should be published.\nThis would enable citizens to make informed decisions beyond \"who is the cheapest\".\nInsurance companies who do not respond to claims fairly are a burden on society.\nInsurance companies should be proud of their performance statistics - why is this information secret?",
