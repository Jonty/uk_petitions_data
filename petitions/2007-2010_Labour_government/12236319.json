            "background": "The Afgan government has recently pushed through a series of measures designed to rob Afgani women of their human rights.  These include the legalisation of rape within marriage and forbidding women from leaving the house without permission of their husband.  This is unacceptable and a trampling of the most basic human rights.  The UK should not support a misogynistic administration who demean and abuse women in this  way.  The Afgan government do not deserve our support and the UK taxpayer should not have to fund legalised subjugation of women.  Women in the UK fought and died for their rights and we must not stand by and allow this to happen elsewhere - especially if we have influence over the situation.",
