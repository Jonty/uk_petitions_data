        "background": "With millions of people celebrating the New Year on December 31st and drinking heavily, many will attempt to drive home again on January 1st before going back to work on the 2nd.  This makes the roads and pavements of the country incredibly unsafe due to the amount of drivers that will feel okay, but will still be over the drink drive limit and therefore under the influence of alcohol.\nA National Sobriety Day would give people the chance to sober up safely before driving home.",
