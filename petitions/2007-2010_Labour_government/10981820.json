For the BBC not only to condone such activity but to actively glorify such assaults on people in their own homes is beyond the pale. \n\nMoreover, the telecommunications act explicitly prohibits the making of obscene phone calls. If the BBC are allowed to get away with this type of behaviour then it is giving a green light to any filthy pervert to claim that they were only doing what they heard BBC celebrities doing on air.\n\nThese two need to be stopped and an example made of them to ensure no one else follows their example.",
