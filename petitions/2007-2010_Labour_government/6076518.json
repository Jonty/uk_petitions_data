            "background": "I feel it is about time the archaic way in which the BBC is funded is brought into the 21st century, and that the outdated and over expensive tv license fee is abolished, and the BBC is funded by paid advertising in the same manner as the independants tv channels are.\n\nThe tv license is just another form of stealth tax which is hopelessly prehestoric and which just gets more and more ridiculously expensive each year without giving the viewing public enough choice other than endless repeats, reality tv, and hopeless soaps.",
