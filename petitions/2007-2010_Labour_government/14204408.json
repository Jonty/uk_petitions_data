It is often very difficult for the victim to obtain this information without using deception and giving away personal data, and the enforcement of the law should not rely on a victim undertaking such a role. It is technically possible for subscribers to bar calls, but phone companies treat this as an added value service rather than upholding the law, and charge for it, even though the work of setting it up is done by the customer.\n\nThis would not prevent people trying to withhold their number for personal reasons, nor would it rely on people who are already lawbreakers obeying a further legal requirement. It would put the recipient in control.",
