            "background": "After only a years operation Fife Stagecoach have decided with little or no consultation (that I am aware of) to abandon the direct bus route to Edinburgh from Duloch Park (Dunfermline Eastern Expansion). This will leave Duloch Park residents with an unreasonably tortuous journey via Ferrytoll to Edinburgh on two buses, and will undoubtably involve more car use to avoid this inconvenience. The X57 is nonsenically returning to its original route along Queensferry Road, which already accommodates a multitude of Edinburgh services.",
