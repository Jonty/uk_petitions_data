            "background": "It is essential for the maintenance of morale that Armed Forces personnel deployed overseas can receive letters and parcels from friends and relatives.  The MoD offers a free service within the military postal system from the UK to the deployed location overseas, but the cost of sending a letter of parcel to the central UK depot by the Royal Mail must still be paid.  We therefore call upon the Prime Minster to provide a free end-to-end postal service for the families of the Armed Forces posted overseas, using new funding without any conditions of neutrality or the restriction of existing services.",
