            "background": "Sam Stanger my brother was jailed for 2 years on Dec 2nd 2009, it would of been 3years if he hadnt pleaded guilty. His crime was to snatch a camera off a car park attendant who gave him a ticket. sam upon arriving back at his vehicle after finishing a 9hour shift  at work, was faced with the attendant who slapped the ticket on his car. Sam then snatched it from his hand in a moment of madness, which he immediately regretted.No violence was used. judge sentenced him to 3 YEARS!!? rapists, armed robbers and muggers, real criminals who give nothing to society have all recieved lesser sentences to Sam! I ask where is the consistency?? a girl was at the same court and recieved a suspended sentence for running a traffic warden over and trying to bribe him!! Sam did wrong but didnt deserve this. He goes to work and pays his taxes and desrves help! sign this petition demanding his immediate realease, he has suffered enough! You can make the difference, lets stand united and make our voice heard! Free Samuel Stanger!!!!",
