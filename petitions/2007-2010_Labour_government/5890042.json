Although the group have spoken to the local councils about getting them removed,it appears there is no law to stop this happening.  We believe the Prime Minister should introduce legislation to enable the blind, mothers and families with pushchairs, along with other disabled people the right to shop without fear of hurting themselves or being involved in an accident because of these obstacles.",
