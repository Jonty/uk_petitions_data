        "background": "The Housing Act 2004, was heralded as a vast improvement in legislation. It is a complex and confusing piece of legislation biased towards the tenant.\n\nWe wish to:-\n\n#1 Replace all the legislation regarding standards, sizes with a simple Phrase \" The building must comply with current building regulation Standard applicable on the first day of letting\" - this will ensure all properties are habitable and eco friendly on the day of renting out.\n\n#2 Spell out clearly all the landlords obligations.\n\n#3 Spell out clearly the tenants obligations for care, maintenance, and payments\n\n#4 Revise the judiciary process for eviction, the judicial process is too slow, and results in excessive debts accruing by a tenant in default under section 8 before a judge grants possession.\n\n#5 Extend the deposit guarantee, to include a pre-court arbitration service for rent arrears evictions. \n\n#6 Provide an arbitration service to assist landlords and tenants when unresolvable disputes occur.\n\n#7 Remove responsibility for setting amenity standards of the properties including HMO's from local authorities, and place it with the \"Trading Standards Dept\".",
