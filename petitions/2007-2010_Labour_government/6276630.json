Having a parliament rota similar to Question Time on BBC1 would bring parliament back to the people. Each city or region could host a week's Parliament each year or once every other year depending on its size and population. This would also mean that local economies would benefit from hotels being used by politicians during the week and travel would be limited as when it is in the Midlands, Yorkshire or Lancashire there would be less emissions from transport.",
