            "background": "We at the National Federation of Anglers, the Governing Body for Freshwater Angling, represent all freshwater anglers and believe that the recent announcement of a proposed increased fee for concessionary rod licences is a highly regressive tax and should be opposed.\n\nA high proportion of the total number of Rod Licence buyers hold concessionary licences and it is these people who are generally on a low and fixed income and are least able to afford to pay.\n\nWe cannot see how the Environment Agency can possibly justify such an increase and call on all anglers to support our action against the proposal and sign this petition.\n\nThe closing date for objection is the 1st September, so please sign up as soon as possible.",
