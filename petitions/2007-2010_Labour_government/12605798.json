            "background": "The aim of this petition is to show the government that the voters of Britain do not want our hard-earned cash thrown away by MPS. MPs get paid a hell of alot more than most families in Britain - yet they still waste our money on themselves, surely in this economic climate - this money (many hundreds of thousands of pounds), could be used to help secure the economy, keep people in jobs and stop the greediness that has seeped into our government.",
