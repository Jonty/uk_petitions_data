            "background": "It has not been proven that genetic modification improves yields or quality, reduces costs or harmful inputs, or has any benefits other than improving the quarterly figures for large US pharmaceutical/seed corporates. Moreover, there is serious doubt whether all unforeseen consequences have been adequately investigated or disclosed. However, the Special Relationship or the threat of sanctions seems to force the British Government's hand into imposing this technology onto the British countryside.\n\nOil Seed Rape is a Brassica. All brassicae interbreed easily and comprise an important family of food and wild plants in the UK, much more so than Soya or Maize which is not native.  It should be excluded from any general permit.",
