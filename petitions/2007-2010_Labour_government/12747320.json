At least you know that you will be left with some faithful. \n\nI have always been critical of the Labour Party but on this occasion, I see no reason why you should quit. Most of all, I hate the hen pecking and back stabbing. It has happened to me several times at work \u2013 I have experienced it and do not like it.\n\nThe last critical letter that I sent to you was some 3 years ago when EDEXCEL decided to remove Lord Byron poetry from the English Literature syllabus. I am a member of the International Lord Byron Society and they really did strike a nerve \u2013of course you did not reply or my letter was not forwarded to you.\n\nPlease do not give in. Now I can see you as a leader. Stand your ground and do not quit \u2013 they can quit if they want to.\n\nYours Truly\n\nMarie Otigba",
