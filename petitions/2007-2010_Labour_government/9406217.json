Whereas now we cannot get through to let the PM know how WE feel about day to day life in this country,e.g. crippling ever increasing taxes such as inheritance tax,income tax etc.etc.etc.and maddening annoyances like daily rises in fuel costs and the crazy situation where a huge slice of the price is actually fuel duty and VAT! More actual DEMOCRACY is required!  Governments are voted in and then spiral out of control.",
