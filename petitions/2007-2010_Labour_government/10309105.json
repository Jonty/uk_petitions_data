            "background": "Recently it has come to my attention that for some unknown reason there seems to be a vast shortage in the number of \u00a35 notes that are currently in circulation. I have a Saturday job in retail and working for a retailer is highly impractical when your perfomance as a sales assisstant is directly inhibited by a lack of suitable tender. Customers are often incensed and irate when we are unable to provide them with \u00a35 notes in their change and can only offer them large amounts of heavy coins instead. I urge the relevant government body to issue more \u00a35 notes or make them more widely available in order to combat this situation.\n\nAlex Sarnowski (Student)",
