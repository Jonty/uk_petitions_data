Their placement/age/health/dependency on another is not the question, criteria should b if proven 2 b a human being (eg scan).\n\nIt seems the reason 2 deny this is so that abortion 4 unecesary reasons remains unquestionably available 2 all, in the hiding of all means of acknowledgement/evidence of victims/victims 2 b. This is extremely dangerous no requirement 2 recognize a slaughtered child under 24wks means that all r prevented from being fuly informed about abortion & r being treated with contempt.\n\nTho thought the birth age @ which a child can survive is 24wks gestation, in reality many preemies survive much younger, but people fear they may b left physicaly dependant. The medical profesion ignorantly presumes 2 know what 'quality of life' is & in true dictatorship form forces only right for that, no 'right to life'. More interested in preserving money than life! It must b beyond distresing 4 relatives of those considered under 24wks, as a final insult if the child dies formal registration the child ever existed is ilegal.",
