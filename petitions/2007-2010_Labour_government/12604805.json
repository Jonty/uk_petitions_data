Additional Costs Allowance (ACA) states that members must ensure that all ACA claims are \u201cabove reproach\u201d and there must be \u201cno grounds for a suggestion of misuse of public money\u201d also expenses incurred should be \u201cwholly, exclusively and necessarily\u201d. \n\nIn the light of their undignified and scrambling haste to pay back claims suggests even they know the above criteria was not met. Paying back monies does not excuse their actions. This was fraud. In any other profession this would be viewed as \u2018fiddling\u2019 and would result in firstly dismissal and secondly prosecution.",
