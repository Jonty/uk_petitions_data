            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "England's libel laws are unjust, against the public interest & internationally criticised - there is urgent need for reform. Freedom to criticise & question, in strong terms & without malice, is the cornerstone of argument & debate, whether in scholarly journals, on websites, in newspapers or elsewhere. Our current libel laws inhibit debate & stifle free expression. Writers are discouraged from tackling important subjects & thereby deny us the right to read about them.  The threat of libel action often leads to self-censorship.\nThe law is so biased towards claimants & so hostile to writers that London has become known as the libel capital of the world.  The cost of a libel trial is often in excess of \u00a31 million & 140 times more expensive than libel cases in mainland Europe; publishers are forced to back down, withdraw & apologise for material they believe is true, fair & important to the public. \nPlease Reform Libel Law in the interest of fairness, the public interest & free speech.",
