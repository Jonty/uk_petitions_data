This applies to EVERYONE including other government departments!\nSolution:\nReview the trading status of Ordnance Survey, changing from a \u2018Trading Fund\u2019 (require to \u2018break-even\u2019) to a directly funded government department. Review Copyright licences \u2013 what are we actually trying to protect and from whom?\nThe Benefit:\nRemove the existing and extensive bureaucracy and licensing conflicts that exist between the numerous parties involved. Make UK Plc more efficient!",
