I feel that its time to say enough is enough and a 7.30pm curfew with permanent tagging should be introduced to anyone who has or has had a previous criminal record especially where violence and alcohol have been a part to play.. How many more law abiding tax paying people of this country are going to stand up to protect their property only to be brutally attacked or even murdered in their own front garden or street.",
