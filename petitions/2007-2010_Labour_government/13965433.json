Many of us have not been able to attend the passing of these heroes through the town and would appreciate a memorial where we could recognise their bravery when visiting later.  A new memorial to these brave men and women could not only recognise the heroes themselves and Wootton Bassett for its dedication to the dead but it would enable us to visit and pay our respects at a later date.",
