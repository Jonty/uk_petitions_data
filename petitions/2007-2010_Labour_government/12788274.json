            "background": "We are seeing a surge in antisocial behaviour of unions and their members in recent months culminating in the current tube strike and the probable mail strike - behaviour which is more often than not aimed as squeezing as much cash as possible out of the public purse.\nThe current government has failed to deal with unions which I believe is down to them accepting large sums of money to do their bidding (which otherwise would be called a bribe) - it is therefore hardly surprising that there is a toothless response to bully boy union tactics.\nI would like there to be legislation for political parties not to take money from any organization where it presents a conflict of interest with their duties as MPs",
