            "background": "Are you fed up listening to the disgruntled objectionists moaning that a compulsory DNA database is an infringement of their human rights? Are you fed up with European Court rulings that are totally nuts?\nLets show them and the Government that the vast majority of the UK population want the DNA database to be compulsory in order to assist the Police with their increasingly difficult role. By signing this petition you will show the Government that you support a compulsory UK DNA database. Lets give them the confidence to promote this, and to stand up to any European ruling to the contrary. All people in the UK have a Human Right to live their lives peacefully in a crime free environment - help that happen!",
