        "background": "The government has published plans to bring forward the date for switch off of ALL the UKs analogue FM radio stations to 2015.  The spectrum will be reused for a range of digital broadcast stations.  This is a badly thought out policy and should be opposed for several reasons\n(a) The public are not asking for this change - it is being driven by a government that seeks to raise revenue by selling the spectrum, and by lobbying from those associated with commercial radio stations. \n(b) The quality of digital radio will be inferior for the majority of listeners, and be difficult to receive at all in rural areas\n(c) There will be literally millions of FM radios still in daily use in homes and cars in 2015 that will all be rendered useless, resulting in needless landfill and unnecessary replacement costs.",
