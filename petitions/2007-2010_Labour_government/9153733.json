        "background": "It is currently legal for 'security' companies to enforce clamping and towing of unauthorized vehicles on private land. This can include charging a \u00a3500 release fee. These same companies also threaten to tow your vehicle away if you do not pay. I feel this is effectively theft and extortion (this practice has been outlawed in Scotland). Please sign up now and get your friends too and get the law changed so that this becomes illegal.",
