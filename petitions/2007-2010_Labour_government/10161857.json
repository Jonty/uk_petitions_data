            "action": "reconsider government policy towards the funding of Combined Heat & Power Units to bring it into line with the feed-in tariff model used in Germany. There, mini-CHP generators are given a set tariff when surplus electricity is fed back to the utility companies and a lesser tariff when they use their own electricity. This would be instead of an allowance against the installation of the CHP unit which is currently in use in the UK.",

            "background": "The idea is to change the system of funding for this low emissions technology from a system of upfront allowances to mirror the German system of feed-in tariffs",
