It is now time to become positive and build up the country by setting in place cooperative measures which were done in the UK after WW2, eg ration books, stamps, cooperative societies etc.  That way the people will have something to work towards instead of killing, burning and blowing themselves up.  It will work if they have something positive in their lives.",
