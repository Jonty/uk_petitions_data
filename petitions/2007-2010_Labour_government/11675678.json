            "background": "A plan being considered by the Communications Minister, Lord Carter, will see a universal levy on broadband bills to compensate the film and music industries for losing an estimated \u00a31 billion over 5 years to piracy.\nWe believe this is unfair to those who do not participate in piracy, and suspect that a levvy will encourage more people to turn to piracy to get their money's worth. The universal levvy is believed to compensate artists who lose out to piracy, but there may be artists who wrongfully claim to having their work pirated, and benefit from payouts.",
