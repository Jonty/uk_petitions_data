            "background": "Paul Staines, blogging as Guido Fawkes, has done an immense service to the nation in exposing political sleaze, for example troughing MPs, corrupt peers, hypocitical government ministers, ministerial and prime ministerial lies, etc. He has also given us many brilliant jokes and 'labels' e.g. his \"Gordon is a Moron\" T-shirt. Paul would make a much better Knight or Peer that any of the huge list of nonentities and crooks that the Prime Minister included in the 2009/10 New Year's Honours list.",
