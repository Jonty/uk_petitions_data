        "background": "Recent General Elections have seen parties elected to power having polled votes from less than a third of the registered electorate. \n\nThis disenfranchisement of the vast majority of the electorate is an indictment of representative democracy. \n\nIntroducing legislation that requires an 80% turnout in order for the result to be valid would ensure that each politicial party would have to offer policies that motivated the electorate to turn out and vote. \n\nIn the event that less than 80% voted, a government could not be formed, MP's would not be re-elected, no new legislation could be passed, and all existing legislation would remain in place to be upheld by the courts and police.",
