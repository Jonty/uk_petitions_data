            "background": "This petition calls on the Prime Minister to launch a debate in parliament and in public on building a bigger and modern UK parliament to replace the House of Commons and Lords. \n\nAt present, the House of Commons in particular is too small to hold all 646 MPs, which means that when there is full attendance many MPs have to stand up. Even if we reduce the number of MPs to 500, the chamber can still only seat 427 MPs. \n\nIn addition, it is highly questionable how accurate the voice vote system used by chamber is. Voting by MPs would be quicker and more accurate if MPs could use electronic buttons while seated, as is common in parliaments throughout the world.",
