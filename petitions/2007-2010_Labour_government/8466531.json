This means that nearly 1 in 25 of the 2.64million claiming Incapacity Benefit say they are too ill to work due to drink or drugs. Incapacity benefit is worth alot more than job seekers allowance. Incapacity benefit should be alot less than job seekers allowance as job seekers need to make phone calls etc",
