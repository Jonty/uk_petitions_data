            "background": "Currently many people especially in certain sectors of the economy work far too many hours.\n\nMore money doesn't make people happier. Over consumption of unnecessary goods is a problem. Stress and overworking is causing a host of problems.\n\nProductivity per hour is far poorer in the UK than in countries with lower working hours such as France.\n\nImprovements in productivity can definitely compensate for the extra hours worked.\n\nStudies need to be conducted into the effects on output and productivity when people work fewer hours.\n\n\nWe need to allow people to feel they can make the choice of how many hours they want to work. people need to choose whether they prefer time or money without fear of reprisals.\n\n\nI suggest options that could be investigated such as:\n\n- Normal working hours are limited to around 35 hours per week. Each hour worked beyond this must be paid at a higher rate as overtime. This applies to both salary workers and wage workers.\n\n- Make it illegal for companies to discriminate against workers for choosing to reduce working hours.\n\n- Make it beneficial for companies to employ more workers on shorter hours.\n\n- Increase holiday time",
