            "background": "From April 6th 2009 home sellers and their estate agents have been prevented from even mentioning to potential buyers that a property is coming up for sale until most of the Home Information Pack is complete. First Day Marketing has been taken away from us. This inability to begin marketing a property at will is detrimental to home sellers, frustrating for estate agents, reduces buyer choice, and is damaging the already fragile housing market. It is also a burden to home owners in financial difficulty and needing to begin marketing quickly. First Day Marketing should therefore be restored.",
