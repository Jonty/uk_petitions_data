            "background": "I have worked for 30 years and was laid off last Christmas, which was a huge blow considering I am the breadwinner of the family.  After 6mths of unemployment I was told that I was no longer entitled to JSA Contributory as I'd ran out of contributions based on the previous year!  I was also told that I was not entitled to JSA Income based, as although my husband only earns around \u00a35k a year, he was working full time to achieve that figure!  As a result I was then told that I was no longer eligible for Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit!!  My husband has now reduced his working hours and we are reapplying for Housing and Council Tax Benefit. I think it's ridiculous that benefit is assessed on how many hours you work, rather than your actual income, as some people earn \u00a350 an hr and some (like my husband) may only earn around \u00a34 an hr!  Income Support used to support low incomes when I was in my 20's, but now it only supports NO income!  Maybe it should be called No Income Support!  It's a shambles and everyone I speak to feel that it is disgusting the way we're being treated.",
