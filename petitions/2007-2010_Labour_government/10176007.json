            "background": "As fuel is no longer a luxury, but a necessity, we, the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to remove the VAT on fuel. We also petition him to reduce the tax to bring the price in line with what it was two years ago. Rising fuel prices are hitting ALL sectors of society, including the emergency services, reducing their overall budgets as they try to cope with spiralling fuel prices. If fuel prices are not rationalised, more and more sections of the workforce will need higher and higher wage increases to cope with the spiralling cost of living, of which the cost of fuel is a root cause.",
