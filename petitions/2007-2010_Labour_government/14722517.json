            "action": "directly intervene and compel Birmingham City Council to change the system whereby parents can be charged with verbal abuse towards teachers without any investigation whatsoever in order to be fair to parents as currently there is an imbalance of power.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I write as a teacher and a parent.  At present, teachers can lodge claims of verbal abuse with Birmingham Council and the parents will be deemed as guilty without Birmingham Council conducting any investigation whatsoever. The letter comes from the Council directly. This contravenes our Human Rights as parents under the United Declaration of Human Rights.  In the case of a false allegation a person's reputation and honour would be damaged without an investigation having taken place to ensure that the claim is true.  We are also not given the right to remain innocent until proven guilty. I agree teachers must not ever have to put up with verbal abuse.  However, a system needs to be in place to deal with parents that do so, that is fair on both teachers and parents alike. No letters recording verbal abuse or warnings about further verbal abuse on the part of a parent should be sent out or retained on file against a parent, before a thorough and complete investigation into the alleged incident has been conducted by an independent third party.  At present the only course of appeal is to school governors who only ever uphold the claims of the teachers.",
