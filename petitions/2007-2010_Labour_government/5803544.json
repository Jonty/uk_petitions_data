        "background": "With the introduction of Agenda for Change, all staff salaries were capped pending banding.  Deadlines regarding bandings have not been adhered to and even now some staff still await their final bandings. NHS Trusts have effectively been withholding staff monies since October 2004 and there has been no incentive to resolve banding issues as they have been able to use this money to cover their budgets.  I feel all staff should be entitled to interest payable on any \"back pay\" they receive as it is not their fault the AFC issues have gone on so long.",
