        "background": "We have no confidence in the current government. This has been caused by over-taxation, the Northern Rock debacle, the 10p tax fiasco & persecution of motorists under a \"green\" banner.\n\nWe believe the current administration has lost the plot. Severa studies suggest the planet is actually cooling & yet we are still being taxed in the name of the environment. People still need to use energy to live, we are not cave folk.\n\nWe urge the PM to call a general election & let the country decide.",
