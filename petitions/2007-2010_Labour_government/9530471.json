            "background": "The Home Office is currently proposing a national database of electronic information holding details of every phone call and e-mail sent in the UK. This is being considered under the auspices of Anti-terrorism legislation, however this information is already available to the security services through a number of channels should they require it. This centralisation of data is just another opportunity for the Government to loose yet more personal information and feasibly censor UK citizens. There are also cost considerations of such a project, and as I remember the government don't have the best track record bringing projects in on either budget or time. I urge you to add your name to this petition to have this proposal scrapped.",
