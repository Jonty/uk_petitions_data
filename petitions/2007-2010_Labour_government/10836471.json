I ask that todays govt apply the same resolve in removing from Britain the Muslim hate preachers of Abu Qatada and Abu Hamza ! Those children that remain and that were to suffer this abomination of 1947 , would feel insulted , having the knowledge that Qatada was illegally here in the first instance ! Many of these children were to commit suicide upon leaving those institutions that were known to the British Government of that time! The Aust Senate was to record that the suicide rate far exceeded the norm !!",
