        "background": "It seems that Doctors can charge what they think for medicals required by law, by drivers of PCV / LGV vehicles. It would be better to have a standard charge so that you visit your own doctor who know's about your health status and not the doctor who supplies the cheapest medical in your area. I consider this would help make the medical report more appropriate being done by someone who knows you medical history and driving safer.",
