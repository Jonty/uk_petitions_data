It costs \u00a31200 to convert a car to LPG. Where previously the savings would pay for the conversion very shortly. Now it is hardly worth it. \nIf it is not the goverments Duty that is doing it, then please regulate the petrol stations chargings.\nI remember when Petrol got down to 0.69p and now LPG is only 5p off that",
