            "background": "Britain\u2019s biggest car magazines and websites have joined forces to urge the Government to support calls to stimulate new car sales in the UK.\nDennis Publishing Ltd, (publishers of Auto Express, evo, and iMotor), and Haymarket Magazines (publishers of Autocar, WhatCar?, Evecars and Pistonheads) are calling on the Government to urgently implement a Scrappage Incentive Scheme, similar to those already successfully employed in Europe.\nUnder the proposed scheme, the Government will pay owners of cars over nine years old \u00a32,000 towards the cost of buying a new car if they agree to scrap their old vehicle.\nDennis Publishing Ltd and Haymarket Magazines believe the scheme will deliver real and major help in the current recession to the consumer and UK workforce.\nOlder cars are more polluting, more expensive to maintain and less safe than newer, cleaner, more reliable vehicles. Under the Scrappage Incentive Scheme, owners of older vehicles will be given incentive to change to a safer, cleaner car, while generating sales for the industry.   \nDennis Publishing and Haymarket Magazines urge you to join our campaign for a better deal for the car buyer.",
