        "action": "Exempt rural residents from 50% of fuel tax to allow them to maintain a basic quality of life.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "People living in the countryside have seen a steady withdrawal of services. Village schools have been closed, shops, garages and post offices have followed, GPs have been 'centralised' into group practices and cottage hospitals closed. At the same time public transport has been gradually reduced. Many villages no longer have any bus service (making free bus passes useless).\nRural communities have a high proportion of elderly, most on meagre pensions, and have faced their share of redundancies. \nIn these circumstances, the rapidly rising costs of using a car are making life in the country unsustainable for many. However, in the current economic climate, they cannot sell their bungalows and move to a town. Real hardship is being faced.\nThe situation must be redressed and quickly. Giving residents in these deprived communities a rebate on their fuel costs would be a practical way of compensating them and allowing them access to the facilities that have been withdrawn.",
