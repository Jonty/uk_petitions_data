How can we be proud of our Great Nation if we are afriad to show our national flag just incase we upset a minority group. Young people do not understand our heritage and do not celebrate Great British traditons and achievements.Young people should be made more aware of their heritage, the achievements of Great Britons, British traditons and the sacrifice of our armed forces past and present to ensure we have the freedoms we take for granted today. We should be proud to fly the Union Flag and should be proud to be British!",
