        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In this day and age it is ridiculouse that we do not have full coverage for our mobile phones across the entire country. I can have a signal on my orange phone, and my friend has no signal on his vodaphone, although he is standing right next to me. The phone companies should be forced to open thier transmitter masts to each other, so that if a particular company has a weak signal, then the phone would switch to a mast with a strong signal, and use any free capacity at no extra cost to the bill payer. The companies can sort the costs out between themselves. That way the capacity would be better utalised, and the consumer would be better off, because he would have what he is paying for, a good signal almost everywhere.",
