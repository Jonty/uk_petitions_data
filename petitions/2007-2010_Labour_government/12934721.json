        "background": "When a driver gets behind the wheel of their car, they are not only driving a car they are driving a weapon that can cause a lot of harm. If most of us remember our driving lessons then we should remember how much concentration it took us to learn to drive on the roads. We had to learn about getting the care moving, sizes the car could fit in. To road signs, dangers, and also to drive for others not to mention watching the public keeping an eye out for children, or parked cars doors opening. The list is endless. Driving a car, bus or lorry, should be done with 100% of the driver\u2019s attention.\nAnd yet drivers are still allowed to drive while eating, and smoking. And I feel that is also wrong, when a driver gets behind the wheel of a car concentration should be the first and last thing on the drivers mind. A driver that eats or smokes while driving has not got all their attention on driving the car. And so in a matter of time an accident will ensue.",
