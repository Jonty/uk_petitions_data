Many of us agonised about how our children would be able to buy somewhere to live. Financial institutions were encouraging a reckless attitude to personal financial management. The Barclays Card account advertisers asked us why we should wait to buy what we wanted. Others told us we deserved it.\nI am sure a lot of thought is being given to what should be done to avoid the mess imprudent financial specialists have inflicted on us.I think the public should be at least asked what restrictions should be introduced on lending and other financial services. We should be asked what we think is reasonable and affordable.\nThis doesn't need to be a costly exercise. It could be done through the Internet.",
