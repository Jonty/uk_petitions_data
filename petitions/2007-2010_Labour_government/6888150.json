            "background": "There is frequently a terrible smell of rotten eggs around the Junction 4 M65 area in Darwen. \nThe culprit has not been identified. Problem is that there are two Agencies who could deal with this (Black with Darwen council and the Environment Agency) and they both claim the other is responsible. \nIn our view it is up to central government to resolve the issue. Residents in the area have put up with this for many years and it's time to sort it out.",
