            "background": "its a fair tax, 10 pound a year for cyclists to use public roads as any other form of transport requires tax, insurance, m.o.t, whereas cyclists dont need any of these to use our roads and with the governments new policy to keep the planet green they are forcing more and more people to use cycles for work etc, so there are more cyclists on the roads than ever before, i think most cyclists would not mind paying 10 pound a year to use public roads which would generate a very large annual income for the government to use where it is needed.",
