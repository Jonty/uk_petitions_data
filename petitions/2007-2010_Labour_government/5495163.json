            "background": "We have heard enough about \"Smokers Rights\" what about \"Shooters Rights\". Now why cant I shoot clay pigeons where I like?,  We are used to have the outdoors to ourselves, but now not only do we have to shoot outside in the cold and wet, but now we have to all these smokers smoking outside. Its not nice.\n\nI am not suggesting a \"free for all\", that would be silly. Pellet free areas could be set aside for people to eat in or for children to play.  For safety reasons the clays should always be sent away from rather than towards  the bar.  Perhaps in premises that dont serve meals, live pheasants could be used, where they wouldn't be any danger of food contamination.\n\nIf non-shooters don't like the noise or the pellets flying around, they can stay on their side of the pub. \n\nIts not fair that we have to shoot outside.",
