This symbolic gesture of solidarity has been deeply appreciated by LGBT people & their families & friends in Latvija, Poland and worldwide.\n\nWe, the undersigned, request that other British Embassies be strongly encouraged to follow suit in flying the Rainbow flag as an act of solidarity for Pride in other capital cities to make clear the British Govt's continuing commitment to engage with foreign governments about the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered people & as a vehicle to publicise more widely the FCO Toolkit published on 22 May 2008.\n\nWe, the undersigned, commend the actions of the British Ambassadors to Latvija and Poland, Richard Moon and Ric Todd, respectively & hereby award them the not yet official \"Order of the Rainbow\" for their services to LGBT people.",
