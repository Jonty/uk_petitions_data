            "background": "I feel that in this day and age the TV licence should be abolished, many people now have subscription service via either SKY or Virgin Media, but still have to pay again for BBC channels. Now is the time for the BBC to either take money from subscription services and to accept advertising to pay. This will stop the criminalisation of poorer people of UK and those that struggle to pay.",
