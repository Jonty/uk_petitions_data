        "background": "There are over 1.5 million people on waiting lists for council housing. This is the only practical means for these people to get a home, something that is a human right under the UN Declaration of Human Rights. Mrs Thatcher stopped the council house building programme.  Subsequent to this the waiting lists grew ever longer. \n\nThe government promised to reverse this anti-council house policy. They should start doing so without further delay. Not only will this provide homes for those who  need them, it will also provide jobs, keep house prices low for those who want to buy their own house, and start to re-build communities.",
