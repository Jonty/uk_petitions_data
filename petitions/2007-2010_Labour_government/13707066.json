New Labour's entire philosophy was to pay paticular attention to the youth and reform the education system. But this year i and many others have experienced numerous diffiuclties in getting the funding that is required for us to succeed in our respective Higeher educational establishments, and to graduate with the right tools in order for us to survive and contribute to society as British Citizens. \n\nI propose a full review of the current system, and a proper commitee should be established in order to prevent such a thing from happening again. In this review i would like the voices of all students to be heard.\n\nI would like assurrances also from the Prime Minister that such a fiasco would not happen again.",
