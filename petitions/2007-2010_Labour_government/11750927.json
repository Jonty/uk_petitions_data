            "background": "Many public places only provide bathroom options for male and female users. This often places transgendered people in an uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous position particularly at the beginning of their transition when they still may not pass 100% as the gender they are transitioning to. By providing unisex bathroom facilities in all public places this would help to eradicate much of the discomfort and fear that transgendered people feel when using the bathroom in public.",
