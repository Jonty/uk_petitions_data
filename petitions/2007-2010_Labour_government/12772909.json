            "background": "The expenses system allows voters to hold their MP to account. A change to a different, and more complicated, voting system will remove the right to elect, hold to account, and, ultimately, remove or re-elect our MP. \n\nWhilst recognising that no electoral system is perfect, our voting system allows us to choose which individual should represent us in our locality on their manifesto. As a check and balance to the expenses scandal, our voting system has held our MPs accountable to their local constituents. \n\nThe 'First Past The Post' system ensures a locally elected and accountable MP, a manifesto which electors have voted for and the removal from a national platform of extremist parties who have little local support.  \n\nBritain is seen as the 'Home of Democracy' and has found its voice following the expenses scandal. This same proud country has delivered voting certainty without collusion, strong government, MPs who you may not agree with politically but feel represent you locally, and a lack of extremist representatives who shame other democracies. \n\nProtect your local democracy and do not let politicians blame the behaviour of individuals on our democracy.\n\nHuw Merriman",
