They are not run for senior staff alone. They are less likely to bully junior staff or customers.\n\nSeveral petitions on this site suggest what's to be done with Northern Rock, Royal Bank of Scotland and the rest, and we believe that a staff-controlled trust to control at least one bank is a part of the answer.",
