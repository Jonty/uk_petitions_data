            "background": "So many young people take a great passion in dancing, acting, singing etc. However, not all of them are made of money! The Brit School is the only free performing art school in the country, however is in Croydon and this is an immensely long journey for most people. Is it fair that young people with less money have a disadvantage of attending a performing art school? Scholarships are unbelievably hard to get, and free performing art school's will allow poorer families to send their children there. There are amazing performers out there and not all of them can afford performing art schools, free performing art school's will allow them to be recognised.",
