            "background": "So many Lorrys are involved in or responsible for accidents on the UKs Motorways.  The Freight Transport Association have refused to make tests for their members compulsory.  A large number of accidents on Britains mottorways involve Lorry Drivers and many are found to have sleeping disorders.  Too many innocent people are being killed because of this problem.  It is time to start protecting lives, including the lorry drivers themselves by making it compulsory for appropriate tests to be taken on a yearly basis.",
