            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "1. Tax Havens: clear up all tax havens (11.5 trillion dollars). This is essential if we are to have an open, transparent system and a fair global fiscal authority.\n\n2. Tobin Tax/CTT: bring in levy on international currency trade, a tax to create: \n\n(i) billions in revenue for global public services. Levy monies to be ring-fenced for Millennium Development Goals.\n(ii) redistribution to the most needy, via regional social funds or direct to grassroots organisations for universal provision of housing, sanitation, clean water and food.  \n(iii) the 'response element' of your proposed early warning system. CTT is a means by which to cool markets by levying higher when markets look to overheat.\n(iv) conditions for an end to poverty and injustice, and therefore unrest. \n\n3. Common Agricultural Policy Reform: half the EU budget (33 billion GBP) is now spent on CAP. This severely curtails agricultural competitivity in the poorest sections of the world. End all CAP subsidies to large corporations and landowners. Keep CAP subsidies for small farms, and extend to other local EU projects for food sovereignty, provision of social housing, self-governance structures and other basic services.",
