            "background": "To ask the Queen to dissolve parliament immediately. It is clear that the Prime Minister is not listening to the people of Britain in the fact that he will not give the people a referendum on such an important issue as the so called EU Treaty. Other heads of countries have shown that their people do matter and have promised them a referendum; clearly the Prime Minister does not care what the people of Britain want and therefore has no regard for their views.  Dissolution of parliament is now the only way forward for the people of Britain to have their say on this matter.",
