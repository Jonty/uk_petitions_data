            "background": "I am Pagan, one of hundreds of thousands in Essex alone.  I believe it is our right to be allowed to marry under our own faith, as any other religion is allowed.  Paganism is a nature based religion and has been around for thousands of years, we are a peaceful religion.  As such I believe we should be allowed to legally marry using our priests and priestesses with our own Gods called as witness. It is unfair to expect us to marry in a registry office and then conduct our own ceremonies privately and not have them recognised in Law.",
