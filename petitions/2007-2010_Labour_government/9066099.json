I do not think we will get a public holiday but, shops could close until noon on that day as a mark of respect.  This happens in Australia and New Zealand on Anzac Day and I do not see why we cannot do the same here.\n\nAlso, as in Australia and New Zealand on Anzac Day, lets see the Cadet Forces, Scouts, Guides, Boys Brigade etc., taking part in the Remembrance Services all over the Country on the 9th wearing their families medals, especially those won during WW1.",
