This includes an exceptional cup record.\n\nHe has already worked with some of the top England players and has managed other players of similar stature at club level.\n\nHe speaks English fluently and deals with the press in a way that is both entertaining and easy to understand.\n\nHe shows clear determination, drive and a will to win which would be useful in the face of inevitable adversity in the England job.\n\n\nBy signing this petition you are showing your support for Jose Mourinho as new England coach.  It is a matter of national interest so you should have your say.",
