        "background": "I remember Commonwealth Day at school, celebrating the birthday of one of our great Queen's and, most importantly, celebrating the Commonwealth and the great nations within it with patriotic songs, fun activities and flag ceremonies. Today there is nothing, whats worse, most children do not even know what the Commonwealth is, and when I say children I also refer to people in their late teens. The Commonwealth can do great things for many people, but there is not nearly enough support for it.",
