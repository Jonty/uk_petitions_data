            "action": "not put a ban on owning second homes, but ban ownership of holiday homes as this often deprives people local to the area from being able to enter the property ladder. Some occupations especially MPs, have to leave their family home during the working week, so a home near someone's workplace as well as where they chose to live with their family should be possible without any financial penalty",

            "background": "There are some rural areas of Britain where it is difficult for local people to be able to afford to enter the property market. To make matters worse well off people, who usually do not have any local family connections buy a property solely for use as a holiday home; this is grossly unfair to local people!!\nOwning two homes should be allowed when the main family residence is a considerable distance from the breadwinner's workplace. MPs and some other professionals are often required to live away from the main family home. Renting near to a workplace would just be filling the pockets of someone else who has bought to rent.",
