The water companies will fund the dispensation by charging the rest of us more.\n\nI don't want to subsidise religious dogma and its promotion of ignorance.\n\nReligions are per se undemocratic, acting in their own intrests and self-perservation.  Therefore they should not be funded with public money some of which at least comes from outsiders.",
