            "background": "The smoking ban has simply transferred smoke from one public area (inside) to another public area (outside). Since the ban on smoking inside, thousands more people are now smoking as they walk along the street, in parks and gardens, and congregating outside pubs and shops.  Unfortunately, smoke does not instantly disappear in the open air and carries over a wide area. \n\nIt is now impossible to avoid people smoking outside. And currently smokers have nowhere else to go. The obvious solution is that we need specific smoking areas where people can go to smoke if they wish, but which non-smokers can easily avoid. This could take the form of partially-enclosed seated areas or cafes.  The smoke is then contained, and these areas can be avoided by people who find inhaling smoke unpleasant or who are concerned for their health.\n\nSmokers demand the right to smoke. But this should not be allowed to affect other people, who have the right to breathe smokefree air. Despite the huge number of smokers in the UK, they are in fact the minority of the population and it is unfair that the non-smoking majority should be obliged to inhale unpleasant, toxic fumes.",
