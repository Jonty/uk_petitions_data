This way people cannot buy a dog as a fashion accessory or latest craze but more importantly they cannot be bred easily for fights to make money!!  Please help me to change the image for all the helpless and harmless dogs that fall into the wrong hands, it's not the dogs fault, it's the owners!! Thank you.",
