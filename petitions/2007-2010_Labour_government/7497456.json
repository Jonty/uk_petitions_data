        "background": "Pigeon Racing is not currently classed as a sport. I wrote to Mr Blair a few years back now, and didn't have much of a response. Keeping racing pigeons, and preparing them for a race takes a lot of time and effort by the owner / keeper of the pigeons. So why Pigeon Racing can't be classed as a sport is beyond me. Please could you take a close look at this, and hopefully change the way it stands now. Thanks",
