            "background": "It seems to the electorate that Number 10 just keeps on handing out huge sums of taxpayer pounds in managing its own functions/bestowing awards upon various people and organisations and increasing the cost of government by 'lording' (and there is, apparently, no limit on the amount of money which restricts the number of people who can be 'lorded') various individuals without reference to any pre-approved budget.  The public (those people who are paying fot it) have a right to know how much money it is intended to use to run Number 10 year on year and the only way this can be accomplished is for Number 10 to publish its running cost budget.",
