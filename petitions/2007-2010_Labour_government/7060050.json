            "background": "The Beatles are a major part of British post-war history. The last Beatle to leave this World and depart for the next quite simply deserves the gratitude of the Nation. This should be ideally shown by a state funeral because the Beatles are as important to Britain post-1945 as Churchill was before that date. They are part of our Nation's social fabric and the last Beatle to leave us deserves a fitting tribute. Their influence speaks for itself. God bless them all!",
