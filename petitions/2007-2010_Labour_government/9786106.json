As I have informed them of my new addresses - 4 in total since graduation in 2003, I have not seen ONE statement. I have tried to phone them up, but they have no idea what I am talking about. I don't have any clue as to if I am repaying one (which loan?) or both at the same time. \n\nI know of several dozen of people who cannot make head or tail of what the SLC are on about with their own problems with repayments, statements etc. \n\nAs with people have to deal with the SLC for many, many years after graduation, the SLC should be reviewed as at the moment, they are the most unprofessional company many people have come across.",
