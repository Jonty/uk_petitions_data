            "background": "Direct action against the military junta in Burma is long overdue. Virtually the whole population has been left to suffer over the last 45 years. Your government claims to be tough on terrorism; and yet, what the junta does to it's own people is as bad as any terrorist atrocity. The UN is so weak in it's approach, therefore we ask you to be strong. Please; no more talks, no more delays. The patient people of Burma need you to take action now.",
