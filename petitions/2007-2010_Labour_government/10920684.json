The ships were involved in hazardous mine clearance operations and I believe were overlooked when the criteria was set for the medal. In recognition of the dangerous work I kindly ask the Prime Minister to consider awarding the South Atlantic Medal(without rosette)or a clasp to the GSM1962 to the 3 ships.",
