            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I am concerned that all support is directed to families, single parents and others within the benefit system. Those who are single, childless and in full time employment on low rates of pay (often not much more than minimum wage) are unable to receive council housing or housing from associations. They therefore have to find housing within the private rented sector which is a struggle to afford. There is limited financial assistance such as the single persons council tax discount which is cancelled out because it is necessary to house/flat share in order to try and meet the rental payments. Working tax credit is supposed to enable working people to meet these financial requirements but it is just not sufficient. There are no other forms of financial assistance available to childless, single people working full time.",
