        "background": "Recent media 'soundbite' hype about the environmental impact of different transport modes is misinforming people; particularly (but not exclusively) about air travel - this dumbed-down and incomplete representation of facts is counter productive. Further, as a result, transport policy is poor or in conflict (growgrowgrow and simultaneously slowslowslow). There is no widely available, transparent, truly comprehensive and independent source of decision support facts - choice is made on poor information\n\nthe impact assessment should be with an enviro-socio-economic scope and cover ALL significant impacts, not just atmospheric emissions - to be based on current and future scenarios",
