        "background": "The 2012 Olympics should show the best this country has to offer; in ideas, history, culture and style. And, let's face it, no 'government-think-tank-created' opening ceremony is going to be anything more than uninspired, over-sanitised, tourist-pleasing claptrap - not to mention the well-known cost-efficiency drive of these Olympics, which is sure to prevent much interesting being put on.\n\nSo what's the answer?\n\nThe proven worldwide success of Top Gear, and their recent live show, shows that Clarkson, Captain Slow, and the Hamster can put on a spectacle that is sure to impress, entertain, and slightly demoralise the opposition with some mildly xenophobic putdowns - and all for a budget of under \u00a3200.",
