Its unacceptable for this death to just become another statistic.  I petition the PM to do something about this and call for the staff who were supposed to look after this child to explain why they failed to notice such appalling injuries and how they can be allowed to carry on in there jobs with little more than a written warning.  I call for all staff who were supposed to protect this child to lose there jobs and for more tighter measures put in place so that this can never ever happen again!!",
