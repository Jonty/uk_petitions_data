        "background": "The French national authorities consistently display a propensity to ignoring national and EU laws over the detention of innocent people, as in the blockade of Cherbourg, by striking French fisherman.  It is obvious the people of France are not at ease with treating the populations of EU member countries as fellow citizens (they let their own boats in and out but not british boats) so we should demand that France be ejected from the EU, doing both us and them a huge favour.",
