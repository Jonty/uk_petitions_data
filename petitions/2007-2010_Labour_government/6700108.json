People are no longer encouraged to think for themselves and are relying on being told what they can and cannot do, and how they should or should not do it.  This is a proposal to create a ministry which will be tasked with encouraging the application of common sense to our lives, and to ensure people take responsibility of their own actions and not blame someone or something else for their own stupidity.  Such warnings as \"this contains nuts\" on a peanut packet, or a coffee cup with 'contents may be hot' are such examples of when people appear to be excused the requirement to apply common sense and responsibility.",
