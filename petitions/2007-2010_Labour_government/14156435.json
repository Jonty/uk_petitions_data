This report produced by the Anti Caste Discrimination Alliance in collaboration with Professor Stephen Whittle OBE, University of Manchester, and Dr Roger Green, University of Hertfordshire, confirms what we and other organisations supporting victims of Caste Discrimination in the UK have been saying. It provides clear evidence that the Caste system has been imported into the UK with the Asian Diaspora and that Caste discrimination is prevalent in employment, the provision of goods and services and education. I cannot overemphasise the seriousness of Caste discrimination.  We ask you to take immediate action to provide legal protection within the Equality Bill 2009 for victims and future victims of Caste discrimination, by including caste as a protected characteristic.",
