            "background": "we have a high number of oval racing drivers all over the uk, which brings over 1000 drivers to the sport and thousands of fans. recently the price of tyres for the sport has increased dramatically. previously drivers were paying \u00a365 for a standard racing tyre and now the cost has risen to over \u00a3100 plus vat. the sport is going to suffer immensely if the cost of these do not decrease. we are aware of inflation at the present time but for our sport to survive prices really need to go down.",
