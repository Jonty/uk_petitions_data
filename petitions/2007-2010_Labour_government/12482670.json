            "background": "The Prime Minister has presided over the UK economy since 1997, yet we are currently facing the worst recession since the Second World War. His government bears some responsibility for failing to prevent this disaster. Labelling it as a global recession fails to accept Britain's part, as the 5th largest economy and one of the world's largest financial centres, in creating the crisis. We petition the Prime Minister to dispense with the customary caveat, accept responsibility and apologise for the damage he has caused to our economy.",
