            "background": "It is becomeing ever clear that the local authoritys cannot afford the huge bills to pay for the travel pass scheme for the over 60's and most by now have huge deficits , it seems the government did not do its home work when it came to understanding how popular this scheme would become, and lets face it was bound to be poppular I mean who wants to pay to travel given the choice!. I belive this is one privelage to much,what was wrong with the old scheme were they paid half fare , NOTHING. this scheme is a huge drain on the public purse and should be scraped with immediate effect. It wouldnt be fair on the working class of this country for their taxes to rise to pay for this scheme. I call upon on the government to scrap scheme with immediate effect.",
