            "background": "As the law stands, apparently, more people are hunting, especially foxes, with hounds than ever before. Could the government not see the loopholes closed and the ban fully upheld by the police, who are, after all, supposed to be upholding the law. I strongly believe this is the right thing to do. The hounds tear the live fox to pieces. Is this not, surely, as bad as dog fighting, which was outlawed many years ago. If Mr Brown wants to win the election, he could do a lot worse than promise a re-think of the ban, as it stands, and get at least 75% of the population of our country are in agreement with the ban. Hunting foxes with hounds is an outdated 'sport' from the dark ages!",
