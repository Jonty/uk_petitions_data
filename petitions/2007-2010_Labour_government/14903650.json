            "background": "Dual the full distance of the A1 between Morpeth and Dunbar. Put it as high priority for the transport infrastructure of this country and Europe's. Funding should be from central or European funding as it is out with the amount of money the local authorities get. At present it is little more than a farm track due to its degradation and being a single carriageway. This will allow vehicles to get past farm vehicles and slow moving vehicles and allow HGV's to travel more quickly and efficiently. The road would be safer if it was dualled for all and more environmentally friendly. Vehicles would not need to speed up and slow down so much, using less fuel. It will reduce the accidents because people stupidly believe it is all dual carriageways because it is the A1 and the main road between London and Edinburgh and only a short distance is single carriageway causing so many problems. Slowing this single carriageway section of the A1 only causes frustration and accidents because of it. Regeneration of this road by dualling will bring many benefits to the area and create work, as well as making it a faster and safer route between Scotland and England.",
