            "background": "Various species of tropical fish sold in the aquatic trade as pets, are being injected with pigments or dyed with lasers to artificially change their colours. This is a very stressful experience for the fish which undoubtedly causes a great deal of pain, as current research strongly suggests that fish can feel pain. There is also evidence to suggest that these processes cause a high disease and mortality rate in comparison to normal specimens.\nTypes of fish including parrotfish and glassfish are dyed abroad and can still legally be sold in the U.K., available more commonly than many people realise.\nVarious respected aquatic stores have taken a pledge to not sell these fish, although many other retail outlets still stock them. Unexperienced fishkeepers may be buying these fish without awareness of the trauma they have suffered.",
