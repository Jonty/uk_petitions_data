            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In the current climate there are three individual tiers of national minimum wage. Those aged 16 and 17 fall into the first tier, those aged 18-21 fall into the second tier with those aged 22 and over falling into the third and final tier. There is currently a \u00a32.20 difference between the highest and lowest tiers of payment, so surely it is our duty to question why this difference is present? A government that prides itself on equality for all should bring the national minimum wages of these three bands into alignment, after all there is no reason to suggest that one band may be able to work in a specific role in a more competent manner than another. By signing this petition you are requesting that the government review the national minimum wage of these three bands, and bring them into alignment to create a single UK national minimum wage that doesn't discriminate between age. Women have received the right to an equal level of pay with the creation of the Equal Pay Act 1970, lets achieve the same right for younger people by giving your full support to this cause by signing this petition.",
