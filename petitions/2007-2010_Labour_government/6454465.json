        "background": "Currently not all councils are doing this.\n\nConsequently residents on council estates are paying their council tax as well as high service charges.\n\nThese charges include street cleaning and road repairs, which for most other people in the council are part of the council tax. \n\nParking fees levied by the council are 3 times as high as in other residential parking zones. \n\nThe extra and double! charges seem extremely unfair for council estate residents, who most definitely are not among the wealthiest.",
