            "background": "This is is in response to the requirement that as from July 2010 all parents hosting foreign students will have to do this. As a result many schools are ending foreign language exchanges as they feel the process is intrusive. It is also the case that as the process cannot be done in foreign countries, schools feel they cannot safeguard children abroad. This will deny such an important part of a language experience to many children, despite the fact there is no single reported case of a child being abused on a foreign language exchange",
