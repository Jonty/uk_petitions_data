            "background": "4x4's are a necessity in the rural area in which I live. Therefore, I do not advocate raising taxes to discourage ownership.\n\nHowever, on the road, they are a hazard for pedestrians and other road users, so I believe that they need to be slowed down and restricted from using certain roads in the same way that large van and lorries are.\n\nThis would also help to reduce the excess fuel that now needs to be treated as a scarce resource.",
