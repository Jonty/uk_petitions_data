        "action": "build a tidal barrage across the Strait of Dover, separating the tidal levels of the English Channel and the North Sea. The main purpose would be to generate clean electricity.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Like the Channel Tunnel and Concorde this would be a prestige Anglo / French engineering project.\nIt has been mentioned on a recent television news bulletin that a tidal barrage across the River Severn Estuary would generate the same amount of electricity as that produced by two nuclear / atomic power stations. A tidal barrage separating the tidal levels of the English Channel and the North Sea would provide a very large percentage of the electricity needs of Britain & France.\nIt is just the type of project that Isambard Kingdom BRUNEL (1806-1859) would have masterminded had he been alive today.\nThere would be locks to allow shipping to pass through. The long needed Anglo / French fixed road link could be built on it and wind turbines could be fixed along the whole length of the barrage.",
