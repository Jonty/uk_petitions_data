            "background": "The royal family and their hangers-on are a constant financial drain on our society. They contribute nothing positive to the country that could not be done by a democratically elected head of state, at a fraction of the cost. I urge you to initiate laws to seize 'their' assets and to remove them from their positions in society. Think of the good uses that the money saved could be put to. They are an anachronism and action is long over-due.",
