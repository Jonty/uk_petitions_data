        "background": "Prior to the opening of the extension of the M1 link to the A1 south of Leeds traffic joining the M1 from the M62 encountered fairly few hold-ups.Likewise traffic on the M1 south flowed reasonably freely however since the M1/A1 link was opened the M1 at Junction 42 is unable to cope with the amount of traffic especially in the evening rush hours. By adding an additional two lanes southbound at Junction 42 tailing off to one at Junction 41 and then reducing back to the standard lanes at Junction 40 the problem would be solved",
