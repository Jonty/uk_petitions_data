In 2008, we whould be leaving behind all vestigages of beleief in the supernatural, and concentrate only on what we know to be fact. By siging this petition, you will agree that the time has come for god (all of them) to be abandoned, and let us concentrate our efforts to a future based soley on fact, science and above all, reason.",
