            "background": "By making all UK clothing sizes the same, it would help the general consumer market in buying essential clothing and conforming to the UK average size 16. This would ease the pressure on young adults regarding their body image and the links with so many cases of eating disorders throughout the country. We've all been in a shop where a size 12 is a size 8 and a large is actually a size small. This has been implemented in other countries and the United Kindom would do well to follow.",
