        "action": "call on the Arts Council to delay the implementation of their investment strategy for a period of six weeks to ensure that there is sufficient time for organisations that are having their funding withdrawn or reduced to be properly consulted on the decision, prepare an adequate and detailed defence of their organisation, and plan properly for a secure financial future.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Arts Council England announced on 1 February 2008 that 212 of its regularly funded organisations would face cuts to their grants. This followed a six week consultation period that included the Christmas period, that took place before their new Chief Executive was in place, and during which the McMaster Review was published by the Government changing the criteria for public investment in the arts. We are calling for a delay in the implementation of this decision so that organisations can prepare an adequate case to defend against these cuts. The new funding is not due to start until the beginning of the financial year so there is time for an extension in the appeal process.",
