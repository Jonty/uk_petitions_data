            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "To help the elderly who have worked hard and have a modest income from pensions, it is proposed that any income from a pension should be tax free up to the sum of \u00a325,000 per annum.\nAny pension income above this level would remain liable for tax at the normal rates. \nThis would help alleviate the finanicial burden on those people who have worked to gain benefit from a company pension scheme or have invested in their own retirement funds. \nSetting a maximum limit on the sum which is free of taxation will help ensure that those on a modest income from pensions are helped  in a proportionally greater manner than those who have a sizeable income (eg former senior politicians)",
