        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Sir Fred Goodwin was over remunerated for leading one of our principal financial institutions to near destruction.  The idea that at the age of 50 he should walk away from his disasterous period of management with a \u00a316m pension fund is fundamentally wrong.  The officers of the company who awarded this to him should also be investigated.  In China Fred Goodwin would be likely to be shot and whilst we do not act in this manner the enormity of his mismanagement when translated down to its impact on individuals and families lives and the future of the country as a whole must be considered as criminal.",
