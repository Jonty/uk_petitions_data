When someone puts themself forward as an MP,they are well aware that Parliament is based in London, and if elected will have to spend a proportion of the working week in London.Why should they be paid extra just for turning up at work. They have chosen a vocation that is meant to serve the general public, and as such they should do the job for the salary that goes with it, and not get a penny more. They should also be disqualified from taking Directorships and second jobs that also currently boosts the income of MP`s.",
