            "background": "For many years, posting any parcel to the Highlands of Scotland has been met with higher delivery charges. When queried, the usual response is that delivery to one of the Islands could cause further charges. For the people on the mainland Highlands, especially the Inverness area, this has caused much frustration. Most couriers will automatically charge more for an IV (Inverness) postcode even though there are no bridges, tolls or ferries for the couriers to take to get to Inverness. This must be reviewed now to bring the Highlands closer to the rest of the Scotland and boost its Economy.",
