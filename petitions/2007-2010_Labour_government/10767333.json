            "background": "I really want to end child slavery for good!!! There are 218 million working children aged between five and 17 in 2006!!! 74 million children under 15 are in hazardous work and should be immediately withdrawn from this work!\n8.4 million Children are in slavery, trafficking, debt bondage and other forms of forced labour, forced recruitment for armed conflict, prostitution, pornography and other illicit activities. Girls are particularly in demand for domestic work! Around 70 per cent of child workers carry out unpaid work for their families. Many children in Asia are kidnapped or otherwise trapped in servitude, where they work in factories and workshops for no pay and receive constant beatings.  \n\nMost boys and girls are lucky.  They live with their mothers and fathers and their brothers and sisters.  They go to school.  They have time to play.\nMany other boys and girls are not so lucky.\nFarms in order to harvest the beans, from which chocolate is made, under inhumane conditions and extreme abuse. There is a surprising association between chocolate and child labor in the Cote d'Ivoire. Young boys whose ages range from 12 to 16 have been sold into slave labor and are forced to work in cocoa",
