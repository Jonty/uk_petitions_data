            "background": "We believe that Blackpool Football Club and England legend, Jimmy Armfield OBE should be knighted for his services to football, with working alongside the FA also. \n\nPlaying over 500 games for The Seasiders, Armfield was a one club man, and his managerial career saw him take over at Bolton and Leeds, with the latter guided to the European Cup final in 1975 under Armfield. \n\nIn addition to this, his work for The Palatine County of Lancashire (Deputy Lieutenant of Lancs in 2004, High Sheriff of Lancs 2005-06) and of course charity cannot go unnoticed.\n\nAn active member at his local church where he was organist for over 30 years, he was selected as a Lay Cannon for Blackburn Cathedral in 2001.\n\nIn recent times, \"Sir\" Jimmy - as he is affectionately known in Blackpool - has delighted us all with his summarising on BBC Radio 5live, being one of the most respected and recognised voices in the BBC's football coverage on radio. After battling against a serious illness, a knighthood for his achievements in the great mans lifetime is only fitting.",
