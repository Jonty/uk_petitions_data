        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Currently there are very few areas for youths to skate in Reading and the surrounding areas. Most of which are run down, vandalised and open to bad weather. The Reading area needs a skate park that is large enough and well maintained so that youths are not skating on the streets and in areas where they are causing trouble and damage to property. Reading is a very suitable place to have an indoor skate park because it is very much in the center of Berkshire and it would be totally unique to Reading and surrounding areas within the south.",
