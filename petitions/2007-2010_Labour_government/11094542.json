We are all too aware that the three concerned have failed to show any remorse for their actions either while on remand or during their trials. Yet the maximum sentence is 14 years, of which part has already been served while on remand and no doubt whatever sentence is given will be reduced for good behaviour. This is not justice. The crimes visited on this little boy were despicable and the sentence should accurately reflect their actions. It is clear under current sentencing guidelines justice will not be done.",
