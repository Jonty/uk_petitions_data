        "background": "At 6 years old, children be taught the basic anatomy of both the male and female form, and the function of the sex organs. At 9 years old, the basics of sexual intercourse should be covered, including an introduction to puberty. At 12 years old, detailed information on puberty- again, both male and female- including giving average penis/breast size, shape etc to put child at ease and relieve curiosity. Give information on risks of STI's, pregnancies, contraception, homosexuality etc. Show detailed pictures (not illustrations) of the male and female form. At 15, be taught the sexual positions, information on vaginal, anal and oral sex, the existance of sex toys etc. Children will be less likely to resort to pornography to \"learn about sex\" and will be better learned and prepared for when they do decide to lose their virginity.",
