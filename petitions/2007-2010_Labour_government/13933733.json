        "background": "I was employed by _Probation Service as a main grade Probation Officer for some years. Vicious, continual harassment and discrimination by managers against me kicked in following the installation of a new chief officer in about 2001.  I was eventually offered an out of court monetary settlement in 2007 which I refused.  The complete lack of support from my then union (NAPO,) the EHRC, government ministers and departments coupled with the severe mental ill health I then suffered has meant that it is only in the last year that I have had sufficient 'energy' to think about overturning this complete miscarriage of justice.  I find that I am now 'out of time.'  These time limits should be removed.",
