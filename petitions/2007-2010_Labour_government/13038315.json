        "background": "The National Curriculum levels, as used by a great many schools at present, are shambolic. There is no consistency in marking work, they are incomparable between subjects, and are extremely confusing to students and parents.. The PM should replace this with the sensible levels used in GCSEs (A, B etc), as they provide an easy reference to the achievement of students.",
