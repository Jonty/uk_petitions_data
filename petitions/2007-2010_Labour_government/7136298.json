            "background": "Modern professional footballers receive very large salaries and in my opinion, many fail to recognise their status as role models for the young.  Children who witness their contempt for authority and blatant cheating believe that this is acceptable and as a result emulate such behaviour in the class-room  and so on.  For these reasons, I believe that footballers should (i) have salary caps, (ii) be made to play a more active, positive role in their local communities, and (iii) recieve harsher fines for misconduct/contempt during matches.  Wouldn't this be a cost-free method of addressing the apparent increase in social discord amongst the youth?",
