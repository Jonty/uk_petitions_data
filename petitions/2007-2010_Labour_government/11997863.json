The cost of insurance for a first time driver is very high. \n\nInsurance companies are charging way too much for insurance and getting away with it.\n\nA new car is costing young drivers too much which is not giving them the chance to buy new cars.\n\nSo please put a limit on car insurance so that your average young person can afford to run a car.",
