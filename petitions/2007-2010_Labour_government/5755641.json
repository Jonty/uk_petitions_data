        "background": "The Government plans to build an extra 250,000 houses by 2016, above the 200,000 a year already planned.\n\nEach new development results in irreversble loss of open space (official or unofficial), wildlife, turns villages into high density towns, increases urban stress, overloads local schools, roads, hospitals, water and food supplies, and over-burdens limited fuel supplies.\n\nNet immigration in 2005 was 292,000.  Government projections show net immigration adding 6 million to the UK population between 2004 and 2031.  All these people will need housing.\n\nIt makes no sense to destroy historic towns and villages, and worsen over-crowding to provide housing for people who currently have no connection with the UK.  A simpler, cheaper and more rational solution exists.",
