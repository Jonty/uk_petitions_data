            "background": "Recently, a teacher was reported to the police for 'inappropriate behaviour', with young men aged seventeen.\nThis is a serious 'Breach of Trust',as sited in the 'Act of 2003'. The young men were more concerned about not getting their teacher into trouble, than realising the 'serious nature' of the offence.\nSo they lied, and have twisted their stories in order to get the person who reported the inappropriate behaviour into trouble.\n\nConsequently the case was handed over to the school, by the police.\n\nHereafter the 'judge and jury' are in fact the school.\n\nThe questions/documentation to be put to the Governors are decided by an 'Investigating Officer' chosen..by the school.\n\nThe documents to be given to the 'Governors' are picked by fellow teachers and so are the questions, selected by a member/s of staff.\n\nWHERE is the impartiality in the process?\n\nWith this example in mind, and to avoid 'Kangaroo Courts' for other innocent people, then it is suggested that there is always an 'Independent Body' to adjudicate, in the interests of justice.\nIt would also restore the faith in the system, which is most certainly NOT playing on a 'level playing field', that is a fact.",
