            "background": "Not so long ago, if Social services suspected that a child was at risk, Parents/Guardians were obliged to co-operate with Social workers & allow full access to the home & the child/children. If Parents/Guardians were unco-operative in this respect, then the state powers were swiftly mobilised and Social services access was enforced. Back then, the childs right to live a life free of cruelty, torture & violent death superceded any parental rights. And so it should be. The child's right to full protection should be enshrined in the UK Human Rights statute & should unequivocally supercede any adult/parental rights. Child abusers/Paedophiles/Child killers, by their vile actions rob innocent helpless children of all their rights to life and for that reason they should forfeit their own entitlement to protection under the UK Human Rights Statutes. Protect children please, not their abusers.",
