        "action": "Start a nationwide health promotion campaign to raise patient awareness of the proper use of antibiotics in order to combat antibiotic resistance.",

        "background": "MRSA and other resistant infections are on the increase here in the UK. Unclean hospitals and negligence in personal hygiene by staff have contributed to this significant increase but one of the main factors of antibiotic resistance is caused by the incorrect use of antibiotics whether incomplete dosage as a result of patient negligence or its overuse when doctors over prescribe the drug. Improper use of antibiotics  plays a key role in reducing the efficacy and effectiveness of the drug.\n\nThe public petitions committee in the Scottish parliament are currently reviewing my petition in Scotland. I believe the Prime minister should promote a nationwide campaign through televised ads to the public in which they are made fully aware of the dangers concerning the improper use of antibiotics.Televised ads help to spread the message across to a wider audience and help to influence people\u2019s minds much more effectively than simply paper pamphlets and posters.",
