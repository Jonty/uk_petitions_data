        "background": "The quality of driving on Britains roads is the poorest it has ever been. This can be attributed to substandard teaching by some (not all) driving schools and practical driving tests not completely addressing common maneuvers such as overtaking and ignoring general road courteousness. Common sense such as the use of indicators is becoming rare. The Government should take steps to address the root of the problem - the teaching and examination of new drivers.",
