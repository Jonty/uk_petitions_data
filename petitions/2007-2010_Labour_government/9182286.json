            "background": "The continuing international Olympic torch relay for the Beijing Olympics has been an embarrassment to all concerned. It has brought fear and aggression to the streets of peaceful democracies. The Olympic torch is said to symbolise peace and unity but this cannot be the case when it is surrounded by dozens of police and security officers and hundreds of protesters. \n\nThe government should learn from this fiasco and abandon plans for a 2012 relay.",
