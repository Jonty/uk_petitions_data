A voting system could be set up to do this. Despite\nwhat the Government says, it is possible!\n \nI want to see Government Ministers held accountable for not\nconsulting with their Constituents before any vote, and for not\nputting their Constituents views before Party Politics. \n \nI want to see all Whips sacked! I want every vote in\nParliament to be a Free Vote, so that they views of\nConstituents will be delivered!\n \nIt is about time Governments worked for the people!\n \nWe need to be able to hold Government Ministers, and Local\nGovernment Ministers, to account.\n \nIf you want to, just copy this and send it to your MP. You are\nfree to do so if you want.",
