        "background": "The Statutory Off-Road Notification which is part of the Continuous Vehicle Licensing Scheme is a good idea and provides a clear indication that a vehicle should not be on the road, but it contains a basic flaw in that it has to be renewed annually.  If you keep more than one vehicle off-road, each has to have an individual renewal, on different dates, and a penalty to be paid if you forget.\n  \nThere is NO valid reason for SORN to need renewing, once the vehicle is delcared off-road, it continues to be so unless or until it is re-licensed for road use.  Annual renewal is a waste of everyone's time and an excuse to extort extra money in the event that it gets overlooked.",
