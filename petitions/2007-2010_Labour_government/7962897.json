            "background": "It has always been a basic principle that anybody who arrives into the country with an existing illness CANNOT receive medical treatment within the NHS without paying for it.  This American citizen - invited into the country by the government - described himself as very sick on his arrival into the country - \"because I could not get healthcare in America, because I have no insurance\" (his words in the interview) was given NHS treatment without being charged for it.  Those hospital or government officials who authorised this illegal medical treatment need to, first, explain why a guest of the government was exempt from our rules and, secondly, be ordered to refund the public purse the FULL and extended costs of the medical treatment proferred at taxpayers expense.",
