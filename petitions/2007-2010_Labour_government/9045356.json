As well as being among Britain's most important pike fisheries, which have produced some of the largest wild pike ever landed, the Upper Thurne and its broads are an internationally-important refuge for over-wintering wildfowl.\nThe villages of Potter Heigham, Waxham, Eccles, Sea Palling, Horsey and Hickling will also be lost, along with thousands of acres of farmland should defences be abandoned.\nFunding should be made available as a matter of urgency to save them.",
