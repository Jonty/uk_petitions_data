        "background": "It is riduclous to consider that NHS treatment over a weekend or of an evening should be considered an emergency.\n\nOver the many many years private sectors have adapted on demand to the nation's needs as it grows and adapts itself. One basic adaptation taken by most firms now is to accept that we as a nation are no longer a 1 person working family, of 9am to 5pm.\nWe have long since grown out of this, and are a fully operational 24hour country.\nAs such our government needs to adjust it's position to reflect this also, and not just in the health sector but in all sectors.\n\nThe bottom line is that; I should be able to access public services when I as a member of the public am able to do so without detriment to my working day. I should not have to cost my employer money, or lose money myself just to take time out to access something I pay for.\nThat statement alone surely underlines the oxymoron that is the current state of our public services.",
