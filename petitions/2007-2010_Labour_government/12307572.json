        "background": "Games, such as software from The Sims and Spore series, have hidden software which is installed when the game is loaded into a computer. This is not removed when the game is uninstalled.\n\nSpecifically, SecuROM, has no mention of it's exsistence in the documentation.\n\nGames from late 2008, including The Sims 2: Apartment Life and Spore, contain the hidden SecuROM and installs it into a hidden folder in the Application Data directory.\n\nIn addition to that, DRM is contained in the software, which only allows the game to be installed a maximum of 3-5 times. Effectively then, the consumer is only 'renting the game' as it becomes un-usable.",
