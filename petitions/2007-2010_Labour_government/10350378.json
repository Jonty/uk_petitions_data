            "background": "Myself and a number of friends and colleagues are disgusted that former Prime Minister Baronness Thatcher is to be given a state funeral, we feel that during her premiership her policies did a huge amount of damage to the heart and sole of this country. Her virtual destruction of the unions took away the voice of the working classes, her privatisation of public services and utilities created a 'haves and have nots' system, those who already have money bought shares in these ventures and became wealthy while the people who didn't have the money to invest but relied on these facilities suffered a decline in the service they recieved. she destroyed the manufacturing industry and the country now relies on the financial services market to stay afloat, i'm not sure if Mr Brown is fully aware just how many people dislike Mrs Thatcher and how many of them will make the journey to protest if she is given a state funeral.",
