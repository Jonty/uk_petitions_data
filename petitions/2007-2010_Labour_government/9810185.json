        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Many of us have trouble paying council tax but those genuinely unable to pay are being penalised by being taken to court and treated like criminals. Councils can charge any amount they like for a negotiation fee and most people who can't pay council tax don't have this fee to pay which restricts their options even further leaving perfectly decent people worse off as well as treating law-abiding people like they are criminals. Not having enough money is not a crime so councils should not be able to treat it as such.",
