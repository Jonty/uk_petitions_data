            "background": "I have previously petitioned on this subject, but felt I made too many points and my main point was lost.\n\nMy apologiies and thanks to: \nAlan Rigby\nRobin Dixon\nAdrian Godfrey\nwho all kindly signed my previous petition.\n\nMay I say firstly there is a great petition set up by Chris Dryden re:'Taxing per family rather than per individual',I agree with this wholeheartedly.\n\nMy petition/request to the chancellor is for 'Joint Tax Allowance.' \nI gave up work 6 years ago to care for our growing family full time. I TOTALLY AGREE with all those who said, that was 'my/our choice' and we shouldn't expect any futher help finacially - fair point.\n\nMy petition is actually regarding 'my tax allowance' I want to ask the chancellor to consider joining 'our tax allownace' as a family unit.\n\nIt seems unfair to penalise a single income family by taxing them 40% after they earn \u00a333.000 yet a family where two are earning can earn \u00a366.000 and still be taxed on the lower rate of 22% - please consider my request to add my tax allowance to my husbands tax allownace - please!\n\nThank you in advance for your support.\nVera Hull",
