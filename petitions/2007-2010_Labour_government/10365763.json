        "background": "As Internet service providers won\u2019t or can\u2019t install the necessary equipment to provide the figures they quote in their adverts it is grossly unfair to the majority or users to pay for something that to all intents and purposes is an unreal figure. To the average user it feels as though they are being defrauded, as what they pay for is never going to be a reality.",
