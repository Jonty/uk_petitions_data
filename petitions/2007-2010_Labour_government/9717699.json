            "background": "The Proper UK people want all the immigrants to go back home with their families and the government to stop letting people into this country. We want no more houses to be built. Our heritage to be restored. We want our countryside to be rebuilt and we want a proper public transport system to be built, so we can save on the costs of fuel. \nWe want all people to learn English as there 1st language and understand we are British that means the queens English and nothing else. If people want to speak any other language then they should reside in their own country. This is Britain, the home of the Queen, fish and chips and the great British bull dog. We have amazing British history. I don\u2019t want my children or grandchildren to learn that Britain is the home of Curry. That is Indian, you go to Indian for that! \nWe do not want to hear that we are a laughing stock amongst the commonwealth, as one NZ paper described us. \nMake us British again! \n\nGet rid of immigrants \nReduce population\nGet rid of housing and restore beautiful old housing.\nGive us great public transport \nGet rid of these stupid tax on taxes\nPut proper British people 1st and not the invaders!!!!",
