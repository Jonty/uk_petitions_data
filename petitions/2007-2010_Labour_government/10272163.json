            "background": "The CRB, an agency of the Home Office, was set up to vet those working with children or vulnerable people. It carries out checks on criminal convictions, cautions and reprimands, while an enhanced check also examines any other \u201crelevant and proportionate\u201d information held by local police forces. \nThe CRB agency is plagued by delays and mistakes which are jeopardising its efficiency. It is the latest Government agency to face questions over its handling of sensitive personal data.\nMore than 50,000 people requiring detailed \"enhanced checks\" because they work unsupervised with children had to wait more than two months for their applications to be processed.\nCRB forms are now so complicated that 240,000 applications are wrongly filled in by organisations confused by the forms.\nThe system is so inflexible that thousands of people are being forced to have multiple CRB checks for different jobs because the checks are currently not transferable from one to another.\nThe agency's 450 staff took a total of more than 5,000 days off sick last year - the equivalent of more than two working weeks per person.",
