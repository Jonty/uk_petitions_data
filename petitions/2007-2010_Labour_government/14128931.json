            "background": "The tax year should reflect the calendar year, as in most of the rest of the world. The change from Julian to Gregorian calendars was not handled parlicularly well. High time to put it right.\nThe UK should fall in line with the EU regarding time allowed in the UK before tax is imposed - ie 180 days, and not the current (and imprecise \"guideline\" of) 90 days. Encouraging high earners to avoid the UK can only result in investment by them overseas instead of in the UK. This is extremely short-sighted on the part of the government.\nAt the very least, taxation imposed on those who spend too many days in the UK should be graduated and not be a simple question of yes you pay 100% or no, you pay nothing.",
