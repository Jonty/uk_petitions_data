        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Victor Obinna was denied a work permit by the Home Office to be loaned to Everton in September 2008, but despite this he has played 12 times for his country, (Nigeria) scoring 4 times. To gain a work permit you must be 'an exceptional talent'. He also plays for Inter Milan who are one of the biggest clubs in world football, so he has to be an 'exceptional talent'. Also, one of the main reasons for this petition is because Manchester United recently recieved work permits for 'Manucho' (who has only been capped 15 times for his country Angola) and 'Tosic' (who has only been capped 12 times by his country Serbia).",
