This continues long after the event and must be curtailed.  An amendment to current legislation is required in order to ensure that, within 14 days of award of bankruptcy, all such agencies are notified of the borrower's bankrupt status by the prime lender(s), who is/are statutorily notified by the Accountant in Bankruptcy. These agencies must be required to cease and desist their pernicious, harmful and trauma-inducing activities forthwith and end this prevalent culture of propagating states of fear and alarm.",
