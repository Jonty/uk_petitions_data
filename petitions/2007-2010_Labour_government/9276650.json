            "background": "Four ladies sharing their house together and having sex with lots of men on a daily basis is not a crime. But the same scene becomes a crime when the ladies take payment for it. This is a silly crime and a waste of police resources. Prostitutes who don't want to solicit the streets, and who want to work in their own homes, are breaking the brothel laws if there\u2019s more than one, (a brothel is 2 or more workers) yet if said 4 prostitutes work alone in 4 separate homes (one in each) this is legal, but there\u2019s no witnesses if they get murdered. They should be allowed to work together in small groups for safety. Not big noisy brothels with dozens of workers. Small discreet brothels; say, 2 workers in 2 bed flats, 3 workers in 3 bed houses, a maximum of 4 workers in 4 bed houses. In a location that doesn\u2019t cause nuisance, like a rural area or a commercial area with no immediate neighbours. Remember, prostitution is a taxable trade. Taxpayers must be allowed to ply their trade in safety.",
