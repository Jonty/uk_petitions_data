            "background": "The competition for training posts for junior doctors is ridiculous thanks to the House of Lords. I feel it is only fair that doctors who have spent 4-6 years and a lot of money training in our medical schools should have preference to training posts in the UK. I bet in other countries they have similar measures. This shows how the House of Lords knows nothing about the medical profession. I think their decision was wrong and misguided.",
