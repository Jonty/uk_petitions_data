            "background": "It seems that the majority of Eastbourne taxpayers' Council Tax goes to East Sussex County Council whereas we only see competence from the Borough Council workers.\n\nRoads and street lighting are not maintained properly with stumps of street lights left unreplaced for years at a time and vegetation not trimmed back from the pavements and cycle tracks. It just seems that we are wasting the vast majority of our tax on a do-nothing council. One which has ignored our transportation wishes constantly.\n\nShould Eastbourne become a Unitary Authority, we should be allowed to start off with a proportionate amount of the ESCC coffers.\n\nAn Elected Mayor is also needed to stop the political in-fighting from a see-saw council, spending more money on what they think the last administration did wrong.",
