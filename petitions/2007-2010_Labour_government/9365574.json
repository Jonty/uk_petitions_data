I calculated that each time we fill up would be a saving of approximately \u00a3120, which would be 3 times less than before.\nI told the kids that its for polar bears, they need to be given a chance to survive..\nI'm employed, full time, as the world is becoming a smaller place for business, there are other industries, like haulage that require special treatment. More really needs to be invested now to help the haulage business. The UK could really profit in this sector with advanced hybrid technology, and the British government should do more for eco-change.",
