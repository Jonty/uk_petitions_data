        "background": "The Chinnor cement works chimney is a local Chilterns landmark equal to the nearby Whiteleaf Cross or the West Wycombe hilltop mausoleum. It is part of our industrial landscape as well as a welcome sight on your way home and a reminder of our local heritage. One of the earlier brick kilns is already preserved on the site, for this we have a previous generation to thank. In a few years' time it will surely appear short-sighted for us to have allowed the demolition of the existing chimney. It is currently planned to take down the chimney and develop the site for housing and business use, the rest of the cement works has already been largely demolished.",
