            "background": "We the undersigned petition HM Government to ensure that the new eco-towns contain carfree neighbourhoods, following successful examples elsewhere in Europe, such as Vauban in Freiburg.  We believe that large-scale carfree developments offer a greener, healthier, safer and more sociable environment. In the absence of cars, these areas can offer more green spaces and streets where children can play, whilst people of all ages may socialise with their neighbours and walk and cycle in safety.  We, and many others, would be very interested in moving to such neighbourhoods if they become a reality.",
