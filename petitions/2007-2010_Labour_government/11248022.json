The DVLA was proven to be wrong and revised down from 38% to 6%. \n\nACPO also stated that \u201cThere is a need for radical thinking in respect to motorcycles, including consideration of engine capability and the creation of protection zones where all motorcycles other than those specifically permitted would be prohibited\u201d. \n\nNot only are they just ramblings of the uneducated but outright lies. If this was perpetrated within a court room the witness would be committing perjury and prosecuted. \n\nSuch comments are inaccurate, derogatory and irrelevant and as such those promoting and furthermore publishing these lies should be prosecuted and be stripped of office.",
