            "background": "Drug companies supply drugs to the NHS to treat all types of ailments in return for massive profits... every year these profits seem to increase, while the NHS struggles to balance its books. I see 2 (maybe 3) core functions of the NHS:- 1.diagnosis and 2.treatment (possibly 3.prevention); I propose that firms profiting from the sale of drugs to the NHS could fund or partially fund the cost of diagnosis i.e. \"diagnostic kits\" could be supplied free at the point of use by drug companies; if a diagnostic test is positive then the company supplying the \"diagnostic kit\" should then supply the treatment and therefore profit from the sale of its drugs. This methodology would also promote distribution of new knowledge to doctors/nurses at the front-end, as drug companies would have a vested interest in promoting their \"diagnosis kits\".",
