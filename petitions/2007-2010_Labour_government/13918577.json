            "background": "Currently, ANY child born to a British parent can obtain British citizenship -- EXCEPT those born prior to July 1, 2006 to an unmarried British father.  \n\nThat date was for reasons of any possible problems with nationality conflicts. However, now they are allowing all other children of British parents to register their births without problems or concerns to how it would affect their children's nationality status.  The government has consistently changed the law to allow registration for all children born to a British parent and admits that registration removes the problem of nationality conflicts.   \n\nThe government admits this is discrimination, yet refuses to find a solution to right this historical wrong. \n\nWe feel it is time for the government to alter its policy and remove the July 1, 2006 cut-off date.  They should allow ALL children born to a British parent, regardless of age or the parent's marital status, to obtain British citizenship.  \n\nThis is clearly a human rights issue as they are singling out just one group of children.",
