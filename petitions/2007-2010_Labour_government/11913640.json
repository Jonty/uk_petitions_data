            "background": "As you know Prime Minister there are more than 40 pub closures a week in Gt Britain. As this is our livelihood my husband and I ask you to please look at how difficult and costly new government legislation has made it for Publicans these days. We do NOT support binge drinking/cheap drink promotions but DO support a great British tradition that brings all kinds of people together. The credit crunch has made life even more difficult for us so we ask you to throw us a lifeline - we want to keep this tradition alive, we don't want to be another statistic.",
