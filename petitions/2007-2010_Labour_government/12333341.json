            "background": "Penalty points for speeding should be given according to how much the person is exceeding the speed limit by. I propose a simple calculation; 1 point per 10% of excess speed.\n\nPeople accidentally speeding a little will get a slap on the wrist (1 point); serious speeders will get more than they currently do. For example:\n\n34 in a 30 zone : 1 point\n\n60 in a 30 zone : 10 points\n\n80 in a 70 zone : 1 point\n\n150 in a 70 zone : 11 points\n\nSerious offences could result in an immediate ban; unintentional slips nothing more than a warning - unless the person 'slips' repeatedly, of course, in which case the points still build up.",
