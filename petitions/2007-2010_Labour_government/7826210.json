            "background": "It has recently come to my attention that as a gay man I am unable to donate blood. All blood taken by any blood donation service is rigorously tested for diseases like HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis B & C. Therefore it should make no difference if you are a practising Heterosexual person or a practising Homosexual person. Of course we should always look to preventing future donations where the blood is contaminated, but I assure you that as all blood taken is currently tested you are infact sending out the message that the entire gay community is not equal to everybody else. I feel this rule needs to be addressed in Parliament preventing national companies from discriminating on the basis of sexuality. This needs to be changed for the greater equality of the United Kingdom.",
