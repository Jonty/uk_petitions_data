            "background": "Dear Mr Brown\n\nWe are asking you to back this campaign to hold a National 2 Minute silence at 3pm on christmas day to reflect on the extremely hard job that our troops are doing in the current conflict. Whilst millions of us are sat at home on christmas day, enjoying dinner with our families thousands of our troops are on the front line fighting for our country. I personaly have no family serving in the forces but feel so much for the families that have to sit at home on christmas day worrying about a loved one. Thousands of children playing with their presents but not seeing their mums or dads. I am lucky, I will be sat at home christmas day cherishing the time i have with my children and feel by everyone giving just 2 minutes of the day would be an honour for our very brave troops.\nPlease back this campaign\n\nGraeme Forster",
