        "background": "The Human rights act was introduced in 1998 and was \"An Act to give further effect to rights and freedoms guaranteed under the European Convention on Human Rights; to make provision with respect to holders of certain judicial offices who become judges of the European Court of Human Rights; and for connected purposes.\" (Human rights act, long title).\n\nUnfortunately for the British people lawyers and criminals have been exploiting the act as a loophole in the law, as such cases of abusing the system are rife. \nFor ten years ridiculous cases have gone through the courts and have been won by those who have a serious disrespect for the law. \nExamples of this are the schoolboy arsonist allowed back into the classroom because enforcing discipline apparently denied his right to education, the convicted rapist given \u00a34000 compensation because his second appeal was delayed; the burglar given taxpayers' money to sue the man whose house he broke into.",
