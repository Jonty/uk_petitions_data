            "background": "Nursery Schools were built in areas of social deprevation to provide quality early years education for vulnerable children.\nTheir role has grown over the years and they provide inter agency care for children and their famiilies working very hard to ensure that small people get the very best start in life that they possibly can.\nAt a time in our society when we are seeing so many problems caused by anti social behaviour and lack of purpose and respect we should be further investing in these centres of excellence.\nFunding is being squeezed making it now a critical situation as it looks very likely that Nursery schools will close.\nWe the undersigned want the government to invest in our Early Years Education an investment in Early Years Education is an investment in society and our future citizens.\nBuilding firm foundations means our country will have solid well rounded citizens on which we can build an amazing future.\nWe call for investment in quality early years provision not a cut.",
