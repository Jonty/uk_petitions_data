We say \"NO\" to the Southern and Eastern growth arcs to provide more affordable housing in the UK.  Fill the 800,000 empty homes around the country first before you waste more money and ruin peoples' lives in the area.  The area is a nice market town and cannot cope with such growth and the government are not listening to the people.",
