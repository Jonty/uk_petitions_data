        "background": "There are simply too many foreign players in our professional game.\n\nThis ultimately will have a detrimental effect on the national team, a trend that will continue unless we take action NOW. Look at Euro 2008!!\n\nAt present Premiership teams are off loading good home grown talent and replacing them with cheaper foreign imports. This has a knock on effect in the lower leagues whereby the players released from Premiership clubs then move down the league ladder, culminating in lower league players being made redundant.\n\nIn remedy, I propose that Premiership Clubs be limited to  four foreign players in the squad. Championship & League1 clubs to two foreigners and League2 none.",
