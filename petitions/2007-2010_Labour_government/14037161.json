            "background": "The formation of a Welfare State will entail the nationalisation of Coal, Oil, Gas, Water, alternative energy, transport, education, healthcare and banking. The notion that we are living in a welfare state now is the worst joke ever written, seeing as how privitized fat cats are in it for self gain. State control would ensure 100% accountability literally to the public, ensure universal, unconditional provision and form the basis of a fairer, more egalitarian society, both socially and economically. The deranged, right-wing, pro-business view is both backward and idiotic, as it doesn't take Einstein to tell you that corporations are in it for profit, whose best interest it is to financially exploit their customers (and employees) with zero concern for people's welfare *cough* credit crunch *cough*. The deluded idea that competition lowers costs is meaningless next to free state provision funded by higher taxes on the rich. It is rapacious and pathetic to impose profiteering in the welfare sector that ultimately hits the people who can least afford it the hardest. Sign this petition if you support any notion of equality or common justice.",
