            "background": "The Exchange Control Act ran in the UK from 1939-1979.\n\nIn the current economic climate surely one way to control the flows of money across borders should at least identify what money is being transferred.\n\nAccordingly, I do not think that any country can restrict money transfers, but what they can do is to at least enforce a reporting system. All assets with any value must be notified to a central authority, with all governments having access to the information.\n\nThis should include all tax havens, which may or not be used for tax avoidance, and evasion. With open borders it may be difficult to enforce but it is necessary to ensure that there is strict control to prevent frauds, and also money laundering.\n\nThis should be discussed at the G20 meeting which is soon to be held in London, a place where I believe some of the misuse of free movement of assets occurs. We must get our own house in order, this could be the start, and would conform with the PMs request that there must be more regulation.",
