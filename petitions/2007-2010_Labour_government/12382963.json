            "background": "The Government has confirmed in their response to the \u201cSaveshortwave\u201d petition that \u201cPower Line Technology (PLT) equipment is required to meet the relevant regulations.\u201d\nThe relevant regulations are the Electromagnetic Compatibility Regulations 2006 (the Regulations)\nfor which BERR is responsible.\n\nIndependent testing to date has shown that PLT devices do not and cannot meet the requirements of the Regulations. Furthermore, continuing numbers of complaints of harmful radio interference from PLT devices amply illustrate that in practical applications they do not meet the \u201cEssential Requirements\u201d of the Regulations and prevent other equipment from functioning as intended.\n\nIrrespective of and notwithstanding the number of recorded complaints of interference, we call on BERR to comply with the law, namely the provisions of the Regulations which are based on a European Directive, and to expeditiously remove this menace from the market by the means as set out above.",
