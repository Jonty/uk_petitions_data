We, the undersigned, throw our full weight behind any attempts to make this dream a reality. \n\nPreferably, we should be able to grasp TPMs and play with them at whim, or just leave them floating serenely around our heads or bellies. \n\nWithout this much-needed funding, many people will continue to suffer from the loneliness and isolation all-too-common in the modern world. Thank you.",
