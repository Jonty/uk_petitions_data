            "background": "The seven deaths on the M6 motorway in South Cheshire, including all six members of the Statham family from Llandudno, have shocked everyone. The North Wales Weekly News is urging our readers to back our campaign for stronger safety measures. It is now obvious to everyone that something needs to be done about the state of the M6 motorway in this area. At busy times it is almost overwhelmed by the sheer volume of traffic and serious accidents are becoming more and more frequent. The widening of the M6 or the building of an alternative road would, of course, entail massive expenditure and result in protests. But surely the authorities could come up with some improvement? Rolling speed limits like they have on the M25 are one example already suggested by our readers.",
