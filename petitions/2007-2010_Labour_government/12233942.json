            "background": "Since the 1960's our society has murdered 6,000,000 unwanted children in their mother's wombs. This is a modern day holocaust. Unless we speak up for those who cannot speak up for themselves then millions more will die. Women have many rights but they do not have the right to take an unwanted life. There are extreme cases when it is better that the baby die in order that the mother live, but the vast majority of the reasons for abortion are supposed social reasons. In reality it is people's selfishness and rebelliousness. No society is free that murders it's own children in its mother's wombs.",
