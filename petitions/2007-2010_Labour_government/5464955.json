            "background": "I have been driving for 2 years and never had a crash, however, the only times i have been close to crashing, it is down to the poor driving skills of OAPs, or namely people over the age of 70.  Their inability to drive at the speed limit (20 in a 30 zone?!) or their failure to see you at a junction means they should have to retake their test or face a blanket ban from driving.  Just to add insult to injury, i have to pay massive premiums for my car insurance as im under 21 and they get massive discounts because of their so called 'experience'.",
