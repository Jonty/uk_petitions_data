            "background": "Sklemersdale has a population of around 40,000 inhabitants.  The public transport infrastructure is very limited to which the nearest hospital in Southport for immediate medical assistance is inaccessible to many people cutting across various age-ranges.  \n\nA few years ago, the Accident and Emergency Unit at Ormskirk Hospital was closed.  To get to Southport Hospital, it takes 30 minutes by car journey and over an hour by bus, with no direct train links between Skelmersdale, Ormskirk and Southport.  A new Hospital is need to remedy this situation as the present Walk-In Centre is inadequate to handle emergency needs. \n\nPlease sign the petition to support the campaign for a new Accident and Emergency Unit to be built in Skelmersdale.  Thank you.",
