        "background": "In some other countries they use traffic lights which stop cars for a minute or so if they were travelling over the speed limit. \nThis encourages drivers to keep within the speed limit to avoid being stopped, but doesn't breed the bitterness and uncertainty caused by speed cameras. They are especially effective at the entrance to villages or towns.",
