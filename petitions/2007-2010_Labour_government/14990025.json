        "background": "At the moment, this payment is paid in November and December. I think it would be better paid in February when people's winter quarter bills are received.\n\nPlus you hear of pensioners using the Winter Fuel Allowance on Christmas presents, bottles of sherry etc, which isn't the purpose of the money. Then they complain they cannot pay the bills.\n\nI think its a daft idea of paying this allowance before the winter fully sets in.",
