            "background": "I propose that the national anthem for England is changed to Jerusalem.\n\nEngland does not have an official anthem and for most English people pride fills there hearts when this song is played. The English people need to be able to celebrate England\u2019s culture more and as such St. George\u2019s day should be marked with the playing of this anthem and displaying flags. The English people need to have an identity; every country in Britain can claim God Save the Queen as there second anthem but we have just one. As a result this merges the two; therefore we lose our sense of nationality.",
