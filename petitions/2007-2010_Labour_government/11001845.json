            "background": "This petition has been created to discard the basis of skin color from ethnic codes from forms. Skin color has no justification on the grounds of ethnicity (please see definition: ethnicity) and has no relation to performance at the workplace, school or any other area as a matter of fact. For example, what relevance does a person's skin color have to do with a position they are applying for at a workplace? isn't that racist? The very terms \"black\" and \"white\" can be deemed racist themselves and cause divide between people on the basis of pigmentation concentration and not ethnicity. The current coding compares \"Asians\" with \"Black and White\" and \"Chinese\" which is ridiculous since Chinese are Asian. The grounds should be considered on a more logical and stable basis of Continent and/or country or mixtures of both.\n  \nSigning this petition will help put the U.K. back on the \"logic map\" if you wish and take us one step further to banning racism as well. I am not comfortable being judged by my skin color, are you?",
