            "background": "It has been known for over 5000 years that marijuana has medicinal qualities. It was used as a chinese herbal remedy, and was prescribed to Queen Victoria for menstrual cramps. The USA government allowed a vote on whether marijuana should be prescribed for medical reasons, and Proposition 215 passed. Quality of life for patients with cancer, AIDS, movement disorders, MS, asthma, depression, epilepsy and Hepatitis C improved drastically because of the effects of smoking marijuana. Why deny the British public the use of such medicine? Hundreds of thousands of people would benefit from using a natural herb as a remedy rather than filling their bodies with chemicals that they may react to.",
