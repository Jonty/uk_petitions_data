        "action": "Allow the current access Road at London City Airport running parallel to Albert Road E16 to be opened up to the general public so that resident's of Fishguard Way can use this as a safer route to and from the nearest public transport stop being that of King George V DLR station",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "An access road was built (presumably with tax payer's money) at the side of Albert Road when the extension to the DLR was built, resulting in King George V station.  It is a direct and safer route through for the 2,000+ residents who reside in the housing development directly opposite the end of the road to the DLR station and should be opened for our use.  Instead it is gated off and no one uses it for anything so is completely useless as it currently stands.  Instead, residents are forced to walk along Albert Road and either down the main road at the side of the park or via the back roads to get to the DLR station.  The area itself is not nice. It is frightening to walk along here at night especially for, but not exclusively to females.  Some residents have been mugged, had stones and bricks thrown at them by children and had verbal abuse directed at them. The council of Newham and the City Airport authority figures have so far denied us this access route stating that it is a breach of safety for the Airport which is simply not the case as there are many more areas that are open to the public which give the same if not better vantage points for would be criminals or terrorists.",
