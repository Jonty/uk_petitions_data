            "background": "In the media we have seen many cases of Political Correctness going mad. We have also seen healthy safety going mad because people are so scared about getting sued. \n\nThe minister for common sense would be able to intervene in issues that have been bought about by far to much red tape or when over zealous pen pushers who are out of touch with real people try and enforce stupid laws and rules. This minister would also intervene in issues such as the schools where they are teaching them to pass exams, where the NHS is more worried about targets than clean hospitals. As the minister for common sense would step in and sack the useless managers that are running the failing trusts. This would have to be somebody that is fair but is not scared of backlash.\n\nThe candidates that should be put forward are:\nJeremy Clarkson\nBoris Johnson\nJon Gaunt\n\n(If any person, feels I have missed somebody who would be perfect for the job please don't keep it to yourself speak up!)",
