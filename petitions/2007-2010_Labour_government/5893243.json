            "background": "In 1996 my two step children and their friend were killed by a drunk driver on their way home from a football match.  They were 10 and 12, their friend was 18. The drunk driver was also killed along with his two dogs,\nwhat a complete waste of life this fateful night brought all of us for the sake of a few 'swift ones'! If there had been a complete ban on drinking and driving in place at that time those four people would still be here now living along side their loved ones, who would all be without this total longing for them to still be here. We are all still saddened by what we went through immediately after the accident and what we are all still going through today and everyday for the rest of our lives! I would therefore urge to look into yourselves and ask how you would have felt if it was your mother/father/brother/sister/CHILD/CHILDREN that night and then ask you to sign this petition for all the Matt's (aged 12), Lucy's (aged 10) and Ben's (aged 18) that have already been killed and all the one's that still might be if this ban is not brought in! (you are 4x more likely to have an accident having drunk just ONE pint of beer!).",
