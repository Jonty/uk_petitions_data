            "background": "After 5 years of constant pain, trips to the doctor and hospital e.t.c my doctor recommended a visit to a Chiropractor.  Then came the bad news, this was not available on the N.H.S. as I don\u2019t have private medical insurance I found myself paying \u00a335.00 per visit.  At the moment I require weekly visits, the good news is that my problem is fixable, the bad news is that I cannot afford too many more visits, especially not on a weekly basis.  This made me wonder how many more people could be easily fixed, but cannot afford treatment, surely in the long term this would save the N.H.S. money as less visits to the doctors would be required not to mention the prescription painkillers that people wouldn\u2019t need.  Please support my petition to make this treatment available to everyone, not just the rich.",
