        "background": "Approx' 35% of the population still smoke and it is OUR RIGHT to choose whether we smoke or not, behind the wheel.  \nDo we ask for listening to the radio, cassettes, Discs, illegal ? \nPersons changing same whilst driving are probably more likely to create an accident than some-one smoking.  \nPLUS...the claim by one Minister that in order to light a fag you take two hands off the wheel is total nonesense.  One has to ask what the weather is like on his planet !\nIs he going to ban manual gearboxes next ? as you take a hand off the wheel to change gear ?  \nThis Nanny state and rubbish currently being levied against smokers is now becoming absolutely stupid..but that's become just more of what we expect from this government.  What about OUR RIGHTS as SMOKERS ?  We now have less rights than than of immigrants.",
