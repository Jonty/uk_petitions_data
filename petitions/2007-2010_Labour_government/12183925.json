Such diplomatic pressure such as deporting all Israeli diplomats and calling for Interpol to issue arrest warrents for all those connected with illegal action within the Israeli Government.\n\nThe Governmnet should mount all pressure on Israel to live up to its International obligations under Geneva conventions and UN law.\n\nIsrael currently is building 70,000 illegal houses for Israeli's only inside the West Bank in direct violation of Israeli law, International Law and the Road Map to Peace agreement.  While Israel continues to fund such buildings and stand by and do nothing while its citizens enter the West Bank in direct breach of International Law the peace process will be effected.  Everyone and every state has an obligation to respect International Law.",
