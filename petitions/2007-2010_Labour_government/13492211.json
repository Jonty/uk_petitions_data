            "background": "If Vets had animals best interests at heart they would realise that not everyone can afford expensive medications that they prescribe. Drugs are cheaper on the Internet but cannot be obtained without a vet prescription.  Since last  year the government have allowed vets to charge for writing a prescription at a cost of around \u00a310 making it too expensive, so animals go without the best treatment.  Most pensioners and people on low income cannot afford to pay the high prices vets charge.Vets make enough money withour adding this extra cost.",
