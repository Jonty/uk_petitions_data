            "background": "There appears to be an on going policy of this government to adversly effect the majority of the population who save and strive for financial security through their pension.\nMany pension funds and privately owned businesses have invested in commercial property as part of providing a secure retirement.\nWhilst all investments have a commercial risk of increasing or decreasing in value this legislation serves as an additional tax that is only applied to a potentially depreciating asset.\nThe government should encourage investment in pensions and not unfairly tax commercial properties that have been unable to secure tenants.\nThe net result of this recent legislation will again hit peoples pensions. \nIf a commercial property is unoccupied and has no rental income stream the property investment reverses into an outgoing expenditure due to rates charged on an empty building.\nThis charge of rates on empty buildings is unfair and detrimental to investment and industry\nA Government should support industry and not hinder those who invest and strive to provide for themselves.",
