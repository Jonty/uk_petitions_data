            "background": "In the UK currently (and in many other western 'democracies' it should be added also) the overwhelming majority of citizens have the opportunity to vote in a new government on one day every (potentially) 5 years, with little formal power in the interval between elections.\nThis petition calls for fixed term elections, the power of constituents to recall their MP at a time of their choosing and a more balanced electoral system which gives wider choice to voters at the ballot box. It also calls for the inclusion of ordinary citizens in the process of policy formulation, so that the political elite can no longer hide unpopular policies or actions amongst a shroud of 'inquiries,' 'commissions' and 'reports.'",
