        "background": "DEFRA have recently prosecuted Fishermen in both Scotland and Cornwall for landing fish in contravention of their quotas or licences. They have received fines which are not commensurate to the 'crime' when compared to career criminals who seem to get away with very little sanction.\nHowever once the fines have been imposed the authorities have pursued the families stripping assets using the Proceeds of Crime Act. The act is on the statute to strip assets from criminals who have amassed their wealth from criminal acts. Fishermen have amassed what little they have through work in the most harsh of conditions!!!!",
