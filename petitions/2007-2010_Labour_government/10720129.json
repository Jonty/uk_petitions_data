            "background": "Decades ago I discovered a cure for mental health problems and during this time over 35,000 have died needlessly in the UK. \nThe cure has been used on a wide variety of mental health problems. The procedure stuns and resets the brain of the patient, so that the patient returns to a normal condition. The Kadir-Buxton Method is done by making a fist of both hands, and striking both ears of the patient at exactly the same time and pressure with the soft part of the inner hand which is where the thumb joins the hand.\nThe procedure is painless and the patient regains consciousness faster the less hard the double blow is struck. \nIt can also erase bad memories and bad attitudes, which could cut the number of re-offenders in prisons.\nThe patient is asked to remember the trauma as vividly as possible three times, and the stun technique is then used.Once the trauma is eradicated, the patient is cured. A Psychiatrist cannot be found to officially evaluate this invention because it would replace their profession with  Practice Nurses.",
