            "background": "I think when people turn 55 they should have to retake their driving test (theory & practical) to see if they are still able to comply with the laws of the road and are actually able to drive properly and show they are in control of their motor vehicle. I have come across many motorists this year; mainly the older community; and i cant believe how bad their driving is, no indication, they dont abide to speed limits wether it being to fast or to slow! No lane discipline, showing no control etc. I could go on but i bet alot of you understand where i am coming from and have witnessed some of britains unroadworthy seniors. So please help me do something about it today! \n\nThank You Very Much",
