            "background": "To any family a pet is an integral member and to those of us unfortunate enough to have lost pets we know how sad this can be, in particular cats and dogs.  According to current UK law cats and dogs are considered vermin and do not have to be reported to the police, even if wearing an ID collar.  We the undersigned request that this law is changed, pets aren't vermin and if an animal is hit by a car they should at least be forced to report it or face a fine.  There is no way the government will allow this so to any govt wishing to take over, make this legal and you have my vote!!!!  Respect the rights of pets as family members, cats and dogs are not vermin.",
