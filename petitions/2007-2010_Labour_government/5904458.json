            "background": "On Wednesday 18th July,  \n4 muslim cheerleaders of hate jailed for 6 years. Outside was a group of muslims with signs such as \"British Police Go To Hell\", \"British Government Terrorist Government\" etc.. (Now this has nothing to do with the fact they are muslims,but they are stirring up hate)\nIf people of a christian or just british people were to do the same thing, we would be arrested and chucked into vans...but these people are allowed to blatantly incite terrorism? Surely they should be thrown out of the country. \nThis country needs to listen to its own people, (it has nothing to do with racism or religion or colour) But we are sick of our country being treated in this manner, stop them from taking over our country. Get stricter controls on who is let in.. i don't mind normal muslims, but there are a few who are delibrately making a division between \"us\" and \"them\"",
