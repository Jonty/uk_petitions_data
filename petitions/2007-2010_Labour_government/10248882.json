ALL monies with the exception of \u00a321 a week is taken off them to pay towards their care.  This means they have \u00a33.00p per day for all other needs. This includes clothing, footware, and underware to name but a few things.  This is quite disgraceful. Tis allowance should be raised to at least \u00a350 per week.",
