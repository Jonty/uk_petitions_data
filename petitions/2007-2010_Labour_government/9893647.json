            "background": "Everyone focuses on the medias reports on a food 'crisis' etc.  I agree that the fuel price increase has made food go up slightly, but there is no excuse for the big boys 'tesco, morrisons, asda' making more and more money.   Something is up there, I believe that the supermarkets have jumped on the UK's panic of food prices and jacked up the price, this together with their crippling the suppliers and farmers.  There will only be one winner, Mr Tesco, Mr Asda and Mr Morrisons (other supermarkets may apply)",
