            "background": "Plans to build a new \"Super Hospital\" for the Sandwell & West Birmingham Trust area are flawed in every way. The proposed hospital reduces the amount of bed space for major treatment, means greater emergency vehicle travel time in case of emergency, means that local people have to travel further for treatment and is not wanted by a majority of the public and hospital staff. Financial planning has not been carried out properly and staff moral at these hospitals is at its lowest ebb.This hospital will lead to a lowering of standards and an increase in the loss of life through miss treatment.",
