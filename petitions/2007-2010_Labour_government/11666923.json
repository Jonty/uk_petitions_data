Especially in these times make sure companies offer the jobs to British workers above all else. \n\nAlso evaluate foreign workers from EU and the world every six months to determine if their skills are still required here and whether or not there is a need for them to be in that job, especially since we have such high unemployment now too and we have so many in low skilled jobs.\n\nWhat is happening at Lindsey Oil Refinery at North Killingholme, North Lincolnshire is a prime example and is a disgrace, the government needs to act! Protect all our jobs.",
