We have been threatened and have had to endure repeated attempts, and some successful attacks, on our freedom of thought, will, and speech.\n\nI am asking the government to recognise the hurt, anger, and fear caused by those attacks. Which have even involved prominante British Muslims, publicly declaring that British citizens should be killed for practising their right to freedom of speech. And for them to except that they been making wrongfully apologies on our behalf, without our consent. That includes they apology made for the Danish magazine which was practising its right to freedom of the press, which the government that has invaded two Muslim countries called \"irresponsible\" while Danish and other European countries embassies burnt, and their citizens fled Islamic countries!",
