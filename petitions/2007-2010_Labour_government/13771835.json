            "background": "Advertising in the media based on Christmas themes is felt by many people to be appearing earlier each year. Apart from the usual annoyances expressed when such adverts can be seen as early as the middle of October, it can also put pressures on families at uncomfortably earlier times.\n\nThe date chosen would also result in media advertising being more focused on the earlier festival of Halloween and the Bonfire Night celebration - two events which are now increasingly subsumed by Christmas advertising. The delay on advertising would assist in reintroducing variety into the winter season festivities.\n\nThis legislation would in no way impinge on the press's freedom of speech, and should not cause a significant impact on advertising revenues as advertisers can be anticipated to concentrate their Christmas spending within a shorter timeframe.\n\nThe legislation would not seek to define which messages are Christmas themed, as such matters can be address on an ad-hock basis by the existing ASA.",
