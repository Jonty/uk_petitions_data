            "background": "As the law stands now all stillborn babies born before 24 weeks gestation do not have any birth rights. They are not even recognized as being stillborn. As a recently bereaved mother to a baby boy born at 23 weeks and 4 days gestation I feel this is very wrong. I feel all babies and their parents should have the right to have their babys birth recognized by law. So they have the same birth rights as babies born as babies born after 24 weeks gestation.",
