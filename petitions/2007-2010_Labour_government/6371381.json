            "background": "As many are aware, many constituent countries of the united kingdom (the U.K. consists of england, scotland, wales and northern ireland) are getting special privilages. the Scots and the Welsh get free prescriptions and the English foot the bill. so the english pay for others to get life saving drugs, but they can just go die if they can't afford it. the scots get free elderly care, and the english foot the bill, so the it's the same principal but with elderly people. and english students have to pay top up fees, but the scots and the welsh and the northern irish don't! so you're entiteled to an education, unless you're english. i say enough! either everyone in the uk gets the same treatment, or if anyone wants special privilages, they can pay for it themselves by putting thier own taxes up, NOT LEECH OFF OF EVERYONE ELSE!!!!!!!.",
