            "background": "Peers in the House of Lords have recently warned that the Government is \u201cdisturbingly complacent\u201d about operation of Islamic Sharia law in the UK and we the undersigned are unconvinced by the Government\u2019s assurance that application of Sharia law by the Muslim Arbitration Tribunal remains subject to English law. Sharia law is not part of the law of the United Kingdom and the undersigned want the Government to make it clear that they have no intention of making any change to that position, as Sharia law is incompatible with the values and law of this country. We the undersigned ask that the Government provides clear and unequivocal assurance that Sharia law will never be allowed to take precedence over British law, and that individuals who seek to regulate their lives through religious beliefs or cultural traditions that conflict with British law will not have the option to use religious councils or any other system of alternative dispute resolution. Five Islamic courts are thought to be operating in Britain under the 1996 Arbitration Act. They are permitted to rule on business, financial and family disputes.",
