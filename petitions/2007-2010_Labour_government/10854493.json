            "background": "Given recent turmoil in the financial sector was made worse by short selling with or without the spreading of false rumours.  It would be appropiate that those who made profits by causing such turmoil should be subject to very high taxes on their profits.  \n\nThis money would help offset the burdon to the general public.  It would also discourage such speculative short selling in the future.",
