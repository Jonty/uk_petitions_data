        "background": "Pregant NHS staff are able to heavily boost their maternity pay by doing excessive overtime in the weeks and months leading up to taking Maternity leave.  Their Maternity pay is based on their average earnings, including overtime in the months leading up to them taking Maternity Leave.  Surely this is wrong as I know of people who just take all the overtime they can get the hands on to just boost their Maternity pay.  Surely, Maternity Pay should be based on their average earnings over the previous year prior to becoming pregnant so they cannot gain unfairly.",
