I know that people in their own homes are still putting sanitary towels, tampons, pads, in toilets and in black bins. Even in my own home. I would like to see a yellow bag put in every home, especially as if these are burnt, it will not cause toilet blockage and lessen the waste put in rubbish tips.",
