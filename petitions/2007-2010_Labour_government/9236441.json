        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This petition supports an objection to Biofuel being put into ALL petrol on the grounds that it prohibits British citizens the FREEDOM to EXPRESS their CONSCIENCE, because it does not permit any British citizen the Right to express a conscientious objection to the current methods of creating biofuels by NOT buying biofuel-petrol mixtures. This petition further supports the view that denying British citizens the FREEDOM to EXPRESS their CONSCIENCE by removing from them the option to buy petrol that doesn\u2019t contain biofuel is counter to Articles 9 and 10 of the Human Rights Act 1998. The current methods of creating biofuels are objectionable to the conscience on ethical, moral, and in some cases religious grounds where tallow (animal fat) is used. The global benefits of using biofuel in relation to the issue of \u2018global warming\u2019 is highly contentious and still undergoing scientific debate, therefore it is NOT a valid reason for mixing biofuel into 100% of petrol in the UK.",
