        "background": "Currently employers when selecting people for recruitment can ask questions about a person's health, including mental health. They can also insist on that person giving permission for their medical records to be given as condition of employment.\n\nThere is a stigma attached to mental illness over normal illness and an employer is likely to choose someone who has never suffered from a mental illness over someone who has. This is usually regardless of whether the person has been treated or whether it would affect that person's ability to work.\n\nThis is wrong for the following reasons:\n\n1. Sufferers of mental illnesses are unfairly discriminated against. \n\n2. Sufferers of mental illness or people with emotional problems will be encouraged to never seek treatment.\n\nA law should be in place to make it illegal for employers to ask for information about any health issues that a qualified person has determined does not affect their ability to work.",
