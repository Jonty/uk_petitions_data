Encourage more people to stop smoking by freewill. Also, inform the nation that the Government was wrong for forcing old people to stand outside in the cold UK climate to enjoy their cigarettes. It would have been far less hypocritical if, the non smokers were forcefully made to stand outside in the cold since it is medical fact that, they have better better blood circulation than people who choose to smoke and pay tax on cigarettes to have some freedom of enjoyment.",
