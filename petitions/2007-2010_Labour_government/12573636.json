However, there is a way to end this madness. All that is needed is for a single world leader to announce that, \n\n\"The Game is UP!\"\n\nIn a public interview or press conference. That is all we ask, four simple words, no changes in policy, and something that wont cost the tax payer a single penny, yet will bring succour to millions around the world!\n\nWith our regards,\nThe Undersigned",
