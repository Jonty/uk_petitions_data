            "background": "Steve Wright has long been the presenter of 'The Big Show' 2pm-5pm weekdays on BBC Radio 2. He has also long been talking over songs, rudely dismissing listener requests for songs, interviewing guests for far too shorter time, making a hash of 'The Big Quiz' and continually repeating the news ten minutes after the main bulletins.\n\nWithout being offensive to Steve Wright, when Mark Radcliffe and others have filled in, the show has been MUCH more enjoyable.\n\nSteve should be moved to a later time slot and ideally be replaced with Mark Radcliffe and/or Stuart Maconie.",
