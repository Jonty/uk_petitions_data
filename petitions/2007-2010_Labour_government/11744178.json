            "background": "Why do they use glasses and bottles in night clubs, people would stop glassing people and causing serious damage to people if they where to use plastic glasses and not give bottles over the counter.  An innocent young man was glassed in the toilet of a night club and the boy received 17 stitches in his face this wouldnt have happened if plastic glasses where used.  I feel very strongly about this,  and feel that it would be a safer place without glass and bottles",
