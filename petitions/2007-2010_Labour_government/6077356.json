            "background": "I recommend all vehicles over 7.5 tonnes should be able to use the relative bus/taxi lane as a main route to their destination with the exception of overtaking any obstacle, legally/illegally parked in such areas.  The driver must return to the lane at the earliest opportunity.  This would reduce large vehicles obstructing lanes required for those who wish to earn/buy their \"bread\" from those delivering it.  This would be especially helpful in large busy cities such as London, Birmingham, Brighton and Southampton, where, as always, traffic is at its worst as it would free up roads for the general traffic and at the same time ensure HGV vehicles can pass through quickly and as safely as possible.  Equally it would save the general public from buying our bread from one source and our beans from another.",
