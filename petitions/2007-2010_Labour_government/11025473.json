        "background": "We feel that the amount of anti-social behaviour and distress to animals caused by the sale of fireworks in supermarkets and stores will be dramatically reduced by introducing a scheme where a licence is required to purchase fireworks. Licences should be restricted to organisers of official displays only. We also want it to be a criminal offence to discharge fireworks at any time other than the date for which a licence has been awarded. We feel that this would present no problem for genuine users of fireworks and urge the Prime Minister to address this issue and pass legislation to make the streets safer in November.",
