            "background": "Education is an agreed right, not a privilege. Generations past, present and future worked and will work and pay tax for it.\nThe interest rate doubled on student loan last year from the rate of the previous year - this cannot be justified at a time when the rate of increases in public pay is set at 2 - 2.5%: both are supposed to be inflation-linked.\nSome students have the prospect of making monthly repayments until the age of 65, while most students from 2006 will only have to repay for the first 25 years of the loan.\nWhile some may call for a 'writing off' of all loans, this petition seeks to do ONE thing:\nRender all persons with student loans (taken out in any year since their creation - 1992?) liable to a flat, standard, equal, fair and clear loan-repayment-lifetime of 25 years, after which time the remaining debt will be cancelled.\nPlease recognise the will of the signatories and make a positive change in their lives!",
