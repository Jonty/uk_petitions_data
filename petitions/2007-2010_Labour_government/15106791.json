            "background": "The technology exists to build very high speed maglev trains that operate in a partial vacuum tunnels, allowing top speeds of over 3000 mph.\n\nInstead of investing in 30 year old TGV technology, we should build our new transport links with this new technology.\n\nIn practical terms we could build a transport network where travel from London to Edinburgh would take less than 20 minutes. This would be at a cost of approximately 50% more than a traditional TGV, but the social benefit of such a link would be massive. Effectively meaning that if fully implemented, every citizen in the UK could commute to any other part of the UK.",
