            "background": "Bridgewater Way, in Trafford, Greater Manchester is the most direct way from Manchester City Centre to both Manchester United Football Ground and Old Trafford Cricket Ground. It is used extensively by both pedestrians and cyclists but has no provision for them. It's higher speed limit, 40mph makes it more dangerous for both cyclists and pedestrians, the former having to compete for space with cars. Pedestrians have to walk on the central reservation, or need to walk on the wet muddy verges, denuded of grass by heavy use. This route sees thousands of sports fans walking the verges on event days. Provision of a footpath and cycleways in both directions would increase the desirability of foot and cycle access, and improve access for fans to football and cricket events. This would help Trafford Council in achieving it's Local Agenda 21 commitments.",
