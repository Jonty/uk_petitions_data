        "background": "Elderly patients are put at risk from the ineptitude of  Locum Psychiatrists, some elderly people are being misdiagnosed, - passed from one locum to another without due care and attention of the patients needs, -- and given medication that is not needed.\nThe basic rights of the elderly are being taken away, -- some have nowhere to turn, -- they look to the Health Profession for help but unfortunately find all too often that help is not forthcoming, -- and have to fight for what is  rightfully theirs.\nMany elderly people do not have the finances to fight their cases and are subsequently ignored.\nI now implore the Government to investigate the serious malfunction of many Locum Psychiatrists in doing their duty.",
