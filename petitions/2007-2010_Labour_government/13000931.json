            "background": "Please raise minimum wage up to \u00a36.50, you cannot live on \u00a35.85 an hour, it's no wonder there is so much debt, and please lower the age from 22 to 18 for it to be the legal requirement to recieve adult minimum wage. There are plenty of under 22's who have mortgages/rent and bills to pay and it is impossible on the meagre sum they are paid currently.",
