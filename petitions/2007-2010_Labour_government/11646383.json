        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Incredibly there is now a law in place that criminalises those adults who enjoy certain aspects of entirely consensual BDSM pornography in the privacy of their own homes. Our government now has the right to invade our privacy and put us on the sex offendors register merely for possessing what they vaguely term as extreme BDSM pornography. I feel that this is an outrageous and pointless attack on personal sexual liberties....even though personally I'm not even titillated by BDSM. I am simply on the side of adult rights and if you are too please sign this petition.",
