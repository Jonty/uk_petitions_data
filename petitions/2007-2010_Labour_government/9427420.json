        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This body would be funded from several sources, including all UK water companies (i.e. Thames Water), all UK property developers (i.e. Barratt Homes) and contributions from local council taxes in every borough of the UK. This body would stop the confusion over who has responsibility for fixing drain repairs and blockages and would be accessible via a national help line; acting as a one-stop shop for all drain-related problems. The fact that there is not a single organisation that takes full responsibility for the UK\u2019s drains leads to flooding and countless problems across the entire nation and it\u2019s time to address this ever more critical issue. Currently UK residents often face a 'pass-the-buck' fiasco when trying get a drainage problem fixed, with water companies, property developers and such like often claiming that fixing a simple problem is somebody else's problem and not theirs, which wastes the public's time and can in some cases create a serious environmental hazard.",
