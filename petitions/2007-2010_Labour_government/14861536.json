In many cases the judge has access to this digital file after an application for an Appeal has been made, which may show them in a bad light. In this day and age it would be a very simple technical and procedural matter to remove the possibility of tampering with the spoken evidence BEFORE it is sent off to a licensed transcription agent - either by a simultaneous recording to a 'black box' or a copy being made and signed off by all parties at the close of the Hearing.\n\nIn addition, an immediate electronic copy of the file could be distributed to all parties to reduce, at least, any disagreement about the content of an order which is not written and agreed directly afterwards. So saving further costs.",
