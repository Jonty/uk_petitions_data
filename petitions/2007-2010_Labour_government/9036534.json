This is further confused because there is one version of the Koran and two further books of mohammeds life.  There is not a 'moderate' koran and a 'radical' koran (to my knowledge), therefore even reading the koran as a means by which to measure radical/moderate Islam is flawed.\n\nThe government should issue a set of guidelines so the public knows how to identify radical (and therefore a possible troublespot which should be reported) from moderate Islam.",
