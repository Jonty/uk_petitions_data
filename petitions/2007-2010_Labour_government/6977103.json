            "background": "The world is rapidly becoming a more unstable and dangerous place and yet this Government and previous ones fail to increase funding on the Armed Forces.\n\nThe Royal Navy may supposedly be getting 2 new Carriers but at the rate the escorting Frigates and destroyers are being cut from the fleet there won't be any ships available to protect them or our tradelanes. As an Island nation which is reliant on the sea for 90% of it's trade this is sheer folly.\n\nThe Royal Air force, so instrumental in protecting us from invasion during the Second World War has only 4 squadrons of fighters left to protect our airspace and is struggling to find sufficient aircraft to support our troops overseas.\n\nThe Army has had it's fine regiments with their history and traditions amalgamated again and again until no morale remains with the soldiers. They are forced to use sub-standard equipment and vehicles without adequate armour protection for the task in hand. Due to the reduction in size of the Army they are also being sent into the combat zone in insufficient numbers to achieve victory.\n\nPlease Prime Minister, I implore you do not let this sorry state of affairs continue any longer, increase Defence spending now!",
