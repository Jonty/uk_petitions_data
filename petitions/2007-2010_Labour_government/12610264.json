            "background": "The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has granted an arnica homeopathic product a licence for the relief of sprains or bruising. Homeopathy has been shown many times to have no medicinal value, no plausible methodology and is no more than well-marketed quackery, which is responsible for considerable harm and even deaths (see http://whatstheharm.net/homeopathy.html). This is despite the MHRA stating that \"Decisions will be based on good science and robust methodology.  Judgements on safety, quality and performance will be informed by all available, relevant and reliable evidence, with the burden of proof often resting on companies.\"",
