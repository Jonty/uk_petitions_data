Personal information held by companies and local authorities is open to temptation and abuse by any criminal eliment with access to their computers. It also can be used and often is, by any company to gain an advantage by targeting your particular age group with high pressure sales techniques. Giving a date of birth for \"data protection\" or other information, could easily be replaced with a memorable word or password of a persons choice.",
