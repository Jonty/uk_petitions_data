        "background": "Royal mail have announced that they are to close small post offices around Blaenau Gwent including nantyglo, tredegar ebbw vale and abertillery.\nThere are hundreds if not thousands of people who rely on these post offices and would not be able to travel to the nearest post offices that would be left open. The post office always do a consultation period and say that they are letting some of the post offices stay open. They think how many they are going to close down and then they add two or three to the list. But these two or three they have no intention on closing anyway. And when they announce they are keeping these two or three open makes them look good.\nPlease Prime minister stop the post office treating their customers unfairly. we pay a great deal of money to them to provide a proper service. Get behind your local post office and vote for this petition.",
