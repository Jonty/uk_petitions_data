        "background": "The burka discriminates against women.  It is already causing the once-eliminated disease, rickets, to return due to the fact that women wearing this costume do not receive adequate amounts of sun. Also, we do not know who is underneath the burka - it could be a male terrorist.  Finally, it is NOT a religious requirement of the Koran, and is offensive to women - both to those wearing it and those who have to see it.\n\nBritain is a secular country and all citizens should respect this and not force their religion on to others.",
