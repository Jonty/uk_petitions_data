            "background": "Advertising campaigns to stop younger people taking up smoking do not seem to be working. Instead of throwing more money at various compaigns, increase the minimum age for buying cigarettes by one year every year. This way people who cannot legally buy cigarettes will never be able to and those who will not give up can happily continue to buy them.",
