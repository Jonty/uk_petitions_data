A written constitution would mean the setting down of a new bill of rights that establishes our freedoms as individuals and a would be a means to bind our politicians absolutely to maintaining democratic principles. Added to this is a requirement to remake our institutions of government to make them fully accountable to, and under the control of, the people to  ensure we are secure from civil rights abuses by any government or government authority.",
