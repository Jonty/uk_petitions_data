            "background": "I think it is time Prime Minister took action against all the MPs that are robbing us blind by swapping homes almost monthly and then billing taxpayers for refurbishment. How dare MPs charge us for bathplugs,dog food,babies nappies aswell as widescreen TVs washing machines,lawn mower repairs,porn movies etc.If members of the general public did this we would be charged and rightly so.Why then Mr Prime Minister can't MPs be charged too? How can the chancellor bang on about getting tough on tax evaders and benefit cheats when he himself is guilty of defrauding the public purse? As too are many others in all parties. Reprimand them all now ,make them pay all monies back and then an equal amount to charities",
