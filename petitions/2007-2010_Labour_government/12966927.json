        "background": "Businesses in the private sector are carrying the increasing cost of a protected public sector. This government seems to think that the only 'good' employer is themselves! And the rest of us are paying for it. The public sector creates no wealth, and as it increases, the opportunity of the wealth creating private sector diminishes. Because it has no external measure, it has become increasingly bureaurocratic and expensive. If all non essential functions were put out to the private sector, it would run more efficiently and be more accountable. And in the current economic environment, it would create more wealth and help more people out of the recession.",
