Carol Thatcher says something silly in private and gets the sack...is that the end of it well no...Jo Brand took offence at Carol we are told...the same Jo Brand who on the BBC told people to send excrement to members of the BNP. So aledged percieved criminal incitement against the policitcal right is promoted - Jo Brand has not been sacked or forced to apologise - yet saying something controversial against the left is treated differently. The BBC is licence fee funded and owes a duty to be policitcally balanced, it is not, it should be - this requires an investigation - with appropriate action.",
