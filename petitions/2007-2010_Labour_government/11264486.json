            "background": "We request the Prime Minister to look at the role OFCOM played in allowing this increase with only 145 exchanges set for 21CN. We also ask the planned price increase which is unfair with so few exchanges enabled the reason given for the increase. \nA BT spokeswoman said: \"BT Wholesale is introducing pricing changes across its broadband product range. These price changes are aimed at encouraging communications providers to switch from current generation 20C wholesale broadband products to IPstream Max or to our new, next generation products which offer better value, higher speeds, enhanced functionality and, in the case of the Wholesale Broadband Connect family, a solution for communications providers' growing bandwidth requirements.\"\nNow we are restricted to less allowance due to BT's increases. \nMany exchanges have a date set for end 2011 which means a large number will be paying higher prices supposedly to make them move to the new platform when it is not available to them.\nThis is an unfair increase which should be stopped and removed.",
