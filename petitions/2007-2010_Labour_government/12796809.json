        "background": "We require the Government to stop the plans to make Dunsfold Park into an eco-town. This is because making the park an eco-town could not possibly help Dunsfold Park be any more eco than it is at the moment.\nThe current proposals include a new town of 2,600 homes. That is more homes than are in Alfold, Chiddingfold, Dunsfold and Hascombe combined and twice the number of homes in Bramley.\nDunsfold Park is a large open space at the moment and to destroy it buy building a town, no matter how 'eco' it is, would be wrong and unjustified.",
