        "background": "The 10p tax rate has been instrumental in helping people on lower incomes out of poverty. Although the government has promised to help childless couples and the elderly, they should also be helping those who live on thier own. People should not be punished financially for being single! Beyond this, the Labour Party should be interested in redistributing wealth to everyone; not just small sections of the population which the Prime Minister deems politically important when in comes to elections.",
