        "action": "Abolish the system which requires the self employed to pay income tax in advance based on the current years tax payment",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The current tax system for the self employed who are not trading as a limited company is totally unfair and counter productive.\nUnder the legislation as it stands if a self employed person has a tax and class 4 contribution to pay of say \u00a315.000. Then by the 31st of January the Inland Revenue would require a payment \u00a322.500 with another payment of \u00a37.500 due again in July.\nThis tax system is very damaging for small business and employment, as it puts a tremendous pressure on cash flow.\nIf that money was allowed to stay in the business then it allows the owners to pay staff and re-invest and even take on new staff,without the need to borrow from the bank.It must be remembered that while this money is in the governments \"Coffers\" there is no interest paid to the small business.Even though that business may have to borrow from the bank and subsequently pay interest on money it would otherwise have had.\nIf this government was intent on helping the self employed and small businesses, then this tax system would have been withdrawn.",
