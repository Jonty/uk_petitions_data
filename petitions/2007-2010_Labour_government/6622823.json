It seems unlikely that phone package suppliers and mobile phone companies will agree to including these because the costs are unpredictable.\n\nThe best solution therefore would be to compel all users of these numbers to give a geographic number as well. Then consumers can choose which they use. Only businesses making money from their 0870 and 0845 numbers would lose out - and we don't want to do business with them do we!",
