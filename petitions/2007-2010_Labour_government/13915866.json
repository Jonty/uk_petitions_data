            "background": "make new or adjust laws and policies based on scientific evidence where possible, that is true. not on for example old theories like creationism as religion holds back the development of the world and rational thinking. and use scientific evidence for major issues such as drugs where the effects can be tested, evaluated and reasoned to come to a decision not based on international law or to get along with other countries. Liberal countries such as sweden and holland do this and have far higher living standards, but i dont want to have to leave my country to get these. Its time to move forward in a way that promotes our country as leaders in science and rational thinking.",
