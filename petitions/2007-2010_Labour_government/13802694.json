            "background": "as most people i am sick of ringing call centres and havin to speak to people who cant speak fluent english. they dont understand some english words let alone the problem i am trying to tell them. then they put you on hold while they do nothing and still com back with no answer only to pass the call to someone else who can barely understand english. i am not racist and i am fully aware of all the multi cultural differences in britain but you couldnt get a job as a an optician or nurse if you were not qualified so why should people get employed to answer and sort peoples calls when they cant speak or understand english.",
