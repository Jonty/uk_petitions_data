            "background": "It has become apparent that somewhere in the complex regulations of Jobcentre Plus, it is written that all unemployed claimants must seek a job via employer applications Only and that seeking a job through your own initiative for self employment is not to be commended, encouraged or allowed whilst making a jobseekers claim.\n\nAdditionally: \n\n- Grants for business start-ups are scarce and only available in a minority of areas. \n\n- The Income Support Scheme only offers \u00a350 per week for the self employed if they have already set themselves up and declared a substantial occupation in self employment. \n\nThis leaves New Entrepreneurs and the Would Be Self Employed out in the cold whilst they try to create a business plan, research their market and set things in motion. \n\nThe unemployment system is therefore failing to support high numbers of jobseekers who are desperate to set up self employment and earn an independent income after long stints of failed job applications.\n\nWe the undersigned therefore petition the Prime Minister to take strong proactive measures to enable Jobseekers Allowance (or some other benefit) to be claimed by job seekers who are focused on trying to start a new business.",
