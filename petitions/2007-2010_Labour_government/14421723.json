        "action": "Order a financial levy on all banks and financial instututions in the UK similar to that being imposed by President Obama on US institutions",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Most banks and financial institutions in the UK have only survived because of the support that has been provided to them by UK taxpayers. They now appear to be making substantial profits again. A financial levy could be imposed on them until the taxpayer's support has been repaid. Such a levy on all banks, rather than capping individual banker's bonuses, would not lead to 'talent' being lost to other institutions. The levy would not affect the bank's need or ability to strengthen their capital bases but merely reduce their bonus pools.\n\nPresident Obama has set the precident for this in the proposing that US banks will be levied in this way until taxpayers have received 'every penny' of the support they provided",
