        "background": "Many NHS workers have childcare problems, These would be lessened if the NHS provided creche facilities for its workers. Irregular shift patterns can cause increased difficulties in finding adequate child care. This would also provide jobs for early year officers. Many childcare providers cannot provide childcare to cover early starts and late finishes within the NHS. Dedicated creches would provide the flexibility that NHS workers need.",
