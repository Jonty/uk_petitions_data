            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The South West suffers from wages out of line with inflation. Most wages are well below the national average. One of the issues that is affected by this, is that local residents on a minimum wage can no longer buy affordable housing in the South West region due to other buyers outside of the South West looking for holiday homes.\n\nThe average gross weekly wage for full-time workers working in the South West was \u00a3493.30 in 2006, below the national average of \u00a3546.50.\n\nThe Real Pay in the UK report examined detailed salary and cost-of-living information at all levels of employment, from un-skilled work to senior management, to show real pay levels for 13 regions across the UK. It reveals while high salaries in central London more than compensate for the high cost of living, salaries for employees in the South West leave employees relatively out of pocket.",
