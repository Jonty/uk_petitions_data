            "background": "We are facing a major challenge and threat to our way of life. You may have already heard about the proposal to build an enormous 6000 house town (this is the size of Melton Mowbray or more than half the size of Loughborough) on your door step. This ill-conceived development will swallow up a fair chunk of your neighbours houses and also means that this peaceful rural region we live in will turn into an urban hub with all the traffic, crime, and problems that inevitably follow city life. We believe that you live here because you like the countryside and we are certain that you will want to fight to keep us all rural. Just take a moment to imagine the traffic generated by 6000 new houses! Some of this traffic will be running past your house on the already over crowded and poorly maintained roads.\n\nWe have to do something. The decision to approve or reject the proposal will be made soon (probably by the end of January) and so we all need to act now. This is not something that can be left to your neighbour or to specific groups or individuals. Once a decision is made you will have no come back so we must unify and fight now.",
