The stock answer of \"it is within the rules\" whenever questions are asked, is wearing thin. People living on benefits or on low incomes are severely penalised for the minimum amount of cheating whilst we see our legislators being allowed to claim tens of thousands of pounds without any receipts or, it appears any checks. If all of these second homes became the property of the state, once sold, or when the MP left or lost their seat, the amount made would be available for suitable, basic accomodation for those who really needed it.Receipts should be required for allowable expenses. MPs could be given a suitable increase in salary if they agreed not to take on second, third or even fourth jobs. The work of a Member of Parliament should not be something done in one's spare time!",
