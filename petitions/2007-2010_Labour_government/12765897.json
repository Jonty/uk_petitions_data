It is effecting so many people today of all sizes (e.g. small seats, poor size range of clothing in both large and small)that something should be done about it. We would like people to offer encouragement, not abuse, to people who are obese or too thin to help them lose that weight or gain that weight. We are aware that obesity is a health concern, but these people need help, not discrimination.",
