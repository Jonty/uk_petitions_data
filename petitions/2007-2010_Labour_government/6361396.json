            "background": "The DLR (Docklands Light Railway) is a smooth-running, consistent service - no doubt due to its automation. Unfortunately it only covers a quarter of London.\n\nThe trains are driver-less. That means that there are no drivers to go on strike, or demand exorbitant wage increases at the commuters' expense \n\nThis is a petition to request expansion of the DLR network, or automation of the existing tube network for the benefit of London commuters. We are suffering a service increasingly disrupted by striking workers, and would benefit hugely from a technical solution.",
