In England no animal can be slaughtered with out prior stunning, as stated in The Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995.\nThe regulations do NOT say religious groups are exempt from these laws.\nAccording to DEFRA \"There are long-standing provisions in our law which permit the slaughter of animals without stunning to meet Jewish and Muslim religious requirements.\"\nSecular animal slaughter involves pre-stunning animals so that they are unconscious before they are killed. \nI am calling for all groups and religions living in England to follow the slaughter guidelines as stated in The Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995.  \nI am calling for no person/s to be exempt from these regulations.\nThis is to protect our Britsh law and the influence it has over ALL people living in Britain, and,to protect Animals",
