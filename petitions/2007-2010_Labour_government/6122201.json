            "background": "The FSA has suspended reclaiming awaiting a decision on the OFT\u2019s agreed test case with the banks.  \n\nThis decision was taken without consultation with the consumer groups who\u2019ve been championing reclaiming.  MoneySavingExpert, ConsumerActionGroup & PenaltyCharges are between them helping 1.5m+ people reclaim, & the charter expresses their opinion.\n\nIn the UK it\u2019s virtually obligatory to have a bank account, yet there\u2019s no competition over charges, & penalty charges often leave finances irrevocably damaged.  \n\nThe Charter\u2019s key clauses are\n\n* \u00a35 is a fair max for bank charges\n\n* The stay on reclaiming is anti-consumer & should be stopped\n\n* If not, a stay should also be put on banks levying charges & ensuing credit defaults\n\n* It should be pre-decided that if the case is successful, banks must be made to pay back past charges plus interest automatically; customers shouldn\u2019t need to complain, and all related credit defaults should be wiped.\n\nThe full charter is available via the web.",
