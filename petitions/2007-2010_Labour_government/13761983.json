            "background": "I was misdiagnosed Bipolar in 1996. My temporary mental health problems in both 1996 and 2008 were due to lignocaine only. A private doctors report and a NHS letter confirm this.\n\nIt is in the BMJ that Tocainide causes Paranoid psychosis.Tocainide is the primary amine of lignocaine. There is an article in the EMJ, where it effects the nervous system. \nLignocaine was withdrawn from use in animals that are used for food consumption.( May 2004)\n\nCurrently health records only record doctors and hospital notes. Visits to the dentist and opticians do not form part of an health assessment. When chemicals like lignocaine are used then of course it should be considered. \n\nI want it to become compulsory that everyone that uses lignocaine is aware of the possible side effects. They are aware of storage and usage of the chemical.They must also provide their patients with the possible side effects on an information sheet as a duty of care.",
