            "background": "Wasps play an important role in the natural world, however their presence in large numbers in areas of dense human population is less significant. Any potential benefit from these insects is outweighed by the pain, fear and distress that they cause, particularly for young or vulnerable people.\n\nThis petition calls on the Prime Minister to initiate a national programme to control and substantially reduce the wasp population, particularly in urban centres and areas of significant human activity.\n\nThis petition also recommends the use of natural and non-chemical solutions.",
