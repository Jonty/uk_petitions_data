        "action": "Facilitate the installation of renewable energy systems for householders",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In France a 50% tax credit is given to encourage the installation of renewable energy systems. In the UK it is a pitiable \u00a31400 maximum, provided certain conditions are met. We require investment for small installers to buy plant, such as diggers and small drilling rigs, to enable boreholes to be dug in small gardens to supply ground source heating and adequate insulation and underfloor heating systems, particularly in rural areas where oil is a primary heating fuel. Period properties need to be upgraded to meet current U-values. Solar panels will meet the bulk of hot water requirements. The UK energy budget has been wasted on non-productive quangos and advisory bodies, and no practical help. We could dipense with oil altogether within ten years. Please help.",
