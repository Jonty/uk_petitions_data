This often results in the full fair paying passengers having to stand as the seats are taken by those with cheap fair ticket.  The morning peak exist to reduce congestion in the morning but the evening peak was remove many years ago.  The government should place pressure onto the train companies, that operate out of london, to re-introduce the evening peak and only allow full fair passengers to travel on trains leaving london between 16:30 and 18:30",
