            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Every day thousands of office workers commute to work. These journeys consume vast amounts of fuel (petrol & diesel) and time, and contribute significantly to pollution.\n\nA lot of the work carried out by these commuters, particularly in IT and Call Centres for example, could be done from home just as effectively. However, business needs a culture change to see the benefits of remote workers, and to learn the necessary management skills required to ensure effective work is carried out 'out of site' of the office.\n\nI am petitioning the government to provide tax incentives to business to encourage them to increase their number of remote workers; and to provide financial help with retraining management to manage their remote workers.\n\nIn these days of soaring fuel costs, and continuing damage to the environment, I see this as being a potential major opportunity to help reduce fuel consumption, reducing expense, and helping the environment.",
