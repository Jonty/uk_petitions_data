            "background": "The oil prices is now very close to where it was a year ago. In comparison to the peak, the oil price has fallen by appr. 40%. However petrol prices at the pump have at best fallen by 10%. We are all worried about inflation and here is an opportunity to help bring inflation down. The higher cost of petrol impact a great number of people and businesses. I fear that if the oil price rises again we may face prices increases on top of the current level. I therefore petition the PM to put pressure on the oil industry to bring petrol prices down in line with input cost.",
