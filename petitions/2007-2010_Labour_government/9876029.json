            "background": "In our Country today there are A lot of Chronic Disabled People suffering with Accute Respiratory Conditions such as Asthma, COPD, Lung Cancer, Heart Disease,and much more. \nThese include people of all ages including Children who have to have Oxygen Machines at home which without them they would not be able to live in their homes they would be Hospitalised. The Oxygen  Machine run from their Electricity Doubling their Annual Electricity Bills, although they do get some compensation from Boc who supply the Oxygen it is not enough to cover all, so this is why I set this petition so that the goverment  should give a fuel allowance simular to the Elderly to such Disabled sick and vulnerable people.",
