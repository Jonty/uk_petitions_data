        "background": "We are 3 Year 12 students who've enjoyed studying politics at A-level and wish we could have studied it at a GCSE level. However, in England and Wales and Northern Ireland you cannot take GCSE politics. It was cancelled in 2002 due to lack of popularity because the course was considered 'dull' because it was based around the study of political institutions. However, we believe that a new GCSE in politics, with a new syllabus based around the more interesting and contempory aspects of politics, for example pressure groups, political parties and setting up your own country and ideology, would attract young people. An interesting and popular GCSE will lead to more people understanding politics which in turn would lead to better political participation and be of huge benefit to society.",
