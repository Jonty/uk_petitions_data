Prime Minister to be elected in an  General election by the public, as in France and America, for a fixed term.No longer by the party system as present. How can the present Prime Minister lead the country when never being elected into office!!! \nBoth House of commons and Lords to be elected with appropriate executive powers for laws of the country. As in America, top positions of the cabinet not to be drawn from those elected as MPs, again as in America. Fixed term in office for all public office.",
