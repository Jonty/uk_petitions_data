            "background": "As a public broadcaster I expect the BBC to inform me of all the facts and not to censor so that it can appease one side.  The BBC could have aired the DEC appeal and could have put a message to say that it is not in anyway a view of the BBC but a message from DEC.  If an organisation or political party to which I was giving money to went against my liking I could stop giving my money to that organisation or political party.  The only way I could legally not pay the BBC is by not owning a television set which I feel is grossly unfair.  There is no accountability with the BBC as there is with a political party which we could vote for.  The BBC has ignored our complaints and it is unfair that our money is going to an organisation that we feel does not care about views.",
