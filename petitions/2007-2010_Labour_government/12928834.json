        "background": "London Midland Services from London Euston to Tring and vice versa is subjected to cancellations, rude staff and ongoing delays. The people using this service are paying huge amounts of money for staff that have little or no information, poor customer service skills.  Above all our money is being robbed as trains fail to show up on time and cancelled at the last minute.  This can not be allowed to carry on, somebody more senior must put a end to the misery we experience on a daily basis.",
