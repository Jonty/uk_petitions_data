            "background": "Although the falling Base Rate is no doubt good news for many, there is a proportion of this countries poorest who are being heavily peanalised. Those unfortunate to be either too sick or disabled to work are having their mortgage interest housing benefit calculated using the prevailing Bank of England Base Rate plus 1.58%.  As mortgage lenders are not reducing their rates the amount people have to find to keep making their payments has gone up - approx \u00a3100 per month on a \u00a350,000 mortgsge.  As this affects people already in a disadvantaged group the prevailing rate should be that as applied by the Lender so as to guard against more homeless and repossessions of those who already find themselves among the poorest in the country.",
