        "background": "We ask that the RSPCA drop their Freedom Food scheme as it has failed to protect the animals / livestock under it. The RSPCA should be there to protect all animals and not farm them for food. \n\nThe RSPCA Freedom Food scheme has been exposed for cruelty, lack of care and has completely failed to protect the animals under it. It simply can\u2019t be trusted anymore. \n\nIt states the Freedom Food scheme is monitored by the RSPCA, yet the RSPCA admits itself farms are only monitored once every 15 months. This is simply not good enough. \n\nThe RSPCA can\u2019t be very proud of the scheme as they keep the farms under it a secret. They even refuse to tell their own members and committee. \n\nThe scheme is doing more harm that good to the RSPCA and they know it.",
