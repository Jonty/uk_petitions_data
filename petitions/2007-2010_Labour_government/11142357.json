They have now been held captive for 79 days now (Today 26-11-08)\n\nThe major reason for their continued detention is the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown's pledge to assist the Federal Government of Nigerias' military with assistance & training. This has angered the militants who are holding these 2 men. The British Government has remained extremely quiet about the plight of these two captives.\n\nAll efforts must be made at the highest level to secure the release of these British subjects.",
