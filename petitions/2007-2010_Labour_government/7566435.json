            "background": "Schools do a pretty good job of teaching children and young people facts and even deductive techniques, but they do very little to teach them how to think for themselves and to understand how other people think. If they were taught these things I feel they would be better equipped to live life and contribute to society and form their own beliefs instead of bowing to peer pressure, and the would better understand the consequences of their actions. Democracy too would benefit as children and young people decide for themselves how society should work.",
