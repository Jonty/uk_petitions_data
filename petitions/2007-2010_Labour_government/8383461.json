        "background": "Pensioners aged over 65-75, who earn more than the age related threshold of \u00a320900 are penalised by having \u00a31 deducted from the age related non-taxable allowance of \u00a37550 for every \u00a32 that they earn over the threshold.  This extra stealth tax inhibits pensioners spending power, and the amounts deducted would go a long way to helping Senior Citizens with fuel bills.",
