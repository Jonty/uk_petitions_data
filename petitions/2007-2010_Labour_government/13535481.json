            "background": "in my eyes and many others pedophiles are the greatest risk to our comunities, yet still have more rights than we have, When they are caught they get short sentances where they do not learn a thing or change because they never will change and then they are let out to affend again! they move into inasent comunaties and are free to look for their next victims. then they affend again. the goverment expects parents to stop their children from getting into danger, but how can they? when they dont know danger is on their door step. sign this petition if you want pedophiles known in your area.",
