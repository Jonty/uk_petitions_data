        "action": "make it illegal for mobile phone companies to disconnect customers who do not use their phones for 6 months; or, if they do, reconnection should be free of charge",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Obviously everyone accepts that if they use a facility such as a mobile phone they will be charged each time they use it.  If, however, any individual CHOOSES to have a mobile only for emergencies, and therefore only uses it occasionally, he/she is penalised for this by being charged for NOT using it.  You can't win: if you DO use it you are (quite rightly) charged but if you DON'T you're still charged!  One might argue that if mobile phone customers know about this they should make a point of using their phone a few days before the 6 months is up; but I imagine most people have better things to do than remember exactly how long it is since they used their phone.",
