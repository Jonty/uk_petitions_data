            "background": "As a disabled person I would love to be fuel efficient so I don't want most of my benefits to go to the power companies this winter so I think the government should do is get the power companies to supply solar panels to all the poorest people, like my self who live on benefits or pensioners,FREE OF CHARGE. Winter 2008 could be the worse winter for all the poorest people in this country because they wouldn't be able to heat their homes or even feed themselves because of the high prices of everything. The power companies are making money hand over fist these days so make them help the poorest of this country so we can all have a warm winter from now on.",
