        "background": "local councils are making it difficult to become registered as homeless. by putting them in sub standard temporary accomodation. for short peroids of time. then throwing them back on the streets, then claiming the local government has fufilled its duties to provide correct housing for people in need, this then allows the local council to thin out the number of homeless people. this then makes it possible for councils to state quite falsly that the number of homeless people is dropping. this seems to be a major issue with to many policies. whereas the government or local council are indeed hiding its numbers of policies which need looking at by re juggling the figures.",
