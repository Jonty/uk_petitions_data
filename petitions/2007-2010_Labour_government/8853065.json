            "background": "At the moment there are far too many charity shops opening up and far too many small businesses closing down.  In my local town two businesses are closing down.  I was quite surprised to find out that it wasn't due to poor business but more to do with increasing rents.  The problem is that unlike a small business a charity shop due to volunteers  pay hardly any salaries or any tax due to their charity status and thus often can afford to pay a higher rent. Thus business is restricted to large retail and charity shops and therefore forcing the small businesses out.  Although there is always a place for the odd charity shop no one wants a town full of charity shops.  Therefore I purpose that charity shops and the income charities receive through retail be tax inline with other businesses to level up the playing field for small businesses.",
