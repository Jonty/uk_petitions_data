            "background": "No one seems answerable for the ineptitude of certain government departments. The CSA continue to make errors and implement rules that actually do more to break families apart. \n\nTwo systems are employed by the CSA with the old system discouraging the parent with residence to grant access to the child (i.e. this may reduce the payments they receive). In fact under the old system I would be required to pay less if I split from my current wife or had children outside the relationship - this seems madness (government encouraged madness).\n\nThe calculation methods differ significantly and I question how these inequalities can continue to be supported after several years.  \n\nThe CSA Departments seem unwilling/unable to talk to each other resulting in the same information being asked for several times. Some one should be answerable for the mess that is the CSA.",
