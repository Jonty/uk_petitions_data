            "background": "The Scottish Borders Council aim to implement a 2% Budget Cut for Education in all Primary Schools in the Scottish Borders.  This is leaving many schools on the border line of surviving and some with negative balances.\n\nThe budgets are so tight that there is a real risk that parents will have to supply their children with jotters and toilet rolls in order to make ends meet.  The only other alternative is to let the Learning Support and Teaching Assistants go and this is obviously not an avenue that we want to venture into.\n\nWe want the Council to take note that this situation is not acceptable and we are not willing to lay down and let it happen, we will do everything in our power to oppose this.",
