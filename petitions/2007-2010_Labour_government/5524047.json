            "background": "Raising interest rates removes money from the pockets of the relatively less well off and those struggling to pay mortgages and not buying superfluous goods anyway, and observation shows this has little effect on real inflation. It has an adverse effect on exports, industries ability to invest, jobs and those who are working hard to support a family. By increasing tax for instance the government would take more money out of the economy in total, while having less impact on the average wage earner with an inflated mortage. This would reduce inflation without hurting industry or Joe Punter.",
