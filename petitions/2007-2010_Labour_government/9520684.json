        "background": "Combivent inhalers are used as an effective treatment for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, by many people.  The manufacturers and the DoH have announced that they will be withdrawn in June this year because the inhaler contains CFC.  Unfortunately, a CFC-free version of this inhaler will not be ready in time for the discontinuation of the product, leaving those who are stable with its help in limbo.  Please petition the government to obtain a short-term dispensation to allow continued production of the CFC-containing version, until a CFC-free product has been developed to replace it.",
