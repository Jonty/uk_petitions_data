What is strange is the mention of \"thousands of pounds of gifts\" from the so-called 'Church' to the British police.\n\nWe, the undersigned, demand that the bias of the British police involving this matter be investigated in order to make way for freedom of speech, and ensure neutrality and purity in the British judiciary system free from bribery and corruption.",
