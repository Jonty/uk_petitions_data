            "background": "It is unacceptable for parents to swear at their children in public. More to the point, children who are often sworn at are very likely to swear themselves.\n\nThe first step could involve the police issuing a parent with an \u00a380 fine. If parents are caught swearing at their children for the second time,they should get a prosecution warning. If parents swear at their children for the third time, then they will be prosecuted. This should make our local communities more pleasant and fewer people will be intimidated",
