            "background": "This country is absolutely filthy, helping to create the 'broken society' that  many people believe that we live in. I am ashamed to drive along many of the roads in the UK, the roadsides piled high with bottles, plastic, take away items, cans etc etc.Ponds & rivers are often polluted with rubbish floating around, helping to destroy the wildlife. Laybys often don't even have litterbins!  The streets in our  towns & cities are full of rubbish, chewing gum, fag ends,cigarette packets,sweet wrappers, graffiti etc.Bins overflow everywhere & seem to be rarely emptied, this leads to a sense of decay & that British could'nt care less atitude. Many tourists are shocked! \nMy solution is to employ teenagers on Community service to work on this & to do something constructive with their time, I also would bring in heavy fines, ie \u00a31000 a time, for throwing rubbish, rather like Singapore where there is zero rubbish. After a short period,of government advertising , after the first few people were fined , we would all become used to it, & what joy to travel our roads & walk in the towns & countryside again, free of the litter of modern society!",
