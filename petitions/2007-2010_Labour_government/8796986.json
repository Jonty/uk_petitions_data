            "background": "Apparently cats are banned from working in the Treasury or in other government departments and ministries. This is because many of the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contracts don\u2019t allow for using cats (or other animals) for pest control.\n\nClearly using cats to kill mice is rather more ecologically sound than putting down poison and rather cheaper too.\n\nSo I petition the PM to insert a binding clause in any PFI agreement that allows for the use of cats as pest control agents on a salary of not less than GBP 700 a year plus one tin of cat food a day and medical benefits.",
