            "background": "In Prime Minister's Questions on 16th July 2008, the Prime Minister made a promise to not raise fuel duty for one whole year.\n\nHe has already broken this promise once in December (to counteract the effect of the VAT reduction) - and intends to break it for a second time this April 1st with a 1.84p/litre - being a taxable tax this is 2p/litre after VAT.\n\nFuel tax is high enough as it is, with a struggling economy it's hardly helping the population and business get on with keeping the economy ticking over.\n\nThis petition is NOT calling for a tax redution (though that would be nice) but for the PM to honour his promise of not raising fuel duty for a year.",
