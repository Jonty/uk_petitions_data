            "background": "the SIA seem to have more power than the police or any magistrates court when making a decision to issue people with a license or not, i have personally been refused because i have had a caution in the last ten years.a caution is not a conviction! \ni have a mortgage and young family to take care of but to be refused my license when i was only protecting myself is wrong. i have been an apprentice CCTV operator now for 3 years and am now suspended from my duty pending an appeal. which no magistrate can overturn anyway. \nso why should the SIA have this much power to see a person who is trying to do well back on the unemployment pile.if you have so many regulations then you destry any respect for law..",
