            "background": "On the 29 February 2008 HMRC announced the closure of Castle House Accrington. This decision is fundamentally flawed in that it is not good operational sense on behalf of HMRC and will be of extreme detriment to the staff, HMRC's customers and HMRC's abilitiy to conduct its business in an efficient, customer focused manner. In addition the closure of HMRC Castle House Accrington will be of detriment to Accrington and East Lancashire as a whole affecting the town and local community not just now but for many years to come.\n\nThis beautiful modern office space would be an ideal location for HMRC's future business and the expansion of HMRC's operations in this area could have untold benefits for the area for the long term future.\n\nThe decision to close this building is senseless and typical of a government hell bent on the destruction of local communities. Please oppose the closure of Castle House.",
