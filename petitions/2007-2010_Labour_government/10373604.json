        "background": "I recently read a case in my paper in which a driver basically got away with killing a pedestrian because \"the high rear window of his car made it hard for him to see the 5ft 4in pedestrian\". I reluctantly accept that this decision was probably fair but why was he driving such a car in the first place and why is it, presumably, legal for such cars to be built?  I am particularly concerned because I myself am just under 5ft; in any case surely the safety of pedestrians - of whatever height - should greatly, and UNQUESTIONINGLY, supersede the \"right\" of drivers to possess and drive such cars.",
