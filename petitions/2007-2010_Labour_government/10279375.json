        "background": "UK supermarkets often bully customers into purchasing twice the amount of food that they actually desire, using discount marketing techniques that have long been outlawed in other European countries. In the light of food-price inflation, it is now time to guarantee customers a fair and competitive price on the quantities they actually want to buy. Please ban supersize marketing such as \"buy one get one free\" and \"buy one get another one half price\" from the UK grocery market. Less food will be wasted and food price inflation figures will be reduced.",
