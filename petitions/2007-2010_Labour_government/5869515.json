            "background": "The A17 is classified as a red route, it is an extrememly busy route which see's heavy traffic flow 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I believe many accidents are due to frustration, the road is often clogged by lorries moving at 40 mph. It can take 2 and a half hours to move 60 miles, there is no area's to overtake and it is very frustrating. I firmly believe the road should be a dual carriageway!",
