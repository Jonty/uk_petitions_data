            "background": "This petition is for the PM to prevent the closure of Browndown MOD training camp on the south coast of the UK. Not only is this camp placed ideally for a number of different training environments, it is also home to an annual Tri-wing Air Cadet camp that has been running for ten years. The camp has been enjoyed by a number of people and should be there for people to enjoy in the future. The reason closing this camp is objectionable is that it is one of the few facilities capable of housing 250+ people.",
