        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The easy availability of alcohol is one the main underlying problems in our society today, causing particular problems in the areas of health and crime.  Although I think it would be difficult to ban supermarkets and other retail outlets from selling it completely, by legislating that all sales of alcohol should go through a separate till would force retailers to consider more seriously the cost/benefit advantages.  For myself, a middle-aged mother, the temptation of bottles of wine interspersed with cheese, bread, fruit etc. is often too much to resist.  I admittedly buy and drink too much wine as it is so easy to put it in your shopping trolley when doing the weekly shop.  Forcing consumers to queue separately for alcohol sales would likely discourage other weak-minded individuals such as myself!  Thanks for reading and/or signing my petition.",
