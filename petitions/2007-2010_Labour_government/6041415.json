            "background": "We feel that the First World Countries should be foremost in the aid of those stricken with poverty. Therefore, we are of the opinion that all nuclear, biological and chemical weapon development worldwide should cease immediately and the money from this should be used to end all poverty, in every country. \n\nThis idea was originally expressed by the late Bill Hicks, a comedian and philosopher of immense talent. The idea rang true with a few people, and so it was decided to call this \"The Bill Hicks Campaign\".\n\nMillions die daily simply because they cannot afford what the First World doesn't even think about, such as clean water, or food. \n\nWe have the power to stop this, and the duty to make sure we do. Instead of spending money on annihilating the human race, why not spend it on saving it?",
