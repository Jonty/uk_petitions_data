You have to pay in the main car park, which is usually full during weekdays with visitors, leaving you nowhere to park!\nBy driving to the hospital saves using the time and resources of the Ambulance service, saving the NHS money!!\nThere should be a parking area and system where the parking attendants communicate with A&E reception to see the customer\u2019s situation before issuing tickets.\nWhen you have the stress of taking a sick baby or child to A&E you should have total time for them not worrying whether you will receive a parking ticket.",
