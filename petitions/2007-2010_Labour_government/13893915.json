It is not satisfactory to restate the inadequate actions all ready in place. Even worse, as in the case of the petition asking the Prime Minister to resign, the Government gave an arbitrary response bearing little resemblance to the petition. Petitions demand to be taken seriously, with either direct political change, or an explanation as to why the issue is being disregarded.",
