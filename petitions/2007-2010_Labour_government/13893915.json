            "background": "The virtue of the fact that there are petitions demonstrates that our country is imperfect, thus, they intrinsically require an adequate response to the issues raised. It is not satisfactory to restate the inadequate actions all ready in place. Even worse, as in the case of the petition asking the Prime Minister to resign, the Government gave an arbitrary response bearing little resemblance to the petition. Petitions demand to be taken seriously, with either direct political change, or an explanation as to why the issue is being disregarded.",
