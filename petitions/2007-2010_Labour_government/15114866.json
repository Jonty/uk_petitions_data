        "background": "When you leave any of the three Armed Services, it seems to be near impossible to receive council accommodation, as ex-soldiers/airmen/women and sailors are not given any priority by the council in the UK. Especially when being medically discharged, there should be an improvement to the system to prevent young servicemen/women and their family from being homeless and losing all their belongings. Are we serving our country to be left out in the rain?",
