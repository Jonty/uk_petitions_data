With its maze like lay out and musical variation it is still one of the very best around. \n\nIf Turnmills is to close this would be a hammer blow for the London clubbing scene coming hot on the heals of the closure of The Cross, The Key & Canvas nightclubs in Kings Cross to make way for the cross-rail development.\n\nTurnmills is a place where hundreds of thousands of people enjoy themselves every year and is of real cultural importance and we need as many signatures as possible in order for the authorities to investigate this potential travesty.",
