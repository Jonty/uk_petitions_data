        "background": "After the 50th anniversary of the Modern computer it would be nice to have a tribute to the man who started it all.\n\nAfter Alan Turing created the Manchester baby and the Manchester mark one this country let him down just because of his sexual orientation.\n\nWhy not make a tribute to the man? The only tribute we have is a statue of him holding an apple! Lets have a Computer museum in Manchester. This would be great for education as computers are playing a huge role in our day to day lives! This could even attract all sorts of big names to the city as the computer industry has to be one of thee biggest industries in the world!\nThere is an endless list of companies that would be interested in such a scheme!\n\nAs there are few museums in Manchester I think this would be a great way to celebrate the anniversary of the modern computer and I believe it would be a fantastic tribute to Alan Turing.",
