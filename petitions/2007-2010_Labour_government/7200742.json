The people of this Country did not vote for Gordon Brown as Prime Minister, to run this country(as he sees fit!). Due to that fact a general election should and must be called to remedy that fact. If we the people do not demand this, the democratic process will be proven to be a farce! The Definition of Democracy, as well all know, is majority rule. Gorden Brown is not the majority! It's Maybe A \"New World Order\"!",
