            "background": "The Home Office has awarded new powers to the police and MI5 allowing them to hack into personal computers WITHOUT a warrant. The move follows proposals by the European Union which extend the use of intrusive surveillance. The remote searching technique uses keyloggers, which can be installed in a variety of ways to allow officers to monitor a suspect's computer usage, including emails, web surfing and instant messaging conversations. \n\nThis is an infringement of personal privacy and could allow officers to monitor your computer use at home and access your private data including bank records, email conversations etc. With more and more devices at home connected to your computer more of your private life will be open to government scrutiny.\n\nThis must be stopped NOW before they access your data, copy it to disk, then lose it on a train somewhere.",
