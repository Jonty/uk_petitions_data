Global Warming is where rising Carbon-Dioxide gets stuck in the atmosphere of Earth, and creates a cloud of CO2. The heat rises because it cannot escape the atmosphere and the CO2. Global Warming is caused by CO2 which is made from the usage of coal, oil etc, cars and planes also add to global warming as they release CO2. We must stop global warming before it is too late, recycle, walk/cycle more, dont litter, help the environment, SAVE THE PLANET FROM GLOBAL WARMING!",
