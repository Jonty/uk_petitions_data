            "background": "I understand that it will take a few years to get this working properly but the out come will be great, i feel like it will minimise animal cruelty. All households that have pets should need a license because of all the trouble with abuse and neglect. All the money for the licence can go to animal shelters and the people behind the licence. All animals should have a licence, that is registered with a vet so there are no people having animals with out a licence. Personally i don't think people should have pets if they cannot be looked after & cannot afford the right treatment, this is why i am doing this petition.",
