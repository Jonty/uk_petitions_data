            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The quality of science laboratories and teaching resources in many secondary schools, particularly those without 6th-form status and those in rural or deprived areas, is woefully lacking.  As a teacher who has switched career from the IT industry to science teaching, I find it appauling that science teaching is given such low status and is so under-funded.  We petition the government to ring-fence a significant portion of education funding to bring about modernisation of UK science teaching facilities.  The advancement of science and engineering teaching in India and China in particular means that we are becoming a third-rate country for science.  This is, to a significant extent, due to this country's failure to provide a high quality teaching environment and resources for science teaching.  We are also failing to encourage and motivate young people into scientific careers.  We petition the government to urgently address this decline.",
