            "background": "With the increase of traffic there are more children being killed on our residential streets. I would like to see an outright ban on all ball games on our residential roads and streets. Not only is there a danger of the children running out from behind parked cars but there is also the danger of drivers being distracted when a car that they are driving is hit by a ball. Parents should be fined if their child is found to be playing outside a designated area. \nWith more cars parking on the streets there are more instances of cars being damaged by children playing ball games. This puts up the insurance premiums car owners which is not acceptable.\nI would be grateful for support for this petition.",
