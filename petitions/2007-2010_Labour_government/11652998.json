UNISON is calling on Essex County Council to scrap the current exercise and open full discussions with the trade unions about the development of an in-house service improvement plan prior to any tendering process.  This will help safeguard the future of staff and council services. \n\nThis unprecedented sale, which is worth over \u00a35 billion over an eight year period, offers virtually any public service for sale.  The legal consultation period was never adhered to or discussed with any County Council Committee, County Councillors or the Cabinet. \n\nBut most importantly, the Council has breached its statutory duty in failing to consult or inform local people whose interests it is supposed to serve.",
