            "background": "In the light of recent events in Yorkshire and the Midlands, I believe the Prime Minister should do whatever possible to ensure that all items (particularly mechanical and electrical) that insurance companies decide to \"write off\" are recycled where possible. Over the past few days on various news programmes we have seen hundreds of vehicles abandoned in flood water and household appliances disgarded due to flood damage. These items should be given the opportunity to be recycled instead of being scrapped or sent to landfill.\nIf these items are all discarded then all that will happen is that we as a nation will once again be adding to global warming, which is the actual cause of the initial problem.",
