            "background": "Analogue TV broadcasts will cease over the next few years, so that all analogue-only TVs and video recorders will require external digital \"set-top-boxes\".  Many people, especially the elderly, find set-top-boxes difficult to use, and the complexity of video recording from a set-top-box will often defeat the technically competent too.  Analogue-only equipment is still widely available and is commonly bought by people without knowledge of these problems.  Warning labels on such units stating \"WARNING: ANALOGUE TUNER ONLY\" would alert people to the problem and discourage their sale.  This would save vulnerable people from losing money, protect the environment by reducing the vast amount of equipment that will be dumped, and reduce the resources required to aid the conversion to digital reception.",
