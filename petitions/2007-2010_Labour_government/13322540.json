            "background": "Through the use of parliamentary questions raised by Lord Foulkes, the government have been exposed as wanting to smear the good reputation of General Sir Richard Dannatt. \n\nThis is because of his strident and very valid criticism of this Government's lack of support for army personnel.\n\nAt the end of General Sir Richard Dannatt's tenure as the head of the Army, it was predicted by many people that the government would stoop to this low level because of the previous criticism.\n\nAttempting to smear General Sir Richard Dannatt in this way is deplorable. \n\nGordon Brown should reprimand Lord Foulkes and publicly apologise to General Sir Richard Dannatt for this slur.",
