        "background": "Small shops are being priced out of business by huge rate increases well above inflation. Tesco's are paying less than shops in the same street and size i.e Portobello Rd, Notting Hill, London. Soon our shopping parades will all be closed, and the public will have no choice as to who they spend their money with. Only conglomorates will be able to afford business rates... and therefore private independant shops will suffer.",
