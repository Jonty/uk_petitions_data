I would ask the primeminister to treat this issue with urgency and one that should make it a criminal offence to inflict such pain on others. They should pay for this crime doing community service, getting up early in the morning, they should be taught to understand what it is like to get up early in the morning tying yourself out working then having to go to bed early to repeat it all over again.\nThankyou",
