            "background": "I am a British National who opened a one year fixed deposit pounds with Landsbanki Guernsey on September 24th.   \nFollowing nationalisation of Landsbanki Iceland, Landsbanki Iceland was placed into administration.\nLatest bulletin from administrator Rick Garrad as follows -\n\u201cThe main reason for the Bank\u2019s difficulties has been the placing of funds with Heritable Bank, which is in Administration.\u201d \n\u201cThere are significant liquid funds available to the Bank and we are doing everything we can to enable a part payment to depositors and creditors to be made as soon as possible.\u201d  \n\nTherefore there is likely to be a shortfall to depositors.      Perhaps the Prime Minister can also exert political pressure on the Guernsey authorities to represent the interests of depositors - they appear to have been invertebrate to date.   There are many Britsh Nationals & Channel Island depositors who have invested their life savings in Landsbanki Guernsey, heartbreaking stories of which can be read online at www.thisisguernsey.com.  \n\nJOHN CABRELLI",
