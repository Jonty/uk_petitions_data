        "background": "Introduction of symbolic prices for public services / community projects\n\nDear Sir or madam\n\ndue the situation of the public finances - the fairest way to raise money without increasing taxes is by introducing Pay-by-use symbolic prices widely used in Europe but not in the UK.\n\nFirst, symbolic prices are very low fares that cover basic cost for services without making a profit for the service provider helping run the service and providing stability over the long term while avoiding the abusing use of the service.\n\nFirst, museums should charge a \u00a31 or \u00a32 per person to cover basic services. Schools children should have a 10 times ticket per week to cover genuine school trips. The BBC license fee should be symbolic \u2013 say \u00a320 per year (compare with any other country very high). \n\nSimilar use of symbolic prices should be identified in sectors such as schools, libraries, hospitals, transport, social benefits, etc. A study should be carried out to identify areas where these symbolic prices make sense and are convenient.",
