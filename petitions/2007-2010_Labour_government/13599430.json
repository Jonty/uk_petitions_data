        "background": "EMA is paid to students whose parents earn less than \u00a330,810, as an incentive to continue their education. However, if it is an allowance for the student, why is means-tested? I don't know of any students earning over \u00a330,810 per annum! Just because your parents earn over that threshold, does not mean they are in a position to hand out the equivalent amount of monies to you. They are busy paying their taxes, working hard and making their own way in life. EMA should be paid to every student regardless of parents income, or it should be totally scrapped. Every student has the right to be treated equally and fairly. It's penalising students from slightly more affluent families because their parents are not sponging off the state. Where's the sense in that?",
