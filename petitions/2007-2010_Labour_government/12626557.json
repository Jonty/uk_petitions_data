        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Many primary schools were built in the Victorian era and do not meet the needs of contemporary education.  Disability access is often extremely poor and alterations to accommodate physically impaired pupils and staff are not affordable under current funding models. \n\n'Temporary' accommodation, in the form of portable structures, is widespread in primary schools.  These classrooms inherently suffer from poor lighting and ventilation. Pupils are exposed to extreme high temperatures in the summer terms.  Such classrooms may remain in place for decades, exposing generations of pupils to sub-standard educational surroundings.\n\nWe call upon the Prime Minister to create parity across the education system and introduce a nation-wide programme for modernising our primary schools.  We call the for the use of 'temporary' accommodation for extended periods to be stopped and for pupils and staff to be able to work in healthy and accessible conditions.",
