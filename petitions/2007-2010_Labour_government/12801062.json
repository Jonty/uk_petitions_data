            "background": "Internet-capable mobile phones and laptops with 3G internet are becoming more common. The extra capabilities these features offer are however held back by data carriers not providing with services at least as fast as EDGE (the fastest '2G' mobile communication standard, with widespread coverage in the USA), and '3G' (providing faster data rates and with almost total coverage in Japan). \nConsumers in the UK are currently wasting their money on a service they cannot receive, and I would like something to be done to make the service available to everyone in the UK, should they want it, by June 2011.",
