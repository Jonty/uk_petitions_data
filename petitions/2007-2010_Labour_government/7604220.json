            "background": "St. Georges Cross, Glasgow car park is just an example. An almost empty car park, void of cars and of customers. Because the car park is adjacent to the shops it does not necessarily mean that the shops own the car park. Infact, you may find that the council owns the land that the car park is situated on. Therefore why not remove these dodgy private car parking companies who operate from the other end of the country and allow motorists who more than pay their fair share of road tax and other running costs to maintain their right to better access and therefore allowing increased trade for the shops. Why should motorists be penalised and why should shops go without business simply because of these crazy restrictions that benefit absolutely no one?",
