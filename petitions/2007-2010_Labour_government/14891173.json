            "background": "At present, the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 disallows adultery as grounds for divorce if one continues living with an adulterous partner for longer than six months after it became known that adultery has been committed.\nIn short, this means that if someone spends over six months trying to repair their marriage before ultimately deciding it is impossible, they cannot divorce their partner on the grounds of adultery.\n\nI feel this is unfair as if one doesn\u2019t initially consider divorce an option and seek legal advice immediately, it is all too easy to exceed this restrictive six month deadline and find oneself unfairly penalised and unable to easily divorce due to putting time and effort into fixing one\u2019s marriage.\n\nI hereby petition the Prime Minister to remove any time constraints on divorce on the grounds of adultery.",
