A person who commits treason is known as a traitor.\n\nOran's Dictionary of the Law (1983) defines treason as: \"...[a]...citizen's actions to help a foreign government overthrow, make war against, or seriously injure the [parent nation].\n\nI believe that Gordon Browns actions regarding the EU Treaty are an act of Treason and that he should be prosecuted accordingly.\n\nAnd that as the Office of Prime Minister of Great Britain is an elected office and as Mr Brown has not been elected to that office, a legal review should be held as to exactly what powers he has under British law as it maybe found that he does not have the legal right to sign the Treaty as he is not an elected official under British law.",
