            "background": "The Government have offered grants for cavity wall insulation.BUT OAPs who own other types of houses are still spending hundreds of Pounds that go straight outside through their un-insulated walls. Why won't the Government extend these grants to those having such houses, enabling them to e.g. apply a special rendering to insulate the walls from outside? The average 3 beds semi-detached would need approx. \u00a35-6,000 to do it. On a Pension that's impossible, but OAPs still have to pay astronomical amounts to their energey suppliers, if they don't want to be cut off their gas or electricity altogether.",
