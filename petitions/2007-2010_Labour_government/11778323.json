            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Exeter City Council and Devon County Council have announced plans to close a partially funded play scheme in the school holidays for children in the Exeter area. The play scheme is Splash, and it provides quality childcare for special needs children, and infant and junior age children while their parents work in the holidays. The scheme supports 36 staff, and is being threatened with closure for a reputed shortfall of \u00a310,000 in order to pay a full time coordinator. This closure is mad, even more upsetting when you consider that the councils are continuing to spend money on sculpture and other forms of art work to apparantly improve our city, but chooses to neglect the needs of it's residents, and especially those of the children and families who live there. If this is allowed to happen, it is unlikely that there will be enough childcare provision in Exeter for all children needing it, so this will result in parents either giving up jobs, or letting thier children run riot in the streets, increasing without a doubt the crime, and antisocial behaviour in our lovely city.",
