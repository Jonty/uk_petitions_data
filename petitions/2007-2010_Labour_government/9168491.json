This is not on if a Mars bar has a standard then that is a Mars bar, okay if the price has to go up fine, so long as the standard remains the norm and remains unaltered.\nMaybe many like myself are fed up wiping your backside on an ever decreasing till roll.\nPlease help the campaign to address these unequal standards.",
