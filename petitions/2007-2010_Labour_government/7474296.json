            "background": "In 1986 ownership of the cemetery passed from the Greater London Council to Tower Hamlets and in 1990 the Friends of the Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park was set up. Seven years ago the park became the borough's first nature reserve and it is now tended by 1,600 volunteers. It is home to 27 species of butterfly, a rare bumble bee, woodpeckers, sparrowhawks and the elusive firecrest. Some 8,000 schoolchildren visit every year for outdoor nature lessons. \n\nThe council is considering making this park a multi-faith cemetery which would, in their view, necessitate clearing it out and starting afresh. \n\nTo even consider digging up 350,000 graves and destroying a wild life park because the demographics of the borough have changed is grossly insulting to our dead and would damage the local environment immensely.  Space should be found elsewhere.",
