            "background": "Chewing gum is a disgusting product. It makes the streets untidy with people dropping their chewed gum onto the pavements. Thus covering pavements with white dots. Removing the chewing gum which is stuck onto the ground costs millions of taxpayers' money every year, which should be spent on something better than this.\n\nSeeing people chewing whilst being professional looks awful as well. Plus there are some people that have to chew loudly which annoys a lot of people\n\nIf people need to freshen their breaths, there are dozens of mint sweets on the market which are digestivable.",
