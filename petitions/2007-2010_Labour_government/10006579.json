            "background": "With ever increasing energy prices, it is time to revisit the pricing model used by electric and gas companies for consumers.  As you know, a higher price is paid on the primary units used, which punishes people using smaller amounts of energy, and helps those that use more as the secondary rate is lower.  This policy also encourages energy consumption.  This is especially punishing for low income people, as they are subsidising the higher usage customers.  How about going to a flat rate across the board which will even things out for everyone, especially the elderly and low income families.",
