However there is a point where thier expenditure of the tax payers money reaches and MPs have surpassed this. \n\nThey have exploited the system and have the responsibility of repaying the money.\n\nFraud is illegal in this country so why should it be legal for them.\n\nPlease sign this petition and send a clear message to the Prime Minister and his fellow MPs",
