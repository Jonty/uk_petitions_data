        "background": "i strongly feel that the abortion limit should be lowered to 16 weeks. having seeing a close friend give birth to twins at 23+ weeks who sadly lost there fight for life. after this experience and seeing other babies & families go through the same, and seeing how developed they were at such a young gestation, and still managed to develop well enough to go home & lead normal healthy life. i feel the limit for abortions now is wrong as it's a developed child and is no longer a fetus, and should be given the human rights we have.",
