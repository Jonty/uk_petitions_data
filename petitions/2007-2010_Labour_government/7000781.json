        "background": "To deduct Leeds United 10 points at the end of last season (which was a huge penalty as it led to their relegation) plus to deduct them a further 15 points at the start of this season (25...yes TWENTY FIVE point deduction in total) which was voted for by football teams including teams from the same league as Leeds seems to be unfair and morally incorrect as they are Leeds Uniteds comptetitors and would do anything to gain an advantage over Leeds United. bearing in mind the injustice of the matter regarding the teams chosen to vote against Leeds the 15 point deduction should be wiped out or at the very least an indendant panel of judges should be appointed to reconsider the outcome",
