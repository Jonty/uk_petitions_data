        "background": "to stop dog owners selling on puppies or adults purely for the purpose of breeding, not just on the internet, but local papers, advertisers, shop windows etc. It might just help stopping puppy farms, and people breeding purely to make money out of their dogs. A proper accredited breeder knows the score on breeding, the laws etc, so wouldn't affect them",
