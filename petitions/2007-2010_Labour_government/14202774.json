            "background": "I believe that the number of ultrasounds during pregnancy should be increased as having only 2 and the final one being around 21 weeks i not enoough. Many people are finding that problems are arising after this time and it is often too late to intevene allowing the pathway for premature births and babies born with difficulties. I feel that there should be a minimum of 3 ultrasounds given at approximetely 12 weeks 18 - 21 weeks and 26 - 30 weeks.",
