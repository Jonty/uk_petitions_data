Gordon Brown only thinks about himself, he doesnt see the lives that have been lost in this madness, he doesnt see the hurt families that never recover from loosing their son's, all because he wants results! If he wants results he should put skysports news on cause they will be the only results he will see, he is sending our boys out there to come back over in boxes, lives crushed. We are not getting no results from afghanistan, so its time to make a stand and bring these boys out! Save a life! sign my petition! Bring Them HOME!",
