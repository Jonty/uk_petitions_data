            "background": "Antipsychotic medication is used for a wide spectrum of non- psychotic illnesses. Stigma associated with psychotic illness is widely recognised and the New Horizons document highlights the importance of working to reduce this. Our recent study/work explored whether the word \u2018antipsychotic\u2019 is also connected with these negative connotations.\n\nConclusions\nThe results of this study indicate that the word \u2018antipsychotic\u2019 is associated with stigma and that this may be an additional factor that influences patients\u2019 concordance with these medications. This has not been extensively investigated in previous research. We would suggest that antipsychotic medication is given an alternative name in an effort to encourage patients to comply with treatment that may be beneficial to their mental health.\n\n\nWe understand this being an ambitious battle, but we remain confident and committed to bring about a change .We have started to explore other means of highlighting our concerns but in the all time we will require your full support and help",
