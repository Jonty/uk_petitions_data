            "background": "The majority of the public does not need a car with a large engine size. A maximum engine size limit of 2000cc should be brought in and then reduced over a number of years to 1400-1600cc. This should include all new cars produced and all imported cars. The time scale should be long enough to give manufacturers and consumers time to adapt and prepare.\n\nCars built or imported prior to this should remain expemt, in a similar manner to cars over a certain age being exempt from Car tax.\n\nA licencing system should apply for any vehicle over this engine size. These should only be granted to individuals and companies who can demonstrate a need for these vehicles and the absence of any suitable vehicle within the restrictions(eg: Tradesmen, Farmers, Rural Landowners).",
