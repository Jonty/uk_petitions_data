        "background": "Dance Lounge is a dance venue in Erith, Kent. Its has 4 dance studios and a MMA studio. Also a coffee lounge area. We host around 30 classes per week and give employment to 10 dance teachers. \n\nWe applied for our change of use in July 2007 and after various trips to the planning office to make ammendments our application went through in November 2007.\n\nOur application has been refused, we are located in a previous office building close to the train station and public transport routes.\n\nThe basis of the refusal is - 'The continued use of the premises for a class D\" use results in the loss of viable commercial unit within a Primary Employment Area'.\n\n90% OF THE SURROUNDING COMMERCIAL UNITS ARE EMPTY!!!!!!!!!! WE ARE NOT IN A PRIMARY EMPLOYMENT AREA AND AROUND 10 PEOPLE WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS IF THE COUNCIL CLOSE US!!! And our guest lose their hobby and dance venue.\n\nWe have all different types of adults and children come to take part in our classes and we have worked hard to make it an amazing venue. Please sign this petition to show your support for Dance Lounge.",
