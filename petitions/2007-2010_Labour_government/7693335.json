For over 45 years Des O\u2019Connor has brought his unique humor, timing and effortless interviewing skills to thousands of fans in the UK and worldwide. Fans that literally grew up watching his shows, laughing together as a family; due to the shows appeal for all ages. Over the years 100's of \"rookie\" comedians and musicians spotted by Des, were given their break on his show and went on to become stars in their own right. Bradley Walsh, Jo Pascquale, Jethro, to name a few. It is time we honored his contribution to entertainment, and mentoring skills to others moving up the precarious show business ladder. He is an icon in light entertainment, and has brought joy and laughter to thousands. Des was currently voted the most inspiring over 50, in the UK. Voted by his peers. His appeal spans the ages from 15 - 100 what other entertainer has that ability, and has held that respect for so long. He is truly a legend, and a national treasure.",
