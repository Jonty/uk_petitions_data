            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The current speed limit for large goods vehicles on single carriageway roads is 40 mph (raised from 30mph about 40 years ago) This creates excessive tail backs on busy A roads e.g A46 south of Newark and leads to dangerous overtaking manoeuvres by frustrated car drivers together with aggressive behaviour by the same car drivers who do not know the law. Vehicle technology has improved dramatically since the 40mph limit was introduced - air brakes, disc brakes on lorries and ABS systems have all been introduced in that time - therefore todays LGV are perfectly safe at that speed on many wider single carriageway roads.",
