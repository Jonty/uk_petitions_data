            "background": "Tesco again plans to expand in Clevedon and to make such an investment must anticipate getting substantially more business, which will put extreme pressure on the local businesses which have been loyal to Clevedon, and experience shows that they cannot compete, and therefore have to withdraw their loyal business, and Clevedon will loose its unique choice and its still active Town Centre, so can we take that risk??\n\nThere has been some amendment to the original plans, but if they were so in touch with what Clevedon wants, why did they not get it right first time?? The changes are nominal and the basic design and layout hasn\u2019t changed much, other than the height of the store.\n\nThe environmental issues still remain as well, with increased traffic and fumes, more heavy lorries to  supply the additional goods, plus more late night deliveries, which is a problem to the neighbourhood with the existing store.  Do they honestly believe people will use public transport more instead of the cars they now use??\n\nThe existing site is adequate and meets the needs of Clevedon.",
