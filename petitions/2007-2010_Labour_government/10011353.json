            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Everyday we hear more and more about the problems of global warming and the potential dangers to our planet if nothing is done. However, peculiarly, nobody ever puts across the case for hydrogen fuel cells while this Labour government uses propaganda to convince us that nuclear power is the only alternative. But this isn't true, nuclear power pollutes the atmosphere, produces nuclear waste, which we still have no viable means of managing, and is definately not safe. Hydrogen power on the other hand gives off, at most, water vapour and even though hydrogen fuel cells have a chance of exploding, so do nuclear power stations, which would have much more devastating effects. Hydrogen fuel would also cut our dependence on foreign oil and would considerably reduce our CO2 emissions and, with research, we can ensure that hydrogen fuel cells are as safe as possible. If this government is genuinely determined to safeguard the future of this planet it will take this petition seriously and give up its ridiculous nuclear power programme.",
