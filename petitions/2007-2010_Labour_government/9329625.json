        "background": "The decision by the EU to make the electronic identification of sheep compulsory from 2010 means that the increasing financial and practical burdens placed upon UK farmers will place them at a competitive disadvantage compared with importers into the EU, as the standards with which importers have to comply are well below those required of UK farmers. \n\nThe technology used for the electronic identification of sheep also has major flaws, including reliability, which brings into question the credibility of the decision.\n\nThe Government should therefore fight for all the concessions permitted with regard to the compulsory introduction of the electronic identification of sheep, while making it clear that the actions of the EC are premature, disproportionate, and unjust for the UK sheep industry.",
