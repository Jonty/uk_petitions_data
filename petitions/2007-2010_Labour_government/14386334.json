            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The domestic heating oil price has increased by 35% in the last month alone.\nThis increase has coincided with the extreme cold weather forcing people to spend additional money, when they can least afford it. This increase is not due to a big change in crude oil prices and this has only increased by just over 10% in the last month. If this increase had been made to gas or electricity prices it would have been criticised throughout the national press.\nAs can only be put down to profiteering by the oil companies I believe the domestic heating oil price needs to be controlled to ensure fairness to the consumer who needs to use this, quite frequently because gas is not an option.",
