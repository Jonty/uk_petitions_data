            "background": "In recent speeches both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition spoke about the need for the provision of next generation broadband services to increase productivity and allow more people to work from home with video conferencing etc. However, neither BT nor Virgin plans to roll out fibre-optic across the country. In addition Britain is falling further behind other developed countries such as France and South Korea (43Mb/s average) and Japan (94Mb/s average). \n\nTherefore, as the government is trying to stimulate the economy by bringing forward many public works projects why is some money not being spent either subsidising or paying for the extension of fibre-optic broadband?",
