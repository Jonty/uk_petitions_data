The bank is now actually having to turn down customers wanting to invest. I think that this is wrong and shouldn't be allowed, other banks have no caps, (I think), or if they do, their limits far exceed 1.5% of the market.\n\n\nHonestly I dont know that much about banks but im pretty sure im right, if not, sorry.",
