            "background": "As England, Scotland, Wales & Both Northern Irerland & Eire National Football Teams are out of National European Championships next year. Maybe we can bring back the British Home Tournament. and get all the 4 Home Nations FA's and ask Eire if they want to join in. It would be good for the UK & Ireland, It's worth a Think anyway. As PM Mr Brown is the PM for England,Scotland,Wales & N.Ireland, he can ask the FA's at a Meeting Etc which is in his Remit Fact!! I think this Tournament would bring a feel good factor to the UK and bring Revenue to all the UK that the Government can get a slice too. SO please Mr Brown talk to the FA's for all Football fans across the UK.",
