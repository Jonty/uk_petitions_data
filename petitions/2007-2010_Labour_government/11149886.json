        "background": "Due to the end of European funding in December 2008, IT courses will no longer be available in the new year.  Considering the importance of digital technology it is vital that older people have the opportunity to learn new media skills.  Without such opportunities I fear that members of the community will suffer and be further excluded.  Despite the success of the projects in the Llynfi Valley, which have surpassed all targets the excellent tutors will be lost to the community here in the Llynfi Valley.",
