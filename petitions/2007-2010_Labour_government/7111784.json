            "background": "Alistair Darling\u2019s Finance Bill 2008 proposes a regressive \u00a330,000 levy on non-domiciled workers with more than 7 years residence, coupled with the option to be taxed on worldwide income. The proposal unfairly singles out non-affluent foreigners who work here and support the UK economy. It is a gratuitous slap to some of the UK\u2019s most industriousness taxpayers and is grossly skewed in favour of the super-rich, who can effectively avoid millions of pounds of tax by opting to pay \u00a330,000. It is made even more painful in that it is a surcharge not a tax, so it cannot be offset by a foreign tax credit. Surely the Government\u2019s intentions are noble, but the proposal conveys a churlish and even hostile attitude to foreign workers by implying that they are fair game for a tax grab -- is it mere coincidence that they do not have the right to vote?  This proposal should be abandoned altogether, or at least revised to affect only non-doms with more than 17 years residence. Thank you for signing!",
