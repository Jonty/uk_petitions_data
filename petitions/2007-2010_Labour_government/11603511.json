            "background": "Britain regularly hears of shocking stories concerning murder and violence on our streets. \n\nAlmost always, these instances concern young people, who show no care for the current extent to which they are punished for their crimes. Therefore, tougher penalties should be imposed upon the thugs, vandals and anti-social people of society.\n\nThe tougher penalties make sense; not only will they punish the offenders correctly, they will also deter future instances of anti-social behaviour and violence. \n\nMany peoples lives have been shattered by the irresponsible actions of those who mock the current justice system, and have no fear of a short prison sentance or, indeed, an 'ASBO'.\n\nPeople dream of a society free of fear, free of violence and free of anti-social behaviour from those of all ages. This dream, I believe, can come true.",
