        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Bolton Council is felling the majority of the trees in Queens Park.. A park without trees amounts to little more than a field. With tree plantation encouraged by everyone from councils to schools to charities it seems ludicrous to be chopping trees in urban areas.  Green spaces are needed in urban areas. Most locals want trees  as part of their green area. It is extremely ecologically unsound to destroy the ecosystems which exist within the park. If the plans go ahead  creatures will die and  habitats will suffer. \nThe Council state their reasoning as follows; \n*improve the view of the lake \n*restore the park back to a Victorian style \n*cut crime  \nThese reasons are ridiculous. \n*Due to the age of many of the trees is it obvious that the Victorians  planted them.\n*Crime in the park is unlikely to be reduced by a reduction tree numbers. Statistically speaking  few crimes are committed because criminals  have a tree to hide behind. Unless a vast amount of CCTV cameras are erected. \nPlease sign our petition .",
