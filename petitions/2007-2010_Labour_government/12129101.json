            "background": "In recent years, we have seen government ministers follow blatantly or apparently illegal policies with little regard to the law.  This has included many violations of international laws (the Iraq war, co-operating with torture and 'extraordinary rendition'), human rights laws (for example, imprisonment without trial) and data protection laws (the ContactPoint database, the various ANPR databases, and so forth).  \n\nIn virtually all cases, the legal problems were identified in advance, but simply ignored.\n\nHow can we respect our government if it appears to constantly engage in casual criminality?\n\nTo resolve this problem, I propose that the principle of ministerial immunity be discarded in the case where it is clear that the proposed action is illegal in advance.  All laws and policies should also be inspected in advance (as per the Swedish system).",
