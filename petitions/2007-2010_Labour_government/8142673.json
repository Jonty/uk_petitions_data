            "background": "Terror-Free Oil Initiative is an American based project that is dedicated to encouraging Americans to buy fuel that originated from countries that do not export or finance terrorism.\n\nI believe the UK government should establish similar aims and not import fuel from coutries of this sort. This would include Oil from Suadi Arabia, Gas and oil from Iran. In doing this we cut the supply of money to regimes like these who are known funders of terrorism.\n\nThis would also mean the UK will not be fuel dependent on the turbulent Middle East. This would in turn lower fuel prices fro UK consumers.\n\n\"The world is a dangerous place, not because of those who do evil, \nbut because of those who look on and do nothing.\"",
