            "background": "This government has actually reduced military spending as a %age of GDP at the same time the economy is growing turtle-like slowly. Real defence spending (if accounted for inflation) has remained flat. Britain spends less on its military ($120 bn) than Russia ($260 bn thanks to Putin) and China (ca. $140 bn). The MOD has reduced the numbers of equipment (e.g. ships) below the level envisaged by the 1998 SDR, which anticipated a PEACETIME situation, not two wars. Next time this is discussed in the HOC, please be honest.",
