The recent hike in prices would be a thing of the past if these companies were put under state hands,with external monitoring to ensure standards are met. Profits would be given back to the company for the benefit of consumers and prices could be means tested to those in financial difficulties. It should not be allowed that people cannot afford  light, heat and water, a basic right of all of us",
