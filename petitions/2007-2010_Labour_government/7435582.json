            "background": "When the petrol prices were averaging 95.1p per litre around 63p of that was tax. This petition is to try and reduce the amount of tax on petrol and get in back under \u00a31 a litre.  High petrol prices dont stop people driving. If you drive to work you will still drive to work, if you drive your children to school you will still drive. All high petrol prices do is add cost to the average person and in some circumstances mean that there standard of living is effected. Another point is that small business who need to travel are effected as costs increase and could cause them to stop trading.",
