            "background": "No one should have to do anything that they don't want to do.  Most adults are able to resist unwelcome pressure, but most children are not.  Coercion (which, in my opinion, verges on bullying) is usually counterproductive and often screws kids up for life.  All children should have access to a complaints, mediation, arbitration and appeals system and they should be trained regularly in how to use it effectively to resist unwelcome pressure.",
