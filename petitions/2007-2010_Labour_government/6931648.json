            "background": "As responsible parents, we do not wish to take our children out of school during term-time - and now that the school regulations have forbidden it we have no choice to book our annual holidays in synch with school holidays. Why, at PEAK season are holiday and travel companies allowed to charge almost double prices during this time. Surely it is time for the Government to take part-responsibility in controlling the price hikes as they are also responsible for governing the holidays.\nThe companies are holding the parents to ransom as the only other alternative is to stay at home.",
