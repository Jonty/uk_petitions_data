            "background": "The UK will soon face a major employment problem when several thousand graduating students enter the UK jobs market.  Rather than subsidise pseudo internships, in which they will largely be used as cheap labour to prop up inefficient industries, all graduates should be required to spend a year using their new skills in Third World countries such as Zimbabwe and Darfur, where the need for skills and knowledge is far higher than in the UK.  This will fulfil the desire many students have for a gap year whilst keeping others off the dole, and simultaneously increase the UK\u2019s influence whilst reducing the direct cash-aid that goes largely into various Dictator\u2019s pockets.",
