            "background": "Currently most electrical devices use propritary chargers and sockets requiring multiple chargers to be manufactured.\n\nAll homes have multiple chargers and when traveling fuel and space is wasted transporting these chargers.\n\nRegulations should be introduced to force all manufacturers of portable electronic devices to standardise on one charger format (i.e. mini usb). This will reduce the amount of electronics being manufactured and going to landfill.\n\nHaving a charger with the device should be optional, with a refund from the price should you not require it.",
