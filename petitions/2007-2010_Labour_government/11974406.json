The only exception being in time of total war, when parliamentary democracy has been suspended, and there is a government of war-time coalition. Furthermore, should an elected politician change their politicial allegiance during their tenure of office, such an act will immediately prompt a by-election in order that their constituents can make a positive decision as to whether or not they wish that individual to continue to represent them.",
