        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Sytems of organ donations and transplants differ widely between the 27 EU states. The petitioner is calling on the P.M. to involve Indian authorities in this - because the sale for profit of body parts still takes place. In light of the murder of Scarlett Keeling, please reassure the British electorate (and healthcare professionals) that British subjects are not involved in this trade and that the British govt is doing all it can to ensure no person has been either injured or criminally affected by illegal trading in organs for transplantation. \n\nThe undersigned agree to the recommendations in the resolution only adopted at committee stage at present : \n\n1. A new European donor card, to complement existing national systems; \n2. A transplant 'hotline', staffed 24 hours a day, to provide relevant and accurate information; \n3. A European Directive setting out requirements for safe and high-quality organ donation across the EU; \n4. That measures be taken to prevent 'transplant tourism' and organ trafficking.",
