As a wife of a man who was made redundant at 27 from a large firm from him working from 16 it was so degrading for him, the government make it more difficult by advising him that if he does not find work within 6 months his benefit will still stop regardless, with the fear of us losing everything. This is not right when i know people even family members i am ashamed to say who have been on benefits since leaving school, a few small time jobs along the way, how is that fair?",
