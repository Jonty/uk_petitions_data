            "background": "Annorexia is a terribly and sometimes fatal illness which affects thousands of people, some as young as 8 or 9.    Although there are some sites that are there to help people with annorexia, there are some sites, called Pro-ana, or pro-mia, sites, that actively encourage this awful disease. \nHow can this be allowed?\nI think these sites should be shut down and made illegal as they  are encouraging impressionable people -especially youngsters - into a very unhealthy and potentially fatal lifestyle. \nAnd anyone caught promoting or running these type of sites should be charged for endangering lives.",
