            "background": "'prisions are over subscribed'. Its another drain on the community, burden on the taxpayer and frustration to the victims families. Why should a person who commits a crime which involves intended suffering and murder be housed with all 3 meals cooked,laundry and washing done and luxuries such as pool tables. take prisions back to the 'shawshank' days of having to run the prisons themselves with only close supervision till the day of the'green mile' arrives.\nNo-one should be able to murder and be released, life for a life.\nTheir criminal actions have broken many rules of the human rights act so all human rights should be taken away from them. deter people away from committing such criminal and serious crimes by making the punishment hell on earth.\nStrip the criminals of arrogance, pride, human rights and anything else that makes them feel human. The pain the affected families feel should be passed onto the criminal, make them realise what they have done. Capital punishment is the only way to deter people away from crime, save the taxpayers money and prevent more over crowding!!",
