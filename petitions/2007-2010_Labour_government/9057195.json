            "background": "The minumum drinking age at home should be raised from 5 to 16 at least so that underage binge drinking in the home is stamped out AS WELL AS on the streets. Making the minimum drinking age at 5 at home is ludicrious and in Europe and everywhere else it's around 16. Change this now!!! Also random police checks should be introduced into all lit up houses every now and again so that it makes it harder for children to have parties with alcohol in the home because they would know that the police might give them a surprise visit. If they caught then appropriate action should be taken",
