            "background": "While we recognise that Dutch MP, Geert Wilders, is a controversial figure in European politics - we unequivocally deplore the decision of the British govt to appease threatening, intolerant religious groups in our pluralist society by depriving Mr Geert Wilders of his right to free speech in the UK. \n\nJust as it's impossible to physically destroy an ideology, it's equally impossible to shield an ideology from criticism and verbal attack. It is imperative - for the sake of long-term inter-community dialogue - that people are permitted to speak their minds without the lingering threat of physical harm from those who deem the exercise of free speech to be 'offensive'.",
