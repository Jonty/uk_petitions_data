            "background": "Many Train Operating Companies have subscribed to the Department for Transports Rail Penanlty Fares Policy, which prevents fare evaders from having free journeys. The concept of this policy is good- in fact it is fair, but in reality some TOC's do not carry out all conditions of the policy, and so innocent passengers who do pay fares are being charged penalty fares at trains or destination stations, as their origin station did not have any ticket facilities, but are yet stil accussed of fare evasion.",
