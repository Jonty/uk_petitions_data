These fulfil a great need for learning new skills and meeting other people. I have retrained for 2 new careers during my life due to these, and gone on to university. And seen many people drag themselves through very difficult parts of their lives, with these courses giving them something to achieve at. They are great places for young and old. Often the old are ignored these days, and this is part of our communities.",
