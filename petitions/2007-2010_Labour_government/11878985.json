            "action": "introduce emergency legislation to ban the use of all wild animals by circuses in the UK",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "It is time to outlaw the abhorrent exploitation of wild animals such as elephants, tigers, lions, camels and chimpanzees, among others, in circuses, where they are forced to do demeaning and unnatural tricks for the entertainment of humans who should know better.  Many of us remember the distressing tv footage of the elephant enduring a prolonged beating with an iron bar by a keeper in Mary Chippendale Circus, and the scandal involving the lady's own brutal treatment of a chimpanzee she claimed to love as it if had been her own child. Wild animals should be respected and while we may want to learn more about them, a circus is no place to do so. Please introduce legislation as soon as possible to prevent this travesty continuing, rather than phasing it out slowly.",
