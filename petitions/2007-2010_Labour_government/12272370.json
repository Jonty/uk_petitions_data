            "background": "Upon investigation it has been found that 99% of applicants, for different categories of Visa to enter the UK, are treated appallingly by the staff employed at the British Embassy in Tunis.\nWe request that everyone, regardless of Nationality is treated with courtesy, respect and politeness. We would ask that information is given to the time-lines indicated on the website and deliberately witholding information is stopped immediately. All staff should be made aware of customer service expectations and treat each person with respect. The application process for visitors visas to be reviewed and possible measures put in place enabling visitors visas to be more freely available, therefore protecting the British Citizen from marrying, sometimes, as the only way to obtain entry clearance to the UK. The long term effects would in fact stop `sham` marriages and thus, non genuine applicants being eligible to obtain ILR.\nShould Tunisians be allowed to visit the UK prior to marriage it would then allow each party to the relationship to experience life in both cultures and possibly stop them from entering into a marriage as the only way to be together.",
