            "background": "I propose that planning laws be changed, in the case of supply of green energy, i.e pylons and wind turbines, as a matter of urgency. Why are the minority allowed to object to Green Energy supply to the detriment of everyone else? Wind turbines are safer than nuclear power and dirty power stations. I would happily live with wind turbines in my back yard.and pylons which are a necessity. They can be taken down, when and if, no longer needed, as opposed to nuclear power stations, which leave a toxic legacy, lasting thousands of years. Nuclear power stations are by the coast. What happens when sea level rise and they flood, causing  devastion and pollution? Are the landowners, who object to pylons, going to allow houses, for displaced former coastal-dwellers, to be built on their land, when sea levels rise? I don't think so. Something needs to be done NOW before it's too late, if it isn't already. We have an amazing supply of wind in this country and should utilise it to the full for the benefit of us all and people who object to pylons spoiling their view are completely antisocial. Please sign this petition to help us all and our children for the future.",
