We use the interest to help children who are sick or disabled, who have nowhere else to ask for help. We can open an account with Halifax for 2.4 % gross /2yrs, but same Halifax account for personal customer is 3.71% gross / 2yrs.\nWhy can we not be equal to personal customers? Can you make the interest rates the same for charities and personal customers please, for the banks that the taxpayer owns majority of like Halifax?",
