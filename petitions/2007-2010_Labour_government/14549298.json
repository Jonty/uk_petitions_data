            "background": "Currently employed mothers have 39 weeks paid Statutory Maternity Pay, self-employed mothers have the same - 39 weeks paid Maternity allowance. Employed fathers have 2 weeks paid paternity leave but self-employed fathers have no Paternity Allowance. This is very unfair as it means a lot of self-employed fathers cannot afford to spend time bonding with their new baby. Self-employed people pay tax just like employees, as well as often creating jobs, so why are they treated so unfairly?",
