        "background": "\"Steiner Waldorf schools have been in existence for around 100 years. Other countries with noted education achievements have these schools as state funded. Diversity and choice should be under parental jurisdiction where their children\u2019s education is concerned and not subject to financial status alone. Steiner Waldorf schools have been the subject of a government research document and the findings were positive. This education system has an outcome of social reform which is much needed and never more so than now. Our government can do something positive for education and create more schools of this kind. These are not faith schools but offer access to children of any faith/denomi.\"",
