We believe that example is concisely summed up in one man - Stephen Fry. A man who shines in film, tv, print, radio, whose erudite knowlege informs us all. Who father was a physicist & inventor. Whose grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Surany, Slovakia. His voice leads us through the Hitchhikers Guide and Harry Potter. He has also recorded audio versions of works by Roald Dahl, Michael Bond, A. A. Milne, Anthony Buckeridge and Douglas Adams, as well as several of his own books. Heck, he's even written a script for a remake of The Dam Busters!",
