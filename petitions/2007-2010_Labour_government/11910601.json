            "background": "We think there is too much violence on TV.\nWhilst there may be arguments over the cast iron proof of whether it does or does not impact on every day life, we who sign this believe for certain images in the media STRONGLY influence people's thoughts.\nTherefore, we ask that violent images are treated as serious as health information and ask that the small details be worked out, but seek to immediately request a new order of vetting of violent images in the media, and the number and nature of these images are reduced as of now. If there is any doubt, we ask something not to be broadcast.\nThe images we are seeing, whilst not wishing to give specific examples are becoming more shocking each year, as tolerance grows due to exposure familiarity.\nIn sum, we ask there to be an immediate clampdown.\nWe ask this as we strongly believe this strongly encourages crime subconciously, impacts on violence and care about its impact on large and small scale society.\nIts need has never been greater, so experiment and perhaps for a fixed time reduce it, and see if there is an impact?",
