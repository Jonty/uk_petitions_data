            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Currently child maintenance is calculated by taking the following amounts - 15% 1 child,  20% 2 children and 25% 3 children or more.  This means that on a net earning of \u00a3200 per week the first child would have been entitled to \u00a330 per week.  A new child is then claimed for and the amount claimed is \u00a340 per week and is split between the two children, a further child is added and the children will then recieve \u00a350 split in three. The original child is then entitled to just \u00a316.66.  At this point the csa will no longer increase the amount taken from the father, instead the money is taken from the child maintenance payments.  It is the responsibility of the father to ensure that if he is having children he can afford to pay for them, by the csa calculating payments in this way they are penilising the child rather tahn the father.  He should be made to pay for each child as extra to the original child/children and payments should not decrease to those original children.",
