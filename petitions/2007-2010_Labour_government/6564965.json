            "background": "BBC radio2 has been running a vote for the Icon of the last 40 years. Lara Croft was a thought highly enough to be included in the last 16 and was given a slot on the Chris Evans show for her prensentation. Every other candidate was given a proffesional 3 minute slot. When it came to Lara the presenters voice was speeded up so no one could understand it and was over in 30 seconds. Everone deservs a fair crack of the whip which she didn't get. To vote by text costs money and this is just another example of the BBC cheating it's viewers who vote by not alowing the full facts to be known and a biase being addopted on a presenters personal prefrance. I'm not saying she would have won but surly it should be a fair vote and candidates being treated equal.",
