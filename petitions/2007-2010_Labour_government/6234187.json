            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The Police have far too much power in the UK and a lot of what they do breaches Human Rights Legislation and there is no one body who controls the police force.  If they do something out of order, it gets swept under the carpet or an officer gets a rap on the knuckles and thats it.\nI would suggest we maintain the police force as it is, but counties elect their own police chief/superintendant every 2 years - then if there is a loss of faith by a community, they will vote in another police chief - at least then it is democratic, like the american system.\n\nI would also like laws to be county by county as well as a general law across the UK, but that is not the purpose of this petition.",
