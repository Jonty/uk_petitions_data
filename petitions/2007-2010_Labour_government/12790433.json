            "background": "Next year the government plan to change the way vehicles are taxed. Again. It is becoming ever more confusing to know what car you have to buy to avoid being charged silly amounts to have your suspension ruined. \nOther European countries have brilliant roads, even up some really big mountains. The council can't even do the road outside my house properly. \nIt is fair that we should pay to use the roads. But no more than a fiver for this rubbish. \nWhen I pay \u00a3200 for 12 months tax next year will my road be fixed? No. Instead my car will be ruined, and so will yours.\nOh, and dont forget all that money you pay for fuel.",
