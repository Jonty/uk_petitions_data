This is wrong!\n\nAn Academy should replace a long failing school, a good school should not be forced to close to give the justification to replace a smaller failing school with an Academy or to make such an Academy financially viable.\n\nWe ask the Prime Minister to intervene with Minister Balls to ensure that the school remains open.\n\nThis will mean that parents have an option to express choice and preference and allow a good school is to continue.",
