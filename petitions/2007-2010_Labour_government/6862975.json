We further urge the Prime Minister to use any lawful means at his disposal to bring pressure to ensure that this grave miscarriage of natural justice is overturned.",

            "background": "Hartley Alleyne, the former West Indies and Kent player, who worked as a coach at St Edmund's School in Canterbury, faces deportation after Home Office officials turned down a second request to remain in Britain.\n\nMr Alleyne has been turned down for a work permit, despite having achieved the GNVQ which was required. The professional cricketer and coach has been in this country for 29 years and has children who are British citizens living here.\n\nMr Alleyne has given a great service to sport in the UK over the past 29 years and it would be a travesty of natural justice were he to be forcibly sent to Barbados, a country he left when he was 21 years old.",
