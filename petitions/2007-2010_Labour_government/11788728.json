            "background": "On a BBC online video, Mr Wilders reads from the letter he received from the Home Office; it says his presence would 'threaten community harmony and therefore public security'.\nI am frankly aghast at the fact that this decision is being made in my name. I have seen his film 'Fitna' and while it should probably be classified as 'propaganda' there is nothing in it that makes it unsuitable for any adult to watch, and make up his or her own mind upon it.\nIn this country we have laws against behaviour likely to cause a breach of the peace which would be adequate to this occasion and I cannot fathom why it should be necessary to do anything other than remind Mr Wilders of those laws and allow him to enter the country unimpeded. The idea that 'community harmony' is more important than freedom of speech is terrifying.",
