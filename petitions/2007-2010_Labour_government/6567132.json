        "background": "The new charges and restrictions currently been proposed by Transport for London will make no differentiation between commercial and privately owned vehicles. This will mean that people will be forced to sell or otherwise dispose of their vehicles or pay \u00a3100 per day to use them in London. This is an infringement of their basic civil liberties and we the undersigned call upon this government to change the Low emission Zone remit to exclude privately owned vehicles from these restrictions and charges",
