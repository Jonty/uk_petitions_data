            "background": "There are patients that have medical conditions and need the support of the NHS. However there is a long process in doing so for those who need appointments in hospitals as well as treatments do not receive it fast enough. This issue should be looked at in great seriousness and be made a high priority which should be resolved, for it is the lives of others in the world at risk, the chance for them to continue their lives as normal and see the next day. In order for the PM ro resolve this issue he should consider increasing funds in hospitals in order for better a better policy to be put in place in hospitals for receiving appointments. We as citizens are waiting too long for our health to be looked at which by then maybe too serious to have a chance of being treated. Also new technology should be developed further to create artificial tissues or organs to replace those who have lost their's or had an organ damaged. The PM needs to acknowledge that patients are not receiving the medical help quick enough; this is an issue which must be discussed and dealt with in all effectiveness.",
