            "background": "There must be many people in this country who don't qualify for the motability componant because of their age.  This is because a disabled person needs to be on higher rate Disability Living Allowance before the age of 65 to qualify.  If a disabled person qualifies for higher rate DLA after this age the benefit they are given is Attendance Allowance.  Same amount of money just a different name.  However, Attendance Allowance doesn't have the motability componant which can obviously be used for a motability vehicle and free road fund tax.  We request that the motability componant is afforded to those on Attendance Allowance aswell as those in receipt of DLA.  As it stands we feel that there is discrimination on the grounds of age.",
