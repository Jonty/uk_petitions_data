            "background": "Deny permission for Sita UK to \"dispose\" of Low Level Radioactive waste at Keekle Head, Whitehaven, Cumbria, UK. As well as being very close to Whitehaven, Hensingham, Moresby Parks & Keekle, it is also extremely close to Two secondary schools, a special needs school, and an infants school. Additionally, the road infrastructure in the area is already congested at peak travel times, and is really unsuitable for the use of by large lorries, and there is already more than enough congestion on roads leading to those roads due to the pitiful state of the road infrastructure from Sellafield to the north. Additionally, Keekle beck runs through it, which flows on towards the south. In my opinion, waste sites should be chosen AWAY from Towns, not next door to them!\n\nFor more information, see http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cumbria/8154028.stm",
