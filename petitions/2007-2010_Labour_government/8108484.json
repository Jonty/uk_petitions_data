A convicted murderer should be given a minimum of 25 years BEFORE parole can be considered.\nThis would replace the current system where two people commiting the same crime receive two very different sentences.\nNew laws need to be bought in to cope with online paedophiles.\nJudges should not be able suspend sentences, if they commit a crime which is punishable with jail, they should serve their sentence in Jail.\nRepeat offenders should have their sentence double with each offence.\nPrisoners should be made to carry out hard labour.\nPrisoners rights to phonecards etc should be stopped.\nPrisoners familes should assist in the cost that person being in jail by contributing towards food, water and heating biils.",
