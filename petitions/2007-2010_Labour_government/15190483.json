            "background": "Aimed at single parent carers of young adults between the ages of 18 and 25 living the London Borough of Merton.\n\nBeing a carer there is no help for me caring for my child \u2013 the Government has let me and my child down when it comes to providing adequate care for us both \u2013 services offered are not sufficient. We receive no help with respite care.  No clubs or groups to join after college hours, if they do exist there is a waiting list.\n\nI believe that young carers save our Government billions each year in carers\u2019 fees, in return they get nothing from this Government. We need more Government funding to support the needs of carers and the young people they look after, day and night. \n\nI am willing to set up my own project if I can be granted the funding to do so, please help so these people can try to live a normal life, these young people need stimulation a purpose and consistency. Please don\u2019t just let their lives just slip away unnoticed. There is so much we do that is disregarded. \n\n\n\nA Mother.",
