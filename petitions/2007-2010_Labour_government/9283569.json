            "background": "The M606 car share lane was created at a cost of several millions of pounds yet connects 2 motorways where the possibility of car sharing is remote. Even at peak times, the lane carries few vehicles, mainly cars with one person in who either are ignorant of the restriction or choose to ignore it. Whilst workers sit in their vehicles queuing to get through traffic lights, this expensive white elephant remains largely unused. We call upon the prime minister to scrap the restriction and let the lane benefit all motorists",
