            "background": "I wish to protest most strongly against the proposed retrospective huge increases in road fund licences for the cars that emit most CO2. Most sensible people budget for what they feel they can afford and add something on for inflation. However these proposed increases defy all reasonable budgeting and their retrospective nature leaves those affected in an impossible position. Surely the recent increases in fuel prices are sufficient to dissuade those owning such vehicles from excessive pollution without your stealth taxes adding to the burden. Please reconsider before this becomes another 10p tax fiasco.",
