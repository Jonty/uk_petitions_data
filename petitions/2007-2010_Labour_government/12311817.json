        "background": "The MoD intends to reduce the pay band maxima for non-industrial civil servants at E1 and E2 pay bands. This will take effect from 1 May 2009. \n\nIt is completely unjust to penalise the lowest paid staff in the department by cutting their pay in such a manner. The MoD propose to cut consolidated \u2013 and contractual \u2013 pay and replace it with a non-consolidated allowance. \n\nIt is equally wrong to force thousands of hard working staff to accept non consolidated pay awards and also miss out on proposed additional progression payments based on length of service that staff with less service will receive. \n\nThe proposed pay \u2018protection\u2019 allowance is only guaranteed until 2010 and this will have a detrimental impact upon their future earnings and pensions.\n\nI ask that you personally intervene in this process so that we can find an acceptable solution to this problem. I know that my union, PCS, has proposed a number of ways to resolve this issue and I would hope that my employer would seriously consider these. I hope that you will agree that low paid government employees should not have to take a pay cut.",
