        "background": "This petition is to advise the public that in purchasing from Lush Cosmetics they are helping to support extremist groups.  The owner of this company funds Plane Stupid and encourages them to not only protest at airports but to commit serious crimes such as endangering aircraft and blocking runways. This kind of direct action does not help the environment one bit as it makes people hostile to the protesters' cause.  We urge the government to take a tougher line on groups such as Plane Stupid and those who support them.",
