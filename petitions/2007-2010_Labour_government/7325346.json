The only use of such a system is to exercise extreme control over the lives of individuals.  Means testing as operated by the tax credits system is extreme social engineering, the demonstrable goal of which is to keep the labour party in power.  After 10 years in Government there is a wider gap between the rich and poor.  \n \nBenefits should work by people who need it going to the post office with their personal details.  The rest of us should be entitled to keep our information personal.",
