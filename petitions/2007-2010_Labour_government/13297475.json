            "background": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to request the United Nations to take immediate action to clean up the \u2018The Great Pacific Garbage Patch\u2019. This large area of the Pacific Ocean currently contains over 3 million tons of assorted plastic debris and this amount is increasing rapidly. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is caused by major sea currents converging in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, bringing with them flotsam from countries bordering the Pacific. The world\u2019s shipping fleets also make a major contribution to this huge volume of rubbish. It is estimated that 90% of this flotsam is plastic, which is not biodegradable.\nAccording to the United Nations Environment Programme, plastic is killing a million seabirds a year, and 100,000 marine mammals and turtles. Virtually all of this wildlife will suffer terribly before they die.\nThis is a global problem that requires a global solution. Only the United Nations has the necessary financial and manpower resources to tackle it. So please Prime Minister, do something that will have a lasting impact on the health and biodiversity of our oceans \u2013 ask, no demand, that the United Nations cleans up this mess.",
