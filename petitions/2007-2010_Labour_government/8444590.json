        "background": "It seems to be common practise for buyers to suddenly drop the price that they have offered for a property, just before contracts are exchanged, thus causing considerable distress to the sellers and anyone else in a \"chain\" if the sale then collapses as a result of this most dishonourable practise! Once a price has been agreed upon and the property is deemed to have been sold, I ask that this price should be legally binding on both parties, as it is in Scotland.I know of no other commodity that just before a buyer is due to take possesion, he can suddenly offer a lesser price for it!That it can be done within the law when purchasing property is outrageous, dishonest and should be outlawed.",
