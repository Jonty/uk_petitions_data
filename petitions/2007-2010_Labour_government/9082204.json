He was the ringleader of a gang that set about and beat to death an innocent man, who simply requested that some anti-social kids leave the area having damaged his wife's car. He has now lodged an appeal against his sentence, which his solicitor described as \"robust\". I would ask the Prime Minister to consider this case, and those like it in the interest of Public protection and refuse the right of appeal to this young man and others like him, in order to act as a deterrent to this kind of behaviour which is destroying this country.",
