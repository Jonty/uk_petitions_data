            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The current system for recieving EMA is decided by means testing, which is completely unfair. Every 16+ student needs money to successfully complete their studies, and why should this be decided on the wages of their parents. Just because a student's parents earn over \u00a330,810pa doesnt mean that they pay their children \u00a330 a week to study. All these students will end up paying this money back through taxes when they successfully leave education anyway. Alot of students who dont recieve EMA have to work for minimum wage and if follow the guidelines can only work 8hours per week (as every hour worked over 8 hours drops a grade on average)and therefore earn less than that of an EMA reciever",
