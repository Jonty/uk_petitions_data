            "background": "Recruitment for the public sector is disorganised, inconsistent and wasteful; A 21st century government should use 21st century means of recruitment by creating a simple online jobs website entitled \"www.jobs.gov.uk\" - this website could operate in the same way as many of the successful online recruitment companies such as Monster or Milkround. \n\nThis site would be the one-stop shop for local and national government employers and potential applicants alike - this would eliminate the need for many advertising campaigns in the major media outlets with the only one required being an advertisement for this website, therefore saving millions for the taxpayer.",
