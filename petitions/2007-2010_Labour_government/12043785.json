        "background": "As a motorcyclist and a driving instructor in the making I see some scary things when out on the open roads. I feel that the more road information a learner/driver has the safer the roads would be. I therefore feel that what I have learned on 2 wheels should be included in any driving test as it gives another perspective in road craft and safety.",
