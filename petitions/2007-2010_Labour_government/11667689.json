        "background": "Families with small children should not be placed in blocks of flats. Children should have a private garden to play in. It's all good saying 'take you kid to the park' but with used needles littering the parks would you take your child or grandchild there?  We like others have to share a communal garden where your children can't play out there because of the fear of your children standing in or worse touching dog muck that some of the dog owners do NOT pick up after using the garden to let their dogs do their business in. Children should be able to enjoy a garden of their own, and parents should be able to feel safe letting their kids play outside without fear of a paedophile watching them. Please sign this.",
