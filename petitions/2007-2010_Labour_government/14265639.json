            "background": "Milton Keynes put forward a first-class bid to stage 2018 World Cup matches and won the right to do so fairly and squarely.\nThe club has come a long way in a relatively short time and has captured the imigination of a generation of young football supporters in the city.\nThe stadium and transport links are first class and Milton Keynes fully deserves its place alongside other great cities who won the right to stage World Cup matches.\nThe petty campaign to have Milton Keynes removed from the 2018 World Cup bid serves no purpose.\nThe people involved in that petition would be better off using their time and energy to ensure that England wins the right to stage the greatest sporting occasion in the world.",
