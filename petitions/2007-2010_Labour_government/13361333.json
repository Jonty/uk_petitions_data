            "background": "At current university students under the age of 25 are assessed for financial funding based on their parents income. Whilst low income families benefit from non repayable grants, the middle class students are left stranded with low loan amounts and huge fees to pay. It is not right that young people who have made the decision themselves to go into further education should be forced to rely upon their parents, who cannot necessarily afford to support them through university just because the Student Loans Company says they earn above a certain limit. Instead, all students should be classed as \"independent\" from their parents and assessed on an individual basis rather than based on their household income.",
