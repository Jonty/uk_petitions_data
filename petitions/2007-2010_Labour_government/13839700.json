            "background": "On the 30th of Octobre 2009, Alan Johnson, the Home Secretary called for the resignation of Professor David Nutt from his position as chair of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD). This came after Professor Nutt had delivered a lecture at the King's College London reiterating his view on the relative safety of drugs and calling for a drug policy that is led by scientific research.\n\nThe ACMD is an independant committee that should under no circumstances have to censor scientific evidence. Further, as part of its role in advising the government on drug policy it is essential that each member should be allowed to express their views, even if these are in contrast with views of members of the government or government policy.\n\nThe sacking of Professor Nutt is a direct form of censorship and endangers the councils mission, to provide indepedant scientific advice to the government. Therefore Professor David Nutt should immediately be reinstated as chair of the ACMD.",
