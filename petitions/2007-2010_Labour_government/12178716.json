            "background": "In the USA, the change to Daylight Saving Time was on Sunday the 8th of March this year. We in the UK have to endure a further 3 weeks of miserable short evenings with early darkness, before the clocks change to British Summer Time (BST) at the end of March.\n\nThe current date changes to BST are illogical, because the change to GMT is less than two months before the Winter Solstice, but we have to wait for over three months afterwards for the change back to BST. By early March the sunrise is early enough to allow most people to go to work or school in daylight.\n\nAdvantages of the change would include more time to indulge in outdoors activitivies after a normal working day, leading to improved fitness and a greater feeling of well-being. It would also keep us in line with the USA system.",
