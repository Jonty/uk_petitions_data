        "background": "The cause of the current tube strike is due to the militancy of RMT who still believe it's the 70's and the sitcom \"On the buses\" is a documentary.\n\nThey are essentially workshy and money grabbing tube monkeys who live in a world of pixies and fairies if they believe that if the company they work for goes out of business that they should not be affected in any way. \nDoes this happen in the private sector? No. So why should they be any different? \nAnd lets not forget that the reason why Metronet went out of business is in no small part due to the very same bone idle people not getting the job done in the time they were supposed to!\n\nSo I propose that all strike staff are immediately sacked and they are replaced with some of the 80,000 recently released prisoners who, due to the foresight of the current government, are now free and no doubt claiming benefits.",
