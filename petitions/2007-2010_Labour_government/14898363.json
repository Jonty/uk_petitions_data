Some biometric data can be correlated with race, sex and illness. The risk of loss of such irreplaceable data may be a disproportionate risk to the value of processing such data.\n\nBiometrics are currently being used for trivial purposes, such as school library systems, without a  legal requirement for consent - The ICO are using schedule 2.5 B&D of DPA as justification for this. If biometrics were recognised as sensitive information this would not be possible. \n \nA recent Bioethics paper on Biometrics  was very clear in this matter:\n\n\"The Council recommends that biometric data should be classified as sensitive personal information and as such afforded greater protection\"",
