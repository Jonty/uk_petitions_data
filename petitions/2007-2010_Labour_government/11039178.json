            "background": "Recently many ordinary people who are reliant on bank interest and bank dividend payments have lost a good percentage of their regular income through no fault of their own. Many are pensioners trying to supplement their abysmal state pensions who have been major losers despite having least say in any of the decisions. Bearing in mind the government's encouragement of ordinary people to save for their own future and avoid getting into overwhelming debts the measures on interest rates and bank dividends have disproportionately hurt the very people who have been the most sensible in order to reward directly those who have been least sensible by surrounding themselves in unaffordable debt. The incentive to save for the future is evaporating rapidly and a balancing measure to withdraw the tax on bank interest would not only help fufill the need to stimulate the economy it would also serve to alleviate the suffering by pinpoint targetting those most adversely affected.",
