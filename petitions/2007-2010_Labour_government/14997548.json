Mrs Johnson should not be able to die without knowing where her child is.  This is so cruel and my heart goes out to her.  I would help if I could and I'm sure a lot of other people would also.  Please, please find her little boy's body before she dies so that she can die in peace.  Ian Brady should be made to tell.",
