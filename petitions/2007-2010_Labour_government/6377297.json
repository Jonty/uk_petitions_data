They have limited or no intelligence, and there knowledge of technology is limited to mobile phones and ipods, where everything in their culture that plays music is referred to as an ipod, as they have an extremely short attention span due to the lack of a brain, meaning it is impossible for them to learn anything new, they know how to operate primitive electronic devices via a primordial instict from their teenage parents. They have no understanding of basic language, and they have a limited vocab. They are an imminent threat to national security, they are more dangerous than terrorists as they will attack you personally if you are not a chav. If they do take over we will no longer be the united kingdom, we will be the unikey kingdom of burberry.",
