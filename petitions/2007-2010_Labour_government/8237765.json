            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "There are proposals being discussed by Euro MPs and others (including a petition on 10 Downing Street's web site) to ban patio heaters on the grounds of their greenhouse gas emissions. It is claimed that they are unacceptably wasteful of energy and a needless source of CO2 emissions. However, they are no more wasteful than gas barbeques which bring great pleasure to millions during summer months. Is it reasonable, in a cool climate such as ours, to deny a few extra hours of outdoor pleasure in the evening, on the basis of barely detectable benefits to the environment - particularly when our more southern European neighbours have no need of similar heating, but certainly use considerable amounts of energy for cooling the air in summer. If we are going to ban patio heaters, why not also excessive heating, cooling or lighting in shops (particularly shop window lighting after closing time)? We have to find a balance. This country is dull enough without going over the top on eco-puritanism.",
