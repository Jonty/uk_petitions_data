We request that the Prime Minister makes any evaluation of the report solely upon its contents, with utmost integrity, and lets the report stand or fall in his opinion on the basis of the report's merits, and on no other criteria - be they matters of personal proclivity, approbation, or political consideration. \n\nIn short, we are requesting that the Prime Minister assess Richard Goldtone's report with equanimity, and gives it due justice come what may. \n\nWith thanks.",
