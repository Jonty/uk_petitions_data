        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Fantastic that it is that Electricite de France (EDF) wants to invest in Building New Nuclear Power Stations in the U.K. . There is the obvious reason that this isn't a charity venture.They want to exploit British customers for profit and the way the energy markets are going, BIG profit. Taking this line from another web site \"So what's the catch? EDF wants a system to guarantee the price of its electricity \". Such investment of Key energy making infrastructure to home and business should be invested in by Britain, for the benefit of Britains. Electricity at a fair price is essential for the U.K.'s business community as well as its domestc customers.  Gas and oil supply is predominantly in the hands of foreign players, isn't it about time G.B. invested in itself instead of looking for the quick fix of using someone elses purse !!",
