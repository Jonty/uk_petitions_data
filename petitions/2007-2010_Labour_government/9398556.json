        "action": "Extend the Higher Personal Allowance to women between the ages of 60 and 65 who receive a state pension",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Currently women receive a state pension at the age of 60 but are only eligible for the basic rate personal allowance for tax purposes as this does not discriminate between people of working age and those receiving state pension.  This means that if a woman is eligible for any pre-97 additional state pension because she paid additional national insurance contributions, she is currently liable for tax on up to almost half her current state pension because the higher personal allowance is only paid at the age of 65.  This certanly flies in the face of moves to bring Equality & Diversity into our society.",
