We state that most disabled people get greater benefit from tailored one-to-one tuition in their own homes than they would in a classroom situation.\n\nWe also believe that the government should fund this teaching and all training opportunities for disabled people in order to enable them to find work or further education where appropriate. Funds for teaching I.T. skills for social and daily use should also be made available.\n\nWe also believe the government should fund the provision of computers and specialist software and hardware where appropriate.",
