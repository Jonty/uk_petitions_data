            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "At the moment men who have worked with a company for less than 26 weeks are entitled to no paternity leave at all. Only men who have been with their employer for at least 26 weeks by the end of the 15th week before the start of the week when the baby's due are entitled to paternity leave. We believe that all men should be entitled to take the same amount of paternity leave to allow them time to bond with their child and to give new mothers the help they need at this important time.  We believe that it a breach of human rights to say that some men are entitled to this time off and others are not.  This petition is about time off, not financial benefits.  Paternity leave was set up in recognition of the importance of a father bonding with his child and yet it is not automatically available for all.",
