Banking Fat Cats have in effect been paid vast sums in bonuses in return for providing incompetent  management. Shareholders and savers have lost money and many borrowers will lose their homes. The government should impose a statutory liability on those who have lead us into this mess to pay their ill gotten gains into a compensation fund.",
