            "background": "Please reform the smoking ban to allow a sensible approach to leisure facilities.  There is no real reason not to allow owners or managers to decide for themselves what is required by their own customers.  I am sick of being treated like a pariah when I want a smoke while out for a drink and have not stayed in an hotel since the ban.  Tobacco sales are still legal in this country and I would suggest the Exchequer would not like to lose our tax from same.  We are not asking to go back to the 50's and 60's but to be included in this society.",
