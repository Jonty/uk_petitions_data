            "background": "At the moment there are a large number of recipients of the cold weather payments who are over 60yrs but genuinely do not need this benefit,  As it is not means tested this section will of course accept it.If was means tested they would surely not recieve it.Surely using this payment for other uses than it is designed would be construed as defrauding the system.\nDisabled people who genuinely need this help are being overlooked creating appalling difficulty because they are not 60 yrs +.\nThis petition seeks to get government to review and completely alter the whole system and introduce one which benefits those worst affected based on need and not whether it is financially viable for government to means test.Disability in all its forms has no age boundaries.",
