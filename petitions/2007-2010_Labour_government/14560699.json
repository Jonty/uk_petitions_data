            "background": "Nannies have sole, unsupervised contact with children, and often work 10-12 hour days. Yet nannies are currently the only childcare provider not required to have a CRB check or a first aid certificate. In addition nannies are not obliged to be Ofsted registered, and the new Independent Safeguarding Authority (ISA) also excludes nannies from compulsory registration.\n\nNannytax along with parents, nannies and nanny agencies believe it is irresponsible that the safety and welfare of tens of thousands of children remains compromised because Government continue to exclude nannies from childcare legislation. With several recent high-profile child abuse cases all too fresh in our minds, how can Government put yet more children at risk?\n\nPlease sign our petition now!",
