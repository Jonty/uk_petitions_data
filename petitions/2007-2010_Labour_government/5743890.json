            "background": "The A303 is a vital road link to the West Country, it serves as a major artery for people living in the area for both work and recreation. It also has to deal with the massive amount of seasonal tourist traffic visiting the area, mainly, but not exclusively, during the Summer months.\n\nAs most of you know, the road passes within close proximity to the World Heritage Site of Stonehenge. Surely we owe it to our forefathers to remove all modern construction, including roads, from within the area of the monument and give it the respect it so badly deserves. This would clearly involve building a new road solution either far from the site or a concealed tunnel.\n\nThe junction close to the monument is an incredibly dangerous one, long delays are caused by the poor & out-dated design which in turn leads to driver frustration and accidents.\n\nPlease sign this petition to apply much needed pressure on the government to improve the situation at Stonehenge and indeed the remainder of the A303.\n\nDoug Oliver",
