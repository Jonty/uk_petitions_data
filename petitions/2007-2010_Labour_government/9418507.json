            "background": "Many hospital wards hardly get dark at night. This means that light sleepers and sleepers who need total darkness find it difficult to sleep. I have visited relatives in hospitals and a few of them did not have any curtains or blinds to the windows. I reckon with the ability of making wards darker at night, people will recover quicker as getting a better quality sleep. Plus this may reduce waiting lists!",
