            "background": "SAFE NSPCC is to close in Barrow in Furness March 31st 2010 after recieving support by fund raising over the years to help this centre continue to operate.  After Campaigning on Facebook there is over 1000 supporters that are against the closure of this dedicated service and we want this centre to continue as Barrow is not a Minority as this centre has given a lot of people in the town support through domestic abuse.  Why should this dedicated service be closed down? who is going to be responsible for future victims? This service has given individuals in the past a way forward to overcome their fears.... Please sign this petition, we have previoulsy done a local petition and Mr Flannagan the chief Executive of the NSPCC did not support the concerns of the general public so now I have contacted the local MP and asking you to sign this so this can be presented to our MP.",
