            "background": "There are many companies in the UK now charging hideous amounts for members of the public to make contact with them. Often the caller is being penalised for merely enquiring about a service or a product.  Companies ought to be required to state clearly what those calls will cost on every document and in every form of advertising (including television) in which the numbers in question are shown - currently this is not the case.  In that way, the member of the public can decide whether they wish to use this company or its products on the basis of how much cost will be involved through contact with that company.  The public should have a right to be aware of premium number charges before entering into any dealing with any company or organisation.",
