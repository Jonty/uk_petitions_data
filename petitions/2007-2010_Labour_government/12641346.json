            "background": "Given the incredible recent events surrounding the revelations on MP's expenses, it is clear that NONE of the sitting MP's are fit for public office. MP's voted in the rules and we expect a higher standard of moral behaviour from the people who set the rules. ALL MP's are jointly guilty - either by taking advantage of the system, or by not standing up as whistle-blowers before the revelations came out. I believe that Parliament should be dissolved immediately and ALL MP's should be banned from standing from public office again. Anyone wishing to stand in future must sign a legally binding deed compelling them to follow the Nolan principles: Selflessness, Integrity, Objectivity, Accountability, Openness, Honesty and Leadership.",
