            "background": "The antiques and fine arts industry created in excess of 4bn GBP in 2007 in 2008 it was reduced to 2.7bn\n\nThe world needs to recognise that England is the centre of the Fine arts and antiques industry and we are proud that it is part of our English heritage. It is slowly disappearing due to high business rates and rents. The industry creates jobs in shipping, conservation and tourism amongst many other related industries. Without it high streets are being replaced by global chain stores. If museums which rely heavily on the knowledge of the industry are getting help why are we not? From an ecological point the antiques industry is very green, we don't throw away antiques so no more landfills,it is therefore classed as very recyclable.",
