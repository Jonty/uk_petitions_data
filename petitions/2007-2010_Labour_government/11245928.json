        "background": "We have been informed that it costs us 35 million UK Pounds for children of EU people who live here but their children live in their home countries.  We are sinking in debt and will be for many many years with the vast debt that the government has got us into.  We cannot and should not be paying out monies to all and sundrie, we have enough problems regarding feral children in our own country that could do with some funds to try to sort them out, should we be floating in money - Which we are not!  I bet France - Germany etc do not make such payments.   With immediate effect all such Payments must be STOPPED",
