        "background": "In a society where so many people are living off benefits paid for by our taxes, it should not be possible for these benefits to be enough for these people to afford life's luxuries. Benefits should provide a minimum standard of living... food, water, heat etc. If someone is claiming benefit and has Sky TV, this means they are getting \u00a330 per month to much. The same goes for the Internet, mobile phones etc that are all luxuries that are not needed for basic living. In banning benefit claimants from owning these things they may think twice about claiming money they don't need but know they can claim easily.",
