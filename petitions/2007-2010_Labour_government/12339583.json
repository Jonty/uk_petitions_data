            "background": "The recent decision by the Nursing & Midwifery Council to deregister a Nurse for assisting the BBC in exposing poor levels of care within an NHS Trust may put more patients both young and old at risk.  It is my belief that a Registered Nurse/ Midwife must ensure that patients/ clients receive a good standard of care.  This decision by the NMC may reduce the likelihood of Nurses/ Midwives raising any concerns in the future.\nThe NMC should have another option available to them when a Nurse/ Midwife has raised concerns in the only way they felt possible at the time.",
