        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Fishkeeping is a large area of interest in the UK.\nMany shops and suppliers are good, and give out correct advice about the stocking and care of what they sell. many many more do not, and it is common for buyers to either get NO information on the needs of the fish they buy, or to get wrong information to secure a sale. \nAll to often fish ultimately growing to a large size are sold to people with no facilities to keep them leading to deformation and painful deaths for the fish, with no advice given on the water requirements  for the fish or the tank requirements to keep them healthy.\nLittle is done to ask buyers questions before a sale to ascertain the suitability of what they want to their ability to keep them.\nClear labelling and guidelines are required for the protection of everyone in this trade as well as the wellbeing of the fish.\nPeople see a small cute 2\" fish and buy it without realising it should one day become 12\" - unfortunately the unwitting buyers fish will die well before then as they know no different at point of sale and do not get the correct information or advice displayed to them or told to them.",
