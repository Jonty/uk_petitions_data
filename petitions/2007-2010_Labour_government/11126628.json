            "background": "Child killers should not have their identity protected. Baby P was given no protection by his evil Mother and yet the British Taxpayer is expected to foot the bill of protecting her identity along with that of the two men who helped her to murder him, upon their release from prison. This is completely ridiculous. Their lives may well be under threat when they are released, tough !!! Baby P's life was under threat from the day his Mother took him home from hospital, only he had no voice to ask for help and was let down by everyone who should have helped him. Child killers do not deserve to leave prison for a life a safety and anonimity at the expense of the British Taxpayer",
