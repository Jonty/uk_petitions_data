            "background": "Spending lots of time driving on motorways, it is clear to see lorries which overtake are a huge cause of motorway congestion.  I personally noticed one lorry which took 4 miles to overtake another vehicle.\nMaking it mandatory for lorries to stick to the inside lane will allow cars to stay at a constant speed rather than having to slow down for these things, thus reducing.\nAlso there should be harsher penalties for drivers who break the speed limit for lorries.",
