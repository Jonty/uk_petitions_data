We can claim a discount but we still have to struggle to pay it on top of our regular usage of Gas an Electric.\n\nMPs and Lords have no comprehension of what it's like to try and live on Incapacity Benefit. I myself just paid out \u00a3277 Council Tax, add on top of that things like Dentist charges (my Dentist is NHS but I still had to pay over \u00a3200 for poorly made Dentures), Prescription charges, Opticians (Glasses). It all mounts up!\n\nAnd I actually saw someone on the news complaining about how difficult it is for Lords that actually turn up for their duties to live on \u00a3300 a day???",
