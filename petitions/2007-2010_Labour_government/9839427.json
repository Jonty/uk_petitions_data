            "background": "The Government often makes issue of \"the minimum a person needs to live on\", minimum level of housing\" etc. While It often seems to be trying to reduce the Living standards of the disabled, MP`s on the other hand are free to use the expences system to boost their living standards well beyond their salary.\n\nThis petition aks the PM to Increase disability benefits so that\ndisabled people can (Like Mp`s currently do) benefit from shopping on the \"John-Lewis list\".\n\nWe further believe that since many disabled cannot work, it is only right that like MP`s they have access to the same \u00a3thousands for window cleaning and taxi`s for shopping, as well as the new Kitchens, and Bathrooms etc that MP`s enjoy (in addition to their salary).\n\nWe simply ask that Disabled people in their one home are allowed similar housing standards to those considered reasonable expences for MP`s in their second homes.",
