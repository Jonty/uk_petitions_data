            "background": "There has been a great deal of press coverage about teachers calling for SATs to be abondoned in England.  Much of this focuses on the amount of classroom time devoted to \"teaching to the test\", and stress on pupils.  \n\nGood teachers and good schools do not do this - with good teaching the pupils will bearly be aware that they are doing the tests.\n\nOur pupils deserve good teaching, parents want to know whether the teachers and schools are effective.  Too many pupils leave school at 16 unable to read and/or write.  Until these rates improve we need testing through school to identify problems before it is too late.\n\nDon't give in to teachers and unions - they are in effect complaining about bad teaching practice not bad tests.",
