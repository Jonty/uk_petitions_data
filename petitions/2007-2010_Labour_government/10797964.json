            "action": "Give more power to Ofcom to intervene and regulate the pricing policies of the big five mobile telephone service providers Vodafone, O2, Orange, T-Mobile and 3 to give consumers a fairer deal.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "With over 75% of the UK population now using mobile phones they are no longer an \"optional\" service. We have the right not to own a mobile but for the majority of us we would suffer as a result of an inability to interact in both our social and working lives.\n\nGiven the importance and sheer level of mobile phone communication we should demand the right as consumers to clearer pricing policies, which are currently a commission-led minefield of special offers and hidden costs. \n\nThere must be an end to mis-selling and unbreakable contracts ( unless a huge premium is paid to cancel it) if the current deal is not cost-effective for the mobile user.\n\nThe big five companies are profiteering on a massive scale for a service which is no longer optional. Please sign this petition if you wish to bring this oligopoly under strict review.",
