            "background": "This is a petition at the utter rediculous price to upgrade to the new handset for existing O2 customers. 12 months ago we signed up to an 18 month contract. At that point the contract period started again. \n\nTo upgrade to the iPhone 3G S you have to pay the remaining 6 months + of the contract, plus the handset cost. \n\nThis is very disapointing as you for this price you can buy them legitimately from abroad unlocked (due to laws in foreign counties) so whats the motivation to stay with o2 when i can have any provider?? \n\nSo, when my contract expires in december, ill be forced to sign another, which will leave me in the same predicament when the new phone is undoubtably announced next summer again.... \n\nThis is extremely dissapointing....express your comments and please sign this petition.",
