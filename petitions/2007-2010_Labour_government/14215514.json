            "background": "I would like to suggest , that over 60's should re-take a driving test. From experience, i can say that a lot of people nearing retirement age , lose confidence on the roads, and, seem to drive as they would have done 30 years ago ,not taking into account the massive expansion of commuters that are out there now , as opposed to when they first passed the test. Thing to consider , eye sight; decision making whilst driving, confidence on the road ( traffic now is at a massive level, not like 30 years ago , when a car was more of a luxury), also, it could encourage people to use public transport , and therefore free up our over crowded roads, and, more importantly , lessen CO2 emitions.",
