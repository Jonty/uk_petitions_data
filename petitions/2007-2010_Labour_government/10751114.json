        "background": "The inclusion of on-screen channel ID logos and/or information and advertising banners is a distraction, (and annoyance), whilst watching television programmes. It seems that nowadays the broadcasters are more interested in filling our television screens with logos, banners and other annoying graphics, than they are in providing the actual programmes. We don't need a constant visual reminder of what channel we are watching! Nor do we need an animated information/advertising banner telling us what the next programme is, what's on another channel in 3 days time, or how we can win a games console, or a mountain bike etc! We want to watch a clear picture, not have it partially obscured all the time by obtrusive logos and graphics!",
