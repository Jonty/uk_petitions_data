            "background": "Children from families on Welfare Benefits, and the families themselves as a whole, are a burden to the taxpayer. As well as the money expended on welfare benefits, they are statistically more likely to either undertake menial work therefore paying less back into the tax pot or reliant on welfare benefits themselves . The welfare system is becoming commonly used as a way to simply avoid working. Young adults should be offered money to be sterilised before they have chldren. The operation should be reversible at any stage simply by repaying the money. The people likely to take up this offer are people from welfare dependent families to whom a reasonable sum of money could be persuasive.",
