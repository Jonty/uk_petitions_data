            "background": "A democracy is a political system in which the supreme power lies in a body of citizens who elect people to represent (not control) them.  But the problem we have is that the citizens have little control over what the Government actually does once elected.  We vote in a party instead of specific policies.  We therefore call on the Government to make it easier for the people who vote them in, to have a say in the policies their Government should follow.\n\nAs far as SAFARI is concerned, we can then finally address the policies necessary to assist those falsely accused of committing crimes.\n\nOf course, the Government doesn't have to do as we ask in this ePetition (and thereby lies the problem within our system!) but we hope they will do so.",
