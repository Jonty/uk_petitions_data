A 45% top rate will be higher than most European countries and will be a huge disincentive to people, not just those eaning over \u00a3150k, but all those families aspiring to earn a decent living. Also by increasing income tax, it also hits pensioners, whereas an increase in the National insurance cap would not. This is dogmatic Old Labour.",
