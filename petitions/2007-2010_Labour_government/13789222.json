            "background": "This petition has been created to ban the sale of rodenticides to the untrained public. It has been drawn to our attention that secondary poisoning and direct poisoning of non target animals is on the increase, the statutory regulations are clearly not being adhered to and wildlife is suffering at the hands of the untrained  DIY user of rodenticide. \nCases of rodenticide resistance are on the increase which is clearly a factor again of misuse of poisons by untrained public. \nI hereby ask you to sign this petition in order to save a huge amount of wildlife and pets that are being killed by people who have purchased rodenticide/ poisons from hardware stores, farm supply stores and internet online stores without gaining any training in their use. \n\nIf you care about wildlife then you should sign this petition.",
