            "background": "It is clear from the Public Accounts Committee report on the farm payments scheme computerisation fiasco that Sir Brian Bender, then permanent secretary of DEFRA, was personally responsible for a huge waste of public money and for bringing misery to thousands of farmers. Despite his gross failure to do his job properly he has now moved on to be permanent secretary at the Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. The question of whether he is a fit person to hold a senior position in the Civil Service is one that should be considered.",
