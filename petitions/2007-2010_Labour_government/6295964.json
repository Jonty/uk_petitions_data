        "background": "Councils do not have a code of practise with regards to allowing drivers time to park their vehicles for a short period and return to them,I do not mean Red Route or dangerously parked vehicles,I mean short term parking.Every council has a different code for their wardens.When the police were enforcing parking restrictions they used a common sense approach,Councils do not allow drivers any time to go to get change seek directions or other help proving the wardens are there to make money nothing else.I urge Gordon Brown to pass a law forcing Councils to abide by  a code call it good grace give drivers between 10 to 15mins to return to their vehicles without rushing to slap a ticket on the windscreen use a bit of common sense if this was in place drivers would respect it and parking resrictions may finally be seen as fair.",
