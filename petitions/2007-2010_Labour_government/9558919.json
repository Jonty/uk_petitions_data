The number of these cases is rising dramatically and we need to do something about it! Surely its better to prevent a baby from getting it rather than having to treat which is much harder! It would only take a leaflet provided by midwifes etc but then parents are aware. There are so many parents out there that are having to try and deal with their babies having this condtion!!",
