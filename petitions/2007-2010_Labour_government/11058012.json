        "background": "Suoermarkets are fond of telling us how they have \"reduced\" prices, but In the last few weeks I have noticed that organic celery in Tesco has gone up by 25p, \"Basic range\" oranges in Sainsbury's went up from 68p to 99p and 1 litre of organic milk which was 79p in Morrison's last week is now 99p.  They are all at it. It is called profiteering. Most people just pick up their normal items, without noticing whether the prices have increased. If these shops were forced to display price increases week by week, we would all be a lot wiser.",
