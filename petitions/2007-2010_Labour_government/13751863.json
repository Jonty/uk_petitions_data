Now is the time for imigration, Bailouts, Budgets, Taxes, Law and order, Europe and all things that impact on the public to be decided by the public not MP's Whom are there only to line their own pockets raping and pillaging the taxpayer yet they do not speak for the public that voted them into power. Billions of \u00a3's wasted on bailouts Cuts in Public services because of bad management of public funds and out of control imigration are only a small number of the reasons it is now time for the PM to be strong, Prove he is not weak and to change government policy before the next General election and impliment this into law so We the Public will be voting knowing we will be heard.",
