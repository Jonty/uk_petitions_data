This building is widely regarded as an eyesore by Plymouthians and it had been intended to demolish it and pave the way for a new building elsewhere and to develop the site as part of Plymouth's much needed modernisation and regeneration. Even the great guru of 1950s and 1960s archirecture, Pevsner, found the building unpleasant and unattractive. The cost of this listing runs to over \u00a340 million which has the potential to bankrupt the council, kill future city centre regeneration and deny a host of opportunities to the current and future generations of this proud and historic city.",
