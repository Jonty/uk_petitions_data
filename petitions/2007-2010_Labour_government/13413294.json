            "background": "In view that the Prime Ministers' announcement that he is prepared to consider cutting the UK\u2019s fleet of Trident missile-carrying submarines as part of a global agreement to reduce nuclear arms. We urge him to provide greater leadership and go further by abandoning the UK's preparations to develop weapons of mass destruction. Cancel plans for a new nuclear weapons system to replace Trident. Do something beautiful, give a precious gift to the coming generation, please stop the madness of developing weapons that we could never justify the use of.",
