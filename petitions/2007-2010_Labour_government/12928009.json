            "background": "i am creating this petition as im quite frankly appauled at what i have witnessed on the social networking site facebook. i have joined a group on there about the crushing of small animals to ban of course. there is a link to show just what this involves. i was never aware of this until now and i am seriously sickened by it. although this seems to be happening in china/ japan or other foreign countries i believe there is things we can do to stop this as a group on facebook will not stop this. i think this should be addressed as this is animal cruelty to the limit and these 'sick' indivduals (the ones doing this so called 'crushing', the ones filming/ taking pictures aand the organisers) need to be brought to justice!!!!",
