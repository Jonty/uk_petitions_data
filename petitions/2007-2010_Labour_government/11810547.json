            "background": "Whilst allowing freedon of speech, enforce a culture of responsible financial journalism to stop ordinary finance workers (not the so-called \"fat cats\") from being forced out of work due to headline-grabbing sensationalism around such topics as \"bank bonuses\" or \"greedy bankers\", as the vast majority of ordinary people who work in the finance industry have no influence over policy or risk-taking but go to work to feed and clothe their families in the same way as shop workers or other service industry staff do. \n\nIt is time these journalists are brought to account when they write stories which threaten the livelihood of decent working folk and the security of their families. Perhaps they should be put in the position, through no fault of their own, where they have the worry of whether they will have a job the next day or not. \n\nThe days of \"Fortress Wapping\" are not that long ago and many thousands of ordinary people supported those individuals through very unpleasant times - perhaps it's time the working class people of Britiain stuck together again.",
