            "background": "From the Highway Code: \"178 Advanced stop lines. Some signal-controlled junctions have advanced stop lines to allow cycles to be positioned ahead of other traffic. Motorists, including motorcyclists, MUST stop at the first white line reached if the lights are amber or red and should avoid blocking the way or encroaching on the marked area at other times, e.g. if the junction ahead is blocked.\"\n\nFrequently I come to road junctions where motorists have stopped in the ASL rendering it useless to cyclists or forcing them to move forward of the ASL and commit a traffic offence themselves; and frequently enough drivers stop behind the first line but then creep forwards into the box, threatening any cyclists who may be there. At present the regulations pertaining to ASL's are unenforced, action to enforce these would only reassure cyclists that the other rules of the road in place for their benefit would be enforced, they would provide a generous revenue stream to the Treasury, and remind drivers that they are responsible for their actions on the road.",
