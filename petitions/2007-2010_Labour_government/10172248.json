A number of other officers who did the same thing have been sacked - there is no reason why Mr. Dizael should be treated differently from these fellows and therefore should be sacked.\n\nDavid Blunkett personally intervened to drop other investigations against Mr Dizaei.  This should be investigated via a public body to ensure that these investigations were dropped with good reason.\n\nIt is not sufficient for someone to get promoted just because they cry racism at each and every opportunity.  Promotion should be based on ability, not race.",
