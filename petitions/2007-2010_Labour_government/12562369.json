            "background": "I am a redundant 34 year old from St Helens Merseyside.  I am sick and tired of hearing about ministers in Government and Labour MP claiming tax payers money (our money) unacceptable amounts and or items.  Once they realise the amount are to be published, then all the lies come out \"I noticed the mistake and payed it back\".  What a bunch of Liar\u2019s, abusing the tax payer, people like myself who has mortgage arrears, council will not help me with my council tax, not government support to help me find work.  Just all hot air and I hope that may people sign to this position to FINALLY voice with me that NO MORE LABOUR GOVERNMENT.  I have voted labour for years BUT NEVER AGAIN.  We the people elected Tony Blair, love him or hate him, we still elected him.  Now we have a little GREY man who we have NOT elected.  We Elected Blair because of his vision and youth, energy.  President Obama has done more in his 100days than Gordon Brown in as many months.  We have a powerless PM, HE MUST with his poor Ministers BE REMOVED FROM OFFICE.  Please people we are all falling down and it\u2019s not getting any better.",
