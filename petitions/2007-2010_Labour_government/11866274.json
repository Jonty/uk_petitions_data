It was very stuffy and could made some people feel ill. Then I noticed the radiators were on full blast. There was no valve for anyone to adjust it. Fortunately, the windows could be opened.\n\nI was having a chat with a fellow patient and he told me that they still have the heating on full blast during hot summer days.\n\nThere is no need to heat up places in hospitals where many people are sitting together.\n\nPlus from what they could save in money could pay for some operations!",
