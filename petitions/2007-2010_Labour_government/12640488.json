        "action": "Oblige HMRC to compensate the taxpayer where a legitimate tax refund is investigated for security reasons and repayment is delayed more than 10 working days, the rate of compensation to be in line with the penalties levied when self assessment forms or tax payments are delayed.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Currently HMRC carry out security checks on potential income tax refunds, they cannot be contacted by telephone so that the taxpayer can determine how long they have to wait to receive their own money back. The HMRC should be obliged to compensate the taxpayer when a legitimate refund is delayed longer than 10 working days. The rate of compensation should be at the same rate as that which applies to taxpayers should they submit their self assessment forms late or make late payment of tax. The taxpayer should not have to pursue the HMRC for the compensation it should be paid to the taxpayer automatically.",
