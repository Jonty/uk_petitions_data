            "background": "As it has proven that it is now a defunct organisation that only monitors energy prices rather than keeping the energy companies in line and forcing them to keep prices down for consumers in line with wholesale energy and costs.\nEnergy companies have been keeping the price of gas and electricity artificially high and have even hinted at increasing these costs even though the price of wholesale gas has dropped to a 2 year low.\nIf the energy watchdog (Ofgem) cannot do the job it was meant to do then it should be shut down rather than carry on with the 6 people, considered to be at the top of the watchdog organisation, earning over \u00a31 million pounds of tax payers money between them.\nNo spin, no jargon, either a good, clear and easy to understand explanation or shut the watchdog down.",
