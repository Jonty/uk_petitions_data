Moves to share such information could easily be abused and could potentially discourage people suffering from sensitive illnesses (STDs, Mental health issues, HIV etc) from seeking help. Given the poor track record of protecting data from loss this seems an ill-advised move with no discernible benefit and should be scrapped immediately",
