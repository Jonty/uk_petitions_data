Blair did a lot of damage, and we realise you need time to repair that.\nLabour is a Socialist party, but you seem to have lost the plot on this. We don't want you covering the Tories' ground. We want a clear alternative, and its just not there right now.\nStop taxing everything we do, remember what communities, society and families are, please.\n\nWe do support you, and are not impressed with the spineless Blarites who are trying to undermine you. But, you have to get a grip. Let your ministers do their jobs, stop trying to knee-jerk react, or grab headlines.\n\nGet on with the job!",
