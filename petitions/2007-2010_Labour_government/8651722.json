            "background": "Northern Rock has now being nationalised by the government. There has been plenty of interest from private investors, so why has this been allowed? This is a business that people have chosen to invest or save their money in.\nDo not penalise others who do not use Northern Rock, as:\n1: People may have made an educated choice and decided Northern Rock was a risky investment, don't make them pay for making what has turned out to be a sensible choice!\n2: This is a business, will you nationalise others if they go under? \n3: 'Emergency' laws have been passed to allow this nationalisation to take place, how many other 'emergency' laws can be rushed through and to cover what? Laws should not be made up and rushed through to fit what the government wants.\n\nNationalising Northern Rock will mean an increase in taxes for all! At a time when inflation is rising, we cannot afford more taxes!\nThe failings of the economy at present are largely down to the government, don't allow this fiasco to add to them!",
