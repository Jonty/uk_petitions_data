            "background": "The cut in VAT to 15% has had no benefit to consumers. Retail outlets determine a selling price, and then back-calculate VAT. For this reason, and as a trip down any High Street will show, the vast majority of items are still priced 'to sell' - i.e. at \u00a3n.99, or \u00a3n99  etc.  As this VAT cut is expected to cost \u00a312.5 billion, the Government should be pragmatic and ditch it now in order to reduce the coming burden on taxpayers identified in the recent Budget.",
