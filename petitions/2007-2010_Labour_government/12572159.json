It appears that this was what many were doing.\n\nIt is completely wrong, and no amount of excuses like 'it was within the system' and 'it is the system that is at fault' will do.  MPs, if you want us to respect you again, man up and donate the profits you made to charity.  Failing that, Brown, enact a law to make this happen.",
