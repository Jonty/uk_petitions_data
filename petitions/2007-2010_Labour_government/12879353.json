            "background": "I ask all right thinking people to support this petition that Mr Ronald Biggs who is serving a 30 year sentence for a train robbery which took place in 1963. He has more than paid his dues to society for a crime which happened more than forty years ago. Considering the lenient sentences that are now handed out to evil criminals who commit far worse crimes than that committed by him. I'm sure the motivation to steal money although wrong can be understood but when child molesters and murderers are practically getting away with very short sentences, it would be only right to release a man who now poses no threat to society, given his age and state of health, particularly at a time when our jails are at bursting point I think this would be a just and rightful act now",
