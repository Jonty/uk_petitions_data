            "background": "We all get frustrated by HGV's causing rolling roadblocks when they try and overtake each other on the motorway.\n\nGovernment should restrict the speed of HGV's to 50 mph and restrict them to the inside lane at all times.\n\nThis would reduce frustration for the vast majority of drivers, free up space on the motorway and therefore reduce congestion and hopefully will start to move freight to railways.",
