            "background": "This is a time of change and there is currently a huge cloud hanging over the probity of every single member of the House of Commons.  It is not beyond the wit of the present executive to realise that a new Mr/Mrs Speaker elected by the people to rule over the Palace of Westminster, as a representative of the people, as opposed to being a representative of the collection embezzlers and fraudsters who currently have seats there - some of whom,at least, are very likely to be serving a prison sentence for most of the time the new Speaker is in post, anyway - is a much more democratic option. All party leaders are now spouting about how 'the power should be with the people' this is a perfect time for them to put OUR money where their mouths are and get into practice of allowing the people more say in what goes on in their name.",
