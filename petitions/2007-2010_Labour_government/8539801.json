        "background": "Only about half of Greater London is covered by the LONDON post town.  Parts of London, such has Bromley, Kingston Upon Thames, Romford etc all have their own post towns.  This does not seem logical when these places are no more or less London than anywhere else.  In addition, this makes people outside the LONDON post town use old counties in their address (eg Bromley, Kent) which is incorrect.  This can isolate those in Outer London, and can also mislead anybody outside London as to the wherabouts of certain locations.  Royal Mail did not wish to change this, as there would be no structural benefit.  However there is no need to change the postcode system to implement this, as BROMLEY, BR1 1AA can easily become LONDON, BR1 1AA, which is indeed how many people in London already format their address.",
