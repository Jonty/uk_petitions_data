            "background": "At a meeting of the Portable Antiquities Scheme's Advisory Group the Chief Executive of the MLA, announced that funding for next year would be frozen at the 2007 level, even though at the press conference for the Annual Report he and the Minister announced that the funding for current levels of activity would be preserved.\n\nThe PAS as an organisation of 50 staff needs \u00a31.49 million to keep going at the same level of activity in 2008 and freezing the PAS budget will mean losing 5 posts out of 50.\n\nThe MLA also wants to review PAS's funding for 2009/11 and integrate them into the programme called Renaissance in the Regions which it is funding 42 hub museums. If that happens the work of the FLOs will be diluted and the national side of PAS will be weakened. This will result in 9 separate PAS groups, all with their own priorities.\n\nThe DCMS should reassign the PAS from MLA to the British Museum that is fully committed to the long term work of PAS. \n\nAt a time where Heritage and recognition of the public interest in our shared heritage, to act in such a manner is contrary to the principal of providing support to the public and providing a secure and sustainable future for the PAS.",
