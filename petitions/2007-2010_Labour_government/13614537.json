The British government as a member of UN Security Council is required to approve the sending of a UN mission. We petition the Prime Minister therefore to act in such manner as would guarantee the security of Ashraf so that such events as occurred on 28th-29th July 2009 will never again happen and to see that the status of all residents as \u2018protected persons\u2019 within the terms of the 4th Geneva Convention is strictly maintained at all times.",
