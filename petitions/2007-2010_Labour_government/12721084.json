            "background": "Currently, there is no tax relief on the costs of child care other than a complicated voucher system. Although it appears that MPs are allowed to claim the full costs, ordinary people have to pay for childcare out of taxed income in order for both parents to work. If MPs can claim the costs then why can't we claim at least the tax relief?",
