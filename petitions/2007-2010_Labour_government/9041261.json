        "background": "Tax payers are paying for two benefits / tax credits which do the same thing for the recipient. They are receiving money from two different sources. Why not scrap child benefit and increase entitlement to child tax credit. This would make the rich unentitled to payments from the common taxpayer for their own children, and would save a lot of money on admin costs.",
