            "background": "Imkaan is a national organisation that highlights represents the needs of Black, Asian, Minority Ethnic and Refugee (BAMER) domestic violence refuges across the UK who provide support and safety to BAMER women and children who experience violence. \n \nBAMER women and children facing violence are finding themselves without routes to, and places of safety because of a series of contradictory Government policies \u2013 which ultimately expose BAMER women and children to further violence and abuse.\n\nThe situation has reached a crisis point \u2013 there are now only 50% of specialist independent BAMER women\u2019s led organisations across the UK that existed 5 years ago.  \n\nPolicies such as Community Cohesion and Supporting People are being used to cut specialist services for BAMER women despite evidence that supports the need for culturally specific services and the inability of mainstream services to offer the level of support needed.  \n\nIndependent BAMER womens\u2019 groups are crucial in helping women to access appropriate support, exit violence as well as having a significant impact on their health, well-being and life opportunities.",
