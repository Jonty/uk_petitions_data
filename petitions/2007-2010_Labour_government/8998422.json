            "background": "Since the liquid restriction on board flights, people are afraid to purchase that rare bottle of wine, liquor, whiskey, brandy etc where they were holidaying purchased to take home with them. They can put these bottles into the hold luggage, but as many baggage handlers throw the luggage around, the risk of breakage is high. Also in the duty free shops, they sell international brands and not in the much of local alcoholic drinks. I think it is only fair that passengers should be allowed to take on board with them unopened and sealed bottles with them. Plus, it will boost income for both the govt and the local area!",
