            "background": "Our prisons are overcrowded, and mainly by people who have commit crimes which have not really harmed anyone, however, the criminals who have commited crimes such as robbery, rape and murder are walking away without a sentence. It has occured on many instances that the more dangerous of criminals have been let off without a sentence and re-offended. But many business men have commited crimes which are not dangerous but have been sentenced heavily, Why is that? Is it because they are easy to handle?\nSo why have people who can be out and working and contributing to tax, rather than them being in prison and cost even more money? When the real dangerous criminals are walking the streets!",
