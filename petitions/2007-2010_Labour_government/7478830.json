            "background": "Throughout Asia thousands of Asiatic Black Bears are imprisoned in bear farms. In China, bears are kept in cages in order to get bile from their gall bladders. Bile is a liquid that the bear's liver produces, it helps the bear to digest fat in the diet. The bile from the Moon Bears is sometimes used to mix medicines from very old Chinese recipes, but many times it is used in products with no medicinal value e.g. shampoos, skin cream and soda. It is known that there are herbs and synthetic extracts to replace the bear bile. This is an outrageous and wholly unacceptable practice.",
