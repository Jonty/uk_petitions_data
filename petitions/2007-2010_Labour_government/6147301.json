            "background": "There are propsed plans to ban all advertising on formual milk (currently follow on milk can be advertised). We feel as parents we should not be penalised for formula feeding and in banning advertising it is coming across as if that is the case.Many women for varying reasons can not breast feed and often feel ashamed and guilty already over this and it can be a contributory factor to some new mothers baby blues /PND . Advertising formula will not stop mothers wanting to breast feed or stop us from knowing this is better for baby , but will allow us to make informed choices over the milk we give.",
