        "background": "Mr Mckenzie was a ruthless teacher but never the less he was one hell of a good one, Yeah he gave a good ear bashing and made you pick litter but there was a reason, he earnt respect. He was a traditional teacher in every sense of the word,Strict but very fair,Of my memories He is certainly one of them I can remember getting a good bit of stick from but thats because I was in the wrong. Now Im sure alot of us were in the same position and deserved the what we got!!\nI really wanted to set this group up to get as much support for a teacher who deserves it. I can remember this is the teacher that sacrificed so much of his time for others, Think of the Ski trips the Boston trips the outdoor pursuits, all this was not possible without him.The turn of events that day were that a year eleven who yes can be classed as an adult probably likes to think he is has been goading week in week out lesson on lesson until one day he has raised his arms and pushed Mr McKenzie and then called him a scottish C**T.Im not saying its right but if you are out of school imagine the scene, Look at what the lad has done first.1.Racist behaviour 2.Raising arms to someone, Classed as assault 3.Intimidation/Goading.",
