            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "simply, there should be no such  situation where one group controls the rights a human being has to keep himself & his home warm & to cook & feed himself & his family. Enabling the capitalization off humanities fundamental needs & maintaining the situation & preventing the possibility of an alternative way to survive.  The fact that the term 'fuel poverty' exists, let alone is used, affirms the problem. The dichotomy of a single person receiving a government benefit of \u00a390p/wk & having to pay \u00a360p/wk to use gas & electricity. More than 60% of a wkly income. Thats someone on \u00a31000p/wk paying \u00a3600p/wk for heat & to eat. Making a business from such exploitation is wrong & amounts to legalized theft. Fuel charges should be radically reduced to minimum or standardized amounts for all. Non payment of fuel charges equals legal prosecution & no fuel for the consumer, yet suppliers actions are permissible & encouraged. I urge the Prime Minister to take the matter seriously & initiate change & Government to act in implementing a fair, just system, economically sustainable & socially moral. & the public to take a stand & effect this change.",
