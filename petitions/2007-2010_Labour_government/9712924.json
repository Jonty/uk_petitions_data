            "background": "Scotland's seas and wildlife are facing one of the biggest threats they have ever encountered.\n\nThe UK government has put together plans to open up virtually all of the seas around Scotland to multinationals seeking to find oil and gas, which will put whales, dolphins and other marine life at risk.\n\nOne of the major risks being the sound penetrated from over large areas of the sea, which can disturb and disorientate dolphins, whales and Porpoises causing them to strand themselves on beaches\n\nThe proposed plans also jeopardise global attempts to cut the pollution caused by fossil fuels, which is causing climate chaos in today\u2019s world.",
