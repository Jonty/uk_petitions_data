The use of such carriers are obsolete, we no longer need bags of this nature. It is irresponsible and morally wrong for supermarkets to so carelessly hand out carrier bags in such numbers. Long life carriers should be made available to buy at a low cost as a replacement for one use carrier bags. Biodegradable bags can be used when required in areas where reusable bags would not be suitable.",
