            "background": "England lags far behind the rest of Europe in the number of holidays we get. A national holiday on St George's Day would be a great opportunity for all the English (regardless of colour, religion or sexuality) to recognise what binds us together - instead of concentrating on our differences.\n\nEverything from cricket to curry could be celebrated on our national day.\n\nNorthern Ireland already has a holiday on St. Patrick's Day, the Scottish Parliament has introduced a voluntary holiday on St. Andrew's Day and the Welsh Assembly agree that St. David's Day should be a holiday. Soon St Georges Day will be the only one without an official holiday.\n\nSupport Saint George and give everybody in England a day when they can be united.",
