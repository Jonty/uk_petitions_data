        "background": "I would like to make it known that Forres, Morayshire, Scotland does not need nor want the proposed RedCo Milne development at the Bogton Road site. It is not in the interests of the town, it's people and the existing businesses in Forres. It is purely development for the sake of development. It will destroy the historic small town environment and cause the death of the small local business. It is motivated by greed, not by the interests of our community.",
