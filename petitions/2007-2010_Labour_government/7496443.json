            "background": "On the 4th of November the year of our Lord 2007 Charlie \"Double C\" Cook was wrongful denied the Movember award for the \"Lamest Mo\". After a month of hard growing Mr Cook had only managed to produce a few straggly hairs to warm his top lip, he should have been a shoe in for the award. Instead it went to some bad Ceelio alike who, and this is the real scandal, HAD A THICK MOUSTACHE. Despite being carried aloft thru the crowd to the stage this scandalous decision was not reversed and the peoples champion was denied his rightful sash.\n\nWhilst we do not wish to detract from the sterling work carried out by the Movember crew (and they should be applauded) we the undersigned call on the government to intervene and right this appalling wrong.\n\nThank you for you support.",
