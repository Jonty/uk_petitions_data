            "background": "The proposed development by Zurich/Eagle Star, for 12,500 houses on the green field site of Micheldever Station, as an \"eco-town\", is a cynical re working of plans that all levels of local council have seen to be detrimental to the local area, and have consistently shown unanimous opposition.\n\nThe veneer of eco suitability given to the plans can in no way compensate for the damage that would be caused to the local environment, or fully comply with the requirements laid out in the governments \"Eco-Town Prospectus\" (July 2007)\n\nAccepting these plans would not only destroy the local countryside and biodiversity but would also have a negative impact on the development in the surrounding areas of Andover, Basingstoke, Winchester and South Hampshire.",
