        "action": "Extend the lower rate of 5% VAT to include Condensing Gas Boiler Installations & Replacements",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The lower rate of 5% is currently applied only to thermostats, valves, controls etc which are peripheral to existing gas fired central heating systems. Whilst it is proven that effective controls ensure that \nolder gas boilers run for less time, and subsequently produce less CO2, the products of combustion retain the same chemical constituents, so boilers of a SEDBUK rating greater than B are still causing ozone layer damage but for less time. As an experienced gas / heating / air conditioning engineer, I am proposing to the Chancellor via the Prime Minister that at the next forthcoming Annual Budget, the contents of the relevant VAT Notice be extended to include Condensing Gas Boilers falling into SEDBUK Categories A & B. This is currently partially allowable but only to charities. If this rate was extended to the general public when they  \nneed a new boiler, the differential of 12.5% VAT would make a significant difference with customers which would then allow some consumers to afford a new appliance when previously it would have been unaffordable to some.",
