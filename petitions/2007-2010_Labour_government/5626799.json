            "background": "Shopping in the supermarket would be more efficient and less dangerous if everyone knew where they stood with regard to their rights of way, and everyone followed a set trolley protocol. We propose that a cut-down form of the Highway Code should be enforced in supermarkets, and appropriate road markings (Stop junctions, double-yellow lines etc) and rules (speed limits, always push on the left, etc) be enforced.",
