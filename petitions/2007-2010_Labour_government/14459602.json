        "background": "Many people complain about absent parents not paying maintainance to their offspring but if more absent parents were allowed to see their children more maintainance would definately be paid.  Would you pay a mortgage on a house that you couldnt even see let alone live in. No. Most people including custodial parents wouldnt but that is expected to be the case in Britain and it needs to be rectified.  If there is no good reason to stop a parent seeing their child they should be allowed to see their child and not be prevented from doing so out of bitterness and spite and a court order allowing contact should be rigourously enforced and not just ignored by the custodial parent.",
