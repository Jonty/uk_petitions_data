            "background": "due to the tradgic death of 9 year old Keegan Smart/Hamilton we would like Tithe Barn Road, Hardwick, Stockton to be a traffic calmed area. In close proximerty to the accident is a nearby local school recently built however no such calming measure are in effect. Due to a number of accidents on this road, we as a community would like to prevent further accidents with your help. The road mentioned is one of the longest on the estate and traffic can be quite bad, also it is a residential area so there are cars parked on the road making it difficult for children to cross safely. We believe that traffic calming measures on Tithe Barn Road will and can prevent such tradgic accidents in the future.",
