        "background": "Should MPs be given additional benefits on top of their \u00a360,000+ annual salary? \n\nThe current ACA scheme effectively increases the basic MPs salary, because, while the \u00a320,000+ benefit they can receive under the grant is designed to fund accommodation expenses whilst on parliamentary business, that money can be used to buy property, the assets of which remains with the MP when he or she retires from parliamentary duty.\n\nIf you believe the current basic salary and pension scheme of an MP is sufficient, then you will see no need for MPs to be handed such financial extras.\n\nIf it can not be expected that an MP funds his or her own accommodation, why should it be expected that the taxpayer does?\n\nThis petition strongly advises that the funds currently used to pay for MPs second houses instead be used to purchase comfortable and practical accommodation, which shall remain State-owned, and shall be free to use by MPs who require it.",
