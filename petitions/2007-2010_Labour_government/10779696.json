        "background": "Contrary to Government policy, the inclusion of a myriad of contradicting religions onto school life is not enhancing community life. This has been proven by the increasing number of schools devoted to one religion only. By definition, these schools subsequently confirm the divisions caused by religion, enhancing the \"them and us\" perspective of students, which they carry on to adult life. It is not possible to teach all religions in schools and is therefore discriminatory against those excluded, as a result, none should be taught.",
