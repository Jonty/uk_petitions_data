            "background": "People and children are suffering in the ongoing operation which is claimed as one against the LTTE.The truth is there is no food ,shelter and medicine for the people due to the army action in the vanni and other areas. There are human rights violation and there is a systemic collapse of any sort of  governance.\nThe degrading treatment meted out to any body with a Tamil ethnicity is sickening.\nThe Hon.PM is right and we thank him for his reply in the Parliament yesterday(14/01/2009) that he would speak with other leaders to stop the carnage and anarchy.\nThe UK has a moral responsibility as at the time of independence of Sri Lanka the Tamils issue was handed over to Sinhalese on a platter and the legacy is for every one to see.\nMore than 3-5 million people have fled the country and more than 100000 have died.There is no solution to sight.Sri Lankan Tamils have been law abiding and we look upon UK with gratitude for the shelter and asylum given to us.You have to take the lead and you need not wait for others to act.The atrocities must stop.We implore with tears in our eyes,Please act.",
