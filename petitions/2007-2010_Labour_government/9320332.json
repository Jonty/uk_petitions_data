            "background": "For the 2008/09 season of the Royal Opera House, for performances of La Boheme and Don Giovanni the Royal Opera House, for a Stalls Circle Standing place are charging \u00a319 for a place, a rise from their price of \u00a311 in previous seasons.\n\nSome restricted view seats in the Amphitheatre which were previously \u00a325 will be priced at \u00a337.  For the Ballet for these same seats, these were priced at \u00a311, these have now been raised to \u00a327, a rise of 150%\n\nIn contrast the Orchestra Stalls have now 5 varieties in ranging from \u00a3195 to \u00a3150 and the top price is a slight rise from \u00a3165 to \u00a3195.\n\nThe regular patrons in the cheaper areas of the house are effectively paying for this flexibility in the more expensive areas and as a publicly funded body, should be held accountable for this price hike, which effectively prices people out of going to visit the Royal Opera House, making it an elitist, inaccessible and most expensive house in Europe if not the world.",
