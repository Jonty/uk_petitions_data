            "background": "In a government response to petition \u201cWe the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to cancel student loan debts for students who started University in 1998.\u201d the following paragraph was included. \n\nThe petition asks for debt, i.e. student loans to be cancelled.  If students have not paid back their loan in 25 years (or when they are 65 for borrowers who started their course before September 2006), the Government will pay it for them.  \n\nI feel that this criteria for repayments is unfair. Those who started university between 1998 and 2006 will be paying their loans back until they are 65, when those who start university from 2006 onwards will be paying it for a maximum of 25 years.  This means someone aged 18 in 1998 that started university could possibly be paying back their loan until 2045, whereas someone who starts university 8 years later in 2006 aged 18 would only be paying it back until 2031.  It means in the workplace there will be a lot of unfairness in wages between people starting university just a few years apart.  \n\nThis petition asks the government to write off all student debt after 25 years, not just for those who started university since 2006.",
