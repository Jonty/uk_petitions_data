        "background": "My in laws are both sick and are both over 70. Mother has terminal cancer and is in a nursing home. Father is in a mental ward as he can't cope and is about to go into care. We have been told that the family home must be sold to pay for their care. If they knew this it would probably kill them! They have worked hard all their lives to buy this house - they have minimal savings below \u00a312,000 as they have spent all on their home. More intelligent and well advised older people have given their houses to their children in case of this eventuality. Is this fair? More and more people are entering their 70's now and their homes are at risk with this law. Please let my in laws die in peace with the knowledge that they have left an inheritence for their children - something they dearly wanted to do.",
