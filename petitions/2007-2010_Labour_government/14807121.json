            "background": "Sir. OAPs total pensions incomes are assessed collectively by Work & pensions dept when applying for benefits assistance, however, income tax is assessed individually, thereby preventing my wife's 'lost' tax allowance of \u00a36110 being offset against the tax I pay. Our claim for benefits was failed due to our collective income  slightly exceeding the minimum income level. This anomaly is unfair, creating a situation where we are far worse off than individuals who have made no provision for retirement. They can relax with all requirements taken care of by the 'state'. We are penalised for, (Mr Brown's favourite girlfriend!)'Prudence! Quite simply, I pose a realistic point, \"if total income is the method as the basis for qualifying assessment, then the collective 'tax allowances'of respective spouses should also be collectively applied\".! we, jointly, do not receive total pensions income which would pay for half of the cost of cleaning a MPs moat! So much for not being a burden on the 'State', or not.\n\nThirtybob. Doncaster.",
