            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The current interpretation of the Adoption Act discriminates against descendants of deceased adopted persons - they are not understood to be 'birth relatives' as defined in the Act.  This means that children are not permitted access to their adoptive parent's original birth records, unless there are rare 'exceptional circumstances'.  Descendants are consequently being denied their human right to know their biological heritage. The Act is being applied unfairly. \n\nThe stigma of adoption is falling away and society is now demanding that birth records of adopted persons be made available on request.\n\nPlease grant this minority group of affected descendants what is rightfully theirs - their heritage.",
