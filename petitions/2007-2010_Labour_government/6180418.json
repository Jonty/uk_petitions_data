        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It seems a peverse and an anomalous situation for a parliamentary democracy to allow a few extremely rich individuals to influence UK politics by their being permitted to make massive financial donations to a political party even though - as is shown by their claim to have a non-UK tax domicile - their \"real country\" is not the UK.\nWe generally expect the important right of political representation and the power of political influence to be aligned with the non-negotiable responsibility of personal liability to UK taxation.\nIt seems both extraodinary and unacceptable to have some UK citizens claiming all the rights and privileges of citizenship, together with the ability to influence the politics of the UK by making substantial political donations, while at the same time claiming that the UK is not their \"real home country\", at least for the purposes of UK taxation.\nWe ask the Prime Minister to correct this extraordinary and unacceptable anomaly at the first opportunity in his legislative programme for the new session of Parliament.",
