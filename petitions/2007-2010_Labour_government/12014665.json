            "background": "As a minimum, parks managers/councils should consider:\n\nSpecialised swing seats offering back and head support, and some method of securing the child in the seat. (Experience shows these may attract the attention of teenagers if added to a boring old play area, they will enjoy seeing how many of them can get on at once. It may be best to install in conjunction with a new teenagers social play item of equipment) \nBig round \"birds nest\" type swing seats can be good for disabled children with little upper body strength and have the advantage that carers and peers can join them in the seat, and also the seat is more fun for all children than a standard one. Both these types of seat can usually be added to a standard frame without further adaptation. \nWide slides, enabling a carer to accompany a child, preferably with the start and finish of the slide at the same height as a wheelchair seat. \nWide see-saws to enable a carer to accompany a child sitting side by side. \nSensory gardens are particularly important to children who may have impairments, especially visual impairment.",
