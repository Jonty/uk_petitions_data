            "background": "With today's technology, millions of man-hours of intelligence can be put towards solving our nation's challenges, large and small - for almost no cost.\n\nA wiki-based policy website would: \n1) Rally the experience and expertise of the country towards national and local policy challenges; \n2) Provide transparency so constituents can follow the formulation of policy ideas that affect them;\n3) Function as added public consultation; \n4) Empower local interests;\n5) Stimulate citizenship.\n\nThe website would function with the same rules and etiquette as Wikipedia: \n\u2022  Assertions must be backed up by facts; \n\u2022  Aggressive behaviour, prejudice, and vandalism would not be tolerated; \n\u2022  Everyone can make edits, reverse changes, add new policy areas; etc.\n\nWe cannot underestimate the good will and will power of our citizens. Any forward-looking government would do well to harness the power of \"citizen-sourcing\" and unleash its strengths for all society to benefit.",
