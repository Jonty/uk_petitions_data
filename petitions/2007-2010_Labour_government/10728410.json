        "background": "There is increasing pressure to change the current system on organ donation. Currently anyone wishing to have their organs harvested after death must opt in. It is proposed that all organs from all people will be available to medical professionals after death automatically unless the deceased has opted out. The change begins from the premise that the state owns the bodies of its citizens and can decide on their behalf how their bodies should be treated. Statistics claiming that 66% of British people are in favour of change are meaningless - a referendum on the death penalty would yield even more support for its re-introduction yet the concept is still immoral and is rightly resisted by parliament.",
