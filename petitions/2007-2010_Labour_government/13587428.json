        "background": "Displaying a tax disc as evidence of having paid your car tax is antiquated and unnecessary.  There are now computer records which are accessed by the police to check if the car is taxed so why should we be fined \u00a360 for not displaying the disc even if we've paid the tax?  From the government's point of view, with approx. 33 million tax discs issued each year and considering the tax disc form; printing; envelope; stuffing and franking machine costs; postage and staff time to send out all these discs I estimate the cost must be in excess of \u00a330m per annum. (not to mention the environmental impact!) So let's scrap the disc!",
