        "background": "It is clear that within the parliamentary system we have in the UK, power is concentrated within only a minority of MPs. By reducing the number of MPs by half, a vast amount of money will be saved in terms of expenses and pensions and individual accountability will be increased. The reduction can be obtained by the exclusion of devolved territory MPs and increasing constituency sizes.",
