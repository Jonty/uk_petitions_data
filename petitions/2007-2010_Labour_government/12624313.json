        "background": "Given the recent revelations around MPs expenses it is clear that some have engaged in potentially fraudulent behaviour while others have 'milked' the system to their benefit. The constant refrain that what they have done is within the rules shows that they fail to appreciate the public anger at their behaviour. Confidence in the democratic process is being affected and the Prime Minister should call an early election to allow the public to pass judgement on their local MP and deselect those that have behaved dishonourably.",
