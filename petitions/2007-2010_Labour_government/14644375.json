            "background": "That the Government should review planning law and policy as set out in\nCircular 01/06 relating to applications for gypsy and traveller sites.  This\npolicy, coupled with what have become unreasonable timetables to meet\nregionally enhanced targets for pitches, delays in government grants to\nlocal authorities to fund pitches, and the apparently unbalanced application\nof Human Rights Legislation, has become discriminatory against settled communities.  As a result Local Authorities are having difficulties in establishing Gypsy and Traveller sites in appropriate locations and planning permissions are being granted in rural 'exception' sites in unsustainable locations (where there is a strong planning presumption against development and where there is no clear and established evidence of local need) to the detriment of settled communities",
