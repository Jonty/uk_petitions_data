        "background": "Didcot Parkway was served by Cross Country trains to Birmingham and the South Coast until 2002 since when they have passed through without stopping.\n\nDidcot has been identified as the location for major housing growth in the South East Plan and has been given New Growth Point status by the Government. The station serves a population of 200,000 people already, as well as internationally important businesses at UKAEA Harwell Campus and at Milton Park.\n\nBusiness visitors and local people heading for the Midlands and Birmingham Airport have to catch a local train and change at Oxford. This takes time and is inconvenient so many use their cars, adding to congestion on local and trunk roads like the A34. \n\nThe importance of these internationally recognised, high-technology science sites to the UK economy, and its important status in the regional spatial strategy mean that Didcot justifies direct rail links to Birmingham, its international airport and the South Coast.\n\nWe call on the Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Transport to specify a Cross Country train service at Didcot Parkway in the franchise recently awarded to Arriva.",
