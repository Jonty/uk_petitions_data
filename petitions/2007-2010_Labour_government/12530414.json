        "background": "health and safety is required, but it has become TOO safe. there are stupid requirements like on school field trips where everyone must wear helmets when going down a steep hill. in many workplaces pins are no longer handed out along with poppies for the British legion poppy appeal for the health and safety of cutting themselves. at primary schools if a child hurt him/herself the teacher or nurse is not allowed to hug the child to comfort him/her. in NHS hospitals, due to health and safety, if a patient falls and can't get up, the nurses aren't allowed to help up that patient due to the regulation of the carer getting back problems it needs to be loosened up a bit for people to achieve things more quickly, and easily, without having to worry about little, silly things. Nurses should be able to assist a patient that falls out of their bed. they do not have to if they don't want to. But don't make it compulsory not to help. let people make their own choices. we are not children!",
