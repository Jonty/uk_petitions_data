            "background": "Audible car alarms serve no purpose now other than to annoy surrounding residents. Car thieves will happily break in to steal items, or even drive off while the alarm is sounding! They should be banned from residential areas, as the owners are rarely around to turn them off and cause other residents misery and suffering, to the point where there will soon be 'rage' incidents.\nMany are too sensitive and go off for no reason repeatedly.\nBan these alarms in favour of other methods of vehicle security.",
