        "action": "Replace the Tv License with central Goverment funding proportionate to the number of registered voters",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The current TV Licensing system  is inefficient and penalises the poor of this country. The current collection methods assume that all households have TV's so why bother with a seperate collection of the TV tax? Instead a simple sum, total number of registered voters x a sum suitable to fund the BBC and other stations. Why bother with the expense of criminalising single mothers, pensioners, the unemployed. The License fee made sense when there was 1 TV per street not now where its as close to being present in nearly every household.\nSurely it makes more sense to have people pay in via the tax system and the government payout by means of an annual grant. Surely this is a fair and equitable solution with a more efficient use of taxpayers money.",
