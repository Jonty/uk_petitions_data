            "background": "UK roads are very often grinding to gridlock. I believe a number of simple measures could help with traffic flow.\n\nAllowing vehicles to turn left at a red traffic light, treating it as a \"giveway\" would help. This measure is already in place in the USA and works well.\n\nAlso, de classifying the lanes of UK motorways would assist hugely. Too many drivers don't even understand how to use the lanes, and the vast majority of the time when the roads are the slightest bit busy the outside lanes are rammed and the inside lane is empty.\n\nThese and other inventive yet common sense measures would greatly improve the usability of UK roads without undue cost or hassle.",
