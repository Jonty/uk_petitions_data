            "background": "Digital music is a commodity like any other and should come under the same rules with regards to sales as any other. This includes a clear description as to what the user is going to buy. These should include (but not necessarily limited to)\n\n- The encoded format (eg wma, mp3, aac)\n- The bitrate at which the file is encoded\n- The length of the track\n- If there are multiple versions of a song (i.e. different remixes etc), a description of which version/mix this is.\n- Restriction rights, if any.\n\nEffectively this would probably come under a blanket leglisation with regard to accurate description of product. You might say this is similar to the way that products for sale in a store must be labelled with weight and a list of ingredients.\n\nThere should be a regulating body for such online sites (if one does not already exist). Those who do not conform to the above regulations may be reported to such a regulating body.",
