People who choose to listen to the Russell Brand show do so because they like his humour. Clearly the country has lost its sense of humour on this occasion! \n\nBoth Mr Brand and Mr Ross have apologised to Mr Sachs and I understand that the apology has been accepted. Please can we now move on, accepting that the BBC does a good job at employing all types of entertainers in order that it might try and please most of the people most of the time but that those of a sensitive sensibility should perhaps give both of these fine entertainers a miss and to not spoil it for the rest of us!",
