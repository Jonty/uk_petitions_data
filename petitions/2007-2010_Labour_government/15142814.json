            "background": "The average UK price of unleaded petrol is currently just over \u00a31.16 a litre.\n\nBut UK petrol prices could hit a record average high of \u00a31.20 a litre in the next few weeks, according to the AA.\n\nAA president Edmund King told the BBC: \"We all know government finances are in dire straits but a 3p rise in fuel duty is not good for the economy and could fuel inflation.\"\n\nHe said that the cost of wholesale petrol had risen by 17% in the past month, and this had not yet been passed on fully at the pumps.\n\nTherefore, the average price of petrol could hit \u00a31.20 before 1 April, he said.\n\nThe AA said families now paid \u00a352 a month more on petrol than a year ago.\n\nNow i for one am sick and tired of the government using us drivers as some sort of cash cow and demand that they stop raising the cost of petrol.",
