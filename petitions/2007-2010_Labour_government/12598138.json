            "background": "It has become fashionable, and almost acceptable to slander speed cameras and speed limits, but it's obvious, despite the witterings of the motoring elite, that such methods save lives daily.\n\nHowever a small minority of motorists, seem to believe the rules don't apply to them, and thus I feel the best way to enforce speed limits is to use land mines, which detonate when a car goes over them at 5mph or greater over the speed limit. This method would definitely force these arrogant motorists off the road, and would act as a deterrent to anyone else, wishing to follow blindly the nonsense they read in The Sun. Show your fortitude, invest in land mines today!",
