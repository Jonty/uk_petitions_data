            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This petition aims to tackle problems encountered once a forced marriage has taken place, when a person has been a victim of day to day pressure, emotional blackmail and threats of violence to marry someone of their parents' choice. We must protect those who do not wish to have their marriage legally recognised in the UK. \n\nA key problem is concerns the current immigration laws. When a British person is pressured into providing his/her documentation to bring a spouse into the UK after an illegal forced marriage, this British citizen should be given the right to provide details to the Home Office so that the authorities are aware that this person has not consensually entered the marriage. \n\nMore importantly, the Home Office should be able to keep this information entirely confidential, utilising it ONLY to reject the spouse's visa application. Currently there is no anonymity in the system, and many victims of forced marriage do not report their situations for fear of violence from their families. The Home Office should NOT be allowed to disclose reasons for a spouse's visa refusal, in order to safeguard the victim's wellfare.",
