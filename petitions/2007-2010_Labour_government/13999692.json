Now we are told we can't sing baa baa black sheep, call a blackboard a blackboard but a chalk board, we have lost the golliwog that a lot of us grew up with, we are no longer black & blue when we have a bruise and to top it all.. now I hear that we can't order a black coffee now !!!!! When is this stupidity going to stop.\nWe need to claim back our English language, stop being soft and stand up for what is ours. \nWe are far to soft and sensitive in this country for our own good..... It's time to toughen up before we lose everything that is English to us !!!!",
