The tax man would not need court permission to remove or freeze assets to pay the bill.\n\nThe Treasury should not have access to our fiscal accounts without some form of judicial review to prevent abuse! \nMistakes happen by the Government (as has happened on many, many occasions!), how difficult would it be to get back our money when they make a mistake? \nWe may disagree with their view and we should have the right of appeal without a \"Little John\" scenario from the days of Robin Hood.",
