Please encourage the Trust to add a codicil to their inaccurate teaching materials that elevation in this way is for the sole purpose of exercising and compression of the limb in anyway, for long periods and whilst static is dangerous. Please can the P.M. answer - where is the evidence that discharge on subcutaneous anti - coagulants is best practice ? As I understood it, clotting times need to be checked (especially if post - surgery the patient may be hypo - volaemic).",
