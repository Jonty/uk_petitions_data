            "background": "Despite the opinions of a small but vocal minority, capital punishment has and will never work. You only need to look at the murder rates in countries like the USA, which still allows capital punishment, to see that it is ineffective. Also, most criminals would rather die than spend many years in jail - why else do killers like Huntley and Brady try to commit suicide? Unlike some people think, prison is not a cushy holiday camp.   And of course, its hardly sending the right message by killing someone for killing someone.",
