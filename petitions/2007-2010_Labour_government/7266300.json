        "action": "require  Ofcom  to make the resolution of faults more transparent to the subscriber of an ISP and under pinning BT Wholesale services.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "There is a considerable inefficiency caused by the current relationship between ISPs (including BT owned) and BT wholesale. The majority of this burden falls on the subscriber because the ISP does not have a strong enough supplier relationship with BT Wholesale. After a subscriber calls their ISP - then calls BT Landline faults - then their ISP again - and waits and waits, the fault is then resolved without any explanation.\nBT Wholesale clearly do not manage their infrastructure well, and their reaction time to pervasive faults is frankly abysmal. This causes many ISPs and their subscribers to waste time, when Wholesale should already know they have a problem. If 151 can test a line for PSTN, then why can't it self test the ADSL signal too ?\n\nCome on BT Wholesale - stop hiding behind your automated systems and come clean as to why you don't fix stuff in a pro-active manner.  As a monopoly you are getting away with supplying a completely sub-standard service to the UK as a whole.",
