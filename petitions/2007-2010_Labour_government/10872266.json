            "background": "Scotland and her people are being penalised when they are having to change Scottish notes for English ones. The valuation of sterling was only different before the act of Union in 1707, so why are Scotland and her people being victimised when they when  they travel into England and Scots notes are not excepted as part of UK currency or when they have to change to Scots into English currency they get charged a fee . We are supposed to be part of the United Kingdoms this should not be the case, not unless Scotland is given the right to start charging and not excepting English currency in Scotland. This contravenes the laws of the Act of Union of 1707.",
