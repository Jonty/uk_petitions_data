        "background": "This is a petition for the government to introduce audio visual recordings of all benefit based medicals. Any such recordings would not only benefit the claimant with regards the validity of doctor\u2019s reports, but the DWP for purposes of case analysis via voice pattern and body language. This would go a long way in helping to recognise the genuine claimants from those who are abusing the system.  \nCopies of recordings should be available for claimant inspection prior to any appeal being lodged. Any refusal by the relevant government bodies to agree with this speaks for itself.",
