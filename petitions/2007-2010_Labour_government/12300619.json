            "background": "Recent years have seen massive increases in the number of households owning and using trampolines. As these have become more prevalent they have also gradually become larger and more intrusive and are now a common cause of disputes between neighbours.\n\nThere are no planning restrictions on trampolines and it seems that it is perfectly legal to erect structures that tower over the allowable height for garden fencing and remove any semblance of privacy from neighbouring gardens.\n\nIt seems ridiculous that these structures can be erected at will while any reasonable countermeasures (such as higher fences or hedging) are subject to planning control.\n\nThe only remedy for affected properties is to resort to the difficult (and inevitably diviive) noise nuisance regulations.\n\nIt seems to me that it is time for some restrictions to be placed on the size and siting of trampolines - either that or affected neighbours should have equal rights to alleviate the loss of privacy caused.",
