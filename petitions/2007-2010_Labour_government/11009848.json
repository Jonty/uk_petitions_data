            "background": "The damage being caused to the property sector in Britain is an inescapable fact. Untold further damage will be caused to this important sector of the economy if property organisations including the port authorities are pursued for their outstanding rates.  There should be an all party review of the removal of empty property relief and in the meantime a moratorium placed on the collection of the tax. This government is showing a callous disregard to the forcefully made pleas from industry bodies such as the British Property Federation, the British Retail Consortium and the CBI.  \nNot to mention the many MP's who have backed Linda Riordan MP's early day motion to have the relief reinstated. There must be a great many more people and organisations at their wits end trying to cope with what is a bad tax....at the worst possible time.",
