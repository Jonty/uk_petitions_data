            "background": "Many other countries possess a transport infrastructure seemingly capable of withstanding adverse weather conditions far more severe than what the UK has recently experienced. An obvious lack of organisation and preparation for winter measures has resulted in deaths and many people experiencing injury and severe disruption to their lives. I propose that the person responsible for this disruption to our transport infrastrucure is the Secretary of State for Transport. As head of transport the Rt Hon Lord Andrew Adonis should be held accountable for the lack of preparation and lack of aquisition of the appropriate resources. Resources vital to enabling the continued movement of the population during severe weather conditions and the functioning of society.",
