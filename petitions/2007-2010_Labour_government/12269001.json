            "background": "Local shops and High Street are being forced out of business by supermarkets who now stock everything from groceries to electrical goods and items as extreme as Horsse Tack. Local shops are being forced to close because they cannot compete with giants such as Tescos, who are selling products cheaper than local traders can buy them. Companies such as Tescos should be asked to decide what exactly they are trading as,ie. If you are a Butcher then dont sell shoes sell Meat! Is this not why the Molopolies Comission was created! To bring life back into local high streets is in everybodies interest, not all of us are fortunate enough to be  able to access these supermarkets and depend on small shops and local high street, who, with their conveience and personal service make shopping a more pleasurable experience. Please help fight to stop these multi million pound companies from depriving is of our right to carry n a tradition of being able to shop in pleasant surroundings with shop keepers who are not only interested in profits but know and care about their customers. Our High Streets are dissapearing fast and when they do we will be at the mercy of the Giant Supermarket. Please help.",
