        "background": "Barry Cryer is a legend of comedy writing and has been for half a century. He has written for, amongst others, Dave Allen, Jasper Carrott, Dick Emery, Les Dawson, Frankie Howerd, The Two Ronnies and Rory Bremner. He was also instrumental in the success of Kenny Everett, who fundamentally changed British comedy at the start of the 'Eighties. Barry has even written for Bob Hope and Jack Benny. The man is a comedy writing genius whose work has put a smile on the faces of millions over the years. I humbly recommend that he be knighted forthwith.",
