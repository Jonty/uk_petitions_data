            "action": "consider income tax relief against the cost of travel to work for commuters using public transport.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In light of recent events surrounding \u201cacceptable expenses\u201d being claimed by our Government, would the Prime Minister consider granting tax relief for commuters that use public transport on a daily basis?  This could potentially boost the use of public transport, and would also increase net income, thus giving more money to spend in the economy.\n\nMy thought is that currently I pay \u00a32900 per year to travel to work, and pay this to a company that you would also be charging Corporation Tax to.  By allowing my \u00a32900 to be deducted from my gross salary before tax, I estimate I would receive approx \u00a3100 per month more than I receive now.  If I consider this on the millions of commuters that travel into large cities each day, this would create quite a large sum of money that would be then spent in shops etc, boosting the flagging economy.",
