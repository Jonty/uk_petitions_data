            "background": "The various authorities are to be credited with their efforts to bring cruel or negligent animal owners to justice. Unfortunately the process is difficult and lifetime bans are depressingly rare. I believe that we must, when a conviction is achieved, ensure that those convicted are never allowed to associate with animals again. In this instance our duty is to the animals and not to the perpetrators of the offences. Whether it's ignorance, negligence or cruelty a clear message must go out that it will not be tolerated.",
