If a pos+ outcome results, that person or group of people can be praised or rewarded and if a Neg- result occurs, then suitable action may be taken. It would seem that if a similar financial error was made by a company chairman, she/he could/would lose their job but no specific person or group ever seems to been accountable within the Government.",
