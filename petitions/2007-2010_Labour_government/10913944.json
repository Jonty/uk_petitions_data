            "background": "The primary objective of this petition is to investigate the crime of bodily organ theft by Chinese medical practitioners,hospitals and clinics, and illegal sale of bodily organs on the Chinese medical black market.\n\nMany Chinese medical patients are falsely diagnosed with a bodily organ failure.The patient, believing he or she is ill then signs the medical certificate to allow the removal of their body organ, believing that the  replacement is necessary, whilst being totally unaware that their healthy body part is being taken to be sold on the Chinese medical black market. There are also indications that prisoners in Chinese jails are also being executed for their healthy bodily organs, to be sold on the medical black market.\n\nChinese civilians are jailed and tortured for petitioning against their Government. Please help stop Chinese authorities using brutality against Chinese civilians. The theft of Chinese bodily organs by Chinese authorities is a serious breach of human rights, and we must stand up for human rights.",
