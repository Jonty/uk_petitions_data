            "background": "The Springfield Road/Maple Way estate in Burnham-on-Crouch is crying out for a facility to increase the health and activity standards in our children. Everyday we read in our newspapers and the media that Britain is approaching a critical period for our children and obesity is a major problem in society in general.\n\nPlease sign this petition to show your support for the Springfield Road Open Space initiative in supplying our children with a safe area to interact (in reality and not virtually) and gain confidence through play.\n\nAsk yourself this; When was the last time you have seen children playing outside on the Maple Way estate?\n\nLet's encourage the children in our community to be active and play safe and do not let prejudiced opinions against children and young people get in the way of this initiative.\n\nThank you",
