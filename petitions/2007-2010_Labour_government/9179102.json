Say it will be soon \u2013 there's nearly as many of us as there are cancer sufferers, and it looks as if the number of people with dementia will double within a generation. In most cases, alongside the sufferer you will find a spouse suffering as much. It is a shock to find out that funding for Alzheimer\u2019s research is just 3% of that to find cancer cures.\u201d \n\nEarly Day Motion 1337 shows the growing cross-party parliamentary support for an increase in Alzheimer\u2019s research funding.",
