        "background": "In this day and age of electronic payments and internet shopping, holding a debit card is essential.\n\nUnfortunately, only a handful of UK banks provide all their current account customers with a debit card with a lot of banks only providing basic account customers with a cash card which cannot be used for shopping in stores or online.\n\nThese days nearly all debit card transactions are authorised by the bank online at point of sale and as such there is little scope for debit card abuse regardless of the type of debit card held. As such there is no reason why every UK citizen who holds a bank account cannot hold a debit card",
