            "background": "The British Council's recent decision to end the last of its activities in Russia is a sad concession to coercion on the part of that country, and ought if possible to be reversed with the Government's help. The British Council should be given such support as would enable its important work to continue in Russia - and its remaining office in Moscow, at the very least, to remain open for business for as long as possible. If nothing else, this would be a far more meaningful and physical rejection of Russia's actions than mere official complaints from from the Foreign Secretary which, true as they are, are easily ignored.",
