            "background": "Haider Samad is an Iraqi Interpretor who has worked tirelessly for the British Government (Military & Foreign Office & Armor Group) since 2003. In recent weeks he has been targeted by Militia and is of right now the Number One target to be killed. He is homeless with his wife, mother and 10 month old baby, his entire family circle killed and they have no money. Several local MP's, the Foreign Office, Prime Ministers Office, Deputy Prime Ministers Office and now five major British newspapers have been made aware of this. The British until now have done nothing to ensure his safety despite knowing of the dire consequences. All we want is for the British to open Basra Airport to let him and what is left of his family in. It is a moral right to save this family from this plight, help us to convince the Government that Milliband's holiday is not as important as their lives. After that, deal with the paperwork!",
