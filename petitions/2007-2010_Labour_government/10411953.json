        "background": "The employees of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA)need to be treated better in regards to a pay increse. When he was chancellor Mr Brown froze civil service pay increses and we did not get the increse that we deserve, nor was the increse we did get delivered on time. The employees of the RFA do and have done a good and often dangerous job supporting the Royal Navy and other armed forces both from the UK and her allies in NATO and other Coilitions around the globe, promoting the UK along the way. For this reason they should be given an above inflation pay increse.",
