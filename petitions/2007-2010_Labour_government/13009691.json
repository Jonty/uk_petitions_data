A very large number of houses that were built in Victorian times and earlier do not have cavity walls and are built of solid construction. Also a large number of these houses have had loft conversions and can not benefit from the loft insulating grant that is available.  Please can the Government consider a Grant for Double Glazing installation in these houses to help householders decrease their carbon footprint and their energy bills.",
