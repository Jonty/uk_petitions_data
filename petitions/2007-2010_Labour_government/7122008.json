        "action": "solve CO2 problem by building nuclear power stations - first to generate electricity, later hydrogen.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We can solve the CO2 problem easily. Begin by building dozens of new reactors to generate all our electricity from nuclear. Eventually go on to build advanced high temperature reactors generating hydrogen to replace all petrol in cars etc. A large nuclear reactor today produces only about 3 cubic meters of spent fuel each year which can be  easily stored above ground. Leave long term waste disposal to future generations who will be able to recycle or safely dispose of that waste in space. Do not wait for cleaner Fission, it may be too late before that technology is developed. The safety issues are a challenge but not insurmountable. Our planet is at risk - talk of Kyoto Protocols and Wind Farms are only distracting us from the obvious and the only solution. Politicians must have vision and courage, and history shows that those that do will be rewarded even by a fickle and uneducated electorate.",
