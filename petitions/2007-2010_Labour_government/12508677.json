            "background": "There is no proof to show that Ofsted has done anything to raise standards in Schools since its inception. Its work serves to demoralise Teachers, and put unecessary stress on Schools. As an organisation it judges schools and places unrealistic demands on them, without providing any support with meeting these demands. It is forcing schools to waste valuable time and energy pursuing a paperchase in order to provide the illusion of meeting its unmeetable demands. It is essentially an information providing service for parents, and a stick with which to beat the Educators of this country. It does not accept criticism, refuses to enter into a constructive dialogue with those that it judges, and takes no interest in the views of this country's most experienced Educators. It is an expensive waste of taxpayers' money and it should be abolished.",
