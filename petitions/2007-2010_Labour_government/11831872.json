            "background": "It has been reported that the Prime Minster has given his backing to the English Rugby Union to host the 2015 Rugby World Cup, in opposition to a proposed Scottish bid to co-host the tournament with Ireland and Wales - despite the fact England already hosted the tournament in 1991 and Scotland have not had the chance yet to be a main host, having only held some group matches in previous tournaments.\n\nThis could greatly improve the quality of sporting facilities all over Scotland and give a much needed boost to our economy.",
