            "background": "The current rules for MPs are not transparent and it is evident that either MPs do not understand their own rules or they go out of their way to avoid having to declare the full benefits that they or they family receive as a result of their public office.  MPs receive substantial public money.  They should be required to declare:  all earnings from their role as an MP and from external sources; all funding they receive for running their offices, their campaigns or any other use (if it is not their own personal income, it must be declared); all allowances received and the stated reason for receiving the allowance (all allowances to be fully supported by evidence of actual expenditure and in the case of accommodation allowances, that they actually use the accommodation personally); all organisations with whom they work, whether they are paid by the organisation or not.  Finally, all MP's employees must be employed in accordance the usual public sector rules relating to equal opportunities, ie, jobs must be advertised, open to all, transparent recruitment process and best person for the job appointed.",
