These people are involved in the running of the country but have never put themselves up to be elected and be given a mandate, and they are unaccountable to the House of Commons and/or the people of this land.  This is a depraved situation being perpetrated by an individual who is, himself, a fraudulent occupant of the post of Prime Minister, also never having been voted for by the people being most badly affected by the crimes he is now perpetrating against those same people.",
