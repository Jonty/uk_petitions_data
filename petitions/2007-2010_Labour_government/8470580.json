        "background": "Psilocybin is not a dangerous substance. In a recent scientific study of the 20 most dangerous drugs in the UK today, Psilocybin was not placed on the list. Conversely, alcohol and tobacco were placed highly. There are no recorded deaths or overdoses from people taking Psilocybin.\n\nAt the moment, 'Magic Mushrooms' are classified as a Class A drug, with up to 7 years imprisonment or an unlimited fine for possession, and up to a life sentence and unlimited fine for dealing. Other drugs in this category include Heroin and Crack.\n\nDespite the strength of the effects, there is little evidence to suggest it is in the same league as other drugs classified as class A, and likewise, the punishment for its possession seems vastly disproportionate considering the level of detriment to health and well-being the other drugs cause.",
