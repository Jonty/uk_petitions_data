            "background": "Too many planning applications for gyms get thrown out without proper reason because Councils hide behind planning laws regarding PEZs and other silly notions.  The government is trying to get more people into sport before 2012 Olympics and this contradictory action by Councils is hampering that effort.\n\nAlso the obesity and heart disease epidemic should mean that councils welcome gyms not go out of their way to prevent them opening.",
