            "background": "Following the OFT's announcement of a Test Case to finally get a legal ruling on the fairness of Bank Charges, the FSA introduced a 'waiver' to it's members allowing them to stop dealing with complaints referring to bank charges during the course of the case. They did not however stop the banks from charging these penalties during the same period, therefore have created an unfair relationsghip between bank and consumer.\nThe 'waiver' should be cancelled and the banks and the Financial Ombudsman Service forced to deal with our complaints in a professional manner. The alternative is to force the FSA into making an order preventing it's banks from charging these penalties until such a time as a legal ruling has been made.",
