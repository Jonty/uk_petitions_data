        "background": "How can the Government not have a 'remit' to see that the publc is not unfairly treated by large corporations?\nIn the US the world price of oil goes up & day by day petrol prices follow it, the same when it goes down. This way the public does not feel it is being ripped off, unlike in the UK. All I am looking for is the same thing to happen in the UK. I believe the Government should put this point of view to the oil companies.",
