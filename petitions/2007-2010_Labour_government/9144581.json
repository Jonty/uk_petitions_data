            "background": "The three anniversaries in 2012 are:\n\n100th Anniversary of the death of William Booth, Founder of the Salvation Army.\n\n100th Anniversary of the death of Captain Scott and his four companions at the South Pole\n\nand \n\nThe 100th Anniversary of the sinking of RMS Titanic.\n\nI hope all these could be observed in some way.  I would also like to ask why there has never been a film made on the life and work of General Booth.  As the Salvation Army are second only to the UN in Disaster Relief surely this would have World Wide Appeal.  I can remember (just) a televison play called \"Shout aloud Salvation\" made I think in the 50's. But no film.",
