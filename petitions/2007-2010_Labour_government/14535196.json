To tackle recycling problems in this country we need to recycle all plastics both industrial and domestic nationwide. This is to include products such as plastic trays, films, lids, bottles, packaging etc. Most of us pay our council tax and recycling is to be inclided in this, so why can we not beat the waste targets and recycle plasticsinto pellets to make cups, packaging and more bottles instead of using a finite resource?",
