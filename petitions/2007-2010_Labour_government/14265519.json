            "background": "If this march was to go ahea,d it would be a major insult to our British soldiers who have fallen for our country in the Afgan war. All war is wrong, and soldiers on both sides of a conflict are killed. We do not have a problem with people remembering the losses of life on both sides of this conflict. As an ex member of the British armed forces (Royal Engineer) we have respect for our own and enemy dead. If they were to parade somewhere elese in the country we would be prepared to show our respects for their dead.\nBut to parade in Wootton Bassett is a direct insult to all British people whatever their religion or background. So we ask the Prime Minister to stop this march. If these extremist groups wish to march let them do it in Afagnistan, and other such like countries, and lets see how far they get.",
