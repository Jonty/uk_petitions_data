            "background": "There is no child in the country that likes homework. The main reason is that it is a complete waste of time. The whole point of school is to learn. The supposed idea of homework is to 'reinforce' what you have already learned, it doesn't, if anything it makes it even worse because being set extra tasks on a certain topic will make you lose interest. Therefore it will mean you will become bored and you will do worse in the particular topic the homework has been set on. So sign this petition and stop making children do pointless, boring homework.",
