            "background": "We have recently seen a minor scandal over alternative health practitioners promoting homeopathic remedies as protection against malaria.  There are even homeopaths promoting homeopathic pills as alternatives to AIDS medicines. \n\nAllowing alternative health practitioners with no formal training in medicine to give medical advice allows them to mislead people (even if this is not their intention) in a way that is dangerous to peoples' health, in some cases even life threatening. \n\nAlthough we do not specifically object to the sale of alternative medicines, practitioners and merchants of these products should not be allowed to make unsubstantiated claims about their effectiveness, as by doing so they are misleading their customers and potentially gravely endangering their health.",
