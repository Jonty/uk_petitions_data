The petitioner also asks the Prime Minister to confirm (i) that none of the sale proceeds were used to fund government expenditure on revenue account; (ii) that none of the sale proceeds of assets located in, or related to England in any way, were used to benefit Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland; and (iii) that under the current devolution settlement to what extent publicly owned assets located in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland are \u2018the preserve\u2019 of their devolved governments.",
