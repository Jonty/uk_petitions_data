            "background": "Aviation accounts for only 3% of emissions yet environmentalists and MPs view it as public enemy number one. The main problem is there are 6.5 billion of us and growing. The politicians cannot or dare not grasp the population nettle.  MPs have denied funding to several projects aiming to develop airliners powered by solid fuel cell/electrical technology, but continue to levy green taxes on flights and plans for Heathrow expansion when a new, more efficient offshore airport is the answer. Emissions by high speed ferries and cruise ships receive only a fraction of the news coverage given to planes, yet the cruise ship industry is growing rapidly and damaging fragile ecosystems. We the pilots, cabin crew, airport workers and all who fly demand a more sensible, unbiased and fair approach to aviation.",
