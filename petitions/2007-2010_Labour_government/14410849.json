        "background": "To ensure children maintain their smiles, B Dental Group has introduced a programme of visiting schools to promote oral health to children. This will ensure they understand the importance of their oral health and visiting the dentist. B Dental Group is championing the return of the School Dentist. B Dental Group believes that each school should offer children the opportunity to have an annual school check up and oral health education. This allows children to be seen by a dentist without having to take time off school, in an environment they are comfortable with. B Dental Group wants to make every child\u2019s experience of the dentist a fun one. During our school visits, children aged 3-5 were asked \u201cHave you ever visited the dentist?\u201d and only a shocking 50% have attended. It is recommended by the British Dental Health Foundation that babies and children should go along with their parents to their routine check-up to allow children to become familiar with the surroundings. We think the government should bring back the school dentist to ensure every child is taught how to maintain their smile, every child will receive oral health education and an annual check up at school.",
