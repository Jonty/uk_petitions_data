            "background": "When Concorde was prematurely retired for dubious financial reasons from British Airways in 2003 they promised to keep one aircraft, Concorde G-BOAB, on display at London's Heathrow airport. Now it would appear that they are planning to renege on their promise \u2013 they are in advanced discussions with a Dubai-based consortium to ship the aircraft to Dubai as a tourist attraction.\n\nAlthough some current and past British Airways Management might not wish to acknowledge it, Concorde is a part of Britain\u2019s heritage, and Concorde G-BOAB should be put on display in a place of prominence at Heathrow, not carved up piecemeal and shipped off to a foreign country. If the British government can spend \u00a330 Billion of tax-payers money propping up financial institutions then the least they can do for British heritage is to pay British Airways their 30 pieces of silver for Concorde G-BOAB, and then put it on display here in the United Kingdom, preferably at Heathrow.",
