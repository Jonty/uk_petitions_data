            "background": "\"Protected no claims\" allows bad drivers to continuously cause accidents without being punished for them. If a driver causes an accident and is subsequently charged more for his/her premium the following year, it is likely that (s)he will learn from his/her mistake and drive more carefully in the future.\n\nHowever, if a driver has protected no claims, (s)he can continuously cause a handful of accidents each year without being penalised, and so they are unlikely to ever improve their driving and will continue to cause accidents every year because they will never be in fear of receiving a higher premium.",
