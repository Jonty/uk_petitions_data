It is therfore the age at which we are considered to be able to make sensible, moral and potentialy life changing desicions. So why then are 16 year old denied the right to vote in elections for a country which they live in and care about?\nIn the following elections around a million 17 year olds will be just that little bit too young to vote and not have the chance again untill they are in their early-mid twenties.\nAs one of those potential 17 year olds I implore you to sign this petition and affect one of the much needed changes in this country who's laws are fast becoming out of date and ageist.\nIf we can not acheive a lower voting age then at least we migh draw attention to the issue and start the road to a more just system.",
