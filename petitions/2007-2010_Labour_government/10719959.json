        "background": "A Penalty charge notice for a congestion charge payment is essentially a tax against administrational problems. The government should not wish to be seen to be maximising revenue from victims of mis-management. A more civilised and logical system would charge vehicles as they are recorded entering the congestion charge zone. The system fails to target criminals who evade the congestion charge zone as, obviously, such vehicles would not have genuine number plates.",
