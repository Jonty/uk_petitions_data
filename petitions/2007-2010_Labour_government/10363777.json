To prove how weak and engineered this limit is, I was able to post 65,535 characters to the 'special requests to the web team' field in a test and the system accepted this without complaint.\n\n7,000 petitions X 1,000 characters = 6.6MB (approx).\n\nI feel that a limit of 20,000 to 25,000 characters per petition should suffice.\n\n7,000 petitions X 25,000 characters = 167MB (approx).\n\nIf the government is willing to increase the limit, I will offer to personally buy and donate to them a 300GB drive to host it all. That should be enough to hold the details of 12 million petitions (approx), assuming they were all maximum length.",
