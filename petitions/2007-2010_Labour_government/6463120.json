            "background": "We would like to strongly object to the proposed closure of Childs Ercall Primary School. \nThis school is the success it is because it is a very happy small school,has great children and very dedicated staff. \nChilds Ercall Primary School's ethos is that Every Child Matters. Behind its old exterior is a very well resourced, friendly, fun and modern environment. The recent Ofsted report praised the school.The school achieves very high standards which it can't publish. \nThe school serves a village community but has not been promoted at any level by the council. Other local schools are oversubscribed and consequently have very large classes. As each child is worth money to a school it encourages a \u201csqueeze them in\u201d culture when a better use of resources would be to expand Childs Ercall School where they have small class sizes. There is no mention in the proposal of the children or how it will effect them. \nThe Council has a duty to ensure that children get the best possible education. How does this proposed closure ensure this?\nChilds Ercall is a very good example of how education should be.\nPlease could you help ensure that this school stays open?",
