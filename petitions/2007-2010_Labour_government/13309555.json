This programme had an audience close in number to the audiences of the BBC's minority-interest digital stations 1Xtra and the Asian Network (1Xtra's reach is 634,000, and the Asian Network's reach is 421,000, while in late 2008, Malcolm Laycock's show was pulling in 511,000 listeners). While it is right that these minorities are served properly by the BBC, how can the BBC justify denying a minority of equal size a mere 30 minutes of airtime per week?",
