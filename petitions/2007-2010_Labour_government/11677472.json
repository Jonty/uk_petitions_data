        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Affecting around 10% of females of childbearing age, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is the leading cause of infertility.   Other risks affecting PCOS sufferers include Endometrial cancer, Type 2 diabetes, Hypertension, Kidney problems & Heart disease.   In addition to these risks PCOS has a host of awkward symptoms including Obesity, Acne & Hirsutism\n\nPCOS is often left untreated & undiagnosed.  The public must be made aware of both the multitude of symptoms & potentially fatal consequences arising from PCOS.  Sufferers, together with friends & family of those affected, feel the Government is doing little to increase awareness & offer support.  \n\nThe National Health Service Cervical Screening Programme, (NHSCSP) is a well respected programme and a similar programme for PCOS should be introduced, with the possibility of incorporating it into the existing NHSCSP.\n\nAlthough the cause of PCOS is not fully understood, this is not a reason to fail to take it seriously.   PCOS poses a serious threat and the more we know about it the better we can manage this terrible condition.\n\nPlease, at the very least, give people a chance to show how important this proposal is.\n\nThank you for your time.",
