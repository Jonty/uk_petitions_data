        "background": "We feel that dogs should not be inbred for 'cosmetic' reasons.  The health problems these dogs suffer should be classed as cruelty, as breeders are knowingly passing on conditions that cause great suffering to the dogs.  We believe that breeders should have to travel over a certain distance from their breeding ground to find suitable mates to reduce these health risks.",
