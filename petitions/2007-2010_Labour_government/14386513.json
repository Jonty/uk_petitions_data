            "background": "South Gloucestershire Council is committed to the free bus pass, a concessionary travel scheme providing free off-peak travel on local buses anywhere in England for South Gloucestershire\u2019s over 60 or disabled residents. \n\nDespite being a supposedly nationally-funded scheme, South Gloucestershire Council already has to use \u00a31.1m of council tax payers\u2019 money to fund the scheme.\n\nIn April 08, a 3-year funding deal was agreed, but the Government\u2019s Transport Minister has now re-opened it. Under the Department for Transport\u2019s (DfT) proposals, South Gloucestershire is set to lose \u00a3340K of its agreed funding for 2010-11 \u2013 the biggest loss for any council outside of London. This would take the annual local contribution up to nearly \u00a31.4m.\n\nSouth Gloucestershire residents join with the Council in opposing the DfT re-opening a 3-year funding deal in its third year and demand the Prime Minister intervene to protect local bus funding.",
