        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "All these UK banks are integral to the economy of the UK. In addition millions of pensioners and employees have a long term interest in the survival of these companies. Nationalisation would destroy a vital sourse of revenue for these pensioners and destabilise employment within the banks. Suspending shares would keep the banks from being attacked by the markets, help the banks rebuild their balance sheets without pressure from the markets and maintain long term pensioner investments.",
