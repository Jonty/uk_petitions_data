        "background": "I am presetly going through a divorce, It has nearly being going on a year now and it would appear that having both sides spent a lot of money (I would think seven or eight thousand pound to date)we are no further forward. \nEveryone I have spoken to that has been through a divorce has the same complaint, the solicitors drag it out for as long as possible to earn more money. If you complain (which I have) all you get is \"well go to someone else if your not happy\" This will cost you even more money, and they know that.\nThey are in a win win situation.\nEverybody without exception I have spoken to feel that the costs for work done by these solicitors is scandalous.\nBoth solicitor in my case are  in the Resolution organisation which is supposed to have standards they follow, well thats a waste of time because they will still do what they want to do.\nI just feel someone should make a stand and hopefully somebody will have a look at the costs involved in this.",
