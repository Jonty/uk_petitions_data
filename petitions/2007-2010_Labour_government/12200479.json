            "background": "6,600 women a year are diagnosed with ovarian cancer, 4,400 of those will die.  There is currently no screening test for ovarian cancer, however, a simple blood test CA125 could potentially identify ovarian cancer. I would like to set up a petition to get women to have this blood test when they have their cervical smear test.  It could save money and lives by detecting the disease early.",
