        "background": "I wish to have an inquiry into the conduct of the British Government and their legal system with special attention being drawn to the Welsh Language Act. I was born in Wales and I am a fluent Welsh Speaker I have found myself at a serious disadvantage when the Legal System of this Country ignored my rights and did not give me a fair trial because of my being Welsh. I am Welsh and I should be treated fairly and equally, and my Human Rights should be respected with regard to my having to appear in front of an English speaking judge.",
