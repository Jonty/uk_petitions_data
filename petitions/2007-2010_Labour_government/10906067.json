            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Fractional Reserve Banking is a common practice among banks that allows them to lend more money than they have on deposit. While creating a temporary inflationary boom, it allows banks to be subject to a crisis of confidence and subsequent collapse - as demonstrated recently.\n\nOur banking system should not be based on a 'confidence trick' but on sound moral principles.\n\nLending what one does not have is a form of fraud for ordinary people, but banks are allowed to practice institutionalized fraud as part of standard business practice. A truly solvent and sustainable bank would only lend what it has on deposit, like any other person in society.\n\nWithout fractional reserve banking much of the excesses of banking would be eliminated, while capital and expertise would be devoted to more economically meaningful endeavours such as the building of infrastructure and resource extraction etc.. Only the best projects and those people most able to repay loans would receive funding, reducing the indebtedness of the nation and forcing us to live within our means - a quaint but necessary principle.",
