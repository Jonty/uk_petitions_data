            "background": "In light of his recent ruling allowing a catholic adoption agency to discriminate against adopting couple based on sexual orientation. Justice Briggs should be removed from his position of authority as I believe that unilaterally disallow a minority group like this is not only discrimination but is unlawful. An adoption agency are a publicly funded institution charged with finding safe and viable homes for children, they should not be allowed to unilaterally discriminate against prospective parents, other than those proven to be unsuitable based on establish criteria. In all instances gay individuals have to go through the same checks to prove that they are valid and caring people suitable for adoption and in many cases this process is often more invasive and extensive due to the social stigma occasionally associated with being a gay parent. In addition there are certain instances are preferable candidates for adoption above heterosexual couples (for example in cases of sexual abuse).",
