            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Laser eye surgery was rejected to be available on the NHS in 2004. This decision was due to the treatment being new. They also argued that as people could wear glasses/contact lenses problems with sight were not an issue. 4 years on this needs to be addressed again. People living with eye sight disabilities should not now be paying thousands of pounds to correct the disability. Glasses/contact lenses are available but cost people with eye problems hundreds of pounds a year. If you have a hearing disability you are not expected to 'put up with it' just because hearing aids are available (these are also available free on the NHS unlike glasses where to get anything free your eyesight problems must be linked to an illness and not just hireditry)People who wear glasses also often suffer from low self-esteem although this has never been addressed. If you have low self-esteem and ask for cosmetic surgery this is available on the NHS so why is it different from those of us with eye sight problems. Please sign this petition and help people with eyesight problems get the medical help that they deserve.",
