            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Warned lists are used to fit trials into court time. Defendants, victims, witnesses and expert witnesses involved in cases on warned lists are given last minute notification that they should appear in court at 4:30pm the day before the trial. In some cases this makes it impossible for police officers, witnesses and experts to attend court, and therefore reduces the quality of justice. The allocation to a short warned list cannot be challenged and often seems arbitrary. This system shows immense disrespect to police officers and professionals who may appear as expert witnesses, as well as to the victims and defendants. The Prime Minister should change this system, force the courts to organise their affairs more efficiently and give a minimum of 2 days notice of a court date.",
