        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I believe that if winter tyres were introduced as a mandatory requirement for winter driving, between certain periods in the winter months, that road safety would be increased and the number of accidents reduced.  Also we may expect an appropriate reduction in how winter weather affects our economy when small amounts of snow and ice are present on road surfaces.",
