            "background": "Too many schools that are deemed fit for learning disabled children, 'ABA' schools, rate a one-size-fits-all, rote learning system, and most have not helped or enabled children to transfer to mainstream schools (as is meant to be a goal of ABA schools) despite the pedagogy and repetition that is Pavlovian, it is full of meaningless data- taking. For example, some children have been at such schools for 10 years + and still cannot speak, read or write and remain in nappies. ABA schools cost approx 80-100K per child per year (transport and escort included) The schools should broaden their scope to include all approaches known (such as floor-play and psychological help for children as well as counselling where appropriate)",
