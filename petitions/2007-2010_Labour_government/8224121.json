            "action": "clarify the Data Protection Act so that providers of essential services, such as utilities companies, and the government, can allow married couples the right to jointly register as customers.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Many companies will allow only one person to register as a customer, so bills are in the name of either solely the wife or (more usually) solely the husband. Many organisations request copies of recent utility bills as part of identity checks and women can find themselves unable to produce these. \n\nCompanies cite the Data Protection Act as their reason for this when the Act makes no such provision.  The government itself refuses to allow registration of two married people in services it provides - for example, Child Benefit.\n\nThe petition is to request the government to lead by example in the services it provides, and also to clarify the Data Protection Act so that companies can no longer hide behind it in their refusal to accept married couples as joint customers.  \n\nAfter all, marriage is when two become one.  This move will remove one the things in our community which works against marriage as an institution.",
