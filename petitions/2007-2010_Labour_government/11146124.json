        "action": "Make the installation of solar panels on new build homes compulsory in the UK",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Climate change needs more support.  If all new houses had to install solar panels to deliver the houses energy needs then this would help reduce the need for energy from fossil fuels.  By doing this average costs of solar panels would come down and existing home owners are more likely to be able to afford them too, especially as Gas and Electricity prices rise.  It should also increase the job sector in this market as extra capacity is needed; which would also benefit the economy.  The cost of this on new homes is relatively small in the overall cost of buying a new house and most home owners could equate it to the future energy cost savings.",
