            "background": "Payday Loan companies are loan sharks who prey on vulnerable people who are desperate. They often charge in excess of 1000% APR and create a cycle of debt that it is nearly impossible to get out off. In some states in the US the interest that these companies is allowed to charge is capped and companies must allow people who \"rollover\" their loan 4 times to pay back in 4 equal installments without  interest. This should be applied throughout the UK.",
