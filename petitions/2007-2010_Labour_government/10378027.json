            "action": "Amend the Renewable Obligation to support introduction of upgraded biogas into UK gas networks",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We urge the Government to remove the obstacles and disincentives to injecting bio-methane into the existing gas networks. At present, the Renewable Obligation only rewards renewable electricity being fed into the National Grid. Natural gas is a clean, efficient fuel for both industrial, domestic or transport energy for which there is already a widespread national infrastructure and regulatory framework. Substitute natural gas, or bio-methane, is available from waste and wastewater treatment, existing landfills and dedicated biomass conversion. There is no technical impediment to preclude injecting bio-methane into the gas grid, which would allow this resource to reach its most efficient usage. However, until the Renewable Obligation can recognise gaseous renewables as well as electricity, the market will be skewed towards the generation of electricity from biogas, rather than more efficient uses such as combined heat and power or even vehicle fuel. Without delay, this anomaly should be corrected so we can reduce our reliance on imported fossil fuels whilst reducing carbon emissions.",
