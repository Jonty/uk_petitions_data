            "background": "After the tragic death of 14 year old who was crossing the A45 trunk road from Blackymore to Wootton, Northampton on 13th October 2009, we want the Highways Agency to reverse their decision and go ahead with the installation of a safe pedestrian footbridge.\n\nThere have been other fatalities on this section of the A45 and numerous injuries to pedestrians crossing what is a major trunk road and the main arterial route into and out of Northampton with a traffic speed of  70mph. \n\nThe current pedestrian crossing facilities are woefully inadequate and unsafe, this was noted and confirmed in the HIghways Agency survey dated November 2008. Less than 1 year later we are faced with another death on this section of road.\n\nIt is now imperative that this matter be addressed as a matter of urgency.",
