This Prime Minister and Government can not afford to be soft on crime and the protection of life in the UK. One of the greatest legacies this Prime Minister and Government can leave is the assurance to law abiding citizens and families that their loved ones will always be safe and home. No parent deserves to bury a murdered child. No child deserves to bury a murdered parent. No child deserves to bury a murdered sibling. No couple deserves to be bury his/her murdered partner.",
