To make further cuts to our already depleted armed forces would place our nation at risk from current and future threats.  This is a dangerous act and should not stand.  We understand that the ENTIRE Harrier fleet of both the navy and RAF could be scrapped as a cost cutting measure.  This is utterly deplorable and if it happens, would remove an entire capability which has been utilised so effectively in Afghanistan.  These cuts MUST be prevented.  The safety of our nation and our people could be compromised if we continue to damage our forces in this manner",
