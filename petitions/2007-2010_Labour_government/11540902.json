This is ruining the game that we love and i think that it all it does is make school kids want to be a footballer even when they are not good enough. They will put all their effort into playing football and none into school work. There is nothing wrong with having a dream but the kids that arnt good enough out all their effort into football and i feel that this could play a part in our lazy culture of wanting to do as little work as they want for the most amount of money.",
