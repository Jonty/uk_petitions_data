        "action": "Provide BBC licence payers with acceptable content and pressurise the Rt. Hon. Chris Mole MP to resign over his comments to the media",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In the wake of two BBC scandals in the space of a fortnight, I would like to see the BBC paying more attention to the views of its licence payers (who complain).\n\nAs complaining licence payers, we expect certain bland and faceless standards to be maintained, so to have this entertaining rubbish broadcast by the BBC is an absolute outrage. I may not have actually listened to either show, but I certainly complained when I read the fair analysis and absolutely true facts of each scandal in the Sun and Daily Mail. On the whole, we would like to see fewer jokes in comedy shows, less loud music in chart shows and a few more documentaries about the digestive system if you don\u2019t mind.\n\nI also urge that Chris Mole MP resigns following his thoughtless comments about Jeremy Clarkson\u2019s thoughtless comments about prostitutes. Mr. Mole suggested to the media that Mr. Clarkson should lose his job, doing so with complete disregard for the feelings of Mr. Clarkson or his family. It\u2019s an absolute outrage.",
