        "background": "GM crops have a lot to offer the world, as well as small countries such as the UK. If the UK is to switch to GM crops we would shed a lot of dependence on other countries. Furthermore, genetic modification, could help save millions of lives a year as many fruits can have vaccines incorporated into them.\n Many people have safety fears over GM crops however many of these are based on the scaremongering by many anti-scientific, pro-organic lobbies, so a full government consultation should also be implemented to allay peoples fears.",
