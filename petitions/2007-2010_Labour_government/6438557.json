            "background": "The issue of Ventophiles using puppets and toys to entice innocents into their network is a serious and worrying development, partly brought about by the rise of the Internet and ease of modern communications.\n\nThe Ventophiles are organised, devious and extremely dangerous. We believe that is morally wrong for puppets to be used in this way. What could be more family friendly than a harmless puppet? The answer is nothing. That is what makes these people so dangerous.\n\nWe hereby demand an immediate investigation into the Ventophile network.",
