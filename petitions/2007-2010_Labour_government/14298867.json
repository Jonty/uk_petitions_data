            "background": "Anybody who would intend to use such equipment for criminal purposes will have no reservations about aquiring them through the post, so why not let responible citizens have the power to protect themselves and others with a less than leathal weapon?  This proposal is more realistic and safer than personal protection firearms, will discourage violent attacks as well as reducing incidents of people carrying knives and ambiguous 'weapons of oppourtunity.' Tasers are legal in many of the European Union member states, so why not bring us in line? Albeit in an inevitably more complicated British way. I would appreciate intelligent arguments in response to this proposal.",
