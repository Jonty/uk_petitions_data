            "background": "Buzzers fitted on high dependancy wards in the Queen Elizabeth hospital for patients to buzz for a nurse day or night . I have been visiting my son since the 1st of January 2010 and got talking to relatives of numerous patients in the waiting rooms , all have voiced there concerns about there loved ones not being able to buzz for a nurse on the H/D wards , patients are left in soiled beds , are falling out of bed breaking limbs because they are to weak to stand yet try to get out to get help as nurses are not there to listen to there calls  , my own son was left to choke on his own bile and is now brain damaged , all these issues could have been avoided if buzzers had been installed .It is frightening listening to the crying of relatives of these patients and the awful accounts day after day that they tell me .",
