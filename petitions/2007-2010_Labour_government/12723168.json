            "background": "I like many other people in this country do a very low mileage in my car each year, but i pay the same in road tax as somebody that does a very high mileage.\nWater meters were introduced so that people only paid for what they used and so as not to subsidise those who used more.\nThat is why i feel it would be a fairer system for the government to collect its revenue by adding it to the cost of fuel and abolishing road tax, this way drivers will be paying for what they use, and not subsidising the heavy road users.\nI feel this method would also encourage car sharing, meaning less vehicles on the roads, reducing road accidents and causing less damage to the roads themselves",
