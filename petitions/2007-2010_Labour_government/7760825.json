            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The invasion of privacy in this country has now reached epidemic proportions and the right of an individual to privacy is being eroded on a daily basis, unnecessary proliferation of cctv technology and its derivatives is making unwanted intrusions on our right to freedom of movement and privacy, cameras are recording in changing rooms and even public toilets with the view that a crime MAY take place, this is not a good enough reason for the siting of a camera and only where it has been proven that crime does take place over a period of time (to be agreed) should a cctv camera be allowed to be sited, where cameras existed and have proven to be ineffective in fighting crime they should be removed, where cameras exist only for the benefit of private individuals or organisations they should be controlled by a licence process enforceable by council inspectors with annual fees and  inspection processes to ensure abuses do not take place, I would suggest an annual fee on a sliding scale from \u00a350 Pa to \u00a31,000 per annum collected by local councils would be a starting point",
