            "background": "We ask the Prime Minister to amend UK Law to make it illegal to import live animals into the British Isles except, under exceptional circumstances, for their welfare.\n\nMany animals, like elephants, bears, tigers, lions and chimpanzees, are sensitive, social animals with a capacity for suffering that exceeds humans'.  They have to be captured as babies, in order that they be safely handled and trained.  Captivity is for these creatures a harrowing and prolonged agony, ending in neglect, once their useful working lives finish.\n\nPermitting live import of animals sends the wrong signal to unscrupulous groups and individuals all over the world\n\nOnly a comprehensive ban on trade can prevent it and support education to protect endangered species.\n\nWe ask the Prime Minister to provide the necessary leadership, introduce the legislation in the UK and propose it to the EU, to be translated into a Union-wide Directive to Member States.",
