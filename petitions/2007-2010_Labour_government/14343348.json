            "background": "Since February 2009, a significant amount of radio stations and music channels have decided not to play Chris Brown's music due to what happened between him and Rihanna. His music and social life are to sepereate things. As none of us know the facts of what happened that night, we shouldnt be quick to judge and instantly boycott his music. Signing this petition will help his music be played more reasonably and decently. This does not condone domestic violence. We all make mistakes and deserve to be forgiven.",
