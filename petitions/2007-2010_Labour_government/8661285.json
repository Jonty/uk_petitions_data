            "background": "It rages me to think that I am working to pay for people who do nothing & I myself am wanting to become a mother but cannot as I do not want to bring a life into the world and not be able to provide a good life for him/her.\nI believe that working tax credits should be available to everyone no matter what their income is.  In Australia EVERYONE receives $4,000 per child when the child is born to help towards supplying the necessary items and $1,000 per year to help with baby/toddler items or school equipment etc.\nIt is not fair to think that the standard of living for people who earn less is being brought to the same level of someone who has worked hard to get to where they are now.\nIt is not fair for the people who pay their taxes be disadvantaged because they have values and want to work for what they have rather than live off benefits or not further their career prospects.\nThe way forward would be for people to receive the same amount of working tax credits no matter how much they earn or lower the tax that married people with or without children pay.",
