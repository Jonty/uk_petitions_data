            "background": "Last summer's bad weather caused a record drop in the number of UK beaches receiving top ratings for water quality, the Marine Conservation Society (MCS) has said.\n\nThere was a 10% fall in the number of bathing spots recommended for excellent water quality in the MCS's annual Good Beach Guide, as coastal areas were hit by pollution washed down by the heavy rains.\n\nIt is the biggest year-on-year drop in numbers receiving the top rating in the guide's 21-year history, with 443 UK beaches -(57%) recommended this year compared to 495 last year.\n\nWe the undersigned call on the P.M. to address reasons for the number of beaches failing the minimum European legal standards and do soemthing about the number of British beaches that failed water quality tests (which have more than tripled from 17 to 53). Please design a leaflet (I can do that).",
