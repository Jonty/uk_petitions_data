The integrity of the competition would be compromised for the sake of the clubs creating another source of revenue.\n\nThe move may also have a disproportionate impact on clubs in the countries where the games are staged, by diverting much-need sponsorship and attendance receipts from local clubs to the much larger and wealthier English clubs. \n\nFor further information see:\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7232390.stm",
