            "background": "There are currently an estimated 500,000 people being starved, tortured, raped, murdered and even gassed in gulags across North Korea. \n\nOrganisations like LiNK (Liberty in North Korea) have collected testimonies from former inmates and prison guards about the extent of the abuse. These are men, women and children who are completely innocent of any crime. The North Korean penal system works on the principle that if one person speaks ill of the State or the Dear Leader, then 3 generations of his/her family must be purged (to root out the 'seed of dissidence').\n\nFormer guards have spoken of gas chambers in which entire families are murdered as scientists record their findings.\n\nThese camps can be seen quite clearly on Google Earth - we are all witnesses.",
