I feel those who have left the cabinet have not done so for the good of Labour or the good of the country but for there own self interest. The Prime Minister is not the sole person to blame for the world wide recession and in my eyes he is the right man to sort our economy out. Lets hope that there are more willing memebers with the passion to confront problems rather then wlak away like Mr Purnell.",
