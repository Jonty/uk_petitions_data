God save our gracious Queen\nLong live our noble Queen\nGod save the Queen\nSend her victorious\nHappy and glorious\nLong to reign over us\nGod save the Queen\n\n2. O Lord our God arise\nScatter her enemies \nAnd make them fall\nConfound their politics\nFrustrate their knavish tricks\nOn Thee our hopes we fix\nGod save us all\n\n3. Thy choicest gifts in store \nOn her be pleased to pour\nLong may she reign\nMay she defend our laws\nAnd ever give us cause \nTo sing with heart and voice\nGod save the Queen\n\n4. Not in this land alone\nBut be God's mercies known\nFrom shore to shore\nLord make the nations see\nThat men should brothers be\nAnd form one family\nThe wide world over\n\n5. From every latent foe\nFrom the assassins blow\nGod save the Queen\nO'er her thine arm extend\nFor Britain's sake defend\nOur mother, prince, and friend\nGod save the Queen\n\n6. Lord grant that Marshal Wade\nMay by thy mighty aid\nVictory bring\nMay he sedition hush\nAnd like a torrent rush\nRebellious Scots to crush\nGod save the King",
