            "background": "We have a system which encourages people to believe that they must be \"on the property ladder\". This has led to people committing enormous amounts of money to purchase some truly awful properties, completely unsuitable as family accommodation. We need more family friendly homes, with gardens/space for children to play, or for people to grown some of their own food. Planners are, also, blinkered. It would be possible to build eco friendly homes from timber (from renewable resources of course!) which would be fast to erect, and would soon blend in to their surroundings. There are some pre-fabricated homes which are economical to erect and user friendly to inhabit. These would require less financial committment, and allow more people, of all ages, to live comfortably in their own space.\nAnyone taking a mortgage should be told the true cost, including all buying costs, plus interest, insurance etc. This would allow for reasoned decisions, and a more balanced approach to the myth of the property ladder.",
