            "background": "In 2006 my daughter aged 8 months died whilst we were in Paris. We had the post mortem in Paris which was a profoundly distressing process to endure. There exists easily rectifyable differences between French and English death certificates that result in british nationals having to endure a second post mortem in the UK that had it not been for a chance piece of luck we would had to endure our child going through. Once is bad enough but the prospect of a second post mortem we were found unbearable to contemplate. \nThis is a growing and yet unnecessary problem and more and more families are having to suffer the same distress.\nIn 2002 138 british nationals died whilst in France, 2003 it was 228, 2004 it was 315, 2005 it was 282 and in 2006 it was 423 and in the first month of 2007 alone it was already up to 91.\nMany of these 423 will be repatriated only to find that they need a second PM in the uk for no other reason than the french Death Certificate is incompatable with our own. \nUp to 423 additional post mortems, 423 families suffering profound stress and anxiety if we fail to act.",
