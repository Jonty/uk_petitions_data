        "background": "We state a lack of confidence in the Suffolk Constabulary in being able to respond quickly and effectively to a particular homophobic hate crime within Suffolk, and that this illustrates a failure of a duty of care and in maintaining policies responsible for the protection of communities and individuals. We believe there is an insult to human dignity where the incitement to violence and vandalism towards LGBT community members is seen as a lesser crime to that of incitement to any other minority group within our society.",
