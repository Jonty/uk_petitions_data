            "background": "Tam Dalyell claimed the cost of storage bookcases for the '50 or so years of Hansard which I own'.  He doesn't OWN it, it belongs to the people of this country and like other employees, when they leave, he should have left it behind.  If he wishes to purchase the paperwork (in the same way that I would have to purchase it if I wanted a copy of Hansard) then that is up to him.  Nobody should be allowed to take away official government documentation when they leave office.",
