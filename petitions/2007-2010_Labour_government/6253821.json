        "background": "You may well have noticed how unbelieveably expensive it is to purchase a single bottle of water.\n\nFor example, most vending machines now charge on average \u00a31 for a bottle of water.\n\nHow is it, that 5 litres of tap water cost about 1p and these companies can charge stupid amounts, becuase they know that we humans need water to survive. \n\nThis commodity isn't highly taxed, such as petrol, which coincidently, I can buy one litre of petrol, cheaper than a bottle of water, even though it's been through an expensive refinery process!!\n\nIn short: Please stop these companies from doing this and placing a realistic RRP price on the product.",
