            "background": "it has now been almost a year since the vat rate was reduced to 15%.\nbut unfortunatly this reduction has not been passed on to the consumer. \nthis can be verified by the high street shops such as poundland and the 99 pence shops.the sales receipt's show vat at 15% but the items still cost you a pound or 99pence. this means that these shops have had a 2% increase in profits that have not been passed on to the consumer. \nthese are not the only shops to have jumpt on to this band wagon.\nwill this 2% be collected from these outlets at the end of the year and be used to fund the pay back for this vat reduction. this money realy belongs to the patrons of these establishments but their is no way that they can claim this vat reduction back from these high street shops.",
