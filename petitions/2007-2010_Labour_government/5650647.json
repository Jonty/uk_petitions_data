            "background": "I think that we should commemorate peace not victory . Peace which cost the lives of millions of soldiers and should be valued .\n I think we need to be reminded of the value of peace not the value of victory .  I think we should be magnaminous in victory and regard the true victory as attaining peace not beating our competetor or enemy ! Vitriol tends to grate on peoples' nerves and alienates as opposed to unite groups .\n July the 4th gets on my nerves as does Zimbabwe's heroes day , I think its silly to be reminded that you were beaten in a war 250 yrs ago but we are just as guilty of it if we keep saying we beat the Germans twice , once in 1966 and in 1945 and celebrate a VE day  ! What was the victory, beating the Germans or regaining the peace we lost ?\nPerhaps if we change the name of ve day to peace day other countries may follow suit and we could start a movement, a movement towards peace ?\nCompetetion is not a dirty word but maybe we can compete to be the most peaceful nation ? \nJonathan Mountain",
