        "background": "Following Lord Mancroft's recent spell in the Royal United Hospital in Bath, he has outspokenly criticised the standard of behaviour and cleanliness of nurses in the hospital. \n\nHe claims they had dirty hands and spoke openly around him of their sex lives showing themselves to be promiscuous in their behaviour.\n\nI would urge the Prime Minister to congratulate Lord Mancroft on his being open about such matters, and take the necessary steps to ensure that all nurses are properly trained in the way they conduct themselves in the ward.",
