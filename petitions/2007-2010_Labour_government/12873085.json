            "background": "Central to the \"Every child matters\" policy is the idea that services and provisions for children are to put children at the center of their focus. Essentially placing the student at the centre of a group of professional sounds great but in fact there is little to no coordination between the various agencies and as a consequence children are not getting the help they need and it is all too easy for children to be overlooked . This is especially the case when the child is almost given the responsiblity for its own care !?\nI would like the Prime Minister to allow common sense to prevail here by making someone responsible for coordinating the efforts of other professionals surrounding provision for children !\nIt doesn;t need extra personnel just someone to take responsibility for the whole process .",
