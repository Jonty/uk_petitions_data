Energy companies can still choose individually to behave non-competitively and follow others' prices up, rather than force them down. \n\nThe same may be true for many products, for example spectacles and contact lenses and some foods. A conspiracy may be tacit rather than explicit.\n\nThe unseen hand of the market cannot work if it has been tied behind its back.\n\nOrdering utility companies to reduce their prices by at least 15% would boost the economy and assist the housing market.",
