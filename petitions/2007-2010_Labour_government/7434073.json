            "background": "Currently, the unemployed are allowed to give the excuse of lack of either qualifications or experience when turning down jobs, thereby rendering themselves unemployable. \nContinued non compliance with their 'jobseeking agreement' should result in a jobseeker being forced to do national service. In the case of people who, for medical reasons, won't be accepted into the armed forces those people should be forced to do community service. This would then allow them to gain work experience and, in the case of community service, give them the opportunity to repay their dept to the tax payer.\nCommunity Service could also be used to allow those that are 'on the sick' and claiming incapacity benefits, the opportunity to do therapeutic work.",
