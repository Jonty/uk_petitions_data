            "background": "Proselytising is the process of converting a person into a religious belief, or attempting to do so. It is, in effect an incitement to hatred towards former, or different beliefs, or the absence of religious beliefs.\n\nCriminalising the activities of proselytisers would prevent them from berating members of the public with threats of eternal retribution, or inciting acts of violence, discrimination or hatred against non-believers. The existing racial and religious hatred/public order legislation is not adequate to cover this activity, and non-Christians/non-Muslims, especially Jews and atheists are not adequately protected from the offence and intimidation that these activities cause.",
