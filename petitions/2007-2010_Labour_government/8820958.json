            "background": "Before any planning application reaches committee level, such applications are first left to the devices of the planning officer. It is here the planning officer can begin his or her vendetta against the applicant by meticulously perverting the application. As part of the Council\u2019s Constitution, the Development Control Department is granted power, subject to exceptions, to grant approval of or refuse planning permissions through a system named the \"Scheme of Delegated Powers\". This scheme is the inner sanctuary of the corrupt planning officer, where he or she can seriously corrupt planning applications and then approve or refuse them at their discretion, immaterial of the schemes exceptions. In the event that an application surpasses this scheme, then a planning officer can still misdirect by passing up their misrepresented reports to the planning committee for deliberation and push those members of the committee in the planning officers\u2019 direction.",
