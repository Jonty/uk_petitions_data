        "background": "Current UK Unemployment levels are 12 year high.\nThere should be a limit or temporary hold on Tier 1 ( General ) Work permits approvals. \nThe job market is struggling and lot of people are looking for work. Is there a point bringing an immigrant and offering them a job ?\nThe Tier 1 Application approval time is currently 3 weeks which is forcing lot of people around the globe to come to UK and work. \nWhy the Home office is not doing anything to control immgiration ? Do they really want the immigrants or the \u00a3 750 fee they charge to the applicants.\nHence we strongly believe there should be a Temporary hold on Tier 1 approvals.",
