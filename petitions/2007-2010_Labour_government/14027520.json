        "background": "BT has been removing the Iconic Red K6 Phonebox's across the UK since the early 80's, and replaced many with the modern Glass and Aluminium versions. Unfortunately, BT is running a program to remove ALL phoneboxes that they deem to be unprofitable, whether they are the aluminium, or the iconic Red K6 Phonebox. \n\nA certain sign of a phonebox on the final list to be removed is the loss of the coin operated phone service. These are a vital emergency call point, even if they are used less than once a year. They are also a part of the landscape in many areas, and are a symbol of the once proud United Kingdom.",
