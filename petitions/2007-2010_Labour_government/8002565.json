When on-line banking fraud is reported to police, they are helpless in tracking the fraudsters because the data is no longer available. Legislation needs to be brought in to enforce the retention of this data in order to protect innocent victims. THESE OFFENCES ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE PREVALENT.",
