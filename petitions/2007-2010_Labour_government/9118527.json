            "background": "Pugneys Country Park is owned by Wakefield Council. It is a 300 acre park which is used regularly by the residents of Wakefield and its surrounding areas for exercise, dog walking, sports training and plain simple enjoyment. Wakefield District Council have ruled that as of 1st April 2008 that a \u00a32 parking fee will be charged to all who park their vehicles. For the people who use this park regularly it will mean they will need to pay upto \u00a314 per week to walk along the parks paths. Hundreds of people use this park daily and its is unacceptable to ask people to pay to park to use a public park which is already funded through council tax charges.",
