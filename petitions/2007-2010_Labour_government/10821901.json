            "background": "The current Pro 40 county competition is to be discontinued after the 2009 cricket season. This competition remains very popular with county cricket supporters and there has been insufficient consultation with supporters. Whilst recognising the popularity of the county 20 over competition and the wish of the ECB and counties to maximise income, it is the view of the petitioners that the 20 and 40 over competitions could co-exist for the benefit of all cricket stakeholders.\nThe current 50 over county competition is declining in spectator popularity and the international 50 over games may be discontinued in favour of more international 20 over games. The petitioners urge the ECB to promote the 40 over county game in preference to the 50 over county game recognising its attractiveness to domestic spectators and sponsors.",
