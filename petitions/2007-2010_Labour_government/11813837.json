This is best illustrated by example: I live in a road with many parked cars and lots of children playing in between. Nearby, there is a wide, clear, open road with no hazards. The limit on BOTH roads is currently 30mph.\n\nSpeed limits differ in suitability depending on local conditions. 30mph is far too fast on the narrow residential road, but crawlingly, frustratingly slow on the open road. It would be more appropriate to have 20mph and 40mph respectively.\n\nDon't penalise drivers for doing a safe 40 in a current 30 zone - and crack down on people who speed through genuine high-risk areas.",
