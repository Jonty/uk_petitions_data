            "background": "The motorcycle test fees will rise to an all time high of \u00a396 this year according to the DSA. When the car test is only \u00a356 this is both imbalanced and unfair. \nI personally see this as yet another level of discrimination from the Driving Standards Agency, it is obvious that they want less motorcyclists to pass or even take the test.\nMore bikes will make car drivers more aware of bikes and therefore can only add to road safety. More cars on the road just increases congestion, pollution and bad driving attitudes from people driving motorised wheel chairs. Please sign this petition and ask the governement to review and reduce the Test fees fro the practical motorcycle test.",
