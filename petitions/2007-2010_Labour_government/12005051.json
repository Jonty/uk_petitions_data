        "background": "Pensioners have, for far to long, suffered the pain of an income that barely gets them by.\nThe time has come for the government tot do the right thing and make all pensions tax free.\nWhen we pay into a pension scheme, the money that we earn is taxed first and then we pay into, if we choose, a pension scheme.  Is it fair for the people of this country to be taxed twice on the same income?\nTimes have changed and with the figure of pensioners to working age people ration being on the rise it effectively means more and more people will have to suffer as a result.",
