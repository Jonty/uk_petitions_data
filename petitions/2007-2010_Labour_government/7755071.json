Unfortunately, a CRB accepted by one organisation is not accepted by another, so individuals have to get re-checked each time.  \n\nThis is often at great expense to the organisation or individual, as well as administration costs and consumed hours at the Bureau.\n\nWe the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to amend the current CRB system to a single universal check, possibly in the form of a driving license-style ID card, that expires every two years.",
