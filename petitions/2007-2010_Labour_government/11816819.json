JSA should only be paid to those who can show a CV with recent work history.  I have just been made redundant and as somebody with a mortgage on a leasehold flat I don't even get help with my service charges - yet if I was renting the same flat then my rent would be paid by Housing benefits.  The system penalises those of us who work yet pays loads in benefits to alcholics, single mums and the work shy.",
