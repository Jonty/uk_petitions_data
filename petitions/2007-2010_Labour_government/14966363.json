They name this the Ferneybeds Surface Mine and intend to submit a planning application near the end of this year, the mine is to be 300m from existing properties.  This area has suffered enough of the dirt and noise from this type of mining and the residents need a break from it.  We have surface mines operating all around our village and have also suffered the burning and burial during the foot and mouth crisis.  For the health and wellbeing of the population of this village, and the impact on the value of the properties, this mining needs to be stopped.",
