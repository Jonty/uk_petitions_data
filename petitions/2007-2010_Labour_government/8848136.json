            "background": "Britain's rising birth rate, currently growing at the highest rate for nearly 30 years, should be considered an environmental liability.\n\nUnless action is taken the UK population will grow by a further 10 million by 2074, \n\nUK population has grown by 20% since 1950 - in less than a lifetime. There are more than 60 million people now living in the UK, one of the most densely populated countries in the world, and our numbers are rising faster than ever before.\n\nA mix of high population and rising consumption means that humanity is currently outstripping the biological capacity of the Earth by 25% a year. By 2050, when global population is projected at 9.2 billion - 2.5 billion rise - humans will be using the biocapacity of two earths.\n\nwe must try to keep our population stable if not carbon emmisions will rise and more natural resources will be used up faster and more natural land/countryside will be destroyed \n\nits not as if the law will deprive people of having kids at all just a maximum of two which i believe is enough",
