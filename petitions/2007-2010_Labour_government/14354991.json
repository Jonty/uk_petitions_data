            "background": "as a nhw street co-ordinator we approached the local council to get a huge camper van removed from our emergency access to our homes.the neighbours have requested it be moved and was abused for their trouble. the fire brigade have contacted the council way back in the early summer of 2009 and yet nothing has been done apart from my receiving abusive behaviour from the council worker who owns the camper van.\nas i am spokesperson for the nhw,how can we get this person to remove the offending vehicle .the fire brigade wish to chevron the area and yet it still is in situ so where do we go from here? the council and the fire brigade have failed so far so is this a case of the council workers being allowed to do whatever it wishes without a thought for the residents safety?. we have had 3 incidents where that vehicle blocked the passing of 2 ambulances and an undertaker in the last 2 years since it has been there.could you please assist us by investigating this issue because this could be life threatening for any one of us.\nregards",
