            "background": "A bereaved fiance\u00e9 of a Royal Marine killed in Afghanistan was caused further pain when the service will she knew had been lodged before her partners deployment, could not be found. A will from 2004 was being acted on. She bravely fought to have searches made and despite constantly being told the will didn\u2019t exist it was eventually found \u201cin a drawer\u201d some weeks later. She hadn\u2019t seen the will or had confirmation but her partner had assured her she would be secure.\n\nAn apology was sent by the Service Personnel & Veterans Agency  and I quote \u201c Had it not been for your intervention, his executors may have attempted to resolve the estate with an out of date will that did not reflect his true intentions\u201d\n\nThere are reportedly 15 similar cases across all the Services of which only 3 have been resolved. We owe it to those that have laid down their lives for this country to ensure their last wishes are in no doubt.",
