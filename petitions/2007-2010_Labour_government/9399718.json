        "background": "The sum of debt-free money in circulation has declined to a few percent of the total. \n\nMost of our money is a result of loans issued by private multinational banks. The increase in debt-money is not sustainable because debt comes attached with compound interest: to pay the interest requires ever more loans.\n\nThis situation could lead to the destabilization of our civilization.\n\nThe proposed solution would help restore economic sanity and reduce the suffering of the people.",
