        "action": "ban poor quality and dangerous imports from the far east, have uk prisoners produce quality goods at low cost",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "due to the amount of cheap goods being imported from the far east, such as china, there has been many goods of poor quality and childrens toys brought into our country which have been made with high levels of dangerous toxins such as lead in crayons, pain and plastics. these items also break very easily and small particles can easily choke small children. also, many items of clothes despite having designer labels which state they are made in european countries, originate from the far east from animals which are cruelty treated and suffer horrific painfull deaths, ie being skinned alive. many of the animals are stolen pets and wild animals which have been cought and bred in very seriously poor conditions. my suggestion i am forwarding to downing street is to close the doors to this brutal trade, also to make use of the overcrowded prisons and rising number of offenders in the uk, to generate a market of cheap to produce goods, with quality in mind, derived from low paid prison inmates, thus allowing offenders to give something back to society which will also build up their manual skills and mental stimulation which will assist in reducing the numbers of repeating offenders",
