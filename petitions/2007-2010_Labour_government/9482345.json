        "background": "Plans outlined by the Prime Minister in his \"draft Queen's Speech\" include charging immigrants for the added strain they put on public services. This \"migration impact fund\" - an effective poll tax on immigrants - is highly unfair. As it cannot apply to intra-EU immigrants (whose recent peak in numbers is a factor in current service level strains), it would unduly disadvantage migrants from poorer nations. It is also an effective poll tax on people who cannot vote - undoubtedly, a populist, but highly unfair measure, victimising the least empowered (and most recently joined) members of society. Furthermore, as immigrants, too, are expected to pay taxes, charging them extra for government services is effectively double-charging them.",
