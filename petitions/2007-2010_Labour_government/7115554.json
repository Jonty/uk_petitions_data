        "background": "i decided to create this petition to hopefully get my point across. i've never had a problem with fireworks up until i got my dog. My dog is terrified of them and every year you always hear at least one story of a firework injuring somebody's pet. my dog has twice ran off because of the fireworks and this usually takes place before november 5th. I think a limited sale on fireworks should be compulsary and not months before the 5th, i think it should be limited to the weekend before, i also feel more police should be on the streets enforcing the 11pm curfew. i think in order to purchase fireworks for New years they should go on sale around the end of december over that bank holiday period to reduce the amount being set off. Finally the legal age to purchase should be raised to 21 as i have previously seen Teenage boys throwing lit fireworks between one another and this could resort in a bad accident",
