            "background": "The Swanage Railway is signalled for goods traffic. To upgrade the track and signals for passenger traffic would normally be prohibitively expensive. The resignalling of the line from Poole to Wool in 2013, provides an opportunity to resignal Worgret Junction, where the Swanage Railway joins the main line,for \u00a33 million. This is a fraction of the cost of a stand alone project. The money has to be sourced but not paid by the end of April 2010 or we will miss this window of opportunity. The through excursions to London that have run over the past year will also be prohibited.",
