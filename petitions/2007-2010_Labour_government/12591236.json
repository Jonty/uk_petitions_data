            "background": "As we all know the MP`s from both parties are being paid a hugh amount in relation to the working man, they all claim a HUGH amount of benefits from bath plugs to cleaning of swimming pools and not forgetting adult films, we understand the rules are their and many MP`s claim becuase they can but their should be improved guidelines set by external body and even reviewed by members of the public. With regard to past payments this should be looked into and if the MP has clearly claimed for item and services which are not  regarded in relation to the work they carry out the funds must be claimed back / refunded with interest. Also as far as MP`s claiming for a 2nd home this should only happen if the MP is not within a set distance ie 150 miles from their office and should travel by using the railway network which should be charged direct and not to the MP.\n\nFurthermore all MP`s claims should be made public as we the public voted for them and our votes keep them in a job, also MP`s must not offer their services to outside companys and get paid extra, but if they work for another body / company their MPs wage should be adjusted \n\n\nPlease vote keep get the wages & benefits reviewed NOW not in the next year or two .",
