            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Many people have been obliged to go to secured lenders when they were unable to get loans from mainstream lenders.  As a result of their lower creditworthiness they were already paying a premium rate of interest and despite the recent reduction in interest rates the people who would benefit most in poorer circumstances have not got any benefit. It is these people who are now losing their homes while the secured lenders have been raking in extra interest as a result.  I know that one lender Central Trust has actually increased its rate three times in the last two years.  This area connected to housing loans has obviously been overlooked yet it is the main reason that many families are losing their home.  This has been confirmed by talking to many institutions who help those in financial difficulties and with respect needs addressing by the Government without delay before many more lose thiei homes as a result of this profiteering at the expense of those who can least afford it..",
