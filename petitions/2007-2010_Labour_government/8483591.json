            "background": "With rising ticket price forcing out many fans it is becoming more and more difficult for the average man on the street to watch football. Adding the extra match abroad would at best rob those who have been faithful to their team for so many years of their money as they go abroad out of loyalty and at worst be the first step to the clubs upping sticks and leaving to places where people are more able to buy merchandise and line the pockets of directors. Football should belong to the fans.",
