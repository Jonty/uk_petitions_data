            "background": "The Government has struck another blow to British worker as the government voted down a series of amendments to the Employment Bill that would have given limited rights to workers in industrial disputes. \n\nOne amendment would ban employers from hiring agency workers to do the jobs of striking staff, and force them to inform employment agencies that there was a dispute to avoid an excuse of ignorance. \n\nAnother would have forced employers to provide contact details for workers to a union seeking an industrial action ballot, reducing the administrative burden on unions. \n\nThese basic polices are backed by all the unions and the TUC.",
