        "background": "If a person is unable to drive for several weeks or months due to medical advice after injury and/or surgery, they are still have to pay for their car insurance for this period of time.\nInsurance companies should refund the whole cost (or partial cost if car has more than 1 named driver) by sending a copy of medical certificates for the period of time the medical staff advise the driver.\n\nAs many people don't get paid the same when they are off sick from work, this will ease the burden on them.",
