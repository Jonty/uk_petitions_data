            "background": "Dear Mr. Brown, It is a well known fact that London is an established base for the LTTE Terrorists fighting a brutal war in Sri Lanka. Their fundraising apparatus in UK is essential to continue gross violations of human rights including mass murder of civilians by suicide bombings, ethnic cleansing, using child soldiers, assassination of political leaders, extortion, credit card fraud, money laundering, identification fraud, arms trafficking, counterfeit trade & systematic murder of moderate Tamils. The British Tamil Forum is just a front for LTTE Terrorists & shares the same objectives of Tamil Tigers. Their fundraising & propaganda activities in the UK are considered essential to LTTE. Therefore you cannot let them continue their activities in the UK. If our civilized society is to survive this assault by LTTE, we need our elected officials to investigate, prosecute & eliminate terror elements in UK. Therefore we ask you to enforce all anti-terror laws of UK to stop these terrorists.",
