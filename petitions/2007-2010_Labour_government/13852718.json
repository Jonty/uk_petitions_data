            "background": "Both Alan Johnson and his predecessor, Jacqui Smith, have proved themselves to be incapable of accepting objective scientific evidence on the classification of drugs.\nThis is unacceptable, since the public are entitled to expect accurate information of the relative dangers of controlled drugs, and for this information to be duly reflected in the law of the land.\nWe therefore call upon the Prime Minister to dismiss Alan Johnson from his present position as Home Secretary. We also insist that in future the classification of controlled drugs be determined by a politically independent body in the same way that the National Institute of Clinical Excellence assesses the safety of prescription drugs.",
