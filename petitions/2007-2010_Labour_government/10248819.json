            "background": "Rushcliffe Borough Council have planned a trial Micro Re-Cycling site for the use of local Residents of these two roads mentioned above. The majority of whom do not want the site in this location. There are many other possible sites in the town. The Council did not consult residents at all until they complained when the foundations were suddenly being installed. All local residents have been left out of the loop totally. The council only replied to our e-mails by sending a standard letter and fobbing us off. Planning permission is not needed because it is on Highways agency land. The local council kept it very quiet because they knew there would be a lot of issues raised concerning the construction of these sites. We need your support to stop this from being built. Other residents in Bingham have had the same problem and they have put construction on hold due to a petition and the support of Local residents and media. Please support our cause.",
