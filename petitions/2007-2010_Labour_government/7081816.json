            "background": "One square kilometre of Amazon rainforest can contain about 90,790 tonnes of living plants.1 in 5 of all the birds in the world live in the rainforest.Some experts estimate that one square kilometre may contain over 75,000 types of trees and 150,000 species of higher plants.In1996, the Amazon was reported to have shown a 34% increase in deforestation since 1992.The original Amazon rainforest was about 4,100,000 km\u00b2 now its 3,403,000 km\u00b2 .At the current rate, in two decades the Amazon Rainforest will be reduced by 40%.Amazonian evergreen forests account for about 10% of the world's terrestrial primary productivity and 10% of the carbon stores in ecosystems \n.Brazil produces about 300 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide a year; 200 million of these come from logging and burning in the Amazon.\nThe Amazon works like a great air conditioner, it cools down the temperature in the entire world by 1 or 2oC and helps to balance the humidity and rain in several parts of the globe. About 860 acres, the size of Central Park in New York, is destroyed every 15 minutes in the tropics.",
