            "background": "I have created this petition to ban the euthanasia on dogs that have attacked people because I believe that dogs do not get a fair chance in any animal attack on a human. I think that euthanizing a dog for biting a human is unfair as in our society we see murderers or cerial killers get put into prison for a horrific crime, whereas if a dog attacks someone and causes a puncture wound from a bite or scratch, they are immediately euthanized without at least a investigation as to why. The dog's owner should be investigated and the dog should at least be allowed a second chance.",
