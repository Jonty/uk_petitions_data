They gave us reasons for the delay(weather, historical dig etc.), even though we have copies of the further planning they applied for which was only granted in February 2009.\nThey gave us a date to complete on the 30th April. But when we sent our surveyor in the apartment block was still a building site. The reports states it is not liveable.\nMy concern now is that we are most likely going to be taken to court for damages. \nThe initial price is \u00a3185000, our deposit was \u00a318500, the current value of the apartment is \u00a3125000.\nThese figures apply to 110 other members of the public.\nMy issue is with the banks in difficulty etc and mortgages difficult to obtain there is no way I\u2019m going to be able to find \u00a360k to add to the deposit.",
