        "background": "Healthy eating is very important, especially now we are in a generation of eating disorders. Fruit and veg should be made cheaper and junk food made more expensive. Chocolate, sweets, crisps and fast food used to be a novelty or luxury, maybe enjoyed once a week but now it seems to be a daily requirement. Possibly due to it being quick, easy and cheap.\n\nI think if ready prepared fruit and veg was offered in the same way as sweets and chocolate at a lower price more people would choose it.",
