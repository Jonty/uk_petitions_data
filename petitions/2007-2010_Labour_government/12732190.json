            "background": "Plans to privatise the training of Britain's armed forces, via the Private Finance Initiative, will reduce training time by 25%, increase the overall cost of training and lead to the loss of esprit de corps and skills by the armed forces. There is no logical reason for pursuing this policy other than to comply with arbitrary public sector spending rules.",
