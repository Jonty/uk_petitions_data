They work day and night, year round under immense pressures to ensure our Nations Defence, this covers all operational and support roles from Afghanistan to the Falkland Islands. Thank You.",

            "background": "Our Forces are deployed all over the world with a primary aim of ensuring our national security, be it Afghanistan, Iraq, N Ireland, Falklands, Cyprus, Belize, Balkans, Germany, Patrolling Hostile seas or Flying sorties, this is by no means an exhaustive list.  All Forces undergo arduous training, they accept any risks and rigours presented in whatever circumstances.  Parted from family for months but get on with it.  The ranks reflect us, Sons, Daughters, Mums, Dads and we CARE.\nPoliticians remember this during every decision you make; equipment procurement, families, healthcare, veterans issues etc.  The cruel deaths of the Sappers, butchered in a place supposedly at peace, highlights the dangers inherent in any form of military service from training to the frontline. It is not the Senior Bankers, Chief Civil Bureaucrats, Dubious third world dictators, Political donors that should be showered with imperial honours, medal s and awards, it is every single one of our HM Forces that deserve the plaudits and the official honours in Recognition for their service and sacrifice for OUR National Security, as a thank you \u2013 NDM",
