How many times have you driven along Billericay High Street (outside Summerfield is a hotspot!) only to be faced with the challenge of people looking at you with beaming eyes trying to walk in front of you.\nThis crime is committed mainly by people with young children \"looking at you begging you to stop or you will mow them down\" or old people who think that as they are old you should respect them and stop!! I say no !! cross on the crossing that is what it is for, dont take risks for the sake of a few paces. \nYou tell your children off few not looking before they cross , but you dont think twice about chancing the risk of running in front of cars in the high street!",
