It wasn't; but he was so terrified that it might be that he did not go to see his doctor.\n\nObviously I can't say exactly what aspect of its being cancer (if it had been) he was so anxious about but it might have been the possibility that he would have to undergo chemotherapy.  Even if that was not his specific cause for concern many other people may also follow his example of not going to their doctor, in case their condition is cancer, due to fears about chemotherapy (I would definitely feel like that!); and some may even commit suicide as he did.",
