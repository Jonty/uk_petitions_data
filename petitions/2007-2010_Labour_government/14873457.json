Give to me a resettlement grant to leave this country to set up home elsewhere outside of the British Isles.  As this Elected Goverment pays non-british persons who have not contributed to our society in any way, giving out benefits and other handout's to persons only wanting to benefit from this institution.  Also this goverment are going to pay insurgents in Afganistan not to shoot?  The monies it pays to foreign persons to leave the British shores as a thank you resettlement grant is way beyound the pale.  Therefore the Britsh Goverment owe it to me; MICHAL O'NEIL. The choice to become non-british and therefore have to pay me a resettlement grant to reside in another country of my choosing.",
