If this is not possible because there are no parties acceptable to the voter then a means of expressing dissatisfaction with the available parties is essential to stimulate modern politicians to do better to represent the opinions of the public. This will also allow differentiation of the apathetic voter from the active (non-apathetic) abstainer.",
