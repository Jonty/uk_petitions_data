            "background": "National Express East Coast (NXEC) has to use \u2018Intercity 125\u2019 diesel train sets on many services that don't leave the electrified East Coast Main Line \u2013 trains that terminate at Leeds, Newcastle or Edinburgh.\n\nIts 29 electric sets (Intercity 225s) are not enough. This is a waste of electrified lines.\n\nAnd the diesel/electric hybrid Intercity Express Programme/HST2 to replace NXEC\u2019s fleet should be cancelled. Increasing oil prices and the extra weights of the diesel engine and batteries make the concept uneconomic.\n\nElectrifying Edinburgh-Aberdeen and Leeds-York routes would almost eliminate NXEC\u2019s diesel workings.\n\nInstead of HST2, electric 140mph Class 395s could be ordered. 26x 6-car sets are being built for South Eastern Trains, to run in 2009.\n\nEach vehicle costs \u00a31.6 million.\n\nAdding up to 12x 10-car sets (costing \u00a3192 million) to the existing order would replace the diesels, and retain the existing production line, making it cheaper. The need to design a completely new train will vanish.",
