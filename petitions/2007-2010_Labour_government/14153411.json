            "background": "If the Government think it is sensible or vote winning to limit bankers bonuses in Government controlled banks you are mad. We have lost so much money we need to recoup it and bankers are leaving RBS by the 100's, senior bankers at that. People know that if you buy an asset you need to spend money to maintain it. As the people are RBS are its only asset you need to invest in those people. Most of these people, indeed 99% of them are not responsible for the reason they neded cash support in the first place from the Government, so don't blame them. I know for a fact that profit earners are leaving RBS. I don't work for RBS or Lloyds. The Government will quite rightly be pulled apart if they lose more money by not backing an investment after committing so much already. In for a penny, in for a pound. Pay them or lose them, loose the profit earners, lose the billions we have put in already. I am not a banker, I am working class, despite my surname. No one wants to see the Government lose its huge initial investment.",
