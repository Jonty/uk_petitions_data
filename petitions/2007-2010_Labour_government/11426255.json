        "background": "Women entering the menopause face discrimination from the medical sector and society. Women are denied treatment for Hypogonadism using the spurious argument that the climacteric is a natural part of female life rather then a reproductive engineering fault.\nMenopausal women are often marginalised by society and the employment sector.Unpleasant symptoms including urinary incontinence, low libido, oesteoporosis, insomnia,depression, mood swings, vaginal atrophy, hot flushes and hormonal headaches are left untreated or at best offered short term solutions from the NHS.\nHRT is freely available to trans gender people but menopausal women are often denied treatment depending on the policy of their local Primary Care Trust.The general policy is to  offer only short term treatment citing the WHI study and Million Women Study as  reasons for the early discontinuation of treament for Ovarian failure.These studies are flawed and poorly interpreted.\nThere is little research into the menopause and we call on the Government to promote greater awareness of this taboo subject and end the medical and social discrimination suffered by menopausal women.",
