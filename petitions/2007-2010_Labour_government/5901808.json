            "background": "The buy to let industry (which I happen to work in), is the main cause of potential 1st time buyers not being able to purchase a property for themselves.\n\nThis is brought about by developers inflating their prices because they know investors will buy their properties to rent them out.  This causes potential buyers to rent which only makes this problem self perpetuating.\n\nAs a potetial 1st time buyer, I find it infuriating that the money I am forced to pay (in rent), is more than my mortgage would be on the same property, thus feeding the cycle.  \n\nHow is this possible when Council tennants will be given a property rent free and then have the \"right\" to buy this at a later stage, for a fraction of the cost.\n\nI, and a lot of other 1st time buyers are facing this situation until either we win the lottery or an inheritance intervenes.\n\nThis cycle can and should be stopped for these \"affordable\" developments that the Prime Minister is planning.",
