There seems to be variations of the correct interpretation to this act - with some stores making their own Policy to fob off customers with genuine grievances.\n\nReports of large Supermarkets, buying up possible store building sites, before obtaining plannning, to prevent other rivals moving into an area are growing.  This should be classed as unfair trading practice, and stopped..Please sign -",
