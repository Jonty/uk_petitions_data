        "background": "The Government needs to place on the statute books a legal divide between Religion and Politics. \n\nBoth have their place in society. However, there now needs to be a legal divide between the two preventing one from seeking to influence the other. \nWhilst religion has played a considerable part in shaping the world\u2019s political systems there needs to be a divergence of the two based on the ever increasing amount of crime, conflict and abuse of humanity that is undertaken by religion in seeking to effect political control and by politicians in the name of religion. \n\nReligion should not form any part of the political and legal regime of this country and religious organisations indulging in politics should lose their status as a religion. Equally politicians should not be able to hold office if they base their work on religious doctrine.\n\nBesides forming a part of UK law, this also needs to become adopted within the EU.",
