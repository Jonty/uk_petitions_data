Line the pockets of suppliers and managers of the NHS with our contributions.\n3. Ensure that the NI contributors are, as in the case of all government ministers, seen first.\n\nI find it abhorrent that the government can steal mine and others hard earned money, to provide a NHS service for NON British people.",
