            "background": "Since the governemtns take over of Northern Rock, the variable rates being charged by the bank on there own admition areexcessive. As understood the company owns one fifth of mortgages within the UK. In order to stem the rise of inflation this petition is being sent to the government to call on them to allow the Northern Rock business model offer competitive rates to its customer base. Through the governments actions seperate from the credit crunch they are making many peoples lives extremely hard, a little clear thinking would ease the strain on the nation and put the whole failing labour government in a slightly better light",
