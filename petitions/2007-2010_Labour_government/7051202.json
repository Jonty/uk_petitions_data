        "background": "Why isn't maternity pay determined by how much the mother is earning before she leaves work? \n\nIt is a fact that women are paid less than men today, why? If women are paid less by employers then this surely should cover the mothers time off work. \n\nA person who has to pay a mortgage of \u00a3700 a month and bring up a child has a complete lifestyle change if they go from bringing home \u00a31000 a month to statutory maternity pay (\u00a3112 a week)\n\nIf I was a mother, I would have to sell my house and live in a council house, but we all know that this would be impossible to achieve. \n\nThe time is now for a maternity pay review. \n\nPlease sign this petition if you agree.",
