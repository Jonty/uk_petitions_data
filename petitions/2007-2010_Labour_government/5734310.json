        "background": "Sony has recently announced a $100 price drop to the US playstation 3 so that it costs $499 US dollars. However it rejected to reduced the price of the european PS3. In Britain we pay $860 US dollars for a less superior playstation 3 with less features, 70% more than in the US which is a disgrace. This is just one example of how we are being ripped off in Britain and we shouldn't allow this to continue. This petition isn't only just for gamers who beleive that it is only fair to pay the same price as the US for a PS3 , but for everyone who is tired of the exploitation of British consumers.",
