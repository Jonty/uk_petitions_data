        "background": "I want to ban 'fluffy' or 'wool' typed bedding from pet shops and other stores that may sell it. \nThis is dangerous stuff. Even if it says 'safe' on the packaging. It convinces people to buy it and think they are doing the best for their small pets. \nBut it is causing hamsters to die, be seriously ill, and cause blockages if they eat it.\nWe need it banned that way, If its not in the shop it would mean it's unsuitable and dangerous for pets. But whilst it is still in stores it is advertising to pet owners it is ok and safe to use.",
