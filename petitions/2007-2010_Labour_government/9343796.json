            "background": "Think about this - it makes sense.\nYouths aged 16+ cannot socialise in pubs. They hang out on the streets (and drink on park benches) and cause trouble because they have nowhere else to go. Allow them into a controlled environment. The older members of society will undoubtebly keep them under control leading to better behaviour. People in this age group will also become more respectful for their elders and society will benefit.\nIf this became commonplace we would have less trouble on estates/in the streets and i believe allowing them to drink in a controlled environment will reduce the desire to binge-drink within those individuals (think about the cost too!). \nThis is a controversial idea but i strongly believe it will work in the long term.",
