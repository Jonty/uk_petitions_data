            "background": "North Lincolnshire Council has reviewed its transport policies and decided to remove free transport for my daughter and other children living in Scawby and surrounding villages.It is not all of the buses so all children are not being treated equally which goes against the council's policy.Secondly in their letters to parents they state that the Scawby to Brigg route is considered safe; it is not - there is not a safe path all of the way from Scawby to Brigg nor are there safe crossing points in several places, no crossing patrol is planned either.On dark mornings and evenings children as young as 11 years old are going to be very vulnerable; it is not that our children will not walk or bike but rather that it is just not safe.The council will provide a paid bus instead at a cost of 90p per day, expected termly in advance - parents cannot afford this with other extra costs at the present time especially when there is one or more children in the family.Pensioners get free bus passes and school children always have - it should be considered part of their education so please do not deny them that right.If this happens a child will get injured,abducted or worse and that is so very wrong.",
