            "background": "If people in this country are petitioning, then the government should fairly respond to us, rather than disregarding petitions and giving us poor excuses, some of which are not even topic related. Those of us who sign petitions are not only trying to make our voice heard, we are also the people who actually try and do something to change this country, in comparison to those who choose not to bother with petitions, etc. Therefore, I think it is unfair that our voice is disregarded due to a lack of numbers on a petition, in comparison to the size of the country as a whole.\n\nExample Of a disregarded petition:\n\u201cWe the undersigned petition the Prime \nMinister to resign.\u201d\n\nDetails of Example Petition:\n\n\u201cThere are many reasons why we might want Brown to resign, but rather than having lots of narrow petitions on this topic (most of which have been rejected), I wanted one for all of us.\u201d\n\nGovernment\u2019s response:\nThe Prime Minister is completely focused on restoring the economy, getting people back to work and improving standards in public services. As the Prime Minister has consistently said, he is determined to build a stronger, fairer, better Britain for all.",
