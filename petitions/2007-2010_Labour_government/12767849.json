The BNP are without a doubt a Neo Nazi organisation, with exceptionally racist ideals, and plans for Great Britain. Freedom of speech, expression and movement are a fundemental right here in the UK, which allows this vile party to exist. But if they ever gained power they would destroy all these values, along with this wonderful country. We cannot allow such a party or parties/groups like them to exist here, simply because we know what a fascist government is capable of. They have no right to belong to a decent society, and reflect the extremist ideals of Islamic groups banned here in the UK. So should the BNP be banned like them too",
