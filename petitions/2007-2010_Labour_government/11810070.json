            "background": "After reading about these children who have died horrible deaths or been subject to ongoing abuse by parents who are on drugs, even throughout their pregnancies, I would like to petition for the government to step in & protect future kids, buy having these monsters sterilised , so that no more children will be brought into a world where drugs put them at risk. If a child is born with an addiction to drugs, is that not child abuse? Help these babies/children.\n\nChildren already in their care should be taken off them. For the government to neglect these children by leaving them in the drug addicts care, then the government is just as guilty for any abuse these children endure.",
