            "background": "We propose that Rural Areas are allowed to sell their fuel subject to the reduced VAT rate of 5% instead of 17.5%, this would reduce the average price of petrol in these areas by around 12p bringing it back into line with the UK average price.\n\nAt the moment due to VAT being added to fuel these areas are actually paying the highest amount of tax per litre for their fuel, and those in the rural communities tend to lead a more sustainable life anyway, so why not reduce the taxation on fuel which is always described as a green tax by Parliament? This would be fairer for all, surely those who choose to lead a greener more sustainable way of life should be the ones who pay less green tax?",
