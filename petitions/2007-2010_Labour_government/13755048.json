            "background": "The assumption being that a financial wrapper could be created and offered by Pension fund providers, instead of investing in funds personal debt could be cleared (to whatever the pension funds was) and a repayment schedule to reimburse the pension could then be created. This would allow the pension to recoup the value used to clear personal debt but the repayments could be made at a lower interest rate. This would help many familes and people who may hold a personal pension clear existing debt. This would help those in work and those made redundant. At a time when personal debt is high this would help the country and allow trade to flourish further.",
