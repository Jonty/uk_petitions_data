            "background": "I have recently read more and more about the current defamation laws in England and I am becoming increasingly worried by them.  I believe the law was first introduced as an alternative to dueling; by launching civil actions for libel.  To the best of my knowledge, these laws have been used to protect the wealthy from critisism without proof to the contrary.  This area of the law clearly needs addressing, as Sheffield Wednesday recently used these laws to persue fans for voicing their opionions on an internet forum.  These laws clearly need to be brought upto date to prevent these ridiculus cases ever happening.",
