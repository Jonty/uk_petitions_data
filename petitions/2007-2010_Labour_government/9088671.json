            "background": "As a person is convicted and given a custodial sentence, their rights to be a citizen should be forfeited or suspended until their release. A prison sentence SHOULD be a punishment, but this is not currently the case! It would appear that prisoners - in most cases - are treated better than their victims, and this is inherently wrong. An austere sentence would be a stronger deterrent. It's time this country overhauled the justice system, and made the law abiding citizen its main concern. Please sign if you agree. There are other petitions similar to this one, but I don't feel that they go far enough.",
