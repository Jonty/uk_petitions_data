        "background": "Capitalist finance is built on the point of efficient markets. That requires equal access to trading information and response times for all.\nYou shouldn't in principle lay off your trading to your dealing experts to get themselves bonuses to do the best for yourself. That is entirely against the justification of capitalism for market efficiency.\nAs much as a universal post office - say we require a universal trading application for anything you can legally trade, within parameters. It needs to be available to everyone on say their mobile phone to be ok.",
