            "background": "Presently the UK has a horrendous record for its Health services.  Doctors overworked, Nurses understaffed and people working so hard and long hours they are bound to make mistakes which is human.  It is high time the money that has been put into the management of the NHS is put more into the Doctors and Nurses.  There should be a fully independent study/Audit performed, not led by the Government to get rid of middle management who are taking up the money and put it where we need it most, in the highly trained professionals that we trust our lives to.  Thankyou to the Doctors and Nurses at the moment who are working hard, lets show our support, lets get the independent study performed and see where we can move the money from (bottlenecks) to where its needed most: more equipment, more trained staff, more hospitals, more helicopters for emergencies.",
