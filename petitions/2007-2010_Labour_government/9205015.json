The main cause of the doubling in child poverty is highlighted as the falure of the benefits system to keep in line with earnings ...\n\ncan Darling be a darlin' on this ?\n\nToo true, all my incapacity benefit goes to pay off bank payments and student loan, because the benefit system is so slow and cumbersome charges have accrued by the time cash goes into my account. The management of the benefits system would do well to liaise with banks, better on timing. Even whilst I was working in the public sector, no - one signed my timesheets - if you do not PAY your staff, how does the British govt expect it's policies to work ?",
