            "background": "This would (fairly obviously) remove the need for these women (of whom I am one) to have regular cervical smears, followed, where necessary, by colposcopies (a more thorough version of a smear) and possibly cone biopsy (removal of pre-cancerous cells); all procedures which are rather unpleasant and which must involve the N.H.S. in some cost (cone biopsies take place as an inpatient under general anaesthetic).  As I understand it the only function of a cervix is during child-birth; therefore it is not needed for post-menopausal women.",
