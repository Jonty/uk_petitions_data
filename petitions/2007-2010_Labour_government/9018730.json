        "background": "I work in retail and I have noticed a sudden increase, year on year in the number of kids shopping with their parents during school hours. With shopping centres opening to 8pm on some nights (some are open til 8pm 6 days a week), there is NO excuse in kids missing out on education. Also some kids that have a dentist or GP appointment say at 9:20am, some parents don't bother to take their kids to school afterwards, even though they will just miss one lesson. If the child is actually ill, then parents should not take them out shopping and spreading germs all over the place.",
