            "background": "The Border and Immigration Agency often takes several years to decide on people's application for leave to remain in the UK.\n\nThere have been reports about people who have been waiting to hear from the Border and Immigration Agency regarding the application they made 5 years ago.\n\nThis causes many years of anxiety, illegal working and is a strain on the UK's resources. \n\nIt is not fair to expect immigrants to wait for that long. It is certainly not fair on the british public to live with people who have to survive but are unsure of what the future holds for them in the UK.\n\nIt really should not take years to say \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\nThe petition is to make it conpulsory for the BOA be set an absolute maximum of 3 months for a decision on applications regardless of the complexity.",
