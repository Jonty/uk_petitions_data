            "background": "At present the safety and welfare of the women and children of Haiti is compromised by the lack of quality policing due to the lack of co-ordination by the Haiti Government and local government. The UN has a duty under the human rights act and the Rights of the Child to impose on Haiti a sufficient force to protect and care for the Women and Children of Haiti. As a major presence on the World stage Gordon Brown should force the UN to address the situation and produce a speedy reaction. Their impartiality will allow the Haiti Government to accept this course of action without feeling they are loosing control of their country but safeguard the future of their Women and Children for now and their future. For the safety and welfare of these Women and Children this action must be taken now.",
