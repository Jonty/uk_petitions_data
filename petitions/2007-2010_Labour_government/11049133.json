            "background": "This is to request the PM to reduce the Tax/Duty levied on Diesel Fuels, to be made the same as that levied on Unleaded Petrol.\nCurrently we are seeing the Unleaded Petrol pump price going down, however Diesel, which is cheaper to produce, not going down at the same rate. Charging the same amount of duty on would go to rectifying the imbalance.\nThis would also have a knock-on effect to the Hauliers and Good Delivery firms, of bringing down the cost of doing business.",
