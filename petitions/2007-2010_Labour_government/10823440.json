Two single people can therefore have a total of \u00a33000. Yet a couple can only have a total of \u00a31500 in social fund borrowing. This is grossly unfair.\n\nWe petition the prime minister to reform social fund rules and bring borrowing limits for a couple to a more reasonable level comparable to that for two single people",
