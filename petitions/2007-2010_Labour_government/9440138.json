        "background": "It is an unbelievable fact, living in the UK in the 21st century, that free dental treatment cannot be obtained for children of school age. The potential for a future adult generation with rotten teeth is huge.\nWhy should anyone on a low income, (and there are indeed many in this situation), have to face the extortionate cost of private dental treatment for their children, simply because there are not enough NHS places available for their children? Can we please have a government who are able to sort this out without the imposition of ludicrous ideas, ethics and practices?",
