        "background": "Fatism is a term that describes hostile or oppressive behaviour towards people because they suffer from obesity. It is prevalent on British television, particularly in comedy viewing where it is deemed acceptable by Ofcom, the television regulatory board, to make jokes about a person\u2019s weight.\n\nApproximately two-thirds of the population is currently overweight or obese, and on present trends, obesity will soon surpass smoking as the greatest cause of premature loss of life. As a nation we don\u2019t feel it\u2019s acceptable to laugh at the suffering or side effects of cancer, and it shouldn\u2019t be any different regarding the suffering or side effects of obesity, or any other weight-related illness. \n\nIn recent decades, racism was also prevalent on British television, but public opinion forced a change. It is time for another change on television \u2013 this time regarding the treatment of people with weight-related illness. Accepting degrading behaviour towards these people promotes bullying and contributes to weight-related illnesses in society today.\n\nPlease sign this petition to make a change.",
