        "action": "introduce a scheme of third party insurance for all road vehicles collected by goverment along with the vehicle excise duty.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This simple task would overnight reduce uninsured driving in the uk to zero and would mean that in any accident the third party would have the security of knowing that the other vehicle was insured , who ever was driving , even if it was a stolen vehicle.At the moment third parties of uninsured accidents have to claim through the motor insurers bureau scheme , a lenghty process that only really covers personal injury.where as third party universal insurance would assure claims for property and personal loss.this measure would in real terms cost nothing as a flat rate would be paid by all vehicle drivers and insurance companies would still sell enhanced vehicle insurance policies for theft and comprehansive risks.\nTo see how this works just look at australia where any vehicle taxed for road use is also third party insured .",
