            "background": "As it stands the current laws on Harrassment of another are so wide ranging and unstructured that even if you report a person for benefit fraud or for abuse of a child or even breach of tennancy you can in fact be charged with Harrassment of that individual even if the individual is found to be in the wrong.  \n\nAs it stands now you can be accussed of harrassment for literally anything (even for doing in what most peoples opinion is the right thing to do) and i feel that there needs to be concrete guidelines as to what does and does not constitue harrassment of another and i feel that anyone who reports things such as child abuse, breach of tennancy etc should not then be persecuted for doing so.\n\nI feel the law as it stands in fact breaches human rights of an individual who wishes to report wrongdoing or fraud or abuse.",
