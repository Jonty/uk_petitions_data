I do not feel that this is enough for the job that they do and i'm sure that I am not the only one.\nWe see footballers prancing around on a football field earning millions for kicking a football so why can't someone who is risking their life to save and preserve this country earn more money...I know that paying each soldier millions is not going to happen but they should be paid more than what they are currently earning! They are our heroes and they deserve the best!!",
