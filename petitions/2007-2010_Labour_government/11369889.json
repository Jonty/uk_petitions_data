            "background": "Top Golf Limited have submitted a planning application to Hillingdon council to replace parts of Ruislip Golf Course(10th,15th,16th and 17th holes)with a vast two storey building and range housing a gaming facility. \nRuislip Golf Club has been on this site since 1936 and is home to a number of local golfers including  thriving Junior, Ladies, Seniors and Mens Sections. The golf course is identified as part of the areas heritage, offering area of natural beauty where in addition to playing golf, local residents often enjoy walks in the open spaces. \nThis planning application will impact on the area by introducing an unsightly mass of construction, high powered lighting, increased traffic flow. \nWith no assurances from the local authority about replacing the land taken by this monstrosity, we are threatened with major changes to Ruislip Golf course and the potential implications of to our community. \nIn Conclusion the proposals submitted by Top Golf Limited offer no advantage over the existing facilities and can only be viewed as detrimental to both the surrounding area and the Golf Club itself. Please help us protect our Golf course by joining our petition.",
