            "background": "It was brought to my attention in October of 2009 that there is very little help for families taking on the resposibility of orphans left when thier parents die. These children lost both parents who had worked and paid into our state pension. The policy at this present time is that the Mother only gets a pension payout for children if thier husbands die. We all know in this country today it is normal for both parents to be working to contribute towards the upkeep of the home and family.\n\nI petition that both Mother and father are entitled to this pension payout and that whoever takes on the orphans of families where both parents have died should get a weekly pension until the child reaches the age of 21.",
