It's about time your government listened to your fellow country men and stop running this country into the ground. There are massive issues we want sorting like, immigration, tougher punishments for real criminals, and your lack of understanding that to spend out of rescession, your government are causing massive debt for british citizens. Stop offering our small country to the world, make us feel safe, and concentrate on repairing the damage your government have already done. We don't mind paying our already extortionate taxes, so long as 'we' benefit before others.",
