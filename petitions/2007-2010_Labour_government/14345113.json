            "background": "Let's make it equally as hard for EU members to enter the UK! Currently, none EU members have to pay a lot of money for visas, which is not the case for people within the EU! This to me seems slightly racist! \n\nSomeone said to me that this is to keep us safe, however, does this not mean we are judging people on where they come from!\n\nThere will always be radical people who invade our safety, but that does not mean they are going to come from outside of the EU! People from Afganistan are just as likely to rebel against us as people of the Polish population are (for example). All of these people seek to come here for the exact same reason. A dream of a better life, free from poverty, free from suffering and pain! In Afganistan today, there is a law that states that a husband may starve his wife if she refuses sex - in other words, rape.\n\nWhat can we do? Either drop the whole visa act and allow everyone to come and go as they please, or visa and check people from every nationality before entering our country! lets stop this racism now!",
