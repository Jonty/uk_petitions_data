            "background": "I am sad to hear in the news that everyday another OAP has been beaten for medals, or a pretty town has been tagged by a group.  \n\nWhen the criminals are ever caught they are unlikely to be really punished.\n\nWhat is 12 months of cleaning the streets to a drug addict who beat a 89 year old woman for a hit?\n\nThey are still addicts, still have freedom and to be honest it doesn't really teach them nothing. Just makes them look uncool and gets in the way of doing the stuff they want to do...\n\nMake them do a term of 2 years serving this country.  Control what they eat, when they eat, when they sleep and when they're allowed to move. Teach them a trade so when they leave they are ready to work.  \nAllow them to show the world they can be productive memebers of this country.\nTeach them respect for this country, its people but, more importantly themselves.\n\n'Bad lad's army' proved it does and can work, lets make it real.\n\nLet's bring a end to this Nanny state.",
