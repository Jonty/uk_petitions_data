My doctor warned me that if i continued smoking I would have ended up having my vocal chords removed, most likely within a year. I stoped smoking succesfully but every time I see someone smoking on the television, it makes me want to smoke again. I am scared that I will loose my will power and eventually give in to this. For the health of myself and other people could you please try to put an end to showing smoking on the television.",
