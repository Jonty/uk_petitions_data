            "background": "Many people don't work but get their rents and council tax paid plus receive other benefits. I want all unemployed people to get income support plus a housing allowance of fifty pounds per week if they don't live in rented accomodation but have a mortgage. Rent money paid to the unemployed at the moment pays off the landlords mortgage and this should be capped at a fair level to encourage work. I live in a leasehold flat and get no help with service charges in times of unemployement - the housing allowance would help pay these charges and stop me from facing court action.",
