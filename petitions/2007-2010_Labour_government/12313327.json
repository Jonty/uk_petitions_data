        "background": "You have to phone up Careline, before you actually get a Social Worker, I believe it puts a lot of lives in danger, because you don't actually talk to anyone who can arrange respite, adaptions for the home, or in some cases child abuse. One Care Worker who calls to see to my mum, had phoned Careline, for her husband, and they actually told her to use a dining room chair, to use in the shower, by the time Social Services called, her husband was dead. I personally find them intrusive, and distressing when I am already distressed, they actually ask why you want a service, I tell them \"none of your business\", \"oh, but we can't refer you unless you have a reason\". No one I know who care for a loved one, wants to use this Careline because of this intrusion in you personal life.",
