            "background": "Last weekend,I was caught out by badly managed Rail Replacement service in lieu of First Capital Connect's planned weekend Engineering Works.I started from London Kings Cross at 0036 hours on a rail replacement service and was stranded at Welwyn Garden city at 2am,fighting to be put on a taxi because their connections missed the last service to Stevenage.I only reached Stevenage at 0330am,after having paid full fare.\n\nI ask why should anybody pay be forced to pay full fares if journey times are nearley doubled during Engineering Works and inconvenience incalculable? I think it is plane obvious that at the outset anyone travelling on the day of engineering works should have an option to buy a half or lower priced ticket and be restricted to travel during the hours of the engineering works! In no other industry would one get away with this kind of poor service and be able to charge full prices!!",
