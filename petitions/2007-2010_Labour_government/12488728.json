            "background": "The Equal Pay Act was passed nearly 40 years ago, yet women are still paid less than men. The full-time gender pay gap is 17%, while the part-time pay gap is a staggering 36%. Equal pay law is failing women.\n\nThe pay gap has persisted because employers are not required to check if they are paying female colleagues less than males or take any action if they uncover such a gap. Furthermore, it is extremely difficult for women to seek justice for unfair pay. Women working in roles where there is no male to compare themselves to, particularly in female dominated professions, are unable to make a claim, and women systematically discriminated against cannot come together to make a discrimination claim as a group. Therefore each individual faces a high emotional and financial burden, meaning many legitimate cases don\u2019t make it to court.\n\nIn order for the Equality Bill to end gender pay discrimination it must mandate all employers to conduct pay audits. To deliver justice to women it must also allow hypothetical comparators and representative actions.\n\nWomen were pledged equal pay nearly 40 years ago. TIME\u2019S UP: EQUAL PAY NOW",
