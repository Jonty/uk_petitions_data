With both C-130 Herculese Squadrons being moved to RAF Brize Norton - which is already at capacity.\n\nOver the years Royal Air Force Lyneham had updated several building including gyms and accommodation. The Government continues to talk about \"saving money\" - how can they say that when, after spending millions on Lyneham, they are going to close it down??\n\nThe closure of this Station will compromise national security, as almost all of the Logistic units of the Royal Air Force are stationed in one base - RAF Brize Norton.",
