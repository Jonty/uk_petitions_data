It may be within the rules but it is wrong - If Ministers cannot tell right from wrong they should not be empowered by the people.\n\nIt is time for the people of Britain to call to account the politicians and also give the Parties the opportunity to campaign on how they are going to tackle the crisis and change UK politics to a basis of what is right and a common sense approach.\n\nThis has to be preferable to the muddled, sound-bite approach which has achieved nothing, indeed probably done harm, over the last year.",
