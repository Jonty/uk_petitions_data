            "background": "Auditing is a procedure that was originated by author L. Ron Hubbard as the central practice of Dianetics and further refined by him as he developed Scientology.\nThe Anderson Report (Victoria, AU) says that Hypnosis is used within auditing, and it is done in an \"authoritative\" way. \n\"It is the firm conclusion of this Board that most scientology and dianetic techniques are those of authoritative hypnosis and as such are dangerous.\"\n\nThe E-meter is a useless machine that is apparently used \"for the express purpose of addressing spiritual issues\"\nThe E-meter became the subject of a major controversy with the US Food and Drug Administration in the early 1960s, when the FDA became concerned that the church was using the E-meter to practice medicine without a license.\nhe E-Meter is not medically or scientifically useful for the diagnosis, treatment or prevention of any disease. It is not medically or scientifically capable of improving the health or bodily functions of anyone.",
