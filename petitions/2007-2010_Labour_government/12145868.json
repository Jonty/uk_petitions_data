            "background": "Taxes from parents that educate their children privately pay for a state education that their children do not receive. These parents therefore support state schools financially through their taxes. Given the serious, economic downturn, it is in everyone's  interest to minimise the number of parents taking their children out of the private sector and burdening the state with the responsibility of educating them. Allowing employees and employers to entering into salary sacrifice schemes, as is common practice for childcare provision and pensions, would help alleviate the financial burden on parents and the state. An amendment to the childcare vouchers scheme to allow their use for education beyond the term the child turns five-years-old would allow a cost-effective amendment to the current rules.",
