            "background": "This Government has had failure after failure since Gordon Brown came to office. These failures include lying to the British people about a referendum, losing bank details of millions of citizens, refusing to uphold democracy by failing to hold an election the people deserved and giving taxpayers a second mortgage by failing to take appopriate and rapid action to solve the issue of Northern Rock - to name but a few. According to Ministerial Responsibility the Prime Minister should resign due to the numerous failures of his Government - giving the country the closure it deserves.",
