I feel that all applicants should have the option of being able to submit a CV and covering letter instead.  This way, applicants would be able to apply for more jobs more easily, and would have the motivation to apply.  The time saved would mean that other useful things can be done, as currently it seems that completing application forms is a full time job in itself.  What is more, during interviews the potential employers do not accept \"applying for jobs\" as a valid use of time when out of work!",
