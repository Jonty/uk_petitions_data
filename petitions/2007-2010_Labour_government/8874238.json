            "background": "British hauliers have for decades been compelled to record all routes taken by heavy goods vehicles in kilometres.\n\nThe drivers must read a speedometer with Kilometres per hour writ large, and therefore dominant, but with Miles per hour printed on a much smaller radius and therefore diminutive, making MPH much less easy to read.\n\nAs there are no plans to metricate our road system, and given that such would be universally unpopular, I think it is time to put the Mile back into our transport fleet.\n\nI have never yet heard a driver express speed or journey in terms of kilometres.\n\nFor more petitions enter my name in 'search petitions'",
