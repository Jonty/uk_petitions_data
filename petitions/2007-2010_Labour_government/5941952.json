            "background": "All power stations can be converted to Buxton Geothermal Turbine Generators by drilling a ten kilometre lined and capped bore hole filled with water. The cap is at three times boiling point, the temperature that electricity is generated. The amount of electricity generated depends simply upon how wide the bore hole is. When all vehicles are electrical the CO2 emission cut would rise from 30% to 50%.",
