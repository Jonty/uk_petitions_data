They depends upon the knowledge which is deposited with all librarians & library workers.\n\nGiven that library workers earn much less than what are average incomes, then the only way in which to help safeguard the future of libraries is to at least make sure that all local government librarians & library workers get a 'key worker' status.\n\nFailure to do so will result in a major decline in the Public Library service.",
