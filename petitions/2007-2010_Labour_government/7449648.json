        "action": "suspend all financial aid to Sudan following the unnacceptable treatment of British teacher, Gillian Gibbons",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "On Sunday 25th November 2007, British teacher Gillian Gibbons was arrested in Khartoum.  Her \"crime\" was that after an exercise whereby she allowed her class of six and seven year old children to vote on what to name a teddy bear, she allowed them to choose the name Muhammad.\n\nFollowing her arrest, she was subsequently charged with insulting religion, tried in a Sudanese court and sentenced to 15 days in jail.  Meanwhile, crowds of protesters marched through the streets of Khartoum demanding that the teacher be executed.\n\nIn the past 5 years, the UK has provided \u00a3326m in financial aid to Sudan and in 07/08, will provide an additional \u00a3114m in aid (Source: fco.gov.uk).\n\nWe believe that it is wholly unacceptable to continue to finance a government that allows this kind of behaviour towards British citizens for what is clearly a very innocent mistake.  As such, we are asking that the Prime Minister immediately suspend any further financial aid to the Sudanese government.",
