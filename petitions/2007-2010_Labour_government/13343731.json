Thor is a disabled soldier who set a precedent in 1989 by being first to lose a limb and remain in service after a fight to prove his worth.\n\nHe has been forgotten and support agencies are unwilling (or claim they are unable) to help.\n\nOn the 8th June 2009 he was served with a notice to quit 4TH SEPTEMBER 2009 his home as he can no longer work or afford the rent.\n\nLocal Government agencies such as housing and social services have proved to be uncaring and have shown little or no regard for the 'covenant' between this soldier and his country.\n\nThor is a disabled soldier and he and his family face homelessness and adversity every day for help with basic needs. Thor is even forced to sleep on the floor.\n\nThor sent to a letter to the Prime Minister, pleading for him to step in and sort things out. He was advised that his case was not a priority\n\nWhilst politicians from all sides of the political spectrum are talking loudly about support for the armed forces, there is no evidence of that support for Thor and his family.",
