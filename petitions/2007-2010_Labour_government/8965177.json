            "background": "Meads Lane Post Office is a vital resource for both the local and also the wider community.  It is located on the hail-and-ride 364 bus route, which makes it accessible to disabled and mobility impaired residents who are able to take a bus almost from door-to-door, and unlike the suggest alternative, is not within a controlled parking zone. Furthermore, this Post Office provides an invaluable and possibly unique service to the diverse population of the London Borough of Redbridge.  The Postmaster is fluent in Swahili, Gujarati and Hindi all of which are widely spoken within the local area, and is able to provide a translation service that assists vulnerable people to complete forms for local services that can be accessed via the Post Office.  The reputation of this service is such that people travel from across the Borough to use it.",
