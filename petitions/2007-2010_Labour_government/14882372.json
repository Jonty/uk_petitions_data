            "background": "Dear PM,\n\nThe preparation for next year's census is underway.\n\nIn the Census we Sikh want to be recognised as an individual race and not just a religion.\n\nThe case has already been won in High Court battle in the 1980s for we Sikhs to be officially recognised as a race under British law. Therefor I urge you to take our voice forward. We are a peace loving community and do not mean harm to anyone. All we therefore ask is for us to be categorised correctly to avoid confusions amongst other communities. \n\nI hope you would take our points in mind when deciding the petition results.\n\nSincerely,\n\nKhushwant Singh",
