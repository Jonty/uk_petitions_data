        "background": "We challenge the Home Office to increase its funding of TruckPol.\n\nTruckPol is a national intelligence unit, collating statistical data and intelligence on all UK road freight crime. \n\nRoad freight crime is an ongoing problem which is estimated to cost the UK economy up to \u00a3250 million per year. The theft of large goods vehicles and their loads causes significant economic and logistical harm to manufacturers, operators and retailers alike. \n\nThe Home Office is supposed to match funding from private industry stakeholders including fleet operators and insurance companies. But at present it only pays \u00a350,000 towards Truckpol's \u00a3130,000 annual budget, and there are rumours that it is planning to withdraw its funding altogether at the end of the current financial year.\n\nTrucks and haulage yards are increasingly being targeted by organised crime, and drivers are among the most exposed and vulnerable sections of the workforce.\n\nCrime prevention, and in particular the fight against organised crime, are Government functions, and we're challenging the Home Office to increase, not withdraw, its funding of TruckPol.",
