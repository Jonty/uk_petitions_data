Accusing the undefined \u2018enemy\u2019 of being behind World War I, WW II, the French and Communist Revolutions, forming secret societies, such as the Freemasons, Rotary Clubs and others, controlling world media, news agencies, the press, publishing houses, broadcasting stations, referring to the anti-Semitic \u2018Protocols of the Elders of Zion\u2019.\nWe want: No lawful contact until they change their stance!",
