            "background": "There are certain crimes committed which demand that the perpetrator or perpetrators should be executed after having been found guilty. Amongst these are murder, rape, child molestation,abuse of power whilst in public office and the cruelty to animals , both domesticated and wild.\nThe reason that most people don't commit crimes is that they are law-abiding citizens with a sense of both moral and civic duty. However, for others, there has to be a deterrent factor and that is, if the law is broken then retribution will follow. Laws, of course, can be enacted, ammended or dissolved as and when circumstances demand. What was not the law yesterday can be the law tomorrow and vice versa.",
