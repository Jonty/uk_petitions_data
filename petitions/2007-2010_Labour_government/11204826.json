            "background": "Beat the recession, give unemployed hours to local businesses that can see profit/growth opportunities but can not afford to hire right now.\n\nTrade off benefit claims for hours (\u00a3 / minimum wage = XX hours per week) and as industry starts growing, unemployed figures decline, country wealth increases.\n\nDo this well, and the company supported to make profits, can convert the UK\u2019s newly appointed \u2018Recession Busters\u2019 into full paying jobs.... a working route to employment perhaps, a working opportunity to get off benefits, a great way to keep active and mentally fit, but a huge chance for our unemployed to work the UK \u2018up and out\u2019 of recession. We have the skills \u2013 lets use them to benefit industry.\n\nVisit www.ARecessionBuster.blogspot.com for full info before voting.\n\nPlease vote your approval \u2013 government can provide tools, but it\u2019s we the people that must pick them and do something!\n\nLet\u2019s convert billions spent on benefits into billions of working hours!\n\nChris Rayner\nwww.eagletechnologies.co.uk",
