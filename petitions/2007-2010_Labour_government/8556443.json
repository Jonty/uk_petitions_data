            "background": "Britain has done ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WHATSOEVER on climate change and its emissions have, since 1997, grown FASTER than America's, yet the PM and Hilary Benn dare to lecture American officials about which strategy to choose. For your information: America's emissions have grown slower since 1997 than those of any Kyoto signatories, especially EU member states, which despite the Government's knowlingly false claims that the EU is good for the environment, has increased its emissions faster than anyone else. The current POTUS cares for the environment and the UK govt. owes him an apology, as well a more productive climate change policy than its current one.",
