            "background": "This petition makes the point that this would create more jobs; so does the creator mean ALL benefits or only those paid to the unemployed?  Even if that is what is meant it seems very draconian - how would people pay for food, rent/mortgage etc., with NO MONEY AT ALL? - and if it DOES mean ALL benefits this includes those for new mothers (Maternity Benefit), pensioners, and the disabled.  \n\nThis is a very nasty petition in my opinion. In any case Jobseekers Allowance, the State pension and Incapacity Benefit are all contributory benefits so it would a form of fraud not to pay them.",
