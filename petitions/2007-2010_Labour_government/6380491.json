            "background": "In Australia, the government has a specific regulation that each free-to-air broadcaster must transmit a minimum of 1040 hours per year of High Definition content (720p or more). If this was introduced to the UK, it would mean that ITV, Ch4, and five would be forced to start an HDTV service, or at the very least a trial service. The BBC have already done so, with their trail channel, BBC HD.",
