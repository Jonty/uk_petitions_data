The planning authorities should abide by rules that ensure more starter/smaller homes are built at least at a set percentage of all planning in each village and rural area. With doing this it will ensure the socio-economic stability of the survival of rural communities in the longer term.",

            "background": "Currently there are a vast, and excessive, amount planning applications & approvals for \"Executive\" and large homes.  While I accept this type of housing, we need to dedicate a set minimum percentage of housing to smaller (less expensive) homes with 2/3 bedrooms.  This will allow younger people to reside in the rural communities, and older generations to move down the housing ladder without leaving too. \n\nIf a village has an excessive amount of \"Executive\", 4 bed +, homes then no more of this type of housing can be built in the village, only smaller family/starter homes should then be permitted until the balance is redressed.  Ensuring village communities have cohesion and long term diversity.",
