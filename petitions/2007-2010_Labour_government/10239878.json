            "background": "For years now, this Government has been procrastinating about the reasons why people are carrying knives about their person, yet does nothing. The average person on the street knows why; due to there being no effective deterrent. Only the Government fails to see this. A caution, a suspended sentence or a short custodial sentence are ineffective & insufficient, often being seen as a badge of honour. This Government needs to begin to represent the views of those who elected them and respond to their concerns immediately. Strict sentences are needed. Get tough with the criminals who make others lives unpleasant instead of postponing the decision and allowing the criminal fraternity to walk roughshod over our lives unhindered.",
