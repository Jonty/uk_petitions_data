            "background": "Ross Brawn, principle of Brawn GP has shown himself over recent years to be a quantifiable genius. First at Benneton, then with a glorious career at Ferrari, he has now by creating forward thinking strategy turned a lame dog into a front running world leading team for 2009. \nAs a country we desperately need this gifted man, a genius of gigantic intellect, to fill the leadership void and save the U.K. from becoming a third world economy, led by spin doctor's and inept politicians.\nIt is my opinion that after besting the rest in the Machiavellian world of Formula One no one man has demonstrated such finely honed skills of leadership,  team building and financial acumen as Ross Brawn.\nHe oozes integrity and has the respect  of his peers, surely, at the very least he is over qualified to lead the country, but we must prevail upon him to save us from obscurity on the world stage as he has done for those that he has touched before us.\nRoss Brawn for Prime Minister",
