            "background": "UK & America are supporting the Israeli's war against the innocent people & children of Ghaza which is a shame for the whole world. Every day the innocent children , women and men are the victims of this war. Where are the world human rights organizations? where is the role of UNO and the where are the claimers of peace in the world. The British and Americans who claim to work day and night for peace and work against terrorism have proved that by supporting israel they themselves are the front line terrorists. We should have no doubt that who ever supports Israel in this war are the real terrorists. So, to maintain peace in this world we should never support such terror activities in any part of the world.The British government and Americans should clearly and categorily condemn the Israeli's and openly support the people of Ghaza which will automatically help to wipe out terrorism in this world.",
