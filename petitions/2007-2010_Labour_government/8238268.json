            "background": "With the threat of restrictions being imposed on the sale and use of LPG fired patio heaters we urge the government to respect individual's freedom of choice to the above.\n\nAs liquefied petroleum gas is a by-product of the petrochemical industry, it is routinely burnt off at refineries/oil rigs as waste. By bottling and finding alternative uses for LPG such as to fuel patio heaters, the gas is not wasted and produces the same amount of CO2 as if it was burnt as waste.\n\nIt is therefore our view that patio heaters that are fuelled with liquid petroleum gas have little or no contribution towards climate change; as such the government should legislate against the sale of this appliance.",
