            "background": "NHS Mail is the messaging system that the Government would like its NHS employees to use. To encourage them in this activity, NHS Trusts are instructed to block access to other messaging systems (Google, Yahoo etc). Fair enough, we don't want employees wasting time on the computer when they should be looking after patients.\nBut now that Microsoft are in charge of the project, access to our mailboxes when we *aren't* at work has been curtailed severely.\nLet us work from home when we need to. Force Microsoft to support non-Microsoft products and Operating Systems or give the contract to someone who will respect the views and needs of NHS workers. Don't believe the propaganda - NHS Mail is failing. Help us save it and give it back to the workers !",
