            "background": "Very little money has been spent on this section of the A1 since its construction in the late 1980s, the road is basically same as it was when it opened in 1990.\n\nTraffic volumes have increased immensley over the past 18 years, the capacity of traffic that this road was designed for has been exceeded and is getting worse year on year.\n\nThis road is the main link on the eastern side of the country between London and Scotland.\n\nDuring morning/evening rush hour it is absolute chaos.\nTraffic queues during rush hour can stretch 4-5 miles on the north and south bound carriageways.\n\nAn upgrade to motorway status of this section is vital, this will protect and expand local businesses/industry and the local economy.\n\nA lot of investment has taken place on sections of the A1 in Yorkshire, where most of the road has been upgraded to motorway status, we pay our road tax and would like some investment in our\nroad infrastructure.",
