        "action": "lower the speed limit to 40mph on all unclassified and B classified unlit roads, particularly in rural areas.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The number of accidents on unlit, unclassified and B roads seems to be increasing. In rural areas in particular there is a real and present danger to pedestrians, domesticated animals, cattle, sheep and associated livestock, those working on or near the road, farm workers, recreational joggers and walkers, schoolchildren and cyslists. This list is probably not exhaustive. The use of \"rat runs\" encourages speeding and reckless driving to the detriment of safety and the local community. Further, a lowering of the speed limit would see a drop in exhaust emissions leading to a better localised atmosphere. We urge the Government to rapidly instigate pilot schemes to test the efficacy of such a measure.",
