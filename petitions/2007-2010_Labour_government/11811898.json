            "background": "stop the increasingly inappropriate custom of Parliamentary Members benefitting from the terms Honourable and Rt-Honourable. National politics is now a professional career, far less a calling.  Those seeking office represent the whole range including those with quite apparently little ingredient of public-spirited dedication. Members gather annually filling the seats in the House, the spectacle of voting themselves large expense funding, and to defeat any measures intended to curtail their greed in defiance of the state of the ordinary members of the society they are elected to represent, quite enough to raise the hackels of the Nation.  It does not help their declining image that they continue to employ these priveledged usages in their exchanges.They are Members of Parliament and that is sufficient. Continuing to grace each other with these pantomine survivals from past centuries including the preposterous dressing up, where each of us ordinary citizens are excessively surveillanced and judged very severely in our own careers and occupations, draws cynicism and disrepute on the institution, and should now be stopped.",
