            "background": "Currently batteries are not accepted as recycle items within recyclable waste collections, to be disposed of safely by my local council. I was told by my local council to put them in the Black bin for land-fill.. \n \n\nThis is not acceptable in our modern world and a better way of disposal of household batteries, batteries used for toys, shavers, watches, clocks and a multitude of gadgets etc should be available.\n\n \n\nI think the councils should be made to collect household batteries. -With such dangerous and environmentally unfriendly items like household batteries I'm surprised at the lack of concern and urgency that there should be to collect these in the weekly recyclable items collections and for the council to safely dispose of them.\n\n \n\nAt my local waste plant I was informed that NO-place or provision is made for these smaller batteries disposal, only for car batteries.\n\n \n\nI am appalled at this and surprised that no-one else has yet made a petition about this!",
