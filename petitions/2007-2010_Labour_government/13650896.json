            "background": "Having read the item on the bbc website i was disgusted that fishermen are allowed to shoot seals at random, because they are apparently stealing thousands of pounds worth of fish from their nets.\nA: They are NOT stealing, they are surviving, because..\nB: The sea is being continually overfished.\nThese friendly, intelligent animals have taken to the risky strategy of entering a fishing net in order to feed.\nAnd now the fishermen, who i would guess are not marine biologists, are free to randomly shoot females, youngsters etc... I would have to assume that many are only 'winged' and manage to swim off to die elsewhere at a later date.\nQuite frankly, its barbaric, has no basis in science and i find it disgusting.",
