            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "As the law stands now, if the parents of a child are not married,the parents have to register the birth together to have both their names entered on the birth certificate. In cases where the father wants nothing to do with the child he has taken part in creating, only the mother's name is entered in the registry.It seems grossly unfair that two people made the child but only one is legally held resposible for that child, usually the mother. Children Right Act states amongst other things, that children should have the opportunity to form relationships with both parents/siblings/grandparents and the current legistlation is not honouring this most basic of a child's right. The CSA is busy chasing fathers for maintenance, we are not doing anything about the \"Whole child\".I believe that we need to start now to create a better future for our children and that surely include the input of both parents. fathers/mothers should be made accountable to support their children's mental and emotional welfare.  Every Child matter, not just to receive education but to receive nurturing from the people who  created him.\nThank you",
