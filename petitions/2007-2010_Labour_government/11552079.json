            "background": "Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council has recently announced the closure of 11 of Wirral's libraries as well as a great number of other community facilities and services. I and I'm sure thousands of other people on the Wirral would want to contest these actions vehemently, arguing that they fall well short of the level of community services we should expect, and that, if carried out, will inflict enormous damage to the long-term well-being of our residents.",
