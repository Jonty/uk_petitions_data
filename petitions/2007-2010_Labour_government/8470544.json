            "background": "Over recent decades loyal fans have put up with changing kick-off times and rapid ticket price inflation to support the team they love, the team that's in their blood.\n\nThe Premier League has consistently moved further and further away from its loyal fan base to make a smuch money for the people that run the Premier League and the Chairmen of the Big Four.\n\nThis is not only bad for the fans; it\u2019s bad for the lower league teams who face a growing inequality with the top. Today (8th Feb), when the Premier League announced its money making gesture to play a round of games overseas, Bournemouth of League 1 went into administration with \u00a34 million of debt -  or the wages of 2 Chelsea players.\n\nThis decision to play a round of games abroad would be the last kick in the teeth for the English fans that made the league what it is. It would rip out whatever soul remains in the Premier League.\n\nFootball is a passion and a game, not a commodity. This is wrong.\n\nPlease aid our campaign to stop this.\n\nThankyou.",
