            "background": "As a tax payer and parent of two daughters at University I have had the misfortune of dealing with Student Finance Direct and now Student Finance England (along with dis-organised County Council Departments). The \"service\" to both Students and parents is, in my opinion, terminally slow, in-efficient, disorganised, disgraceful and wasteful. There appears to be no complaints process and Students are suffering real hardship at a time when major life changes occur and study should be  taking place. This should not be allowed to continue and our Prime Minister, Minister (or Ministers),Head of Government Department/Agency and the (highly paid) Senior Staff at Student Finance England should be held accountable to Students/parents and tax payers alike. The British Public have power and we should use it! Complain in numbers and we can change this intolerable Public Service. Please vote for my/our Petition. Thank you for your interest. Created by an average British Tax payer who is embarassed by our Public Sector service level.",
