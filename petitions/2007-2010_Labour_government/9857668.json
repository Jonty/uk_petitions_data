They withdrew due to lack of interest, if the UK were to promote it more, then then I am 99.9% sure that there would be a great deal of interest, it would be a great influence to today's youth as there are many anti social behaviour and lack of creativity- possibly causing problems in their future and certainly in today's society.\nThe UK pay a lot for the Eurovision- how about actually getting something out of it?\n\nbring the UK back! (maybe we might actually get far in a Song Contest)",
