            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The MoD have proposed a reduction of the permitted muzzle energy of rifles allowed to be used on military ranges to 3,800 Joules from the current 7,000. The current permitted energy levels have enjoyed a healthy safety record. Lowering this energy level will stop law abiding shooters from enjoying their sport, and will effectively ban certain rifles.",
