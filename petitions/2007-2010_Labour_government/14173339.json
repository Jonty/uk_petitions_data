        "background": "For our GCSE citizenship coursework, we chose the topic of abortion, when we read into the laws of abortion it seemed wrong that the mother should be able to keep the baby so long before an abortion. We also looked into the stages of the fetal development and found that a fetus is fully-formed at around 10 weeks, and we are campaigning to change the current laws of an abortion being allowed to take place at or even after 24 weeks, almost 5 months, into a pregnancy.  Our proposition is that abortion should be make illegal after the baby is fully-formed (at 12 weeks) unless there is a reason the pregnancy would be harmful to the mother or baby.",
