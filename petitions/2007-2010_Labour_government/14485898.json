            "background": "The ability to identify the geographic location of a postcode, either by latitude/longitude or grid reference, is an essential aspect of many systems which use postcodes to identify locations within a certain distance - ranging from pizza delivery to the nearest hospital or job centre! However, this information is currently only available via the Post Office \"Postzon\" service which is not free. \n\nThis petition seeks to have postcode geolocation data made freely available on data.gov.uk under its standard terms rather than only being obtainable through a commercial service. This would bring the UK into line with other countries, such as the US, which make this data freely available for the benefit of residents and businesses.\n\n(Note that this is not the same as the PAF data, for which a separate petition already exists. This petition relates solely to the data currently published as Postzon.)",
