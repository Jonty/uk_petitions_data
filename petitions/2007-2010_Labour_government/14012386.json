            "background": "I believe that introduction of sheet music to libraries should be funded by the British government. There are thousands of children and adults out there who would love to start playing an instrument, but the high cost of buying a wide range of sheet music is preventing many people from starting their musical career. Introducing sheet music into libraries for free of charge borrowing will be help many people when they are taking up a new instrument, and will have a beneficial effect on society.\n\nIf this petition is successful there should be a wide range of sheet music from each genre and for each instrument.",
