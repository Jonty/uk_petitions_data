Many NATO troops are being killed and wounded in the process. Whilst here, in Europe and the United States some people are, unwittingly providing financial support to the Taliban, and are walking freely in our streets.\n\nThese people are the heroine addicts. The money that they spend on drugs goes a long way to fund the Taliban.            \n\nDo you think it is about time that the heroine addicts of the NATO countries are put into internment, treated humanely, possibly given drugs free of charge grown in Europe under strict control, until the conflict is over.\n\nSurely we must stop this funding of our soldiers deaths and injuries.",
