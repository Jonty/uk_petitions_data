            "background": "A National Care system for the elderly will result in selective funding of Council's the Government considers deserving (Labour controlled) and hamper well administered Council's from providing care they can budget and afford from their own funding sources.  Could this be just another way for the Government to get their hands on our money to alleviate their chronic debt problem?  The proosed \u00a320,000 death tax will probably do into the same deep hole and should be resisted at all costs.  We pay tax all our working lives, on our pensions, on our purchases why pay it for the unavoidable - death?",
