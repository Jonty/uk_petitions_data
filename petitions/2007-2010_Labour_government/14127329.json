            "background": "Join Positive East's petition to the government to help stop HIV stigma and discrimination.\n\nOver 26'000 people in the UK last year experienced stigma and discrimination due to having HIV. This stigma and discrimination varies from being ostracised and isolated by family members making them eat separately or throwing them out the house, employers breaking confidentiality and disclosing a person\u2019s HIV status without their permission, to children being bullied because a parent has HIV or healthcare workers using two pairs of gloves during health examinations.\n\nThese are just some examples of how HIV stigma and discrimination can manifest itself. It can have a dangerous affect on local communities, breeding ignorance and hostility when understanding and support are what is most needed.  \n\nThe government has to take more steps to ensure that not one person with HIV in the UK experiences HIV stigma or discrimination, let alone 26\u2019000. \n\nPlease sign Positive East's petition to help ensure that government does its best to tackle HIV stigma and discrimination, and in turn end HIV stigma and discrimination.",
