            "background": "We wish to express our disgust that whilst we as disabled people are subject to strenuous scrutiny in claiming and retaining benefits Mps can claim more than our yearly income  for luxury items ..  whilst many of us are in fuel poverty and struggled over winter to eat, and heat our homes.\n\nWe object that they claim money for cleaners when we as disabled people cannot get help with domestic tasks and thus have to live in homes that are frequently not clean and sometimes dangerous \n\nWe would suggest that rules about what can be claimed and to what value be amended so that only items necessary to live a decent life are allowed perhaps defined by what a bailiff would be required to leave if he were repossessing. \n\nThat our public servants seem to believe they deserve a far higher standard of living, with expenses higher than our incomes for things they should fund themselves smacks of serious hypocracy Mr Purnell..please note !",
