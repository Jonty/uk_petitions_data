            "background": "Green Resource Recycling of 243-245 Sheepcot Lane, Watford, are a family-owned business that provide an excellent recycling service.  They take often old and unwanted items and mend them to either sell on or break them into useful parts.  \nRecently, they applied for planning permission for two new buildings and a tarmac hardstanding.  Having seen the valuable work they do, and the dilapidated nature of their current buildings, the renovations are very much needed.  The proposed buildings would be a much-needed facelift for the site, improving the vista for the surrounding properties and improving access for customers and employees.  This would not be planning permission for a new establishment but a modernisation of existing facilities.",
