            "background": "In a move to stabilize council tax, be greener and give the local community more money, I hereby suggest that there be a 'junk mail' licence and fee for delivering junk mail. Vendors will pay \u00a3500 a year and 1p for every leaflet delivered to houses. No licence  - no delivery or very hefty fine. This will stop most junk mail going from door to bin and the household having to pay for something to be taken away that they did not want in the first place. All deliverers to have id and be checked regularly.",
