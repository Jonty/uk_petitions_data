            "background": "There can be no argument against giving temporary workers the right to demand equal pay to their permanent counterparts.\n\nIt simply cannot be right that two workers on the factory floor can do exactly the same job but be paid at different rates simply due to the length of their contract.\n\nHowever, to give temporary workers full equality of employment rights could be hugely damaging to the wider economy of the UK.\n\nMost worryingly, these plans could lead to employers relocating much of the work currently done by temporary workers to cheaper, more flexible economies.\n\nIn today\u2019s economic climate in particular, forcing such widespread operational challenges upon employers over a relatively short period of time could do considerable harm to already struggling British businesses and workers.\n\nIf such changes are indeed needed \u2013 which we maintain they are not \u2013 a much more gradual process involving greater consultation with the temporary sector is needed.\n\nFor those reasons, we urge the Prime Minister to reconsider the current proposals and to focus on introducing equal pay for temporary workers as a means of addressing their most immediate needs as soon as possible.",
