Moreover, in addition to the council's current severe financial situation, the council has recently admitted that an unauthorized loan of \u00a32 million was made by an unidentified council member/officer to an unidentified third party. The reason for this unauthorized loan and all other relevant details (including repayment requirements and interest) have been withheld from the majority of councilors, the press and the public; and an independent inquiry has been refused by council leaders and officers.  Accordingly, we also petition the Prime Minister to:  (a) Instigate an independent public inquiry into the circumstances which led to the Audit Commission\u2019s condemnatory finding; plus full public disclosure of the circumstances surrounding the unauthorized loan.   (b) Require the council\u2019s elected leaders, along with present and former salaried officers concerned with the council\u2019s financial affairs are held to public account for their actions.'",
