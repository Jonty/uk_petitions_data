            "background": "The Government have stated that the two biggest crises facing the UK population are obesity and climate change.\n\nThrough the co-operation of the food industry, the Department for Health, the two education departments, and DEGRA, a promotion to stop Britons eating meat completely could see less cattle and sheep kept for slaughter, meaning less production of methane through natural causes, thus reducing CO2 gasses in the atmosphere.\n\nRequesting the UK population to stop eating meat would also satisfy the report published recently which suggested even eating bacon caused cancer in humans. \n\nTherefore the Government should make it a priority to promote turning the UK into the first compulsory vegetarian state, to help with personal health and national climate change policies.",
