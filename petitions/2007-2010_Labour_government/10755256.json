            "background": "Labour yet again give away MILLIONS of taxpayer's money to other nations without consulting the taxpayer first.\n\nThe UK has its own problems and the government is always bleating the Treasury doesn't have enough money. Then they pull a stunt like this: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7606024.stm \n\n\u00a375M given away to Bangladesh!!  This money could have been better used at home, to:\n\n*Improve the UK's neglected road network;\n\n*Provide equipment or improve the conditions of our armed services operating abroad;\n\n*Help fund the NHS;\n\n*Help fund the police and provide financial support for such initatives as tackling the rising knife crime.\n\nOr any number of other useful causes or initatives in the UK.\n\nThis petition is to STOP the government from giving away Treasury Funds in this manner without FIRST CONSULTING THE UK TAXPAYER!\n\nThere are numerous charitable organisations in the UK that earn millions every year. The taxpayer should be given the option to decide whether or not to charitably give away treasury funds in this manner. After all, the government works for us, right??",
