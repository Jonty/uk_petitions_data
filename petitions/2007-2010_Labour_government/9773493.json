            "background": "Chequers belongs to the nation and has, since 1921, been used as a country retreat by Prime Ministers. Gordon Brown has indicated that he will not use it regularly at weekends and, instead, it will be used for international summits and brainstorming sessions with civil servants.\nConsequently, there will be many days when it is not being used for official purposes. My proposal is that on some if not all of these days, it should be possible for members of the public to visit the grounds and house, just as happens in equivalent properties in a number of other counties.",
