        "background": "Having recently entered full time employment and started on my career after university, I am astonished that the top rate of tax is for people earning a good average salary!  \n\nI propose that the top tax band be only applied to people earning more than \u00a350k, and a 4th band created in between.  For example:\nEarnings of \u00a30-\u00a39k would be tax free.  \nEarnings of \u00a310k-\u00a319k would attract tax of 10%.  \nEarnings of \u00a320k-\u00a329k would attract tax of 20%.  \nEarnings of \u00a330k-\u00a339k would attract tax of 30%.  \nEarnings of \u00a340k-\u00a349k would attract tax of 40%.  \nEarnings of \u00a350k+ would attract tax of 47.5%.",
