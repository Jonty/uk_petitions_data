            "background": "With the rise of immigrants entering the uk from countries such as Asia and the Middle East and even more underdeveloped countries such as Africa where diseases such as TB, dengue, Hiv/Aids, Hep B, Hep C, Rabies and many more are prevalent, wouldnt it make sense to prevent these diseases from re-entering the UK. At one point TB, was completely irradicated from the UK, and the need to give infants the appropriate vaccination was no longer needed. Now there is a steady rise in TB and Aids/Hiv infections, since nothing is being done to prevent its re-introduction. I do not believe this is an infringement of human rights, its saving human lives, and our children will not be subjected to life threatening diseases. It costs the NHS thousands of pounds each year to treat these cases, sureley prevention is better and more cost effective than the cure.",
