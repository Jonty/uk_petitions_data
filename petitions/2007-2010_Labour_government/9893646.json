            "background": "Henry William Allingham (born June 6, 1896) is a supercentenarian World War I veteran and Britain's oldest living man. He is the oldest ever surviving member of any British armed force and the oldest surviving veteran of World War I.\n\nHe is the last survivor of the Battle of Jutland, the last surviving member of the Royal Naval Air Service and the last surviving founding member of the Royal Air Force. He also fought at the Somme and Ypres where he was bombed and shelled.\n\nHis life has spanned six monarchs and has taken in 21 prime ministers.\n\nHis many medals and honours include the British War Medal, the Victory Medal and the Legion D'Honneur - the highest military accolade awarded by France.\n\nWill the Prime Minister not join me and my fellow petitioners in recognizing several lifetimes worth of patriotism, service and courage by justly awarding the KBE to Mr Allingham? A man who could rightly claim to be a true knight - tried, tested and earned - and an inspiration to all citizens young and old for whose freedom he and his comrades fought so hard to preserve.",
