            "background": "With soaring fuel prices, income through collection of VAT on petrol and diesel is dramatically increasing for the UK government.\n\nNow is the time to reduce VAT on petrol and diesel to 5% as per domestic gas and electricity. This would help the UK motorist and also begin to align prices with those across Europe.\n\nAlso, we must have some stability in fuel prices, therefore we ask for a freeze on fuel duty for a minimum of 5 years.",
