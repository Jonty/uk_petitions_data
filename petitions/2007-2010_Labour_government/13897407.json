        "action": "ban driving whilst wearing any kind of full face covering such as the veil, balaclava, burkha, niquab or garment that otherwise covers all or part of the face of the driver.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We believe that drivers should have unimpeded vision and that face coverings can cause a significant or potential loss of vision whilst operating a motorised vehicle. We believe this to present a risk of vision being obscured whilst the vehicle is in motion and an increased risk of accident, damage or even death.\n\nIn addition, we believe that in the event of an accident, it impedes the ability to identify the driver and could also prevent a Police Officer from effectively investigating a criminal offence if the face of the driver is covered. We point out the fact that there is no religious reason why a driver should drive with a full face covering and therefore on safety and security grounds, it should be banned by an act of law.",
