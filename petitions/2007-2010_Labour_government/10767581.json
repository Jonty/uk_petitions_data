            "background": "All over the world children are suffering cruel and dangerous lives lots of the children are slaves. Children as young as 5 have to lead these lives for a bit of food and maybe a little bit of money!\nThere are many forms of slavery but some are more horrific then others. Here are some of the different types of slavery:\n\u2022      child prostitution(leading up to aids and other sexually transmitted deseases)\n\u2022      Beggars\n\u2022      Factories\n\u2022      Fishing(in dangerous waters)\nAnd many more... \nBut this not the children\u2019s fault it may be their parents selling them for a bit of money to feed a family of 6 for 3 months, imagine your parent selling you for some money. \nIts basic human rights all the children want is to be free from the fear of danger free from those evil enough to keep them from living a happy and safe life.\nThank you for taking the time to read this.",
