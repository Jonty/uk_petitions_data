Married women are the only class of people who have been put in a position where they could mistakenly sign away their full pension entitlement.",

            "background": "For example: my wife was told by her employer as a young married mother that she only needed to pay full contributions if she wanted to be able to claim unemployment benefit or sickness benefit; her pension was covered by my contributions. In later years she was offered the choice of paying a full contribution, but no figures were given. She mistakenly believed full contributions would then be about \u00a319 per week and she was only earning about \u00a350. She is three years older than I am. At age 60 she received 47 pence per week graduated pension. At age 68 she received 2/3 of a basic pension as the wife of a 65-year-old man. She worked from age 15 to age 61, except for two years.",
