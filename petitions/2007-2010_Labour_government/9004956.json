            "background": "The Lafford High School, Billinghay in rural Lincolnshire, is NOT a failing school. It is one of the most improved schools in the country. It has wonderful members of staff and lovely children. Many have additional needs which require extra support and a caring environment, which the school provides very well. We are now faced with closure. \n\nThe staff, governors and parents are committed to the school. Our village community would suffer a severe blow if we were to lose the school. The school was not large enough to be included as part of a bigger academy and now faces closure.\n\nWe seek your support in securing a future for each and every child who wants to be at the school.",
