            "background": "I beleive that if a patient receives a clinincal recommendation to receive a drug, treatment should not be witheld. At present the PCT need to approve treatment even if there is a clinical recommendation. Therefore patients are being refused drugs recomended by their doctors because PCT's will not fund them. Which area you live in will affect the decision as there are many PCT's.\n\nI don't think anyone would accept refusal of treatment on the basis of race, age, sex etc - so why are we happy to accept it on the basis of which area you live in?",
