        "background": "Cambridge suffers from severe congestion and this is likely to get worse as the town's population and employment expand. There are no easy solutions. Congestion charging on its own will not be the whole answer, but it may form part of the answer.\n\nKnee jerk opposition to congestion charging neither solves the problem nor advances the debate.\n\nThis petition supports the rational discussion of Congestion Charging as part of a solution to road congestion in Cambridge",
