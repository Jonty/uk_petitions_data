            "background": "That the same price for the same goods and services are applied, regardless of geographical location, nationwide. That manufacturers must accept orders from small as well as large retailers, and at the same unit costs, regardless of quantity.\n\nWithout this legislation, the nation will be controlled by the purchasing power of large national and multinational vendors, to the detriment of the consumer - especially those in outlying or rural areas.\n\nAs it stands, the six major supermarkets, and the energy companies, have a total stranglehold on prices. High Street globalisation is rife because competition is non-existent except between themselves, and independent retailers are disappearing because they cannot compete on level grounds.\n\nWe urge the Prime Minister to break this stranglehold quickly and decisively with anti-competitive legislation such as this.",
