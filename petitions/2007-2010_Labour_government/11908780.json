        "background": "The current financial crisis seems to be deepening by the day. Further cuts in interest rates and quantitative easing will not fix the economy, in fact it may well make things worse. \nThe electorate as well as investors have lost confidence in the economy and the Government of the day. \n\nIn my view the best way of restoring confidence would be to call an immediate General Election and let the public decide whether Brown's Government have got what it takes to get us out of this mess.",
