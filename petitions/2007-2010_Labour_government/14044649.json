Then restrict the borders, establish a positive balance of payments, print money and come to an agreement with our debtors. While we are putting the country right bring back the troops and put a cap on immigration. Just my idea. Put more effort into putting right what our country has done wrong in the past. Also reject any laws that would restrict MP's freedoms and opinions.",
