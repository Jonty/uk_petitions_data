            "background": "Give the increasing instability in the former Soviet states of Georgia and Ukraine as well as the middle east it is foolhardy not to buy the full order of Typhoons to allow for attrition as  current equipment (Tornadoes and Harriers) are using up their service life at an increased rate due to operations in Afghanistan and the Middle East. Also the projected in service date for the F-35 Lightning II is likely to slip.",
