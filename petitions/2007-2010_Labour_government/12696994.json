            "background": "The plight of bees is dire, vast numbers are being harmed by Agro chemicals. Many countries in Europe have banned key chemicals that have been shown to harm bees. Its time we as an island nation did what is common sense, Protect our land and its inhabitants. We should ban all chemicals from food production that are known to injure health, not only our own but also that of the flora and fauna of these wonderful isles. No planting of GM should be allowed for the same reason. Lets make this island clean for us, our wildlife and make it a beacon in a world mired in pollution.",
