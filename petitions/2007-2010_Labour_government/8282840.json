        "background": "The British people are dismayed that there are still Members of Parliament who misuse their parliamentary allowances to benefit themselves, their friends, or their families. We ask the Prime Minister as a matter of urgency to enact legislation to increase the penalties for such offences, eliminating the need for removal of the whip or suspension from the Commons. Any MP found to have acted in this way will be immediately sacked as an MP and a by-election will be called in their constituency. In this way it will be clear for all to see that such behaviour is not to be tolerated.",
