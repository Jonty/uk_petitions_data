            "background": "The State of Israel is using immense military force against a largely innocent civilian population in the Gaza Strip. It is unacceptable that Israel fires heavy artillery and drops bombs in dense urban areas, causing immediate death and destruction and a humanitarian crisis afterwards. The long term economic blockade on Gaza by Israel will mean that after they have finished their clearly offensive, not defensive, operations, Gaza will be left in an even worse state than previously. It is time western governments, including Britain, hold Israel to account over their barbaric actions and flagrant violation of international law.",
