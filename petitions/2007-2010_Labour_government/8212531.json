        "background": "We have all seen the adverts offering free help by the NHS to smokers wishing to kick the habit.  Have you seen one offering the same help to drug addicts? Not to the same extent. Many drug addicts are begging for help but are told to wait for an appointment in two weeks time and then it will take another four weeks to be decided by a committee.  If and when they manage to get some sort of help the facilities are often depressing and degrading - not what they need when they are down there already. When an addict ask/begs for help, they need it there and now - a few weeks down the line and we have lost them yet again. Some die - others carry on down the destructive path, which they don't really want to go. Drug addicts need instant help.  We know it will be expensive but just think of the money saved (not just the lives).  There will probably be less crime i.e. shop lifting, burglaries, 'jumped' trains, prostitution, police time and resources  etc. etc.  Those 'lost' to us now would and could be good, useful and helpful members of the community.  Most of all you will be saving the lives of ALL the people involved - Families go through hell - it's not just the drug addict that suffers.  PLEASE! PLEASE! HELP!",
