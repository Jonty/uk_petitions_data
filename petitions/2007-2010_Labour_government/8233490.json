            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The car is not likely to be replaced as the most popular form of transport any time soon. Meanwhile, global warming is marching on and no significant action appears to be being taken. If all methods of transport currently using polluting materials were forced to use alternative non-polluting fuels via the same methods as now, petrol pumps, etc; this would cut our carbon emissions over time as the alternative fuel was developed to be cleaner. In most cases it has been proven that some alternative fuels do not effect performance or cause the engine any long-term problems. In cases this did not apply a time period could be set to allow change over. The cost of alternative fuel would have to remain the same to stop dramatic effects on the economy in the short term but could be be gradually reduced over a time period defined by the Chancellor. If England were to produce the chosen fuel this would create much needed jobs, but the business would have to be protected from on sale to other countries by Shareholders.   \nMuch development is needed for alternative fuels to be enviromentally viable but this won't happen without investment and for that to take place they must be widely used.",
