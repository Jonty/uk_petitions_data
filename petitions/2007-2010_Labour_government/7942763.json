            "background": "Mr Speaker has shown again (as in many instances already on record) that he fails the test of impartiality on every count.  He has allowed the contemporaneous record of government proceedings to be changed to avoid embarrassment to a member of his own political party.  This man is not fit to sit in Mr Speakers chair and should be removed forthwith.  He, also, has no mandate to be there since he is a scottish constituency MP who has lost his constituents to the Scottish Parliament and NOT ONE OF THE PEOPLE NOW SUFFERING BECAUSE OF HIS LACK OF IMPARTIALITY HAS VOTED FOR HIM.",
