In France we have to pay 164\u20ac (\u00a3145.73) - that is over TWICE the cost.  \nThis is very unfair especially as all of us who are in receipt of a UK pension have seen our incomes reduced in value by nearly one-third over the past year owing to the drop in the value of Sterling. \nI ask the British Government to create a level playing field for all of its citizens regardless of where we live.",
