        "background": "Irrespective of how much care drivers, cyclists and pedestrians take, accidents happen because cyclists can be very difficult to see.  This is especially the case when it is dark with poor visibility caused by rain or other adverse weather.  Making the wearing of high-visibility clothing mandatory for all cyclists on public roads would make road use safer for all concerned - cyclists, drivers and pedestrians.",
