            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The current four carriage Voyager trains are not of high build quality to offer an excellent intercity service. These trains are far too short, as they replaced eight carriage High Speed Trains and there are not enough seats or luggage spaces on board for everyone. The catering faclities aboard the shop are severely restricted and limited as well.\n\nThe new InterCity Express trains would be formed of two seperate power cars marshalled at either end of an eight carriage train. This would provide a much quieter and smoother ride. These trains would be 23 metres long with doors at each end of the carriage on both sides.\n\nThe new trains could feature three luggage stacks per carriage (one at each end and one in the middle), upto around 75 seats per Standard Class carriage (five carriages per train, one with wheelchair space), a buffet/restaurant carriage with seating for 24 First Class passengers (one carriage per train) and 48 seats per First Class carriage (two carriages per train, one with wheelchair space).",
