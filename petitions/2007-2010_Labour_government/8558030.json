We the undersigned believe that this constitutes unacceptable price discrimination and abuse of market share as iTunes is the sole provider of many  commercial downloadable tracks and we the consumers are unable to purchase downloads from the United States service instead.\nWe the undersigned believe that progress on this issue is important because it is likely that services such as iTunes will become more important as a distribution mechanism as time advances, in the realms of cinema and television as well as music.",
