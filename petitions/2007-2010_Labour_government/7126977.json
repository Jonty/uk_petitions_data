            "background": "Chris Powell of Charlton Athletic is one of those rare breed of\n     football players who works hard both on and off the pitch, for\n     the same reason: enjoyment. \n\n     His work in the community is legendary, and what better example\n     to the football world is there, than the man who makes so many\n     community visits, and so many friends.\n\n     He has never once been questioned of his loyalty to the club or\n     its fans, so much so, that he has been re-signed for Charlton\n     on no fewer than three occasions.\n\n     It is his attitude to life, the community and his peers that\n     make him the nicest footballer in the land, and the one with\n     the biggest heart.\n\n     We'd like the government to recognise his hard work through\n     bestowing a knighthood on him, to make Chris Charlton's first\n     \"sir\".",
