        "background": "STOP enviromental health Offices from allowing MOBILE tattooing in there area. Some councils in the UK are allowing people in there area to register from there home address (without planning permission)and then go Mobile, tattooing in other peoples homes and even in Public houses. The laws on tattooing should be changed so that this can be stopped as these people are not only breaking the law by moving contaminated waste and sharps without a licence and then placing this waste in domestic bins. They are also not keeping records so avoiding paying income tax on there earnings.",
