            "background": "People who saved their money in Landsbanki Guernsey face the devastating prospect of losing 70% of their savings. So far depositors have only received 30p for every pound saved, following the bank\u2019s collapse in October 2008. The majority of depositors are British citizens and pensioners, facing significant hardship and distress following the loss of their life savings. \n\nThose resident abroad or in Guernsey were limited as to where they could deposit their sterling savings as up to 97% of UK high street banks will not allow a British expatriate citizen to open or retain a UK bank account. \n\nBritain is the only country in the EU and North America to refuse its own expatriate citizens equal banking rights with their fellow countrymen within their home country.\n\nThe Landsbanki Guernsey Depositors Action Group calls on the UK Government to support British savers in Landsbanki Guernsey in seeking the full and prompt return of their savings.",
