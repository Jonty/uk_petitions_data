            "background": "Clearly neither Bercow nor those who voted him into office have understood at all the anger and revulsion felt by taxpayers towards those who abuse the system of expenses / Grace&Favour homes and waste our hard earned money taken from us in iniquitous taxes.  The recent revelations about the appalling waste of taxpayers' funds on the Grace & Favour residence with which the Speaker is provided appear even worse in the light of the fact that he owns his own residence in London and need not even use the G&F home for his family needs.",
