My daughter is lucky enough to have parents who can assist with child care on Bank Holidays, but it is not always possible to take leave to cover for staff training.  If the provision of childcare is not available, through no fault of the parent, then why should local authorities profit from charging for a non existent service.  Also why should local authorities be allowed to increase the charge for child care in school holidays.  Many parents with children in nurseries are on low incomes and struggle with finances, finding additional funding during school holidays.  We urge the government to reappraise this situation.",
