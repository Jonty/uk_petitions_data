            "background": "The President of the European Council is a position in the European Union  that chairs the European Council. At present it is an unofficial low key position (also referred to as the President-in-Office) which rotates between member states every six months.\n\nUnder the proposed Treaty of Lisbon, this system would be replaced by a permanent post with a two and a half year term. If the ratification of the treaty takes its course as scheduled, the first permanent President would be appointed in late 2009 and enter office when the treaty gains legal force on 1 January 2010.\n\nBlair was one of the architects of a permanent EU presidency and has been touted for the job as far back as 2002.\n\nPlease sign this petition to stop Blair becoming president of the european council.",
