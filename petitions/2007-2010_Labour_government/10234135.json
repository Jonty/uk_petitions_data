        "action": "Make the Banks change the current Cheque processing procedures, and start doing it within 2 days like our European counterparts.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Most European banks, and in the US and Canada, process cheques on the day or by the next morning. In the UK, it takes 5-6 days, which is grossly unfair. The banks are hesitant to change this, as they actually profit millions every year due to this fact. Mervyn King (The Bank of England Governor) has spoken of his frustration several times, but nothing has been done. It is a gross liberty doing this to customers. The way Banks operate and treat their customers in the UK is utterly dsicgraceful, and it seems they are exempt from normal working laws. I urge you to sign this petition to get the governmanet to do something now, as they will never change our dated and unworkable systems without being made to. As per usual, they are making big bucks from our misery - Enough is Enough.",
