            "background": "I don't know if I'm right on this matter, but it seems to me that a move towards hydrogen power could be detrimental to the world. The method breaks down water into hydrogen and oxygen, which means that we will be removing vast quantities of water from the planet. We may be about to make the same mistake as bio fuels, but instaid of making food scarce, we'll be making water scarce, and taking water completely out of existence on a mass scale. We already suffer from droughts in this country, but in Africa and other parched countries, removing water from the earths eco system to run our cars and power our homes would result in droughts like we have never seen, and it would be fatal for the entire planet... As anyone worked out how much water a year would be needed to run all the cars in the world on hydrogen? and if not, I think they should.",
