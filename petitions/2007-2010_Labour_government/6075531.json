I AM NOT A SMOKER and I did not commit the alleged offence. Leeds City Council are not interested in providing proof but only in threatening and bullying behaviour. Mine is not the only case as others are being highlighted in the Yorkshire Evening Post. Something MUST be done to stop this department from harassing the innocent public with their fraudulent claims. The Police themselves cannot prosecute without satisfactory evidence, what makes these people a law unto themselves? Innocent until proven guilty will become a thing of the past if this is allowed to continue. Please help me stop this atrocity.",
