            "background": "The much-touted lie that the banks act in the interests of their customers, your citizens is finally exposed.  After years of enduring the complete antithesis of customer service that closed branches, long customers queues in remaining branches, impersonal call centres with obstructive, insulting security procedures, over-charging and inappropriate product-selling represent, we have this week witnessed the final denoument - the potential undoing of the entire global financial system and with the savings and livelihoods of millions of \"ordinary\" people lying underneath a precarious guillotine.  The only people who remain secure from these staggeringly inept and/or calculatingly short-term business practices are the shareholders who took and ran away with the dividends from previously falsely inflated profits and the senior executives whose contracts guarantee that they are very highly remunerated for long periods of time, regardless of their performance and the damage they cause. Enough of this - the financial services industry is no longer a market that works for those it should serve best.  Time to re-think the freedoms they enjoy.",
