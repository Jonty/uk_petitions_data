In Leviticus chapter 25 the\nBible outlines a celebration that should happen every 50 years. I really\nbelieve God gave us the secret toward financial health as a nation in this\nchapter. It would do your office well to apply this teaching so our nation\ncan regain its footing in God's sight and in the sight of all nations. There\nis no better example of how to do this than by implementing such a jubilee\nnationally and internationally. It will lead others to follow a good example\non forgiveness of debt, mercy and compassion. It may even help us regain\nsome respect that has been lost due to our meddling in foreign affairs for\nselfish cause. Thank you for your leadership.\nYour Servant in Christ\nRicci",
