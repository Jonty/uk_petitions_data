            "background": "On 25 January 2008 we received notification that the Gemini Board had rejected our offer and that they considered the UK to have issued notice to withdraw. While we have not yet issued formal notice to withdraw, the scientific prioritisation process in the Programmatic Review has placed access to Gemini South and Gemini North a lower priority and in the current funding climate we will not be able to continue to fund our membership of the Gemini partnership. We will therefore be taking steps to issue formal notice to withdraw.\n\nUnder the terms of the Gemini agreement the STFC will be liable to a \u2018penalty\u2019 payment of c\u00a37M, this being the value of two year\u2019s subscriptions. However, this should be seen in the context of potential payments of c\u00a324M between now and the end of the Agreement in 2012, this being the cost of our annual subscriptions and our contribution to the \u2018Aspen\u2019 instrumentation programme. \nStop this happening now before it's too late!!!!",
