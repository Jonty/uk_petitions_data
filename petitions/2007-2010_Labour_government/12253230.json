            "background": "I think that creating a School Counicl to represent all of the children in the U.K is the right thing to do. Because then the Goverment can hear childrens points of view on how the education system works, because then they will know that they do not know what it is like to be a student. They may say that they know what it is like but they are wrong they are not the ones who have to come in day after day learning. But I propose that this Council will consist of one member from each School Council in the U.K.",
