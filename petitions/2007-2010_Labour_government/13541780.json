            "background": "The national postcode database was originally created using public money and as such should be freely available to the public and businesses. Currently licencing this information from Royal Mail can cost businesses thousands a year and many SatNav systems do not include post code lookup due to the licencing fees involved. This information if available to all can only improve IT infrastructures nationwide and help small businesses compete. The small returns Royal Mail make from licencing this formation do not justify holding back the development of huge numbers of web services and would allow small businesses the chance to compete with those who can afford the high licencing costs for what should be freely available information.",
