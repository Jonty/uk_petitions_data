Yet everytime I go shopping I'm forced to try and squeeze my children out of a tiny gap, trying not to damage the car next to mine and leaving the pushchair virtually in the road because everyone who fancies parking close to the shop or doesn't want there car to get damaged see's fit to use the parent and child parking spaces! It needs to stop.",
