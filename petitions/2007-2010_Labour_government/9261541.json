            "background": "Gordon Brown's decision to abolish the 10p tax rate has unfairly penalised many in the country who are on lower incomes.  Especially those who are not eligible for any form of Tax Credits (single and childless working couples).  With this in mind, the Government should either reintroduce the rate or overhaul the Tax Credits system so that those who lose out are adequateley compensated.",
