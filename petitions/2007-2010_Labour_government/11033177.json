Robin Hood in reverse.\nBy insisting the Banks lower interest rates, you have robbed the poor to give to the rich, yet again.\nPensioners, who have already been hit hard by fuel & food inflation, lost most of their saved assets because you asked them to invest in Stock Exchange Securities, are now to receive much reduced interest on their cash savings, so that those who have borrowed carelessly may benefit.\nMost Pensioners are now worse off than they have ever been.\nMy advise to the young - NEVER SAVE A PENNY - CARRY ON SPENDING OTHER PEOPLES MONEY - IF YOU DON'T - Mr Brown will soon relieve you of any savings you may have, once you reach retirement.\nRecipey for total National Disaster.\nNo Vote for you Mr. Brown!",
