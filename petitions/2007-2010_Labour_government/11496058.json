Will stimulating the failed banking sector with free money solve the current national economic crisis? Instead of burdening the tax payer for generations to come one could be gallant and give them something for years to come. Why are the leaders  making free money available to banks for them to re-loan this money. The source of economic growth is not perpetual!",
