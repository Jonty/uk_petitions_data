Many people feel that we as a city would benefit from a good rowing facility were we can go to have a good time but most importantly to get fit. The goverment are always going on about getting overall health of our nation better and we are not saying that everyone will use it but if it has enough publicity about it it would be used by many different culltures! This would be a great idea! Who knows there might even be Olympic hopefulls in Birmingham that wouldn't get a chance to win in them because they didn't have enough training at a young age!",
