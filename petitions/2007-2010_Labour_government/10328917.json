        "background": "I believe that banning carrying knives in public outright is a violation of human rights and nature - we have used knives for very legitimate purposes for thousands of years. Thus, I think that introducing 'no-knife' zones into urban areas where knives serve no useful purpose. All those caught with a knife in these areas should be fined/details recorded in their permanent record/jailed based on the severity of the case. However, in more rural areas where these zones are not present, only those who have a legitimate reason to carry a knife may do so. Moreover, knives must be kept away from streets and housing areas throughout the country - no matter where.",
