            "background": "We have alternate fuels, such as biofuels, electricity and hydrogen, yet we are not exploiting these. Hydrogen especially, i have heard talk of hydrogen 4x4s, 0 emissions, yet i cannot find a single place, where i can buy a hydrogen vehicle, despite them being on the road, and i have never seen a hydrogen fill up station. If we want to go green, we need to publicise, and create the facilities, to facilitate those who wish to use this new fuel and vehicle. not to mention going green has so many other benefits.",
