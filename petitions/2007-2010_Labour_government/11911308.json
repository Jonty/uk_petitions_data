What we need to do is to ride out the storm and using money we don\u2019t have is what got us into this mess in the first place.  The Banks and Financial services can not be trusted to make decisions or self regulate themselves as their mistakes kick started this depression. \n\nThe Government must pull in the reigns and ride this out, look at what the Americans are now doing and restart the economy by getting people back to work on public projects till things get better.\n \nRemember \nThe Weimar Republic printed money to try and kick start the economy and that led to there downfall of Germany and paved the way for the rise of the Third Reich and WWII.  May we never go down that road ever again\u2026..",
