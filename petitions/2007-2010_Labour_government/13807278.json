            "action": "to abandon the government\u2019s top down housing policy which has compelled Charnwood Borough Council to propose building a new town of 5000 dwellings on precious and productive countryside north of Hamilton and east of Thurmaston.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Government housing policy is directing Charnwood Borough Council to plan for 6000 plus dwellings in the south of the borough within the Principal Urban Area (Greater Leicester). The Council has no choice in this matter and cannot look at alternatives such as allowing necessary growth within existing towns and villages. The Council has therefore had to put forward a plan that concretes over precious and productive countryside and  that threatens village identity. By abandoning it current policy the Government can free district councils like Charnwood to decide for themselves where best to site new houses.",
