            "background": "I ask the Prime Minister, Unions and workers of the U.K. to put an end to the injustice of workers being injured in industrial accidents, then being condemned to years of living on Reduced Earnings Allowance and Industrial Injuries Benefit, living below the poverty line, on an allowance which is a pittance of their original wage. If Members of Parliament, the Labour party and the Unions truly believe in social justice, and lifting an abandoned group of workers, who, in the main, have lost their livelyhood through no fault of their own, out of poverty in the pursuit of this countries economic wealth, then the repeated situation of workers having to accept low level, out of court settlements, and then being forced to live on poverty level allowances for the rest of their lives, should be ended. After several terms of Labour Government, with the quest for social inclusion and the attempt to iradicate poverty, this is one of Labour most disgraceful failings.",
