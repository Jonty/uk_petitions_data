            "background": "We believe that allowing people to work at home on a regular basis will increase overall productivity and better prepare our economy for the future.\n\nBy allowing office workers to work at home they will be able to concentrate on tasks that require a less frenetic arena than the typical office space.  \n\n100 million people are expected to work at home in the USA by next year.  By encouraging work at home now we will foster innovative practices and solutions that we can later export.",
