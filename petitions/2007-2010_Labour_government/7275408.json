            "background": "The current Eurostar ad campaign in Belgium is wholly offensive in its' portrayal of the English people .The English are symbolised by a semi-naked skinhead ,painted in The Cross Of St.George , urinating into a tea cup .Can you imagine the outcry if we had depicted foreigners in this way ? This when we cannot even publish cartoons of Mohammed ? This when the English subsidise everyone , including the EU whilst being swamped by immigration ? This when the English feel aggrieved for so many reasons ?  THIS ?",
