        "background": "Places of work that do not provide employees with diverse and enjoyable work such as some wherehouses, post offices, cleaning firms, olds peoples homes, carpet stores and many, many others... should have to pay a tax if its decided that the work could be done by robots. The tax would then help fund government scientists to produce robots to do the work. The television program Tomorrows World promissed that all repetative labourious tasks would be done by robots. But while companies can still get cheap human labour to carry on with these dull taskings without being taxed for it the robots will never come.",
