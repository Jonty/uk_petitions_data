            "background": "Speaking as someone who has just suffered a roadrage incident I strongly support a return to hidden cameras, for their potential to get the hotheads off the roads.   \n\nAlso, side-streets are being progressively destroyed by ramps, chicanes, bollards and dead-ends, in an ineffectual attempt to control 'rat-runs.' Hidden cameras would achieve safety more cheaply, without the inconvenience. \n\nVisibility markings were instigated at the behest of the 'performance car' lobby, who argue that high-spec cars remain safe when driven at high speeds.  That is a moot point, but counter-argument is that visible cameras simply do not work.\n\nWhen hidden cameras were allowed in the 90's, their presence led to a far more civilised driving environment.\n\nA proviso is that hiddden cameras should only be sited at identifiable hazards, and where the maximum speed is clear.",
