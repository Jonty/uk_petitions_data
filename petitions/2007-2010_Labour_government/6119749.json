            "background": "The proposed scheme will restrict travel to off-peak (09.30 to 2300 daily) thus limiting those wishing to make a full day trip anywhere impossible without paying the full fare at least in part. Local Councils have the power to enhance these schemes but may not because of funding issues. Scotland enjoys a much better unrestricted scheme and England should follow suit.",
