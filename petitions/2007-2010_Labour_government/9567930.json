        "background": "I have been a fan of Engelbert Humperdinck for 41 years and all of that time he has dedicated his life to music bringing a lot of pleasure to many people around the world.  But that's not all this wonderful man does. He tirelessly devotes his spare time and raises funds for many needy causes all over the world from  Aids, Leukemia, Cancer Research, Hospices, Lung Association and many more for which he receives no recognition.\n\nI feel Engelbert deserves a Knighhood for his devotion to his music and also his dedication to the needs of others.\n\nIf you feel the same please sign my Petition.\n\nThank you.\n\nMrs. Linda Rose Anderson",
