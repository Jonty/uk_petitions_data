            "background": "The current practice of baptism or christening of children is an act against the human rights Act.\nOnce a child has been enetered into any church they have had their human rights breached( 12- freedom of expression, & 13-Freedom of thought, conscience and religion) \n\nChildren have no say in religious matters and should have the absolute right to have freedom of expression( as they cannot express how they feel at point of baptism etc)\nOnly 1 in 12 children break away from their parents belief system. \nFrom a common sense perspective and on a moral point surely if people feel that they must be baptised or christened then it should be done at the individuals choice and not done by their parents choice.\nI feel that it is an abuse of the child to not allow them to express their religious feelings nad choice of religion.",
