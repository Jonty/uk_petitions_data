            "background": "The issue of politically motivated victimisation of people in Ghana by the current government is a politically motivated action and is meant to pose a bad image of the country to the outside world. This has been proven to be the strategy of a collection of political group who have in the past suceeded in making the nation inhospitable to foreigners and foreign direct investments in order to bring the economy to its knees to take power in elections.\nIt is true that there are issues of human rights abuses in the country.  The open support of the estwhile government for the seeming illegal installation of Chiefs which I would not want to name and shame since I want to prevent further excalattion of violent sentiments are all factors that have caused the seeming personally motivated pockets of Violence that occurs in the Country. The final question I would want to ask the suggesters of Politically motivated violence in Ghana is that has there been a killing of a journalist in Ghana since the take over of the current government compared to the ex-government?",
