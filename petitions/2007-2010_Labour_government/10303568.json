        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The amount of foreign vehicles using our roads has dramatically increased over the past two years, increasing the congestion on our roads. These vehicles are used on a long and short term basis, by people from the EU working here. We are taxed to transit through countries such as Austria, Hungary,around \u00a317 to go through these countries. Taxing all of the foreign vehicles entering the UK would keep a log of who is inside our borders, as well as helping with the costs of keeping the roads. It is not fair that the British public should support all of the extra use from their own purse and have to pay increased tax discs in the future; the proposed increases should be shared between all of the road users.",
