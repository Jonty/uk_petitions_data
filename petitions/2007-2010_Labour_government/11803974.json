            "background": "I've just heard that Lloyds Banking Group intends to pay bonuses of \u00a3120m to its staff. This can't be allowed in the country's current difficult circumstances. We can't afford such largesse. 43% of the money would come out of the national wealth which must be severely depleted by government handouts already made to banks. Also Lloyds will need more public money to ease their problems caused by the acquisition of HBOS and its \u00a311bn losses. The banker mindset must be changed now - they seem to think they are entitled to give themselves huge annual presents out of customers/public funds, no matter what damage to the nation. No other group seems so brazen or ignorant of the difference between right and wrong/ fair and unfair. The Lloyds rep said that most of the money would go to staff on lower pay. So what - many people are losing their jobs because of banking misbehaviour, and would be glad of a salary, never mind an annual cash present. Please sort this -if banker's thinking prevails it will ruin us all. If emergency legislation is needed then do it - people would support it. We all feel cheated.",
