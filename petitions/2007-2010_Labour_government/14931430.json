            "background": "The harsh winter has taken a serious toll on the country's roads. The freezing weather has caused any small imperfections in the road surface to become almost unavoidable pot holes.\n\nThese pot holes are damaging and distressing enough to car drivers, but motorcycle riders face a clear and present danger when taking to the roads.\n\nWe at Doble Motorcycles want to highlight this potentially fatal issue, and to do so we need your help. \n\nAlso it would be great to try to find the \"Worst Pothole\" and the \"Worst Potholed Road\", so keep your camera or phone handy when you are out and about and snap any potholes you come across. Send the pictures to us so we can use them to support this campaign.\n\nRemember we can't do this on our own, and the more people that add their support to this issue the better the chance of highlighting it to the authorities, so spread the word and lets get these roads sorted.",
