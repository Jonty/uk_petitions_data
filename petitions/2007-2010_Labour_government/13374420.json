They argue that such concerns outweigh the suffering of people who are dying. \n\nA number of countries and states in the US have introduced assisted dying legislation producing evidence that, in fact, vulnerable people are better protected and supported with better end of life care as a result of assisted dying legislation. \n \n\nAn independent commission is urgently needed to investigate all of the evidence, both for and against a change in the law, to ensure that our choices at the end of life are guided by fact and reason and not fear.",
