        "background": "Religion does not and will never give answers that are backed up by fact. Politicians should not make decisions for this country based on their personal religious beliefs as they are unable to represent the wider views of their constituents by doing this. People are going to carry on suffering because politicians have gone by their religious views to go against abortion, euthanasia & stem-cell research. Any MP that makes a decision based upon their religious views should be suspended from parliament. Pupils in Primary and Secondary schools should not have to undertake Religious Education if they choose not to. Having young gullable children visiting religious places of practice is to be quite honest depending on your point of view \"brainwashing\". Many countries in the world have a seperation of Religion and State in place the shocking exceptions in the Western world being the United Kingdom & the United States of America.",
