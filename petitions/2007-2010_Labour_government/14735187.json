            "background": "The Prime Minister has chosen to give his full backing and support to the case for Anthropogenic Global Warming. That is his right as an individual and that right is part of the constitution of this country.\nThe Prime Minister does not have the right to insult millions of British people by describing them as \"deniers\", a particularly hateful and emotive insult, because they do not share his view.\nRecently Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir John Beddington, said  \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy to dismiss proper scepticism. Science grows and improves in the light of criticism. There is a fundamental uncertainty about climate change prediction that can\u2019t be changed.\u201d\nIn spite of this, and significant evidence to show that there is indeed much in doubt, the Prime Minister continues issue his insults.",
