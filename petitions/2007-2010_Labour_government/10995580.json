The experience of the EU\u2019s Operation Artemis in 2003 in protecting civilians in the city of Bunia should be taken into account.\n2 commit immediate resources both from DFID and through the EU to humanitarian relief and development activities in eastern DRC.\n3 intensify diplomatic activities to achieve a regional political solution to the insecurity affecting eastern DRC.\nStatements up to now by Foreign Office ministers show that they are active on the third of these points, but the urgency and gravity of the situation require action in the sequence of this petition if security is to be restored and lives saved.",
