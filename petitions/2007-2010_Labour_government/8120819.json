Given the current/previous examples of 'law-breaking' by elected representatives we- the electorate- say enough is enough. If anybody breaks the law, a life-time ban on holding elected/non-elected office within government is enacted. This will also include:-i) people sitting in the House of Lords who were NOT elected by the people; ii) people serving on QUANGOS- again those NOT elected by the people.",
