The petition is to control equipment to only be sold to licensed professional's as we are regulated and conform to by law's. There is a increase in people who are unlicensed and working from home due to being able to buy equipment. There are serious health risks and the council do not have enough power to stop this, therefore if sales are controlled it will help break this. There have already been hep and hiv scares from bedroom tattooists as well as alot of underage tattoos.",
