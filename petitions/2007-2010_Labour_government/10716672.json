            "background": "From 1947to1967,a policy begun by the Labour Attlee Govt,was for the mass emmigration to Aust,of unwitting British children!The children were not asked, and when told,thought that Aust was no more than a few fields away from their then,institution of abode anyway!They were of a mind they were orphans..none were!It has been proven, that they were sent over to people in Aust that were paedophiles,and were often sexually abused!In Bindoon,Clontarf and Tardun,in West Aust,they were used as slave labour,and frequently beaten!Most were entirely uneducated by the age of 16!Many suicided upon release from these places!The Aust Senate said they only knew that the deaths were far above that of the norm!Many of these kids were to be aboard ships that were to pass silently in the Suez and on the high seas,those that bore the incoming Asians,with THEIR children!The 492 Jamaicans had arrived at the same dock of Tilbury aboard the 'Empire Windrush',in 1948 that some children had embarked from in 1947! It was an abomination!A childs'episode of horror.",
