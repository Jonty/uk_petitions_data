            "background": "The government need to offer a separate level of social housing for people with Learning disabilities away from the stresses of anti social behaviour. My son had the misfortune to be born disabled in a country that really doesn't care for its vulnerable citizens. We have struggled to exist in social housing for 18 years. My son has Autism, epilepsy and learning disabilities. We have been placed alongside undesirable people in social housing because we have no access to anything else.Moving time and again.\n I have been told from the top of Government in this country that they cannot intervene in housing association affairs, if they have no suitable housing thats though!\nI care for my son 168 hours a week for \u00a387 in carers allowance and premium, I stand no chance of giving him a better life. Social services will enable him to have a shared ownership home and a full time carer package at huge cost, with out his family but they wont allow us a proper home where I can continue to care for him.He should be able to live with essential family members.",
