            "background": "The new Home Office vetting and barring scheme is an expensive and ineffective layer of bureaucracy that does little to protect children.\n\nIt will discourage adults from giving up their time for worthwhile causes and breeds an air of distrust between the young and adult populations.\n\nThe cost of the ISA is excessive and will put extreme strain on the profitability of many small businesses.\n\nThe creation of the world's biggest checking system is a disproportionate response to the problem it is trying to solve. We agree with The Office of the Information Commissioner said there are 'inevitable' security risks in collecting large amounts of personal data, especially as the government has such a poor record on data security.",
