        "background": "Our economy is in a mess and the EU want to ban plasma televisions. This will be a particular blow to hospital patients and people who already own one. \n\nIn an economic recession, preventing the sale of plasma TVs will further the harm to the economy. \n\nAs we are in a recession and need more money in our economy and need to be able to make our own decisions, we call upon the PM to hold a referendum that asks whether or not we want to continue to be a full EU member, become an associate member, or completely withdraw. \n\nThe money saved by withdrawing from the EU would help us out of the recession and put pay to any plans of having plasma TVs banned.",
