            "background": "Reversing a vehicle in a car park or elsewhere can be a tricky manoeuvre. Even the most observant and diligent driver cannot see all around their vehicle at all times. It is therefore foolish at best and dangerous at worst that pedestrians regularly walk alongside or behind a reversing vehicle, especially if they are accompanying children. The proposal is that this act is made a criminal offence, either with a fine of say, \u00a3100 or five hours community service. This issue is pertinent to road safety.",
