            "background": "What a ridiculous idea. This is hoped to become LAW by 2010 so you all need to back it.We are in a recession with millions unemployed many young and middle aged and Government wants us to work until we are 70 and  we get the pension we have paid duties for all our working lives. It is not on. Apart from the fact that Gov are stopping us getting our own money we have invested they don't even give us a decent pension along the lines of other European countries.They want us in Europe for their benefit and motif not for ours.",
