            "background": "As an equal rights country we should have rights to Holidays for religious days for all religions for example Eid and Diwali etc. There was a time when the police force had no blacks or asains but now there are many and actually want more. i think this partition is all fair for all who live here expecially those who were born here. For example a muslim born in britain should have rights to a holiday for his/her religious celebration,its ok for him to pay council tax, income tax national insurance etc but he doesnt get his rights as a british citizen. This is possible we know that and the government knows that and hopefully this will happen. Tust like the police force eventually accepted asains and blacks so will its government. All races all religions lets make this happen lets all have a annual holiday on our religious days. (Ammen.... Ameen... inshallah.....Hopefully with the will of god......)",
