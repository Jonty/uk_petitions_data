        "background": "Whitley Bay, famous for its glorious beaches and family holidays of yesteryear,has suffered from a lack of direction, and investment, for many years.  To its credit, North Tyneside Council has tried extremely hard to reach a consensus  on a way forward, but without success.  There is now a proposal from a number of community groups to provide a sustainable solution, involving Mind Sports and the Dramatic Arts, drawing visitors to the town and regenerating the local economy.\n\nTo date, North Tyneside Council have given partial consideration to this proposal - we urge them to go further, and if necessary work with Culture Quarter to realise this dynamic vision and regenerate Whitley Bay.",
