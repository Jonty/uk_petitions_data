        "background": "fathers who abuse, be it sexually or violently, their children should NOT be allowed contact with the children. It is stressful to say the least on children and their mothers to be dragged through the courts by an abusive ex partner and this puts huge amounts of stress on the family unit. Children have the right to be protected from such people, and mothers have the right to support them and the right to decide the father should be out of the picture. It is not our fault if the man abused us and our children.",
