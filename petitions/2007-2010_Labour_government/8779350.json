            "background": "Climate change is already damaging the world's ecosystems.\n\nLeft unchecked, it is set to cause a global humanitarian and environmental disaster \n\nThe UK has the opportunity to show real leadership in combating global climate change by delivering a stronger Climate Change Bill.\n\nIt\u2019s a case of either listening to the science, or ignoring it \u2013 in which case we will have to face the consequences for species, habitats and people.\nWe need to set a target that delivers the reduction in UK climate-changing gases that is needed \u2013 the science tells us the target should be at least 80%, not the 60% the government proposes, which is based on out of date science.\n\n Research from the RSPB, WWF commissioned a report to examine whether the UK can achieve an 80% reduction target and what implications it would have on the economy.\n\nThe report found that it is technically feasible to reduce the UK\u2019s emissions of CO2 by 80% by 2050 \u2013 including emissions from international aviation, and without resort to new nuclear power generation \u2013 without relying on unsustainable technologies, and that this can be delivered within a growing and sustainable UK economy.",
