            "background": "many people who recieve housing benefit also work part time but do not make enough money to pay their rent completely , in this time of high unemployment it is very frustrating that many landlords and agencys, state \"no dss\" in their adverts. this is very ignorant considering alot of people who recieve benefits are in work and are desperately trying to find more work, and who may have to face homelessness if cercumstances warrant that they need to obtain a new place to live only to find all routes are shut to them. its clear the goverment needs to do more to reasure landlords and also put in place messures to prevent landlords from discriminating against benefit recievers instead of basing their decision to let or not to let a property on the bases of the individuls referances and credability.",
