        "background": "The so-called \"community speed watch\" scheme, which allows members of the public (typically bigoted elderly men) to monitor the speed of motorists is utterly ridiculous and should be completely abolished. The roll of issuing fines and pointing speed cameras should be entirely down to the police... And not groups of pensioners. \n\nFurthermore: These \"volunteers\" are often bias and highly incompetent... Choosing to harass drivers and allowing friendship to negate other speeding motorists to be distracted by a \"radar-gun\". They have minimal formal training and for the most part act as they please.",
