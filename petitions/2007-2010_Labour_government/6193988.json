            "background": "Pegah Emambakhsh is an Iranian national who sought asylum in the UK in 2005. Her claim failed despite appeals and she was arrested in Sheffield on Monday 13th August and taken to Yarlswood detention centre. She is due to be deported back to Iran on the 27th August.\n\nIf returned to Iran she faces certain imprisonment and possibly stoning to death. Her crime in Iran is her sexual orientation \u2013 she was in a relationship with another woman.\n\nMs Emambakhsh escaped from Iran, claiming asylum after her partner was arrested, tortured and subsequently sentenced to death by stoning. Her father has also been arrested, tortured and interrogated about Pegah\u2019s whereabouts, he has since been released.\n\nAccording to Iranian Human Rights Campaigners over 4000 lesbians and gay men have been executed since the Ayatollahs came to power in 1979. \n\nOther European countries (including Germany and Holland) have a moratorium on deporting gay people back to Iran. We urge you to take action on behalf of Ms Emambakhsh and stop her deportation back to a country where there is no doubt she will be persecuted and very likely stoned to death.",
