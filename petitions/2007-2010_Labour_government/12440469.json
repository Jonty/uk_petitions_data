        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "For each pound someone earns coming off benefits, at some stages, they are taxed at 100%. This is a higher marginal tax rate than the 50% rate of income tax for high earners. Even then the high earners are likely to evade that by packaging their income as capital, possibly as part of a pension.\nIt is not acceptable that the poor have such higher marginal tax rates than the rich.\nThere should be an ongoing programme to assess effective marginal taxation rates to ensure that the poorer are effectively taxed at a progressively lower marginal rate with increasing poverty.",
