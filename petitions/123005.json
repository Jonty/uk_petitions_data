The Council issued a new sentencing guideline on sexual offences effective from April 2014, following full public consultation.  As well as physical harm, the approach in the new guideline reflects more fully the psychological and longer term effects on the victim, enabling courts to take into account the true extent of what the victim has been through.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Justice",
            "summary": "The most serious offences have severe maximum penalties, including an automatic life sentence for anyone convicted of a second very serious sexual offence. ",
