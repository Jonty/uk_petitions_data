        "action": "Make government responses to petitions more productive.",
        "additional_details": "Given that a petition gains the appropriate number of signatures to be responded to, it is clear that a large number of people disagree that the government has made the right decision, and reiterating this statement without any due consideration for why or where the concerns are coming from defeats the object of having this platform for petitions. \r\nConcerns must be understood and responded to with possible courses of action to improve the situation brought to attention by the petitions.",
        "background": "The responses to petitions started online more often than not simply sustain that \"the government is confident it has made the right decision.\" This is hugely counter-productive in easing the public's concerns over government actions.",
