        "action": "Remove or greatly increase the petition character limit, currently capped at 880",
        "additional_details": "Many members of the public are informed on an extensive variety of subjects, ranging from obscure and niche, to popular and general interest. These people are ideally suited to approach the government via petition, to better educate the public and government alike. However, current character limitations means only small fragments of their expertise can be represented. Given the government's latitude in ability to respond to these petitions, the public should be granted similar levels of freedom.",
        "background": "The current character limit in petition descriptions is too small to include a highly meaningful body of evidence, argument, and other relevant information. Governmental ability to reply to petitions is notably unencumbered. People should be able to engage in responsive dialogue with the government.",
