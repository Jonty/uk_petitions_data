        "additional_details": "We are especially aggrieved at the promises of an extra \u00a3350m a week for the NHS and a reduction in immigration from the EU. Both were retracted the morning of the result, so we believe the leave campaign should have reasonably been aware of their illegitimacy, and by withholding this information from us they deprived us of our right to make an informed vote.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I, along with the 1st 5 signatories, voted remain, but we started this petition on behalf of others who didn't & regret it.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, voted to leave the EU based on what we now know to be spurious and misleading promises made by the leave campaign. We now deeply regret our vote. \r\n\r\nHad we been aware of the true facts and economic consequences at the time of voting, we would have voted to remain.",
