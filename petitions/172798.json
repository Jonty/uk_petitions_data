        "background": "A ban on gay men donating blood was brought in across the UK during the Aids/HIV crisis in the 1980s, but was lifted in November 2011.\r\n\r\nDonor deferral for men who have sex with men was changed from lifetime to 12 months but a 12-month ban was kept for men who are sexually active.\r\n",
