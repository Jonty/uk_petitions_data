        "additional_details": "Personally I find that calling 2 mbs download and 0.5 mbs upload to be a joke and false advertising from ISPs. Fiber-optic Internet must be made more widely available or Britain will fall further behind the rest of the developed world for Internet connectivity.",
        "background": "For many people in rural areas the speed of their Internet connection can be very limiting. From trying to play a game online or watching a film to working from home or uploading school work, many actions that people living in towns and cities take for granted can be impossible in more rural areas.",
