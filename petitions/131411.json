        "action": "Stop Government using advertising on Gov sites to promote  'Remain in Europe '.",
        "additional_details": "The Government can only issue facts not suppositions or concocted figures to support their views in trying to influence the outcome of the vote. They tried on 9th September 2015 to change the rules specifically for the referendum but were defeated. Certain Gov't members/supporters of the Remain campaign are using any and every method possible to influence the electorate to vote to remain.\r\nThis is a serious breach of existing Rules and must result in immediate removal from office.",
        "background": "Their action falls under Purdah rules which prohibit Ministers, Departments and local authorities from publishing any promotional material arguing for, or against any particular outcome or any of the issues involved in the Referendum. The Government know the 28 day rule but intend to 'flaunt it' !",
