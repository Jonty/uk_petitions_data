        "additional_details": "Britons have enjoyed the rights of EU citizenship for 23 years, younger Britons from birth. We respectfully remind MPs that 48% of voters chose to remain in the EU with all the freedoms thus conferred. Many young Britons, to whom EU citizenship offered the most for the longest, were denied a vote and are angry at the outcome. It is clear, therefore, that a majority of UK citizens wish to see these rights maintained and that MPs have a duty to represent our wishes and protect our freedom. ",
        "background": "We urge MPs to protect the rights granted to Britons under the Treaty of European Union, Article 8, \"the freedom to move freely and reside anywhere within the [EU] member states\" Our rights must not be rescinded nor our freedom lessened. Any treaty between the UK and EU must guarantee these rights.",
