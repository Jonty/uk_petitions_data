        "additional_details": "The speed at which the NHS is being placed into private hands is steadily increasing with more  contracts going to private providers, even when the NHS contracts  cost less for the same services. The money to pay those private companies comes from public money which should be going to the support of the NHS.  By placing the NHS completely in the public hands, Where we are given the ability to make decisions on what happens to our Health Service people would have more respect on how it is used.",
        "background": "Private companies are charging extortionate fees which are being paid for with public money.  Voters should be asked how they want their money to be to be spent or if they want to use their money to pay for high managerial positions which could pay for training for doctors and nurses.\r\n",
