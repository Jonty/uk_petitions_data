As it\u2019s a process, not a one-off event, your child may be enticed gradually to come to trust them. And the groomer may then try to isolate and control them. Apps like these should be regulated and seek age verification to join. Eg Credit / debit cards",

These sites such as tinder have no age verification process. 29% of children do not know who they are talking to online.",
