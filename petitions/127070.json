        "additional_details": "Student nurses often work 37.5 hrs unsocial a week, as well as having to completing assignments. This then makes it difficult for student to work to financially support themselves and as well there children and families through their education. With having to apply for maintenance loans to support standard living  the total amount owing at the end of their course can exceed \u00a354,000.00 with interest on top. ",
        "background": "Since the conservative party have announced to scrap the NHS funding tuition fees and bursaries, it is only fair that they should introduce the standard living wage for student nurses whilst on placements in trust to prevent financial burden placed on them by entering training.
