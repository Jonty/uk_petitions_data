        "additional_details": "There is evidence that the young adults who grow up the most rebellious are the ones who have had a really strict upbringing where they weren't allowed much freedom. I believe this is the same with alcohol, withholding it will only make them want it more.If your old enough to drive a car you should be old enough to drink alcohol. Driving a car is a risk to other people lives on a daily basis however, alcohol only involves the person who drinks it.",
        "background": "I think that there a lot of underage drinkers who are heavily drinking out of control because they aren't legal to do it. I think this is more harmful then beneficial if they are legally allowed to drink alcohol they won't feel that drinking alcohol is a big deal preventing them breaking the law. ",
