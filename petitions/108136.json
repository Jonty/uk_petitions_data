        "additional_details": "Latest example being the engine fire of British Airways flight at Las Vegas Airport, various photographs and video of passengers on the runway with one or more carry on suitcases in their possession which should not have been brought off the aircraft during the emergency evacuation process. A minimum fine of \u00a325,000 if no fatalities but up to ten years in prison in the event of any deaths reasonably attributed to delayed evacuation due to luggage unloading.",
        "background": "During a number of recent passenger aircraft emergency evacuations a significant number of passengers have been seen and filmed taking their luggage with them. This causes potentially life threatening delays in the evacuation process and should be treated as a crime for public endangerment.",
