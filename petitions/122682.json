        "action": "Pay nurses the living wage when on placement",
        "additional_details": "On placement I was an active member of the nursing team, I believe student nurses should be paid for their efforts. I receive a bursary which just about covers my expenses. This includes the travel expenses to get to my placement that I pay out of my own pocket as I am unable to claim anything back. Student nursing courses are much like apprenticeships but with more responsibility and duties, bearing this in mind students should receive a living wage for their services.",
        "background": "I left a well paid job with good prospects to pursue my ambition of becoming a nurse. Before Christmas I worked for a month between placement and a part time job waitressing with no days off. I recently had to leave my job due to ill health and I struggle with the cost of living as do many others.",
