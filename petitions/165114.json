        "action": "Intervene and facilitate entry of UNHRC into India-occupied Kashmir",
        "additional_details": "Refusal to allow a UNHRC visit comes at a time when the Indian state stands accused of using disproportionate force to crush protests. To date, military-occupied Kashmir has seen over 70000 killings, 8000+ enforced disappearances & countless cases of torture & sexual violence. The Indian state has given impunity to its armed forces so as to protect them from prosecution for international crimes, including war crimes. The state stands in violation of its own laws as well as international laws.",
        "background": "On 17/08/16, the UNHRC stated that it 'could only assume the worst' following the failure of the Indian authorities to grant its office access to Kashmir. Recently, thousands of civilians have been injured by armed forces during continuing protests across the region. Death toll now exceeds 60.",
