        "action": "Provide enough basic winter shelters for rough sleepers in all British cities",
        "additional_details": "We call upon the government to take immediate action to provide basic winter shelters for rough sleepers to prevent deaths from hypothermia and illness.  People may become homeless because of family break up, mental health issues combined with cuts in services, benefit sanctions and cuts, lack of affordable housing, addictions and for other reasons.  This could happen to any person.  The government should provide enough basic shelters in winter so no one freezes to death in 21st Century Britain.",
        "background": "The number of rough sleepers has increased in recent years with not enough affordable housing or mental health services and more benefit sanctions and cuts.  In winter the situation is life threatening for them. Our country is rich enough to provide basic winter shelters for these vulnerable people.",
