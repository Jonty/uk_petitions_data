        "additional_details": "Though the the real problem is greed and corruption, but the global warming is reaching a threatening level now as we all know! The debate about climate change mindfully plays into the assumption that CO2 produced by burning fossil fuels is causing the warming. That's true. And if we need to deal with that, we have to be timely. It is a safe, low cost solution to start using Nuclear power plants to prevent ten thou tons of nasty fission products from destroying our earth. Government must help.",
        "background": "Through a well-constructed nuclear power plant programmed to run with free charging points nationally, we can reduce carbon output by 70% in 15 years. Government must just take action as soon as it can. ",
