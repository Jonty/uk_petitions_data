        "action": "Make CCTV mandatory in the UK\u2019s equine slaughterhouses",
        "additional_details": "Sending a horse to slaughter may not be the preferred choice for most horse owners, but World Horse Welfare believes it is essential that this remains an available option, as other methods of ending a horse\u2019s life can be unaffordable for some horse owners. However 72% of horse owners we asked said they did not have confidence horse welfare would be protected throughout the slaughter process, but around 50% said that the implementation of CCTV would make it a more acceptable option. ",
        "background": "We want to ensure that the whole slaughter process is made transparent through the mandatory use of CCTV or other recording technology in all UK equine slaughterhouses which is accessible and checked by the relevant authorities, such as the Food Standards Agency, to support their monitoring efforts.",
