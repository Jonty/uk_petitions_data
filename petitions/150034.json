        "additional_details": "We, your country Men and Women who voted to leave the EU call upon HM Government to implement Article 50 as promised by David Cameron in February should a \u2018Leave\u2019 European Referendum vote be successful.\r\nThis great democratic conglomerate of countries has voted to separate from Europe.\r\nNow more than any other time in our history, we need faith in our leaders. Please confirm this by being strong and following the will of the people who vote.\r\n",
        "background": "The voters who signed this petition are particularly panicked that Mr Cameron, in a last ditch attempt to delay this \u2018Pushing of the button\u2019 has bought some time with a view to somehow managing a re-negotiation with the Eu or even worse, completely overturning the democratic decision to leave.\r\n",
