        "additional_details": "Also why is it that in Sheffield only people from our area are going to be affected? People on benefits are in financial difficulty already and can easily walk to their local jobcentre to attend appointments and now only we are going to have to travel by public transport at additional costs to ourselves. I believed that we all had equal rights in this country and all should be treated the same so why only close the one office. Once again the government in this country treat us like a statistic.",
        "background": "The S2 area of Sheffield is full of vulnerable people, the support that is provided from the staff in this building is very positive.\r\nIve attended other jobcentres in the past but they have no connection with the area or the people in it. Eastern Avenue helps you feel like your not just a statistic",
