A term will last 4 years. \r\n\r\nThe House of Lords would also face an election at a regional level, with two people from each regional, similar to the senate in America, a term will last 4 years with a vote every 2 years. To be eligible you must have served as a local councillor for 10 years as a minimum, or served a term as an MP.",
        "background": "In 2020, I believe that someone who wishes to be elected as PM should be nominated. Those nominated would then face selection by the commons. Following this 5 candidates plus the previous PM would face a public election under the voting system \"First-past-the-post\". A term will last 4 years. ",
