        "action": "Revoke the peerage awarded to Michelle Mone as it is without merit.",
        "additional_details": "Ms Mone's peerage award is based on the premise that she is a successful entrepreneur, a model to others in the 'rags to riches' sense.\r\n\r\nThis logic, whilst plausible, is deeply flawed, as Ms Mone's enterprises have been anything but successful, and, in fact, are deeply indebted (see for example company SC169601) and have had only limited success.\r\n\r\nMs Mone is widely reported to have used EBTs (http://bit.ly/1LEbi70) to avoid paying tax in this country, therefore is surely not appropriate as a model for others.",
        "background": "Ms Michelle Mone MBE was awarded a peerage in the Dissolution Honours list (nominated by the Conservatives), however, there appears to be little reason for this, other than Ms Mone's very vocal support for the \"Better Together\" campaign in the 2014 Scotland Independence Referendum.",
