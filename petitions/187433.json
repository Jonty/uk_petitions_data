        "additional_details": "Sheffield City and Diocese have a proud record on justice and equality. Inequality that would be introduced through Bishop North accepting the nomination to the See would have profound, disturbing ramifications for the Church of England's public witness in the region, and for pastoral oversight of female clergy in the Diocese.\r\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/24/new-bishop-sheffield-opponent-female-priests-urged-decline\r\nhttp://modernchurch.org.uk/news-blog/bishop-north-resignation",
        "background": "Bishop North\u2019s opposition to women's ordination means he does not accept ordained ministry of female clergy, or any male ordained by a female bishop. Women account for 1/3 of clergy in Sheffield diocese. A non-ordaining Bishop of Sheffield is a serious matter for female clergy in such large numbers.",
