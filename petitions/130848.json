        "additional_details": "I am head of Geography and Citizenship at South Wirral High School and for the past 4 years we have held a \"Hillsborough day\" for year 10. The day includes 4 key lessons: the truth, the fight for justice, the role of the media and the legacy on football. The day has been so well received by year 10. I want every child in the country to learn the truth about the events that day so that no child grows up with misconceptions about Hillsborough. Importantly, I want the legacy of the 96 to live on.",
        "background": "In 1989, 96 Liverpool fans were unlawfully killed at Hillsborough during the FA Cup Semi Final. There are 1000s of school children today that have little knowledge about the disaster. I propose that it should be included in the National Curriculum at key stages 3 and 4.",
