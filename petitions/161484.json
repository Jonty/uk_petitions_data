        "additional_details": "Too often the 18-24 year old demographic has amongst the lowest turnout in elections and referendums. The importance of voting cannot be overstated, yet there is little information on the process and importance of participating in democracy for young adults. Should 16 year olds be able to register to vote in their final year of secondary education they will have two years to learn about our democracy and consider their views, before being eligible to vote at 18.",

The importance of taking part in democracy and voting cannot be stressed enough, yet information and education on the importance of voting is minimal.",
