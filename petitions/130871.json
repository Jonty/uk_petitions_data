As a small business sole trader I became a victim of fraud losing \u00a34271.39 to a supplier in Holland.\r\n\r\nI wrote to Action fraud, the British police, the Dutch police, the Dutch embassy in London still no one can help, I went to the citizen advice, and even my MP tried to help but dead end. I believe banks should consider and realise how small businesses are affected by fraudsters and chargeback accordingly to exceptional circumstances. It is unbelievable that in such according to my experience no one is helping.",
