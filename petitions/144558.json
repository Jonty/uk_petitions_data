        "additional_details": "Paedophilia, parallels genocide as one of the most vile acts committed against the most vulnerable. It is our duty to protect children from all levels of harm. The present legal system of a few years to life in prison for pedophiles, fails completely to protect children. The soft penalty of prison, does nothing to deter offenders and entices paedophiles released from prison to offend again, and again and again. Hanging paedophiles will make them think twice before harming children.",
        "background": "The European Convention of Human Rights has interfered with the rights of British children to be protected from the most depraved individuals infesting our society. The death penalty should be instated against all pedophiles, as the ultimate deterrent and the ultimate protection for our children.",
