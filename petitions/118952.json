        "action": "Make the IPCC have civilians heading investigations with zero ties to the police",
        "additional_details": "It cannot be argued that a supposedly independent review branch investigating the police for misconduct, that is run and headed by ex officers, is not going to be biased towards the average citizen, therefore officers that perform misconduct are more likely to be getting away with crimes that average citizens would be locked away for. We cannot allow the system to hold one standard for its citizens and another for its protectors, this petition would balance the scales. ",
        "background": "The IPCC is a police complaints review branch, the problem is that the branch is run by ex-police officers with ties to the service and therefore loyalty to the service. The complaints are therefore looked upon from a bias eye, consciously or unconsciously. ",
