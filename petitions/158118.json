        "action": "To force councils to invest revenue from parking fines into parking facilities",
        "additional_details": " Councils should be forced to invest the large majority of these funds into parking solutions/facilities i.e. underground car parks in densely populated cities and towns, or road improvements where parking improvements are not feasible.\r\n\r\nAny improvements should reflect the requirement for resident, business and visitor parking.",
        "background": "It is a well known fact that parking fines generate huge profits for local councils, c.\u00a3600million+, but there is no action or interest in reducing the number of parking fines issued to motorists, as this is viewed as a profit generator for all local councils alike",
