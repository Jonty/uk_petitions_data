        "additional_details": "Examples of the clear and knowing deceit involved, include the use of statistics that the Leave Campaign knew to be wrong, including the exaggerated cost of the U.K's membership of the EU. It also fraudulently used company Logos, including that of Nissan, and the names of famous celebrities, to falsely claim their support. The Leave campaign continued with this deceit despite being instructed to correct matters by the Office of National Statistics and the companies and celebrities involved. ",
        "background": "During the referendum on the UK's membership of the EU, the Leave Campaign knowingly lied to and misled the public resulting in a flawed outcome. Such deceit must not be allowed to succeed. Leaving the EU is likely to lead to the breakup of the U.K., something the public would never have voted for.",
