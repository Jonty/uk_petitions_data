This is known as a Sure Start Maternity Grant.\r\n\r\nYou usually qualify for the grant if you\u2019re expecting your first child - or you\u2019re expecting a multiple birth (eg twins) and have children already and you already get certain benefits.\r\n\r\nThis penalises those that have multiples but aren't on benefits - let's change it!",
        "background": "My twins were born on 5th August 2015 and I have recently received a rejection letter for this grant. Why? Because I don't recieve benefits. \r\n\r\nLet's change this and help the hardworking people that have multiples, regardless of their income. ",
