        "action": "Please confirm that the key public EU referendum information was misleading.",
        "additional_details": "We believe that a good democracy should not deliberately misinform its people. We assert that the referendum result was based on very misleading information to voters. We believe that the Government now has a pressing duty to inform people honestly, accessibly and assessably about the implications of both staying and leaving the EU. Please do not place any emphasis on a referendum result where voters were significantly misinformed by lead campaigners who have all now stepped back.",
        "background": "The main slogan about \u00a3350 million extra for the NHS every week was wrong. The claim that we are likely to have total immigration control if we leave but continue to have access to the EU single market was unrealistic. The cost of leaving to every household of \u00a34,300 each year could not be known.",
