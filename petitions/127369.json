        "additional_details": "This is not a personal issue with the current royal family, but the idea that one single person can create and abolish laws and even declare war at the click of a finger seems incredibly counter-productive. Revolution saw the end of the French Monarchy, but we have come a long way since then, and a public vote would be far more efficient. Hereditary public office is contrary to democracy, and should therefore be voted on. The people have opened their eyes and are beginning to adjust to the light",
        "background": "Progress has come a long way during our existence, which is why it is still odd that we, mere subjects, are still ruled by one family that have been born into wealth and elitism. We elect a government, but bow down to the monarchy. I would like to call a democratic vote for sovereignty reform.",
