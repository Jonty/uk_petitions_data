        "action": "Stop conversion of all state schools to academies",
        "additional_details": "The task is massive and government resources could be better directed as 95% of primary schools are currently under state control so would be forced to switch to academies and currently 82% of state schools are rated good. \r\nIt will also led to an increase in the number of unqualified teachers. Teaching is a difficult job, this will also push more stress an workload on to teachers, in deciding the curriculum and to be the best in the area.",
        "background": "This will affect all state schools both primary and secondary. There is no evidence it improves education some schools do,some stay the same and some get worse as academies.It will mean children's education will differ as schools are not required to follow the national curriculum.",
