        "action": "Remove the blanket ban on term time holidays.",
        "additional_details": "93% of all school absence is a result of truancy and only 7% of all school absences are a result of a family taking a term time holiday. Term time holidays are often the only time a lower earning income family can afford to go on holiday. If schools need to avoid holidays during a particular term due to assessments, then they are advise parents that these terms no such absences are permitted. The systems needs more flexibility to meet the needs of a modern working family.",
        "background": "Rather than banning pupils from authorised term time absence, head teachers should exercise discretion. Wales has removed this conflicting ban and Westminster should seriously reconsider and repeal the ban.",
