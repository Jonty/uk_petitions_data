        "action": "Demand that the British Government refuses to pay the \u00a352bn EU 'divorce fee'",
        "additional_details": "The financial sum requested has no sound, reasonable nor logical basis. No legislation exists to justify or legalise the request made, nor allow it to delay Britains departure from the European Union or scupper upcoming negotiations. The British people wish to make it clear that they understand this to be a provocative act that serves no purpose but to illegally punish the U.K. for acting on the will of the people in leaving a Union which they believe to be corrupt and undemocratic. ",
        "background": "On June 23rd, the citizens of the UK voted in a democratically-compliant referendum to leave the European Union. We propose that the subsequent exit fee charged by the EU is nothing more than a revengeful ransom note with no legal standing,and that any demands of payment should be refused/ignored",
