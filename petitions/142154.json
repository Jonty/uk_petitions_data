        "additional_details": "EU residents are net contributors to the UK economy and represent a crucial asset for the sustainable development of this country. Giving voting rights to EU residents who have lived in the UK for 5 years or more would mean the recognition of a fair right and would allow EU residents to have their say on topics that have a direct impact on their lives (such as the recent EU referendum)",
        "background": "EU residents, who have lived in the UK for 5 years or more, have the right to get UK citizenship. However many people do not exercise this option for various reasons and, consequently, they do not have the right to vote. Brexit referendum has shown risks deriving from the lack of this voting right",
