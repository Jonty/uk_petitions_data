        "additional_details": "This matter has been raised through the media and there are many accounts of people giving up pets in order to find somewhere to live. It is not acceptable to give up animals considered as family members. The situation is so bad that there are dedicated websites for 'pet friendly' rentals, but no properties are available in certain areas of the UK which sometimes includes whole counties such as Surrey and Hampshire.",
        "background": "In a country which professes to be a nation of animal lovers, pet owners looking for houses to rent are being forced to give up their animals in order to find somewhere to live.  Estate agents do not earn their expensive fees by trying to negotiate for pets. This situation is completely unfair.",
