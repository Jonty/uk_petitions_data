        "action": "To end linear A-levels and reinstate AS examinations",
        "additional_details": "A-levels are becoming a linear two-year course which means that students must study the course for a full two years and AS-level will no longer count towards the final A-level grade. The nature of this change is to make A-levels tougher, despite the fact that A-level exams are already an important and very stressful part of a student's life. The House of Lords agreed that students should have a vote as this affects students everywhere; however, this was declined, denying us the chance to oppose.",
        "background": "A-levels are a very important part of a college student's life. It is already very hard and sitting Linear A-level exams at the end of two years is more like a memory test rather than testing a student\u2019s abilities. Linear A-levels have already been used in the past and have not worked out very well.",
