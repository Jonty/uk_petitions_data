After challenging the CMS, they ADMITTED I had \u00a31,050 in their holding account.I requested repeatedly that they release it,but they did not.I CONTINUED to receive correspondence claiming they had not received my money, despite them admitting it was in their holding acc.My local MP eventually had to step in on my behalf.\r\n",
