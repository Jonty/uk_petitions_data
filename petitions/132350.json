        "action": "Remove ethics questions from science exams at all levels of education.",
        "additional_details": "Psychopaths are a relatively large minority in the UK, which means that a significant quantity of students are completely unable to answer questions regarding ethics through no fault fo their own. I feel that this is discrimination against certain people and should be changed to give them a fair chance at an exam just like anybody else. Exams are vital to success in later life and being put at a disadvantage just because the exam board doesn't consider everyone is very unfair in my opinion.",
        "background": "For most people ethics are easy, but for psychopaths they are often an ungraspable concept. This does not make them evil, most psychopaths are just disadvantaged and live peacefully otherwise. However, I feel it is unfair to put a minority at such a disadvantage purely because of how they were born.",
