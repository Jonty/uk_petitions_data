        "additional_details": "HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) plans to close 90% of its offices; and cut 9,000 more jobs by 2021\r\nHMRC refuse to acknowledge the organisational impact of leaving the EU, saying it doesn\u2019t change their closure plans. This threatens HMRC's future ability to collect the taxes which provide for the funding for essential services including defence, education, healthcare, policing and welfare\r\nHMRC has already closed its office in Newry, which stands on what will be the UK's only land border with the EU",
        "background": "Leaving the EU will have a major impact on the work done by HMRC; particularly VAT, Customs and International Trade. \r\nWe call on HMRC to suspend its plans to close offices and cut jobs, until Parliament agrees the functions HMRC will need to undertake following the decision to leave the EU.",
