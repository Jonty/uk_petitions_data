She fell and hit her head. She had a seizure and 2 different types of bleed in her brain. She has since been intubated and put into a drug induced coma in order for her to recover from surgery. \r\nWe want a law to be put in place that prevents other families being affected by this situation, one that was so easily preventable. \r\n",

All this was preventable, if she had worn a safety helmet, she would have escaped with maybe a few bruises or, at worst maybe a broken wrist! ",
