        "action": "Petition for David Cameron to REMAIN leader of the conservative party",
        "additional_details": "He presents himself as an honourable and dignified man, an inspiring leader and a commanding world statesman.  He has the ability and experience to negotiate with the European leaders to give the UK the best trading deals and a new immigration policy.  He is well respected by world leaders outside the EU and is in pole position to negotiate new trading treaties between the EU and their respective countries. An alternative new leader does not have his experience and has not been elected.  ",
        "background": "Despite David Cameron voting to REMAIN and losing to the LEAVE voters and now choosing to LEAVE, this petition is for him to REMAIN.  This is because he is the best person to lead the conservative party until the end of his second term. ",
