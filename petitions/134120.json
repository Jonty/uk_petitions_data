        "action": "Hold a second, and if necessary, third EU Referendum for a best-of-three vote.",
        "additional_details": "This is a big decision for our country. The results of the first EU referendum to decide whether or not we should remain within the European Union have already affected our nation in significant ways, most notable of which being the value of the pound, and that decision should not be left for a singular vote.\r\n\r\nIf a second vote were to happen, and the results declared the same, then no more referendums would be necessary and such a decision taken forward.",
        "background": "With the EU Referendum results having been announced, there is a clear divide between the country, a result bordering a tie with less than a two-percent margin. \r\nThose undersigned believe that a second vote should be held, to confirm the wishes of the British people, with a third vote if necessary.",
