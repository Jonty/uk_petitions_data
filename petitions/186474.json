        "additional_details": "The sheer lack of contact from the DWP regarding payments and other information has been horrible for over two months. By law it says stated on previous jobcenter letters that you must live off (x) amount of money per week meaning they are breaking there own law during the process. Going 6 weeks without any income and it dose not get backdated. For two months I've gone with hardly any food' barely able to eat' no gas hardly any electric. Rent and other bills also in arrears due to this system",
        "background": "I'm a young male who's gone two months without any income due to the new universal credit system. I've heard nothing regarding payments and been attending jobcenter interviews. I would like the government to switch back to the Jobseekres system and fully scrap the new universal credit system",
