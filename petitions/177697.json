If you\u2019re 68 or over when you become resident, you can drive for 3 years. After this time you must exchange your licence.\r\n\r\nPeople from European countries outside the EU can't exchange their licence unless they come from a country with a specific arrangement with the UK. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition asking for a specific change to the rules for exchanging driving licences.
