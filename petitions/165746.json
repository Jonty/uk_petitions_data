While GICs are currently working towards reducing waiting times, the entire process is broken.\r\n\r\nBy signing this petition, we are asking the government to:\r\n\r\n- Pledge more funds towards trans health care to address admin problems.\r\n- Prioritise the work of the Equalities Office to address the harm that GICs are doing.\r\n- Anything else that can be done to address the lack of NICE guidelines for treating gender dysphoria and means of treatment.\r\n",
        "background": "In July 2016, I polled 100 transgender people and 60% reported their experience at a gender identity clinic (GIC) was detrimental to their mental health. \r\n\r\nThe process of proving the validity of your gender in order to receive treatment harms individuals and it must be changed.\r\n",
