        "action": "Implement a 20% tariff on all goods imported from the United States of America",
        "additional_details": "This petition is to ask the house to debate the imposition of a similarly punitive trade tariff as that which President Trump wishes to impose on Mexico. The whole world needs to stand up to bullies and the UK should lead by example.\r\n\r\nThe last time the world appeased a bully, 80 years ago, it didn't end well.",
        "background": "After a row over who would pay for a wall between the USA & Mexico, a bilateral summit between the two nations was cancelled by the Mexican president.\r\nIn response, President Trump now seeks to impose a 20% tariff on all Mexican goods.\r\nIn response the UK should impose a similar penalty on the USA.",
