        "additional_details": "Our Prime Minister, Theresa May, is one of the few individuals in the world with the power to change this, with the complex economic relationship between us and the US. However, she has endorsed these disgusting changes. So we ask you, Theresa May, to speak out against all of Trump's radical and brutal laws, and put pressure on the US to change them.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Donald Trump has passed an immigration ban on ALL immigration from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. This includes not only refugees but those who have the right to live and work in the US. This is wrong.\r\n\r\nTheresa May, you must put pressure on the US to end this. ",
