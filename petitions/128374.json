The guidelines need to be changed. Once a women has had a child, cervical screening should take place and if a women presents with symptoms and a gp warrants it, they should be allowed to proceed with a smear test without it being refused by a lab. ",

After a year of doctors appointments and referrals and a smear test being done but refused by the lab I was finally given one to which it has found I have cervical cancer and am awaiting treatment.",
