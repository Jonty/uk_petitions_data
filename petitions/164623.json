        "additional_details": "On June 23rd 2016 a referendum took place where the United Kingdom voted to Leave the European Union.\r\n\r\nEver since the referendum results were announced, the \"Remain\" campaign have tried to stall and derail Article 50 from being triggered - with the most recent attempt by Sadiq Khan.\r\n\r\nThis is NOT acceptable. The Nation voted to \"Leave\" and the Government should be held accountable by triggering Article 50 immediately. No further staling tactics should be tolerated by Sadiq Khan or anyone else.\r\n",
        "background": "Sadiq Khan is seeking to put off triggering Article 50 until the French and German elections have been held. \r\n\r\nThis is another staling tactic by the \"Remain\" campaign to stop Article 50 from being triggered. The Government should trigger Article 50 immediately with no further staling.",
