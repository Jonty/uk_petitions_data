        "additional_details": "Countries such as Germany who use an opt in organ donation system only have consent rates of 12% among its population, whereas Austria, which is very similar culturally and economically to Germany, has a consent rate of 99.98% among its population due to its opt out organ donation system. We'd like to emulate these impressive statistics in the UK in the hope that it will mean more organs for those who desperately need them. ",
        "background": "In December 2015, Wales initiated an opt out system for organ donation, meaning that anyone in the country is automatically put on the organ donation list unless they specifically opt out. This leads to a far larger pool of potential donors, meaning there are more available for transplant.",
