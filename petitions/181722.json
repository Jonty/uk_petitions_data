        "additional_details": "Everyone's needed to walk past someone smoking in public and needing to hold their breath to avoid inhaling the toxic fumes. Every year, second-hand smoke kills thousands of people in the UK from lung cancer, heart disease, strokes and the lung disease COPD. Second-hand smoke has been linked to around 165,000 new cases of disease among children in the UK each year. Passive smoking may also increase the risk of cancers of the larynx and pharynx.",
        "background": "Smoking is a choice and no-one should be punished for the choices of another. Smoking should be made illegal in public areas to assist non-smokers who do not wish to be in contact with the toxic fumes of second-hand smoke.",
