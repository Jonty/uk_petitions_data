        "additional_details": "It is important that individuals have a choice to decide whether they want to use animal products or not. If individuals choose not to use animal products, this choice must be respected. Unlike most other animal products, which can be avoided quite easily by individuals who wish to do so, currency notes cannot be avoided easily. Therefore, it is requested that you support this petition, to ensure English currency notes in circulation are made Tallow free & Vegan friendly as soon as possible. ",
        "background": "Recently, the Bank of England confirmed that the new English \u00a35 note contains 'Tallow', a substance made from animal fat. This has caused concern among vegans as well as those following Hinduism, as it is harder to avoid currency notes, unlike most other animal products which could be avoided.",
