        "additional_details": "I feel a more fair systerm should be in place. Low level offenders who have not ever served a custodial sentance should be able to move past their mistakes and not have a lack of judgement follow them for life. I propose if an offender does not re-offend between the ages of 18-21 by the time they are 21 other then DNA and fingerprints no record should be held about the young person in regards to arrests and convictions.",
        "background": "I believe it's unfair to hold mistakes people make as a minor/juvenile to stay with them for the rest of their life. The DBS filtering systerm is simply not good enough, they have been judged already lets not keep judging them 20 years later.",
