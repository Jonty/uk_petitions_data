        "additional_details": "PCOS alone affects 1/10 women world wide and can be recognised through the pubescent stage. Yet schools are not teaching children things they should be noticing in their body - How to spot early menopause? Erectile dysfunction? PCOS? Any other conditions? Children are taught every day about sexting, safe sex, and staying safe online. What about what is happening to their bodies biologically? This information is just as important to keep children safe and healthy, not only now but into adulthood.",
        "background": "Sex education should not just be about sex, STI's and pregnancy.\r\nOur children should be aware of signs of infertility and other conditions, how to seek help and deal with them.\r\nThese conditions can affect children of any age, and we need to give them as much knowledge and support on that journey.",
