It's wrong how working fathers need to pay CSA then find money to cover costs for court and legal proceedings as legal aid does not exist!",
        "background": "Fathers should be exempt from paying CSA to the child's mother. It's disgusting, Court fees and solicitor fees cost a lot and for fathers with very little income paying CSA they can't afford to go to court to see their child. Mothers using children as a weapon should be a criminal offence!",
