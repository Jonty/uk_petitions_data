        "additional_details": "16- and 17-year-olds will be greatly affected by this referendum, no matter what the outcome. Please give these adolescents the ability to voice their opinion and concerns as this vote will affect them just as much, if not more, as people over the age of 18. After the Scottish referendum, where the voting age was lowered, political interest in this generation has increased drastically, proving that younger people can understand that a referendum on this scale cannot be taken lightly.",
        "background": "16/17-year-olds should be given the ability to let their voices be heard. The youth of today are the adults of tomorrow. It's important for our country to enable adolescents to voice their opinions on important matters such as the UK's upcoming European Union referendum - give them this opportunity.",
