        "additional_details": "Cyclists are using their bikes on a public highway too, so should also be made to have this check. You can't drive a car with defective brakes and tyres ie brake pads worn down to the metal and tyres that are cracked and perished. Cracked frames, bent forks, worn out wheels (braking surface), drive parts worn out which will cause slipping and injury to the rider plus other road users as well. Cyclists quite often blame motorists, but if their bike was better maintained incident could be avoided.",
        "background": "As a bike shop owner I see bicycles that are in a shocking state! All motor vehicles have annual checks which are compulsory, bicycles are no different. Cycling is on the up and we feel that a cyclist should also be made to have a Compulsory Annual Safety Check (CASK). Cyclists use these roads too.",
