        "additional_details": "The UK has previously been free of Babesiosis, Rabies and other disease and viruses found on the continent. Its my view it should stay this way especially due to our dense population and the risk of major outbreak is high. Take foot and mouth disease as an example of just how prolific the spread of disease can be and that only affected a controlled animal population.\r\nWe have put our borders in a situation that bring much avoidable risk and has allowed easy movement of puppies and stolen pets",
        "background": "Following the recent case of babesiosis in Essex where two dogs have been destroyed I call for a review on the transportation and movement of domestic animal to and from our country.\r\nI propose that quarantine restrictions are reinstated so that disease and illness is not missed in incubation period",
