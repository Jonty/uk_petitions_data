        "additional_details": "England have a squad of top quality players. To perform as they did is wholly unacceptable. The FA in my view are to blame, the players have a manager and coaching staff who are completely out of their depth and are lead by a man who seems unduly illogical in his actions (Greg Dyke). This translates to the players who also gave nothing, absolutely nothing. From my view the only exceptions seem to be Danny Rose, Harry Kane, Joe Hart, Jamie Vardy and Adam Lallana (as well as unused players). ",
        "background": "These players have been brought up playing football and train for it everyday of their lives getting paid millions per year for it, their performance didn't show this. In my view, therefore, the player's wages should be paid to the fans that turned up to the game, unlike the England football team.",
