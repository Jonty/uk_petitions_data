        "additional_details": "History of used car warranties the injectors failed, the EGR valve failed, brake callipers have seized, the brake discs failed, the gear box was slipping and needed transmission fluid change and trani doctor added to fix it, this should have been a gearbox change, but they said it's a service issue or it's wear and tear so not covered, DPF failed, not covered, these warranties don't cover attempting to find the problem, they won't pay for trying to find the fault, these warranties are a scandal",
        "background": "These warranty claims companies offer mostly 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 star policies, the cost of the policy and coverage depends on the level of cover you purchase, whenever a claim is made, there first reply is \" that's not covered \" In most cases they refuse as it's wear and tear, well its a used car !!.",
