        "action": "Removal of the ring fence on Overseas Aid, and use that money on UK social care",
        "additional_details": "The shortfall in our own social care budget could easily be covered by reduction of overseas aid, and it would not need to have responsibly placed aid cut completely. With the rise of dementia, as people live longer, we need more money to cover the increase of pensioners affected. The baby boomer generation is now retiring and it can only increase the problem. Why give money to countries with Space and Nuclear programs, but leave our own citizens to suffer.",
        "background": "We send a vast amount of money overseas in aid, some poorly spent and wasted, while our own old and disadvantaged people are crying out for decent social care. They paid tax and NI rightly expecting dignity in their old age. We need to look to the people needing care here before looking abroad",
