        "additional_details": "Many Disabled Scooters can Not get past and so Is Discrimination against these, the Councils waste good money Dropping Kerbs at junctions when they are blocked by parking and the fact that they have to use the road to get around them, London should not be the Only City to adopt 'No Parking' as others have issues, common sense.\r\n\r\nFootpaths should be given back to the ones on Foot on Safety Grounds alone.\r\n\r\nLet's make things Equal throughout and bring some comfort to all the above.",
        "background": "It is Stupid and Outdated to have ONE city and the rest of the Country different, the same issues arise Everywhere, Parking on footpaths causes Major issues for the Disabled, Blind, Pushchairs not being able to get through, it is Bias against these, the Footpath should be as in its name for Walkers",
