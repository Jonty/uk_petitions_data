        "action": "Stop state sponsored addiction to methadone as long term cure from addiction",
        "additional_details": "the problem, say experts, is that doctors are not sufficiently educated in narcotics, and methadone is particularly complex and deadly. No two people respond to methadone in the same way, so where one patient might seem okay, another can die on the same dosage. And if it doesn\u2019t kill the patient, it can rapidly lead to dependence and wind up in a full-blown, life-altering prescription drug addiction.  methadone kills far more people than heroin ever did. it truly is STATE SPONSORED ADDICTION.",
        "background": "Methadone, which for decades has been used to replace heroin as an addiction treatment, now causes more than twice as many deaths as heroin itself, it has become more and more popular among family millionaire physicians and other health care providers who hand it out for all kinds of chronic pain.",
