        "additional_details": "Why it's unfair, at 21 after holding an A2 license for 2 years a rider can take their test for an A license where as someone that has not held a license for 2 years will have to wait till they are 24 for an A license, age for direct access should be lowered to 21.\r\nAs for the test if an A2 license has been held for 2 years a more advanced CBT for bigger bikes should be taken instead of a full test costing hundreds of pounds more. There is not much difference in size and weight with A2 and A bikes",
        "background": "The current laws for gaining a motorcycle license are unfair and deters people from gaining a full license.\r\nDirect access test for an A license should also be changed if an A2 license has been held for 2 years, a simple CBT for bigger bikes should be taken instead of another full test.",
