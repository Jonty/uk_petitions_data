        "action": "Bring licensing back for dogs and cats UK. A cost of \u00a31 per year per animal.",
        "additional_details": "All registrations would begin on 6th April, and must be renewed by 31 March, every year. Each registered dog or cat must wear a tag specifying the council, registration expiry date, and registration number of the dog, with the colour of the tag changing every year for easy identification .  Fees for working dogs (herding dogs, police dogs, drug dogs, etc.) are generally lower than for pets, and seeing-eye or hearing-ear dogs would be  free or minimal cost to register.",
        "background": "Dog licensing was abolished in 1984, in most countries it is mandatory to have a license for an animal you own. It is like registering a car to the legal owner. If an animal was to stray or get run over alongside the new microchipping laws, there would be a greater chance of getting a pet back home.",
