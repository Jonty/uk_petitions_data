        "action": "Provide legislation to maintain the same level of weekly waste uplift everywhere",
        "additional_details": "Aim of this petiiton is to provide legislation to maintain the same level of weekly waste uplift in each area (I.e if an area was originally green bin only at 140l weekly and then becomes 2/3 weekly still at 140l the council must provide other recycling bins that add up to the same total of 140l a week) So a 2 weekly collection would be 2 bins at 140l (one recycling, one not) 3 weekly would be 3 140l or 1 140l and 1 280l.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Argyll and Bute are cutting green bin waste collections by a third in Kintyre without providing a safe, secure or easily accesible alternative which has lead to feelings of insecurity, people buying bins out of their own pocket when they already pay council tax.",
