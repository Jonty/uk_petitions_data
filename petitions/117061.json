        "additional_details": "Instead of ploughing money into the HS2 rail link, the funds would be much better spent on building strong flood defences in the affected areas. Not only would this end the indescribable misery for these towns and villages, it would also bring great economic benefits and security to them.",
        "background": "The communities of Cumbria, Lancashire and Yorkshire are really suffering at the moment because of the flooding. The existing flood defences are insufficient and, unless these defences are considerably strengthened, the misery of flooding will keep re-occurring for these communities. \r\n",
