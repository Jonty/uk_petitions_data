        "additional_details": "Since the introduction of employment tribunal fees the number of disputes proceeding to the tribunal has collapsed by over 60%, that means that potentially any hundreds of legitimate cases are not been brought.\r\n\r\nBy changing the tribunal system into a tiered system would add flexibility and cost savings to proceedings. More complex cases need the time and costs to properly review and defend.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.michaellewin.co.uk/news/employment-news/time-to-overhaul-employment-tribunals/",
        "background": "Michael Lewin Solicitors agree with the Law Society that the Employment Tribunal system should be broken down into a fairer system of four levels so that simpler cases are quicker and cheaper to bring by individuals; whilst more complex cases should be handled by more experienced judges.
