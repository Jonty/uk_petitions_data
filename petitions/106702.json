Someone who worked from 16 and is now 22 has more experience than a 40 year old housewife who is now in her first job.\r\n\r\nSome people say that older people deserve more because they might have more responsibilities, but that isn't always true.\r\n\r\nYou should be paid on the work you do, not your year of birth.",
        "background": "The current age bands are under 18, 18-20 and 21 and over.\r\nIn 2016 it is planned to introduce a 'living wage'.  These plans are to affect over 25's only.\r\n\r\nI ask you one thing, why?\r\n\r\nWe do the same amount as work as our colleagues, we deserve the same pay!",
