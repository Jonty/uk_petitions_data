        "additional_details": "The GP surgery required a payment of \u00a330.  When questioned the Assistant Practice Manager advised that payment was in line with Government guidelines of \u00a330- 55.  Personally think this is outrageous given students now required to pay for education and this is another hidden cost to any student wanting to go to Uni (costs of which are prohibitive to most).",
        "background": "Daughter has applied to Universities who requested letter from GP regarding her health. Local surgery have insisted on a payment of \u00a330 claiming this is a NON-NHS service (apparently charges \u00a330-55). How come a 'sick note' non chargeable to adults but students need to pay for a simple letter?",
