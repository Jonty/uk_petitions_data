        "additional_details": "All school health standards should be applied to all meal servings, along with more defined legislation regarding variety and quality, especially for food served at mid-morning break. This will allow students to eat healthier options, eat a variety\u200b of food and know what they are consuming, no matter the time, is of high quality.\r\n\r\nFood served at mid-morning break includes:\r\nPizza slices\r\nBelgian Waffles - which are sprinkled in sugar\r\nDonuts\r\nPaninis\r\nBacon and cheese rolls - where there is 1cm of fat on each piece of bacon",
        "background": "Currently, at our school, the main meals are healthy, the menu varies and the quality of the produce is high, but as not all of the standards on health, quality and variety apply to break food, the same things are served every day. Fruit is there, but this is expensive and placed in a corner.\r\n",
