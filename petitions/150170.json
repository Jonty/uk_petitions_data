        "additional_details": "The percentage vote secured by the elected governments has reduced markedly since the end of WW2, with as little as 35% leading to majority government in 2005. There is also a significant trend of falling turnout in general elections, which is being ignored.

",
        "background": "The inequity in representation relative to numbers of votes cast, caused by the existing electoral system, has resulted in a deep seated mistrust of politics and general disillusionment with the democratic process. The system that provides proper democracy is one where each vote carries equal weight",
