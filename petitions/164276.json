        "additional_details": "Two weeks ago, I went on a six day visit to the camp, having taken some aid for children and others and spent time with the people in the camp. There are businesses set up by inhabitants of the camp, some semblance of normality in an abnormal situation. There are schools, cafes and drop-in centres for the young. But the French authorities seem hell-bent on destroying such necessary amenities.  It is harassment of the most vulnerable people. Give these people the right to settle in UK.",
        "background": "To ask the Home Office to issue humanitarian visas to all those in the Calais camp (and the smaller number in Dunkerque) and arrange safe transport to Britain. As a priority, the unaccompanied minors should be brought to Britain as per the Dubs amendment.",
