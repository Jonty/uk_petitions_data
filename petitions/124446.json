        "additional_details": "As a result companies like Service Dogs Europe took advantage of disabled people by offering what they thought were official service dogs to their disability and to multiple disabilities. By allowing people to owner train these companies wouldn't survive. To make sure that owner trained dogs are at ADI standards and that they help a disability it would be reasonable for the dog and owner to be assessed to minamise fake service animal. This would give many disabled people a more independant life.",
        "background": "Currently there is no official support or recognition for owner trained assistance dogs in the uk. As a result may cannot get the help they need from such animals. As charities have extremely long waiting lists or don't support a curtain disability.",
