However, there are a number of days of celebration, and others, which are associated with celebrating the constituent countries of Britain and their traditions. \r\n\r\nExisting days of celebration include, St George's Day in England, St Andrew's Day in Scotland, St David's Day in Wales and St Patrick's Day in Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nOver the years there have been various suggestions from the public for days of celebration and new bank holidays, however the current pattern is well established and accepted.  \r\n\r\nAlthough, it has been celebrated since ancient times in many locations throughout the UK, the early May Day bank holiday has only been in existence in the UK since legislation was passed in 1978. More recently it has been associated with workers\u2019 rights groups who choose to march or protest on this day to raise awareness of their causes. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Culture, Media and Sport",
