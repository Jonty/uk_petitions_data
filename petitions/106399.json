        "additional_details": "A car is damaged by a cyclists cycling without due care and attention, who has to pay for the damage? You do through your insurance which has a great affect on you. If that was a car, their insurance would pay so therefore cyclists should be treated the same and have to have insurance to cover themselves. This also means obeying the rules of the road such as stopping at red-lights and not using bus lanes.",
        "background": "Cyclists use the road on a day to day basis. If they use the road, they should have to pay for it like we do. If they crash into your car causing damage, you end up footing the cost and losing your No Claims Bonus. They should have their own insurance for using the road.",
