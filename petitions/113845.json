        "additional_details": "We, the British public have seen the devastation to people's lives all around the world that war causes.  We have also seen the damage it does to our country when we go to war under false pretenses.\r\nMinisters from all parties have agreed at various times that our involvement in Iraq played no small part in the popularity of IS and the 'War on Terror' is making things worse.\r\nWe should be given full facts to why ministers think going to war in Syria will make us safer, before a full referendum.",
        "background": "Today our PM made a case to go to war to ministers in Parliament who will go on to vote on if we use military force in Syria.\r\nIt should be the public who decides if the action is worth the risk of becoming more of a target to IS, not ministers.  It is the public who could be put in more danger.",
