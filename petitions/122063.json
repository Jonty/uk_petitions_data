        "action": "Free childcare to be more accessible for working families.",
        "additional_details": "The 15 hours a week should be available for all families to relieve the pressure of childcare fees. Also by starting this at a younger age parents can return to work sooner. Working families do not receive much financial support even though some months we all find it hard to make ends meet. So by signing this petition we can make a difference. As a country that promotes equality I feel that our children should also have equal access to free childcare whatever the background/income.",
        "background": "There are systems in place providing 15 hours per week of free childcare. But this is only available for lower income families from the ages of 2. A huge amount of a family's wage packet is used to cover childcare. It makes the notion of returning to work very challenging and stressful.",
