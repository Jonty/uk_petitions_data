Whilst some decisions Politicians make are contentious most are for the good of the people, all of our people.  \r\n\r\nPresident Trump has a \"For America\" agenda but clearly he is keen to make America great again and whilst doing that will no doubt create the next Industrial Revolution.\r\n\r\nWe can embrace the opportunity of expressing our independent opinion whilst showing we are a Global Partner, caring for all of our ethnicities.

We have a duty to all in the UK to make UK Plc great also.\r\n",
