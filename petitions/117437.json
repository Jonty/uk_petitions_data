It has been coming into the UK for over 50 years and in June 2014 khat was banned by the Home Secretary Teresa May despite advice from Government's official advisors that it should not be classified as a drug.\r\nKhat has been proven by scientists not to be a drug. It is part of the tradition and culture these communities belong to. The wise thing for this government to do now is to overturn this ban.",
