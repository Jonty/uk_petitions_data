        "action": "Increase the public sector pay by 5% NHS staff deserve a decent pay rise",
        "additional_details": "\r\nAn independent study into regional pay in the public sector showed that in all areas of the country public servants were being underpaid compared to private counterparts before the recession and still so after. We've endured many years of working hard and taking it on the chin, hoping that when the country gets on its feet we would be recompensed with a better wage. Give us a fair deal. You have repeatedly said 'Britain needs a pay rise' MPs are getting 11% surely 5% is not asking a lot.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "People working in the public sector have years of no pay rises and when they do finally get the pittance of 1% it comes with increased pension costs and now increased NI contributions. Britain deserves a pay rise? So do the hard working NHS\r\n\r\n",
