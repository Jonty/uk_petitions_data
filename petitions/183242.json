        "additional_details": "We know that the big 5 housing companies are holding onto roughly 476,000 planning permissions, artificially inflating housing prices and have been doing so for decades. I say this policy is just as monopolistic in tendency as the recent energy, rail ticketing and Fifa bribes scandals. This isn't about morals, this is about conservative Hayek based free-market systems. Unfortunately, a state sponsored 'eye' is required to help maintain proper market function from time to time.",
        "background": "The recent addition of bonds to enable buy-to-let creation doesn't help facilitate a proper meritocracy. More proper for a 50-50 split in terms of building policy choice. This policy seems like a government giving up on the future of truly independent living to appease the big house builders.     ",
