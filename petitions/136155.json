        "action": "A public general election to replace Cameron",
        "additional_details": "Cameron and Boris have differing beliefs/values, both also present different arguments for their party. \r\nBoris wants to end the NHS, opposed against same sex marriage, wants to give bankers back their bonuses, wants to reduce tax on high earners. This is not what the country voted. This could be worse than when Thatcher was in power! \r\nPrime Minister resigned, one to replace him is of no similarity, therefore, us, the British public should be able to vote for a Prime Minister that we believe in.",
        "background": "Upon leaving the EU David Cameron has decided to resign as Prime Minister by October. When this happens the UK, is more than likely, going to have Boris Johnson take over. When the public voted the Tories in they did so with what Cameron had to say, not Boris. ",
