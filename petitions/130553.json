        "additional_details": "Hospice care is the \u2018centre of excellence\u2019 for palliative care but most of us will die on the wards. We could have privacy, dignity and specialised care in Hospice Suites requiring reorganisation rather than more resources to establish.  \r\n\r\nA recent Select Committee hearing had an NHS spokesman claiming this provision would reduce the skills of generalist Nurses and Doctors,  as if patients exist only to provide practical experience for medical staff. The dying should enjoy the best we can provide.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The current Office of National Statistics survey of End of Life Care, \u2018Voices\u2019, shows 96% of the dying strongly prefer home care or some more private and congenial place to die than the wards of a Hospital. Only 3% prefer Hospital yet half of deaths annually in England will occur on the wards. ",
