        "additional_details": "Licensing will ensure minimum welfare standards are met and avoid further genetic problems from interbreeding. \r\nBreeders will be responsible for finding suitable homes, breeding responsibly and paying relevant taxes on profits.\r\nThe general public will have greater confidence when buying a puppy from a responsible breeder.\r\n",
        "background": "Over 600 dogs are needlessly destroyed every month in the UK.\r\nMany dogs are over bred, interbred or abused by puppy farms and individuals for a quick profit without thought for welfare of the dogs.\r\nThese are living, breathing animals with feelings not accessories to be used for profit.
