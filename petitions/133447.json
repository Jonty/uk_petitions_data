        "action": "Lower the legal voting age to 17",
        "additional_details": "At 16 years old, you can join the Armed Forces, join a trade union, and you can get married or register a civil partnership. At 17, you can drive most vehicles, become a blood donor, and be no longer subject to a care order. However you still cannot vote until the age of 18. Knowing that we are prevented from voting towards decisions that will influence the rest of our lives, I believe that there is a fundamental flaw within this, and 17 year olds should be given the right to vote.",
        "background": "In the UK, the legal voting age is 18, lowered from 21 in 1969. As a 17 year old, and like many others of my age, it is incredibly frustrating that we are not given the right to vote towards important decisions which will have a great impact on our futures and livelihoods, such as the EU Referendum.",
