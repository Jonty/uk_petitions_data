        "additional_details": "Being in control of the content of a paper which enjoys a wide audience in the country's capital brings into stark relief the issue media impartiality. The significant toll of a position based a considerable distance from the subject's constituency highlights the lack of commitment shown by the former chancellor to people of that area. It is clear that he cannot continue to serve as an MP without making a mockery of the parliamentary system. ",
        "background": "George Osborne has shown flagrant disregard for his parliamentary position by taking the role as editor for the London-based Evening Standard. He also enjoys high numeration from other positions, after inflicting vicious cuts on the country in his former capacity as chancellor. ",
