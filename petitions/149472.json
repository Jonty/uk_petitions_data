        "action": "We call on Parliament to pass legislation to hold a second EU Referendum",
        "additional_details": "Governments are constantly asked to reconsider and vote again -whether by judicial review, or legislative amendments. Citizens, when taking Gov's role as legislators, should do the same.  \r\n\r\nThe current constitutional crisis is built on inequality. Making Britain poorer won't help Britain's poorest communities, but making Britain richer didn't help either.  That must change or we lose the battle of Britain. Go to oonaking.com to see why this petition differs from the original, & why this can work",
        "background": "Many people were unaware of the referendum\u2019s far-reaching consequences. After all they were asked: \"Do you want to remain in the EU or leave the EU?\" not \"Do you want to break up Britain?\"  It's only fair to allow people to reflect on a vote that may change their country's geographical borders.",
