        "additional_details": "Whoever holds a section 1 licence should have any gun they wish. Because what doesn't make sense is that if 22 rimfire semi auto rifles are legal then why can't we own a 22 rimfire pistol. If we somehow stand up against anti gun people and prove to them of how guns are not evil people that are bad are evil. If you even don't have a licence but support this sport you can push us to victory and freedom for this sport and live in a country with zero threat.",
        "background": "In 1997 The UK Labour party Prime minister Tony Blair brought in The Firearm Ammendment Act of 1997 Number 2 which banned all .22 rimfire pistols for section 1 holders. I feel like the ban was unessecary and pointless and I feel that we have been treated as gulity people but we are not.",
