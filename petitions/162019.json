        "additional_details": "Studies by SSH found that, \"65% of all [2,000] women had experienced street harassment.\" Hollaback found that 80-90% of women have been publicly harassed. Protests of freedom of speech are confronted by the Human Rights Act of 1988 which states, \"[Freedom Of Expression] may be subject to restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law...for the protection or rights of others.\" There is no acceptable provocation for catcalling. Sufficient protection from violation/objectification is crucial.",
        "background": "Instead of protecting those who deem it acceptable to intimidate, we must ensure that the majority feel safe in public. And yet catcalling is overlooked. Equally as threatening as issues in the Malicious Communications Act 1988 or the Public Order Act 1988, catcalling should be its own hate crime.",
