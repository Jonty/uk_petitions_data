Fears about immigration did not influence the way people voted.\r\n \r\nCampaign claim: We send \u00a3350m a week to Brussels, which could be spent on the NHS instead.\r\nCurrent claim: The claim was a mistake\r\n\r\n",

The televised debates were more about the art of avoiding the question than having a constructive debate.",
