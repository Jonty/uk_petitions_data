        "additional_details": "Adding netball to the Olympics would increase its international profile and further increase participation across many different countries.\r\nNetball is already a firmly established sport both enjoyed by many people and yet barriers are placed around it that prevent it advancing in the sporting world and that includes the Olympics. \r\nIf it were to feature in the Olympics as golf and tennis have been, it can only benefit the sport for those who play it now and those in the future. ",
        "background": "Netball isn't in the Olympics because 'not enough countries play it'. However according to the IFNA, over 20 million people play netball in more than 70 different countries. Netball is a sport enjoyed by women of all different ages and it deserves more international recognition. ",
