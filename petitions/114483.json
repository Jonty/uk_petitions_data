        "action": "Stop the use of HADECS 3 speed cameras or bring them in line with existing rules",
        "additional_details": "It has been evidenced that these cameras are not being used in a fair and just manner. Police guidelines and existing cameras allow a tolerance of 10% +2mph, the HADECS 3 cameras are being used on \"smart\" motorways, set to 70mph and left active even when no speed reductions are placed on the managed motorway. Add to this the risk of drivers over braking should they see a camera and the distraction caused to drivers in having to look for and identify the cameras increased accident potential.",
        "background": "The use of HADECS 3 speed cameras as a stealth tax on motorways is both unfair and dangerous. Motorists were assured cameras would not be used for profit and only fitted in high risk accident black spots. The use of these on the motorway network is in contradiction of this.\r\n",
