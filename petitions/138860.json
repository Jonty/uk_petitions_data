        "additional_details": "Holders of EU passports have had the right to live and work in the UK and to settle here - in many cases, they could have applied for UK citizenship which would have entitled them to a vote, but there was never any need with an integrated EU.  Now faced with the prospect of an EU exit, they are denied a vote.  These people pay taxes in the UK, and run businesses in the UK which provide employment to British citizens.",
        "background": "EU citizens who have built their lives in the UK, often married to British people with roots in the UK - families, businesses, jobs - are impacted by the referendum and they have a right to vote. ",
