        "additional_details": "The Foreign Aid budget is too high and is subject to abuse.\r\nWe believe that the budget should be reduced to \u00a38.4bn & the commitment of a minimum of 2% GDP on defence spending is increased.\r\nOur armed forces are amongst the best in the world.\r\nWe should reflect this by boosting our defence budget & spending on our armed forces.\r\nIn an ever more dangerous world, we should spend more on beefing up our defence budget.\r\nWe believe that the best way to achieve this is to cut Foreign Aid & boost Defence",
        "background": "We believe the the Government should reduce the Foreign Aid budget back to \u00a38.4bn, the level it was at in 2010.\r\nThe Foreign Aid budget is set to rise to almost \u00a316bn by 2020.\r\nWe believe this additional funding should be moved to beef up our defence capabilities and our marvellous armed forces.",
