        "additional_details": "My father applied for British visa to visit us in UK. He had visited us in past but was denied this time on grounds that sufficient documents have not been provided. Although we have provided all the documentation required as deemed necessary.\r\nThe applicant should be given a fair chance to explain & submit anything considered missing instead of rejecting.\r\n\r\nJust one chance to Clarify & one Chance to Appeal, so loved ones could join moments of joy & sorrow. It will be environmentally friendly too.",
        "background": "Current visa application does not list required documents/ information categorically. It is left to  applicant to decide & provide. If there is something short in visa officer\u2019s view, applicant is not given a chance to submit it. Instead application is rejected and there is no right to appeal.",
