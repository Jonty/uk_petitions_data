        "additional_details": "This proposal is designed to ensure that common-sense, not dogma, is applied and the interests of all UK citizens are protected. \r\n\r\nA satisfactory resolution of all issues is highly unlikely within the fixed 2 year period specified in article 50. \r\n\r\nShould the EU prevent the above, the UK government should decide in parliament, and possibly with a 2nd referendum, whether to proceed with departure from the EU. Should the process of negotiation with the EU falter or fail, this should also be done. ",
        "background": "The UK government should invoke article 50 only when it is certain that the timescale and process is adequate to ensure the interests of all citizens of the UK will be protected. Assessment of the objectives from the UK standpoint and preliminary discussions and agreement with the EU are required. ",
