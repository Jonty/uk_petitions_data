        "additional_details": "Trump\u2019s administration  make statements that contradict publicly available evidence, are likely to oppose urgently needed action to reduce global warming, oppose a free press, are racist and Islamophobic and are likely to increase recruitment to \u2018IS\u2019, and support aggressive nationalism and so threaten world security.",
        "background": "Trump\u2019s administration espouses values and standards opposed to those of the UK and EU. A new trade deal with the US will be on much worse terms than we currently have with the EU. The EU needs to remain strong  in an uncertain and changing world, while Brexit is a threat to this.",
