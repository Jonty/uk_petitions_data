        "additional_details": "Fracking is once again in the media with the Government ruling that horizontal fracking can go ahead in Lancashire. It follows the approval of fracking at Kirby Misperton in May (although this is delayed to to legal challenges).\r\n\r\nThere is little consensus on the long term impacts on the area and the surrounding areas after fracking. Examples in the US have resulted in water contamination and air pollution causing headaches and nausea not to mention confirmation of causing earthquakes.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Fracking is a controversial process to extract natural gas by fracturing surrounding rock and directly a high pressure mix to release the gas.\r\n\r\nI ask for a referendum on whether fracking should be allowed in the UK at all.  Public opinion seems strongly against yet applications are being approved.",
