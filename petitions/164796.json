        "additional_details": "Cllr. Zahir Mohammad, Cabinet Member for Schools in Bucks, in response to queries about funding inequalities between grammars and secondaries said this: \"The non-selective schools receive considerably more support from increased funding e.g. per pupil Free School meals, Prior Attainment, English as an additional language and Pupil Premium etc and this can be quite significantly more than grammars.\". The 11+ is biased against children from poor families and this system cannot be expanded further.",
        "background": "The government are looking into lifting the ban on new grammar schools, but this will create more inequality than social mobility. In areas where there are grammar schools, secondary moderns receive significantly more free school meal funding etc. The grammar system clearly doesn't work.\r\n\r\n",
