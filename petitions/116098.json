        "action": "Ban American KKK members from the UK under anti-terrorism laws.",
        "additional_details": "If Dylann Roof had been a member of ISIS both the USA and UK would already be introducing new laws to help combat his ideology. If Michael O'Neill propaganda from Boko Haram where he was making bombs America would already be planning new air strikes to fight them. But as it wasn't ISIS or Boko Haram we can only talk about them not their ideology or their allies still one the loose. Since the US has proved repeatedly they can't deal with their own terrorist groups I say we must lead by example.",
        "background": "With ISIS in the news on a regular basis what many people are starting to forget that other terrorist groups still exist. KKK has been in the news earlier this year after Anonymous exposed 1000 Americans who still support them. Notable KKK terrorists include Dylann Roof and Michael O'Neill.",
