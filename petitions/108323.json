        "additional_details": "Waiting-on staff are taxed on their tips.....are the employers declaring what they are stealing?  I doubt it, and am sure that this is not an isolated case.  These staff are paid minimum wage - often for very long hours.  Customers tip according to the service they have received and in good faith that their waiter/waitress is benefiting from this.  These people should not be allowed to continue to get away with this.",
        "background": "Employers/owners of a restaurant are taking the tips employees are given by customers off them; they are then keeping over 50% for themselves before sharing what is left between all the employees - which results in them getting very little of what was given to them in good faith by the customers.
