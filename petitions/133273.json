        "additional_details": "in 2013-2014 7 young girls committed suicide due to bullying on the website ask.fm, countless more were affected. Because of the outrage parents rightfully stopped their children from using the site and eventually the craze died down. However 'curious cat' a similar site has just emerged, the endearing name and layout of the site seems to target younger, more vulnerable children. Whilst they do offer some filters, they are not default therefor many uses won't apply them and so will be targeted.",
        "background": "Websites such as 'ask.fm'&'curious cat' allow users to post on each others walls anonymously. Young teenagers sign up to these to hope to get an'honest view of themselves' as at this age many are crippled with self doubt, however bullies are swarming to these sites because of the anonymous feature",
