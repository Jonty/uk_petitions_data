        "additional_details": "Because a referendum was promised but never held, Gordon Brown signed the treaty without the authority to do so.  His signature therefore carries no weight.  The UK did not agree to the treaty and is thus not bound by any of its clauses.  In particular, the UK is free to leave the EU by a simple unilateral declaration without any need of Article 50. \r\n\r\nGordon Brown signed the Lisbon Treaty.  The UK did not. \r\n",
        "background": "Tony Blair promised a referendum on UK agreement to the EU constitution (later renamed the Lisbon Treaty).  This referendum never took place, therefore the UK electorate has never approved the Lisbon Treaty.  Nonetheless, Gordon Brown proceeded to sign the treaty. ",
