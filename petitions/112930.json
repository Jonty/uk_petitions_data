        "action": "Change Gun Possesion Laws to a minimum 30 years.",
        "additional_details": "The Victims of gun crime and there families lived are changed forever.  The guilty and also ther families lives also change forever. It is out of control too many young children are turning to these weapons. Children do not know the consequences of using guns and the current laws don't help. 5 years out in 2/3 years is not a deterrent. A change in law will make all young and old think twice about using them. I urge the government to make a stance & get guns off our streets. ",
        "background": "Gun crime in the UK is at an all time high. The amount of lives ruined by this crime is wrong. Guns ruin lives. We need guns of our streets and this is the only way to do it. Possesion or association should carry a maximum of a 30 year prison sentence. Guns are currently too easy to purchase. ",
