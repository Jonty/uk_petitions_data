        "additional_details": "There have been a number of court cases where the judges have rightly found in the workers favor because of restrictions imposed by the employer's on the employees. I would say that any member of staff that has to hit a response target or stay in a certain area should be paid at least the NMW/NLW. Especially if this is their main source of employment. The law is very unclear around working on-call and should be clarified urgently to protect the lowest paid workers in out society. ",
        "background": "NMW/NLW at the moment does not apply to anyone working on-call from home or at the work place in most circumstances. I belive this to be wrong. I work as an out of hours responder and we are currently paid \u00a33:12 per hour if I'm called out or not. This is my only job and I work 16 hours min per shift",
