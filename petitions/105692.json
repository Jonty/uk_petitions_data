        "additional_details": "Recently there have been fewer places to learn, as airfields close across the country and the sites are turned into housing developments. We feel there should be a responsibility on the few airfields left to support learning. Bristol Airport have been the latest to take advantage of the closures by increasing charges against small aircraft, though their profits have increased. We want to reverse government policy on airfield closures, and demand protection against greedy airport operators.",
        "background": "Each year there are people, from all walks of life, who learn to fly a small plane. It may be their dream, they may be physically challenged and want to realise an ambition, or perhaps go on to a career in flying. Many who learn to fly go on to raise awareness and financial support for charities.",
