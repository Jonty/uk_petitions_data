        "additional_details": "Smas is very rare with only 400 known cases world wide. I am the second in Scotland to be diagnosed. \r\nI want this rare disease to be recognised and for more awareness to be made. More knowledge for gps and treatment options for known sufferers. As it stands there's no surgeon willing to take my case on in the uk as it is so complex and they say surgery poses more risk than benefit to my life. Had I been diagnosed sooner I wouldn't have got so I'll. Knowledge and awareness is key.",

I was diagnosed with Smas December 2015 after suffering for over 20 years with symptoms GP continually put down to Anxiety or eating disorder. Smas is a rare disease with a mortality of 1.3",
