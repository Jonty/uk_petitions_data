They are in contact with a few developers who are interested in building an ice rink. The Secretary of this club, Edna Boden, has been campaigning for the return of an ice rink in the area for over 28 years. \r\nFor more information visit our facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/IceRinkForSouthampton",
