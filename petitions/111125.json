        "additional_details": "The government plan to take away the one thing we need for struggling families, how many of you earn below the minimum wage that will not be increased and the tax credit cuts will subsequently ruin you and your family. We're already struggling, living below the bread-line whilst Cameron and Osborne live in their huge houses claiming back as much money as possible, their families don't struggle so why should ours and our children.",
        "background": "They are threatening the poor by making them poorer, a hard-working single mum in a low paid job needs this to keep afloat as to many other families, there are other ways to make cuts like stop giving money abroad, stop funding immigrants, don't punish those who truly need it.",
