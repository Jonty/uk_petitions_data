        "additional_details": "Parents make children wear a cycle helmet but do not wear one themselves - sending out the wrong message.  Kids who are made to wear one by parents take them off and carry them as soon as they are out of sight so as they 'fit in'. Schools encourage cycling to school, but do not insist that children wear a cycle helmet in doing so. \r\nThere is so much evidence that wearing a cycle helmet saves lives. ",
        "background": "Cycle helmets save lives. We made it law for motor cyclist to wear helmets, so why not cyclists.  So many kids come under huge peer pressure not to wear one when they cycle to school as it is 'not cool' but if it was law, then everyone would have to wear one, so it would become 'cool' again.",
