        "action": "Stop employers from making women redundant whilst on maternity leave",
        "additional_details": "More and more employers use \"strategic changes\" during maternity leave as a reason to push women out of their business. This causes women and families great distress at a time that should be happy and memorable. Having a child can be a financial shock and adding the pressure of taking someone's income away from them at such a sensitive time can be soul destroying and causes families to become desperate, especially those whom the government doesn't offer any support to.",
        "background": "More should be done to protect women on maternity leave from losing their jobs.I was made redundant 4 months into my maternity leave and was left feeling the financial and mental effects of not having a job. Not entitled to redundancy pay or any government support. I now feed my son on \u00a320 a week.",
