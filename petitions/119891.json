        "additional_details": "APDT(UK) offers accreditation in order to become a member and vets usually recommend APDT(UK) trainers to their clients. However, this is a voluntary accreditation that members of the public may not be familiar with. A governing body similar to the APDT(UK) model (or give the APDT(UK) authority) needs to be created in order to increase pet dog welfare in the UK and in turn reduce dog bites and PTS through aggression problems that are exacerbated by advice given out by non accredited trainers. ",
        "background": "Anybody can set up as a professional dog trainer in the UK, regardless of qualifications, experience or use of correct training methods. There needs to be a governing body responsible for accreditation, registration and logging of CPD for dog trainers in the UK. This will improve dog welfare greatly",
