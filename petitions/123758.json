        "action": "Stop the Housing and Planning Bill change to social housing access for under 35s",
        "additional_details": "The Bill is likely to have a significant impact on single people under 35 since currently they are only eligible for the shared accommodation rate in the private sector. This will make difficult the letting of one bedroom social tenancies to single people under 35 who may be reliant on some form of housing benefit (including many of those in work). This is age discrimination and particularly unfair for vulnerable young people who cannot share accommodation due to mental health; autism, etc.",
        "background": "Hidden in the Housing and Planning Bill is the proposal that benefit for social housing is changed so that those who are single aged under 35 will not be able to access an affordable social tenancy, they will be expected to share, including if they are vulnerable and/or in work or training.
