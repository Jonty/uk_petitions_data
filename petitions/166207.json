        "additional_details": "In America they screen newborn babies for Krabbe Disease but not in the uk. This is a very serious condition which there is no cure. It is a gene which one or both parents carry and can pass it on to the child without even knowing. If it's not found early enough then a child can die by the age of two years with late onset Krabbe Diease. This needs to become part of screening with a newborn ASAP. Please help make this happen!!",
        "background": "I have a best friend that tried years to get pregnant. When she finally become pregnant she was over the moon. She then become pregnant with her second child which was then found out to have Krabbe Disease at 13 months old which there is currently no cure for and they don't screen for when born.",
