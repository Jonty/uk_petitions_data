        "action": "Allow EU citizens on the UK electoral register for 5 years a vote in referendum.",
        "additional_details": "It makes no sense that a UK citizen resident abroad, who hasn't been on the electoral register for up to 15 years can vote, whilst EU citizens contributing to our society and on the UK electoral register cannot.\r\n\r\nThis is further undermined by the fact that Gibraltarians, who are only in the EU by the skin of the UK's teeth, can vote in the referendum whilst citizens of fully committed EU states resident in the UK cannot!",
        "background": "With the cost of UK naturalisation for EU citizens being circa \u00a32000 and requiring 3-5 years prior residence, the cost for EU citizens to gain full UK voting rights through full citizenship is extremely prohibitive. These individuals contribute immensely to the UK and yet are prevented from voting",
