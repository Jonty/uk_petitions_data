        "additional_details": "Ban Bookmakers using the term \"We reserve the right to restrict or exclude people from our offers at our discretion and without notice or warning\" This quite simply should not be allowed it is totally unfair and discriminating. A supermarket cannot exclude customers from its publicly advertised promotion offers, so why is a bookmaker allowed to? In other Countries, where a bookmaker makes an offer public of say \"bet \u00a325 and get \u00a325 free\" they have to honour that to everyone who takes part in it.",
        "background": "Most Bookmakers with a UK licence routinely and on mass, ban some customers from taking part in their publicly advertised promotions. This is false advertising and conning people to gamble, then refusing without reason to honour the advertised offer and excluding them from all future offers.",
