        "additional_details": "Speaker John Bercow is retrospective with this statement having had no objections to leaders of controversial regimes such as Kuwait, China, and Qatar speaking to MPs and peers in both houses. \r\n\r\nWe need an impartial, professional individual for the role of Speaker, one who is not tainted by expense scandals and family members that call his position into disrepute. Mr Bercow clearly lacks the desire and ability to carry out this position in the publics interest and this needs addressed. ",
        "background": "Speaker John Bercow has time and time again shown himself to be unfit for the role of Speaker of the House of Commons. \r\n\r\nHis recent statement that he is strongly opposed to President Donald Trump speaking in Parliament shows he is inconsistent with his views. ",
