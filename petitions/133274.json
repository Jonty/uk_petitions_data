        "additional_details": "Some of the children are in pain almost every day & some are in casts or they may need surgery involving cutting through the thigh bone and re-angling the bone so that the head sits properly in the socket pinning and plating it.In place ago help the head grow to the correct shape. I am disgusted to hear so many stories of DLA/PIP refusing to recognise this as a disability and turning down children in wheelchairs! This can happen not just once but 4-5 times per child. THIS IS A DISGRACE. Do your research DLA!!",
