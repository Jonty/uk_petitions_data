        "action": "Make UK political advertising subject to the Advertising Code.",
        "additional_details": "The Advertising Standards Authority ensures all adverts in the UK are \"legal, decent, honest and truthful\", and has the power to ban false advertising. However, their powers do not currently extend to political campaigning, meaning we have more protection when buying a toaster than voting in a referendum. \r\n\r\nAn extension of the ASA's powers would strengthen our democratic system and protect free speech. Let's remove lies from our political discourse, and kick \"post-truth politics\" out of Britain.",
        "background": "Political campaigning is a form of advertising, and like all other forms of advertising, it should be regulated. The recent referendum campaign highlights the urgent need for political advertising to become subject to the Advertising Code in the same way as other areas of advertising and marketing. ",
