        "action": "Feature twice back-to-back World Darts Champion Gary Anderson on UK bank notes.",
        "additional_details": "On January 4th 2015, 'The Flying Scotsman' Gary Anderson made history by becoming the first Scottish world darts champion since the late, great Jocky Wilson when he defeated convicted sex offender Phil Taylor 7-6 in the PDC World Championship Final. Twelve months later, he retained his title, thus proving himself as undoubtably Scotland's greatest ever sporting hero and arguably its greatest ever son. It is beyond time that Gary Anderson's unprecedented success is recognised properly.",
        "background": "This petition calls on the U.K Government to begin the process of introducing legislation which will force all banks in the U.K. with the power to print currency to feature two time back-to-back William Hill World Darts Champion, Gary Anderson on all new notes printed effective immediately.",
