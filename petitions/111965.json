        "additional_details": "GPs deliver 90% of NHS care, a huge workload.  The RCGP estimates a current shortage of 8000 GPs and this will get much worse.  Half of GP training places remain empty because the government has removed occupational health support for GPs, imposed pension changes which force experienced GPs to retire, imposed time-consuming and expensive CQC registration, demanded 8 til 8 7 day a week opening despite lack of demand at pilot sites, and use GPs as their political scapegoat for all NHS issues.   ",
        "background": "This government has reduced the general practice budget by 20% in the last 5 years and significantly reduced the GP workforce and morale. They continue to force changes that will see practices closing imminently, and 82% of GPs planning to reduce or stop work in the next 5 years. (Pulse 26.10.15)",
