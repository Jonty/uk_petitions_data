        "additional_details": "British citizens living abroad are often denied their right to vote on matters affecting them. This occurs as postal votes frequently fail to arrive, and if they arrive at all, votes typically have insufficient time to return to the UK. British citizens living abroad should have the right to vote in, or return a postal vote to, an embassy in their country of residence. This is an option offered in many other countries and would allow those living abroad to have a voice. ",
        "background": "British citizens living abroad are currently only able to vote by post, proxy or in person in the UK. Postal votes frequently fail to arrive and voting by proxy or in person is often impossible. Citizens abroad need to be able to vote in an embassy, an option for many other countries.",
