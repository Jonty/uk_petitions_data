Legalising cannabis could bring in \u00a3900m in taxes every year, save \u00a3400m on policing cannabis and create over 10,000 new jobs.",
        "background": "It's LEGAL in places. It's been proven to aid physical and mental pain - (chronic muscular pain, CANCER CELLS, insomnia, and anxiety to name a few). Yeah it can make people lazy if they smoke it without moderation but drinking too much can make you aggressive, reckless or even dead.\r\n\r\n",
