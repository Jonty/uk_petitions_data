        "additional_details": "Society is being brainwashed to think that their bodies must look a certain way or be a certain shape. Size 6 manikins and underweight models are causing people to feel like their body is wrong; influencing young people starting to navigate the minefield of food and body relationships and triggering eating disorder sufferers. We have the power to free ourselves from societal pressure to get the \u2018perfect\u2019 body; everyone\u2019s body is good enough, no matter what size or shape it is. ",
        "background": "We are brainwashed into perceiving our bodies as inferior to those in magazines, on television, on catwalks and we are made to believe that we have to transform our bodies to look just like theirs or hate ourselves accordingly and that those bodies are the only ones that are beautiful. It is wrong.",
