        "action": "Introduce national statutory measures to shelter and rehabilitate rough sleepers",
        "additional_details": "Government statistics show a 55% increase in rough sleeping between 2010 and 2014. Independent statistics put the figure much higher, and the number has almost certainly risen substantially again since 2014. Most of these people are not eligible for help from statutory services in their current form. There is evidence to suggest that other government policies, such as short-sighted housing policy, cuts to social care budgets, and benefit-sanctioning, have swelled the numbers of homeless.",
        "background": "Britain's cities are in the grip of a homelessness epidemic. Rough sleeping is hugely on the increase, and it's dangerous and degrading for those who have to do it. It is shameful for our society.\r\nWe ask government for urgent national statutory measures to shelter and rehabilitate rough sleepers.\r\n",
