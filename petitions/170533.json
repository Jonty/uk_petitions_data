        "additional_details": "The law says you have to either divorce by waiting 2 years or 5 years OR you have to choose a reason like \"adultery\" or \"unreasonable behaviour\" or \"desertion\". \r\n\"Why should it be easy? Kids need their parents to stay together\" I hear you say...The trouble is, lawyers get round the divorce law very easily, but at great expense to their clients. Letters about petitions back and forth, outrage at the particulars, common sense out the window. \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 for lawyers. Madness! Sign the petition to help.\r\n",
