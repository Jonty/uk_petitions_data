        "action": "Amend the way cats are undervalued in todays society and enforce current laws",
        "additional_details": "The Department for Transport have expressed to us that major legislation would need putting in place to enforce our proposals. They say the current Act involves dogs and not cats due to dogs status as 'working animals'. Contemporary times do see cats being used as 'working animals' so have the right to be safeguarded the same way. The Animal Welfare Act 2006 states cats are property. Intentionally injuring or killing a cat is punishable under the Criminal Damage Act 1971 so should be enforced.",
        "background": "A cat does not fall within the remit of the Road Traffic Act and therefore does not need reporting should you run over one. \r\nAmending the Act would give cats the best chance at survival rather than suffering by the roadside and it would give the family peace of mind/closure.
