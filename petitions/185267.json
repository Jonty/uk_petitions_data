        "action": "Make GCSEs test students' abilities rather than their memories",
        "additional_details": "For subjects such as english where students are no longer allowed the texts they are supposed to analyse in the exam at all, it doesn't test students ability to put forward an argument, it tests students' abilities to remember certain things. It is also not practical for physics as learning the 18 formulas in not beneficial and may cause marks to be dropped even though students know what to do but they cannot remember what equation to use.",
        "background": "The new GCSEs are now based on testing students' abilities to remember things more than to actually answer the question. This makes sense for subjects like history, business studies and biology where the facts are the most important thing. This is not the case for all subjects.",
