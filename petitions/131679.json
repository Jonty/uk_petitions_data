        "action": "Stop treating Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)",
        "additional_details": "Myalgic Encephalomyelitis means \"muscle pain + inflammation of the brain and spinal cord\", in other words it is a neurological illness. It is accepted as such by the World Health Organization (WHO). The term CFS was coined in the USA and seized upon by psychiatrists in the UK, and today the psychiatric view of ME (that ME does not exist but is really a \"fatigue syndrome\") now dictates the Department of Health, Nice, and NHS policy. While this policy remains in place, ME patients are untreated.",
        "background": "The NHS offers treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and tells us that CFS is \"also known as\" Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) in order to justify treating ME the same as CFS. It is unethical to treat one condition as another; it makes patients more ill and is a waste of time and money.\r\n",
