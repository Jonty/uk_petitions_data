        "additional_details": "Research says: \"Children around the age of four may not be ready for the environment they encounter in the reception class, which will include having to deal not only with a curriculum that may not be tailored to their needs but also with a number of social and emotional adjustments. These factors may cause stress and anxiety\". Younger children could \"be affected in a negative way by their experiences in the early years\". In Finland the outcomes are more balanced as children start school later.",
        "background": "Having family who relocated to Finland and seeing my 2 year old niece thrive in the Finnish education system; is a wake up call for us to change the age children start school in the UK to give them a more stable start in life.",
