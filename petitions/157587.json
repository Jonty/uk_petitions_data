Millions  were born into a Britain already a member of the EU and see themselves as citizens of that greater family of Europe. Evidence is growing that the motivation for this referendum was to resolve strife within a British political party not to benefit this nation and so by its very nature, it was a corrupt and misguided enterprise.",
