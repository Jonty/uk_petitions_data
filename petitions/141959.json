        "additional_details": "The country has expressed its wish to leave the EU. It has not expressed its wish of who should now lead the negotiations. This is why a general election is necessary. The team to reach the most beneficial agreements with the EU need to know they have the full backing of Britain's electorate as they represent them and define the future of our country. ",
        "background": "A fundamental policy position of the government elected in 2015 has changed. The Conservative Euroskeptics do not have themselves a mandate to form a government. Negotiations on Britain's exit from the EU require a more inclusive approach than the Leave campaign has proven itself capable of.\r\n",
