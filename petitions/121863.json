        "action": "Agree with European governments to radical plan to prevent drowning of refugees",
        "additional_details": "Our radical plan: \r\n1) Naval rescue of refugees from Turkish beaches. \r\n2) Registration of rescued refugees and issuing of Temporary Refugee (TR) status identity cards. \r\n3) Temporary distribution of TRs to European countries. \r\nThis will require: Suspension of current European legislation on refugees, management by UNHCR and recognition that refugees are being offered a temporary sanctuary NOT a permanent home. We believe that most TRs will want to return once peace is established in their country.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government and Parliament to work with other countries to adopt a radical plan to stop the drowning of Syrian refugees. People were horrified by the picture of the drowned boy on the beach but the drownings are still happening. We must have a plan which starts by ending tragedies.",
