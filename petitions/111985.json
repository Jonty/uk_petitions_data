        "additional_details": "Injuries to children and household pets would not be an issue if the public sale was banned and displays only set fireworks one day rather than weeks even months.\r\nDisplays would allow families to enjoy an organised safe environment.\r\nFireworks would be less likely to get in the wrong hands and stop such things as setting them off indoors or at animals/people.\r\nLess lost pets that have fled in fear. (kenneling/rehoming issues)\r\nChildren and pets can feel safe and secure in their own homes.\r\n",
        "background": "To keep the sale of fireworks to licensed displays would allow safety in the community. It would help frightened animals and children to feel secure in their own home. It would stop the explosives getting into the wrong hands ie children thus reducing injury, harm and death to themselves and others.",
