This will encourage more young people in their thousands to grow up as the next generation with life-saving skills and a keenness to help others.  Signing this petition could save a life!\r\n\r\nCheaper AEDs (No VAT)\r\n= more AEDs in communities \r\n+ more young, prepared people to assist victims when a SCA has occurred \r\n= MORE LIVES BEING SAVED\r\n\u2026..Let\u2019s make it happen",
        "background": "Help us remove VAT on lifesaving defibrillators.  Did you know Scouts and Guides, Cubs and Brownies, Beavers and Rainbows all have to pay 20% VAT for this emergency life-saving equipment. It is wrong. These are the keenest young people to train and encourage with basic life support skills. ",
