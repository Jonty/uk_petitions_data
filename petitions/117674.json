        "action": "Make DNA testing in the UK compulsory to reduce crime",
        "additional_details": "Compulsory DNA testing involves taking a swab sample in your mouth which the DNA stays on the police's records. This DNA will enable the police to track down criminals that have made you a victim of crime. The DNA will save time and make it easier for the police to solve crimes which would help reduce the amount of crime in the UK. Without DNA, it makes it harder for the police to arrest guilty criminals instead of innocent people. Would you rather crime increase and put everyone at risk?\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "DNA helps the police find criminals in a fast and efficient manner. In order to do this, they need to take 1 swab sample of everyone in the country. Of course, this has negative effects including privacy, but would you give up a sample of your DNA to keep you and your family safe?\r\n",
