        "additional_details": "I feel very strongly about this and the difference in receiving or not receiving Child Benefit may influence financial decisions for many families.\r\n\r\nChild Benefit is \u00a320.70 per week for one child and \u00a313.79 for an additional child. For some families this makes a huge difference. \r\n\r\nWhy should families with a household income of less than \u00a398k receive their full entitlement to Child Benefit and yet a family with one working parent who earns over \u00a348k not? ",
        "background": "Currently if a single person earns over \u00a350k a year they have to pay a tax charge on child benefit, earn over \u00a360k and you have to pay more tax than child benefit so there is no point in claiming. However a couple can have a joint income of \u00a398k (\u00a349k each) and receive the full Child Benefit. ",
