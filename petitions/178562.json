        "additional_details": "Whether this is done by extra funding, volunteering or campaining. It is a responsibility of every normal human being especially parents who knows this is wrong. I would also like to see laws changed for sexual offenders to receive the death penalty as there is no place for their kind in this world & any child abusers to be sterilised from having anymore. This is not the type of world I want my children to live in & I believe it is all our duty for anyone who agrees with me.",
        "background": "I believe Child abuse especially sexual is not talked about enough when it is happening way too often. The goverment & the nation need to step up & work together to clamp down on catching & ending this inhumane crime. I would like it to be a forefront issue of the government & police & laws changed.",
