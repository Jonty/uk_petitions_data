But people that are in charge think there is to much red tape or are confused about making the necessary adjustment, to change there policy's for hot temperatures. I do think that headteachers and employers should have a maximum temperature to insure a Safe work area. As alot of people will benefit from a law of maximum temperature. ",
        "background": "There is no set maximum temperatures for children in schools and colleges. Also for working people. With school uniform being so strict, that children can't ware school shorts just trousers. I think the risk of dehydration and more serious medical attention will be more prominent.",
