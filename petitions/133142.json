The Microchip can also disappear or move.\r\nSome people find them and do not hand them in to the right authorities(dog warden etc) like it is law to do. \r\nMy personal experience in the past each time my dogs have been scanned I have had to request it. This should not be the case.\r\nLuckily I did that, as if my dog did go missing I would of never of got him back as his chip vanished. Dogs have a chip for a REASON\r\nDogs' are Family\r\n",

Please Sign & Share to help this happen. \r\nShocking that it is not law already. \r\n",
