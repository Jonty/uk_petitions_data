        "additional_details": "I took my son to a zoo and a circus when he was small & I felt always very sorry for the all the creatures there, I had no knowledge or background in species behavior, however I could still tell these animals were not at their natural best. \r\nTigers pacing up and down relentlessly, little intelligent monkeys trying to communicate via the glass and elephants with very little space to live in. \r\nIt all felt wrong then & now I know its wrong, its time to stop.\u007f  ",
        "background": "Keeping animals in captivity and out of their natural habitat does not benefit them or their species in any way. Large animals like elephants and bears suffer the most as in the wild they roam for many miles daily. Species conservation is best done in the wild, without cages. ",
