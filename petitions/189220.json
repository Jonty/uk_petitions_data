        "additional_details": "Research shows that 9,000 young people could be put at risk of homelessness, and will face the choice of living on the streets or living in unsafe and unsuitable accommodation. \r\nResearch by Herriot Watt University shows that the legislation will save the Government just \u00a33.3 million, and that even these savings will be eroded if just 140 young people were made homeless as a result of the policy.\r\n",
        "background": "On 3rd March the government introduced new legislation which restricts 18-21 year olds from claiming the housing element of Universal Credit (Housing Benefit). This will leave thousands of young people who do not have the support of their families at serious risk of homelessness.",
