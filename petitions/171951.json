        "additional_details": "He plans to remove and stop Islamic people from staying in and entering the USA, he has and is causing huge racial tensions in the USA. He has said massively offencive comments about women and gender equality, and intends to act on these beliefs. He is inciting war in the middle east and violence within his own country. For all of these reasons the UK cannot consider the USA a reliable friend and the special relationship as it is called should be ended.",
        "background": "This petition has been made in response to the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States. The special relationship with America should be ended due to the conflicting views of its new president and his decisions that will affect the UK internationally. ",
