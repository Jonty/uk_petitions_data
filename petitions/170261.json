        "action": "Allow rape victims to receive forensic examination and results before reporting",
        "additional_details": "Date rape drugs leave the system within 72 hours of being ingested, and forensic examinations should be made within this time frame too, so that the victim can eat, drink and shower normally. The decision to report is heavy, and should be given time. When forced to make a decision so quickly, victims are often pressured into reporting their crimes when it isn't in their interest to do so. Victims should have the right to receive the forensic examination and its results before reporting.",
        "background": "Potential rape victims often can't find out whether they have ingested a date rape drug unless they take legal action and report the crime. This involves undergoing a 3 hour forensic examination, making a video statement, and the arrest of the accused. They may also be forced to appear in court.",
