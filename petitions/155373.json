        "action": "Establish support mechanisms to aid people experiencing abuse due to Brexit.",
        "additional_details": "Reports of members of the public being subjected to racial or xenophobic abuse has increased noticeably since Brexit. Mechanisms exist to report such hate crimes to the police but there is little visible information connecting the victim or scared member o/t public to volunteer groups representing caring individuals in the community or for those who wish to help, to join together. This issue needs a national voice and to be seen as the responsibility of all ordinary decent civilians.",
        "background": "This petition asks Parliament to urgently recommend putting in place visible resources (web, social & phone) so that members of the public who have been subject to abuse related to Brexit know where to turn to seek advice and the support of concerned and loving members of their community.",
