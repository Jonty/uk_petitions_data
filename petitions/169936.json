        "additional_details": "Rents are being pushed ever higher meaning that people are stuck in a renting society, without their own property, and a generation is likely to be lost to housing ownership as a result of this. There has to be a movement towards considering rental towards mortgage acceptance. With rents at their current rate, people simply don't have the disposable income to save a deposit, so why not actually look at their proven ability to pay?",
        "background": "With the governments failed help to buy scheme rumoured to be scrapped, why is no one petitioning for a persons proven track record on a rental property to be considered in lieu of a deposit. if you've paid \u00a31,000 a month rent for 3 years, then you can afford a \u00a3700 a month mortgage for example.",
