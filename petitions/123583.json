        "additional_details": "We live in a Constitutional Monarchy, with Parliamentary Democracy, however the recent actions of Mr Cameron have turned this country into a Banana Republic. At the very least, Parliament should first debate, whether or not it is right for the Government to use the Civil Service, the way it is intending to, in the lead up to this referendum. Rigging the entire debate as Government, is not providing a free, fair and impartial debate on the issue, to the people, which is what it should be.",
        "background": "We the undersigned, believe it is unconstitutional and wholly inappropriate, for the UK govt to hold an opinion (Either way) on the potential outcome of the EU referendum and it is certainly not right, to instruct Civil Servants that they may not speak freely on the matter, as they so believe.",
