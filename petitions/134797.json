        "additional_details": "The terms of any UK exit from the EU - particularly the trade regime we can negotiate with the EU and how we will interact with the EU single market - will have a major impact on the UK economy. Voters were asked to make a decision without knowing exactly what they were voting for - or thus the consequences for them.  \r\n\r\nThe Government now has a mandate to negotiate with the EU the terms of a possible UK exit. The people should be given the chance to vote on these terms before a final decision. ",
        "background": "On 23 June 2016, 51.9% of those voting in the EU referendum chose to leave the EU. But the terms of the departure were not specified by the Leave campaign. And 63% of the electorate did not vote for this significant change. ",
