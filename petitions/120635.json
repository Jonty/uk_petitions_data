        "action": "Enable better access to emergency funding for academies awaiting a pupils EHCP",
        "additional_details": "Gaining an EHCP to access funding for an SEN child is a complicated and long process, leaving months in the interim with no funding for support. Early years settings can get emergency funding for these situations, as can non academy schools, but with the government push for schools to become academies, children are getting lost in the gaps, leaving schools underfunded and understaffed for children with SEN. Allowing emergency funding for academies is desperately needed",
        "background": "Currently academies cannot access emergency funding to give special needs children support above the statutory 13 hours and the wait time for an EHCP is far too long without an emergency provision. With the government push to make schools gain academy status this is leaving SEN children underfunded ",
