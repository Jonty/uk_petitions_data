        "additional_details": "In the UK, it is against the law for a company to make a false or misleading claim in an advertisement. We have a body, the Advertising Standards Agency, dedicated to making sure they don't. As a result, UK advertising is largely free of falsehoods.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, politicians of all parties can simply make up facts and figures, knowing that even if they're disputed, the waters of our national conversation will be muddied. The risk of an embarrassing court case would put paid to this tactic.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Why don't we hold our leaders to as high a standard as the people who sell us payday loans and hand cream? By making it a criminal offence for MPs to lie to the public, we can finally bring some honesty to our public discourse.",
