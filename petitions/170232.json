        "additional_details": "Misuse and misrepresentation of information which is later retracted in miniscule font tucked away in the rear of a newspaper is endemic across several publications at every point on the political spectrum and allows newspapers to circumvent regulations regarding the accuracy of their reporting, often to the detriment of the public, the political life of the country, and the safety of vulnerable people. ",

We are committed to independent self-regulation of the press and do not interfere in settling press complaints, as long as the press abides by the law particularly with regard to libel and defamation. It is therefore not the role of government to interfere with the practices of independent regulators with regard to the printing of corrections.\r\n\r\nIndependent press self-regulators, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) and IMPRESS, have an editors\u2019 code to which their members are expected to adhere, and, in line with Lord Justice Leveson\u2019s recommendations, they have the power to direct the placement and prominence of corrections. On several occasions IPSO has ordered corrections to be made on the front page.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Culture, Media and Sport ",
