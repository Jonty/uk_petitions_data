        "action": "A confirmatory referendum be held before the Government activates Section 50.",
        "additional_details": "We note that the late referendum on EU membership was passed by a narrow margin. We also note that such a result is against the apparent wishes of the democratically elected Parliament and is an unusual form of decision-making with uncertain legal standing and provenance. In the circumstances, we bear in mind the precedents of referenda in other EU countries and take notice of the requests made by leaders of the Leave campaign before the result was known. ",
        "background": "Accepting the critical nature of the issuing of an s. 50 notice to the E.U., we request that, before such a Notice is issued, a confirmatory vote be held by referendum with the present result standing unless the Remain vote has more votes than that recorded for Leave in the late Referendum.",
