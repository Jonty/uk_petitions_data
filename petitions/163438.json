        "additional_details": "There is a 50/50 split when it comes to health warnings cannabis fights cancer cells that's what we do know so why not legalise it? The previous petition said it would affect kids. I'm sorry to burst your bubble but kids will smoke it no matter if it's legal or not. Why not make it safe by growing it in clean labs? It would also be great for our economy and tourism look at Amsterdam! One of the most peaceful cities in the world!",
        "background": "Cannabis doesn't harm you I know people from all backgrounds even teaches who smoke the plant. Also it would create Jobs! Alcohol is far worse for health but that's legal. Cannabis has been smoked for 100,000 years and still nobody has died from its affects. ",
