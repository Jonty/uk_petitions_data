        "additional_details": "When we have the highest levels of scrutiny over advertising toothpaste, but very limited controls on issues of the utmost importance for our country, can this be right?  Is this proportional?\r\n\r\nDuring the EU referendum the leave campaign continued to quote \u00a3350m as the weekly cost of the EU after it was proved wrong.\r\n\r\nWithout accurate information, how can we make the right decisions? \r\n\r\nThe political exemptions for advertising and marketing in legislations and codes of practice must be removed.\r\n",
        "background": "Today, political advertising and marketing do not have to be accurate, decent, honest, legal, truthful and socially responsible. Misleading is legal.\r\n\r\nParliament must pass an Act so that political advertising and marketing has to follow the same laws and codes of practice as other organisations.",
