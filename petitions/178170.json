        "action": "Stop a race to the bottom on corporation tax",
        "additional_details": "We believe that corporations should pay their fair share of tax to fund the infrastructure and public services we all depend on. We further believe that to achieve this, there must be cooperation between nation states on tax matters. \r\n \r\nWe deplore any attempt to encourage tax competition and to foster a race to the bottom on corporate tax rates putting at risk the social investment that citizens rely on.\r\n \r\nWe call on the government to work cooperatively with our EU partners on harmonising corporate tax rates across Europe and to ensure that the main rate of UK corporation tax rate is returned to a minimum of 28%.\r\n",
        "background": "The Conservative government has suggested that if we do not get sufficient access to the single market when the UK leaves the EU, the UK would be forced to lower corporate tax rates to attract business to Britain. This is not the future we want for our country.",
