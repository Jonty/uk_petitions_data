        "additional_details": "Hundreds of thousands of children younger than 13, are employed in the UK in commercial research, testing, marketing and consultancy (ISBN1845298802). Child Employment Officers do not give them the protection they give children in performance work such as modelling & acting. Irrespective of the above Act the Officers do not regard them as being employed (NNCEE). This and the lack of protection undermine their rights as workers and can result in them being mistreated & deprived of pay (ACAS).",
