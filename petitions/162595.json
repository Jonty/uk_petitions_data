        "additional_details": "Soon to be a student nurse myself, I personally believe charging student nurses the full tuition fee will have a massive impact on how many student nurses/midwives and allied health professionals apply for these courses. Working 37.5 hours for free is a commitment these students take to fulfill their dreams, but having to pay thousands of pounds to attend the course as well will certainly put people off.",
        "background": "There is already a lack of staff nurses across the country and now the government have confirmed they will be removing NHS bursaries for pre registration students. These professional students works 37.5 hours a week with no income and no time to get a part time job.",
