        "additional_details": "Politicians are now trying to stop the us from ending the free movement of people from the E.U. and given that very high immigration was the number concern of the voters who voted to leave the E.U. they should not be allowed to undermine the will of the majority of people and they instead  must ensure that during the negotiations to leave the E.U. that ending free movement of E.U. citizens into the U.K. is a red line that cannot crossed and the people of the U.K. will not be duped! ",
        "background": "During the referendum campaign we were repeatedly told that the only way we could cut immigration to the Tens of Thousands was if we left the E.U. and stopped the free movement of people.  Then we could introduce and Australian points based system to get the numbers and the type of people we need.",
