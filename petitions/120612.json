        "additional_details": "The estimated cost of HS2 is over \u00a350 BILLION - it could be more than this of course: http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201415/ldselect/ldeconaf/134/13406.htm\r\nThe benefits of reducing the travelling time by train between Birmingham and London are arguable, but look a lot less beneficial when the cost is so great.\r\n20 years from now when HS2 is expected to be completed, it's possible that new IT infrastructure and working practices might reduce the need for business and social travel.",
        "background": "The plan to upgrade the railway link from London to Birmingham is very costly, will take many years to build and will have a negative impact on the environment and many people's lives. Far better to spend the money allocated for this on social housing.",
