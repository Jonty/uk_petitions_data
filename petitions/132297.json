        "additional_details": "Thameslink Govia's poor management is evident in:\r\nThe lack of adequate contingency plans to cope with disruption.\r\nPoor & inaccurate information provided to customers \r\nThe ongoing staffing disputes without major disruption to the network. \r\nContinually increasing fares with declining service levels\r\n\r\nWe urge the government to urgently review the situation and award the franchise to a company which can deliver a consistent, good level of service.\r\n",
        "background": "Govia Thameslink has the highest number of passenger journeys but the lowest customer satisfaction rates and the lowest PPM of any UK rail network. There has been a continuous decline in their PPM measure since 2015. They have the second highest rate of cancellation & significantly late running.\r\n\r\n",
