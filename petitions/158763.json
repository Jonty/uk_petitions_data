        "additional_details": "A specific example is Michael Gove's endorsement of a poster specifically promising an additional \u00a3350m per week of funding for the NHS if the UK left the EU. His \"campaign bus\" was also emblazoned with a slogan further supporting this message. These claims potentially influenced the outcome of a critical national referendum. It is believed that at the time of doing so Gove knew this figure to be grossly inaccurate and that the pledge was not within the campaign group's gift to uphold.",
        "background": "It is believed Gove deliberately misled the UK electorate & made claims he knew to be false for his own personal gain. If as believed he purposefully & deliberately misled the UK public Gove's position as a public servant ought to be untenable.",

The expression \"vote of no confidence\" is used when talking about a vote in the House of Commons which tests whether or not the Government of the day has the confidence of a majority of MPs in the House of Commons. That's why we allow petitions asking for a vote of no confidence in the Government or in individual Ministers. The concept of the House having \u201cconfidence\u201d in someone does not apply to backbench or Opposition Members."
