        "additional_details": "Our democracy and constitution ought to be respected. Therefore, it is constitutionally requisite that parliament debate and scrutinize all particulars of \u201cLeave\u201d legislation.\r\n\r\nOur MPs are representatives, not delegates. It is NOT and never has been their constitutional role to merely take instruction from their constituents, nor the Executive, but rather to scrutinize legislation presented for the overall good, amending as necessary, hopefully to improve it. \r\n\r\nWe demand this role be performed.",
        "background": "One of the stated aims of those who wished to leave the EU was to assert the constitutional principle of parliamentary supremacy, but the government has attempted to cut out parliament\u2019s oversight of the legislation. We insist that parliament exercise its supremacy to approve \"Leave\" legislation.",

            "details": "Petitions need to call on the Government or Parliament to take a specific action. We're not sure exactly what you'd like to happen. \r\n\r\nParliament already debates, scrutinises and decides on primary legislation (Acts of Parliament). For example, Parliament has just decided on the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill.  \r\n\r\nThere are other kinds of legislation, called secondary (or delegated) legislation. These usually make detailed changes to existing law, using powers given in an Act of Parliament. There are different kinds of secondary legislation. Some of these have to be agreed to by Parliament.  \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.  For example, you could start a petition asking the Government to submit all of its plans for the UK's exit from the European Union for scrutiny in Parliament. \r\n\r\nYou may also wish to sign this petition:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/182254"
