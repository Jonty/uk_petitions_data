        "additional_details": "After speaking to a council official, he confirmed that a 'broken line' cycle path allows cars to park in them. What's the point in the cycle path then?? I, and thousands of others do our best to stay out of the way of motorists but with these 'joke' cycle paths, that makes it borderline impossible. \r\nSo the reason for this petition is simple. Make cycle paths just that. CYCLE PATHS! This way, cyclists are safe and we are out the way of motorists. ",
