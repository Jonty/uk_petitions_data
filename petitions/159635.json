        "additional_details": "Due to the scale of the campaigns both for and against leaving the EU. This is a very complicated topic and it will be difficult to investigate thoroughly. I would like to propose a full inquiry immediately which would address any personal agendas involved in the referendum campaigns and the sources for the factual information released. I think the British people are owed this corrected and valuable information and those who were not truthful to be held accountable.",
        "background": "During the confusing & fast moving times of the EU referendum campaign, factual information was released every single day into the public domain. These 'facts' did not stay consistent throughout the campaign and I propose a full investigation into the 'facts' from media outlets & both main parties.",
