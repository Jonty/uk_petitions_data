        "additional_details": "Mental health should be a part of every teacher\u2019s learning, so they can actively support the mental health needs of children and young people, and step in before problems escalate.\r\nWhile most teachers know the basics of first aid, they have no first aid box to turn to when worried a child might be in distress. It appears to me that teachers feel out of their depth, so shy away from talking about the subject, not knowing how to broach it. Most are simply not equipped to meet its challenges.",
