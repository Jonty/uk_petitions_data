        "additional_details": "Men who served under him are on record as saying he was 'not merely immoral, but criminal'.\r\nHe was known as the 'Donkey, leading Lions'.\r\nHe allegedly developed a system of working out how many of the enemy had been killed, by counting the number of allied losses, and became angry when some of our regiments had not lost enough men.\r\nPlease let's replace it with something more appropriate and less controversial. \r\n",
        "background": "General 'butcher' Haig sent hundreds of thousands of men to their inevitable deaths through, arguably, incompetence or possibly pig-headedness, during the first world war.\r\nIt is an absolute insult to relatives of the fallen, to have to file past his statue on rememberance days.\r\n",
