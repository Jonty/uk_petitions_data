        "action": "Due to changed circumstances (Trump), rehold UK EU Membership referendum",
        "additional_details": "The election of Donald J. Trump and the ensuing instability, both within America and on the global stage, was not anticipated by any serious political commentators when the UK EU Membership referendum was conducted. The decision to leave the European Union was therefore made on the assumption that America and its global engagement would continue unchanged. His election, and its consequences, constitution a significant material change worthy of we the public revisiting the referendum.",
        "background": "We the undersigned believe the election of Donald J. Trump to the Presidency of the United States of America represents a material change to the circumstances under which the UK EU Membership referendum was conducted, and call on Parliament to enable a second referendum on this topic.",
