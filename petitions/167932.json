        "additional_details": "The outcome of the advisory referendum on 23rd June means that the government must now propose defined exit plans for terms of leaving the EU.\r\n\r\nHowever, leaving the EU is too momentous a decision to proceed without a clear understanding of the proposed model.\r\n\r\nWe call for a public vote to be held before Article 50 is invoked, on the options for the future UK/EU (and global) trade model with impartial assessments of the consequences of each option, including the option of staying in the EU.",
        "background": "In June the UK electorate voted to leave the EU by a narrow majority. It has since become clear that there was no clear plan defined and little information given about the options. A public decision can only be valid if a clear intent of the direction the government wishes to take us is proposed.",
