        "additional_details": "Being a gay teen, I often worried I would become homeless just because I was gay. I am one of the lucky ones, but sadly 20% of LGBTQ+ people are homeless, and the LGBTQ+ community make up 10% of the UK population. Transgender individuals are 5x likely to be denied housing to transphobia. The feeling of rejection one feels when your own family stigmatise their own for how they were born matters. It is unfair and wrong to be forced to live in squalor because of something we cannot change.",
        "background": "As I came out to my parents, I prepared to live on the streets because I feared my parents' rejection. This happens to hundreds of (usually teenage) LGBT+ people per year. This petition would call for more accurate statistics on LGBT+ homelessness/help for those who are already homeless.",
