        "additional_details": "The Chilcot report describes the failures of government planning and inadequate Parliamentary scrutiny that led to the disastrous intervention in Iraq. Should Article 50 be invoked, without a plan scrutinised by parliament, as some propose, we could see a future enquiry coming to similar conclusions about Brexit. ",
        "background": "The Government\u2019s plan for Brexit must be rigorously scrutinised by Parliament, before Article 50 is invoked. MPs should consider whether the Government\u2019s plan is realistic, achievable, adequately manages risk and benefits the people of Britain. Don't repeat the failure of scrutiny which led to Iraq.",
