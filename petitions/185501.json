        "action": "Help disabled people to work by abolishing the cap on Access to Work payments",
        "additional_details": "ATW enables disabled people to work by paying for equipment, PAs or extra travel costs. From April 2018, people will not be able to claim over \u00a340,800 a year. This cap will only save \u00a33 million but make it almost impossible for severely disabled people to work and cause huge distress. It contradicts the Government\u2019s aim to increase the number of disabled people with jobs. It also does not make economic sense. For every \u00a31 spent on ATW, \u00a31.48 returns to the Exchequer in tax or benefits savings.",
        "background": "The Access to Work Scheme helps disabled people to work by paying for the extra costs they face. In April 2018, the Government is planning to impose an arbitrary cap on how much money a person can claim. This will make it far harder for disabled people to find and keep a job.",
