Right now, the country needs stability more than ever before during his tenure. He might not agree with Brexit but, as he says, democratic leaders 'deliver the instruction' of their nation. They do not walk away when they are most needed. ",

In his resignation speech, he said that, 'the will of the British People is an instruction that must be delivered'. Let him practice what he preaches and continue to 'deliver' our instruction of May 2015. ",
