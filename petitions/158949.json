        "additional_details": "Decent and honourable British citizens are appalled at the implied use of these residents as a bargaining chip in the 'Brexit' negotiations. We are confident that an immediate and unequivocal assurance of the kind requested by this petition will be met by corresponding assurances from other EU member states in respect of UK citizens living in those states. This will make the process of British withdrawal from the EU, if we finally go down that route, a more positive and constructive one.",
        "background": "Following the result of the referendum on EU membership, the Government is equivocating about the status of (non-UK) EU citizens living here, presumably many of whom came here under the freedom of movement principle of the EU, of which the UK is still a member. ",
