        "additional_details": "1 in 10 incidents involving horses ends in a fatality for individuals and almost always for the horse. Although accidents involving horses are not required to be recorded as an official incident, unless a person is injured, it happens quite frequently and can be traumatising for both horse owners and motorists. \r\nIn the past, I have witnessed a horse being hit on a busy main road. The horse was badly injured and died at the scene. The owner of the horse was also injured and extremely traumatised.",
        "background": "Stop allowing horses to be ridden or pull a cart on main roads. Horses on main roads can cause serious danger and distress to the horse due to fast moving, loud vehicles. It can also cause major distruption for motorists who are often unable to over-take which can lead to queue build up.",
