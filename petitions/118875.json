This helps the Government to fulfil its legal obligation to reduce national CO2 emissions. \r\n\r\nUnlike for cars, it has only been mandatory for CO2 emissions data to be included as part of the type approval process for motorcycles since 1 January 2016. Therefore, it has not been possible to base motorcycle VED rates on CO2 emissions. The current engine capacity based rates offer the most practical and easy-to-understand way to reflect the respective emissions of motorcycles. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the average motorcycle owner pays \u00a354 per year \u2013 a lot less than the top VED rate of \u00a381 per year \u2013 and the average car owner pays \u00a3166 per year. In addition, under this Government, VED rate increases for motorcycles have been limited to inflation only, meaning that all motorcyclists\u2019 VED liability remains unchanged in real terms since 2010.\r\n\r\nHM Treasury",
