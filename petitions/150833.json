        "additional_details": "The current system allows for those in public office to write their manifestos to appeal only to more politically engaged demographics and ignore subpopulations who statistically vote less. Mandatory voting would encourage engagement, increase turnout and enable our government to better understand the will of all citizens they govern rather than only those that vote currently. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, this still allows a person to use their vote in protest, as spoiled and blank ballots could be posted.",
        "background": "Democracy is about finding the will of all people as fairly as possible. Making voting a requirement or duty to all registered would increase political engagement and hopefully leave nobody behind when policy-making. Ambivalence can be expressed with a spoiled vote. Abstention punishable by fine",
