        "additional_details": "Might I suggest that there is a clause that after a specified period of time (say six years) since we have officially left the EU, the people of both Ireland & Northern Ireland can decide whether they would like their current situation to stay the same, Northern Ireland to reunify with Ireland, or whether The Republic of Ireland would like to rejoin the United Kingdom.",
        "background": "As part of The government's Brexit talks, there should be a discussion about a possible Re-Unification of Ireland. As Northern Ireland will now be our only physical border with the EU, some kind of border controls will have to be implemented, to stop any unrestricted movement across the UK border.",
