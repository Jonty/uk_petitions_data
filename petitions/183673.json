        "additional_details": "For hundreds of years the Whigs were a fixture of our parliamentary system. Alas the Whigs are gone but there was much rejoicing for at least the wigs remained: on the heads of the speaker and the clerks. For many happy years the wigs remained, their solemn dignity showing that the House of Commons was a serious place. \r\n\r\nHowever, John Bercow seeks to remove the wigs from the clerks. \r\n\r\nI urge Parliament to do whatever necessary to block this decision \u2014 much in the fashion of the vellum situation.",
        "background": "A petition to urge the Speaker to reconsider his decision and if he will not to request that Parliament do whatever necessary to maintain the well-loved tradition of the clerks wearing wigs in the House of Commons. ",
