The United Kingdom (UK) Parliament sitting at Westminster is morally and legally now obliged to obey the peoples wish. \r\n\r\n\r\nAfter repealing ECA [1972] the UK Government can trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty and negotiate with the EU.  \r\n\r\nWe the undersigned do not trust the Government nor Westminster Parliament as a body to be truthful with us, you have purposefully kept the people of the UK ignorant about the EU for 43 years, even our children have  not been taught about the structures and workings of the EU in school. \r\nTherefore we demand also that the people are kept informed about all of the negotiations and agreements our Government makes with the EU.    \r\n",
