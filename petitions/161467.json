        "additional_details": "While many have signed a petition asking for a second referendum, it is also important to highlight the lack of legitimacy of the first referendum. \r\n\r\nMany who voted leave were expressing discontent with the status quo. Many were also relying on false information.\r\n\r\nProf. Michael Dougan, constitutional lawyer, evaluates the referendum:\r\nhttp://youtu.be/0dosmKwrAbI\r\n\r\nHe concludes that the leave campaign rested on false promises, and the government has a duty to protect the national interest.",
        "background": "Government to acknowledge that the misinformation in the Brexit campaign means the referendum result lacks legitimacy, and the result is not a mandate to leave the EU. Government and members of parliament to announce, both collectively and as individuals, that they will act to keep the UK in the EU.",
