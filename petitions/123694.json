        "additional_details": "These free baby groups are a fantastic way for new families to get out and share their experiences with others and also to stimulate their babies and toddlers, which ultimately leads to happier parents and children. Many of these families cannot afford to attend groups that you have to pay for and cutting these groups will lead to the social exclusion of these families. ",
        "background": "At the end of this month all free baby groups in Hastings will be stopped. These include antenatal classes, Aquababes and stay and play classes held in children's centres and at Hastings museum. These classes are vital for new families who can often feel isolated or overwhelmed. ",
