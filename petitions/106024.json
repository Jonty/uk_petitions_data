        "additional_details": "Cancelling the RFL instantly benefits neither the DVLA or the user, it just potentially criminalises the user. To permit the user 48 hours grace to move the vehicle would be basically revenue neutral for the DVLA.\r\nThe current system was implemented, not thought about or designed.\r\nThe DVLA already enjoy the benefit of the current tax changes, they do not need to punish the private motorist.",
        "background": "When you buy a car the current Road Fund Licence (RFL) is cancelled instantly. You have to tax it instantly to be able to drive it home, or break the law.\r\nThis makes no sense and is extremely inconvenient.",
