        "additional_details": "Dogs are stimulated by noise and movement. Unfortunately most children will be running around making a noise when they meet dogs. There are many kits already available, specifically aimed at teachers, such as http://www.clickertraining.com/node/3535 or http://www.be-a-tree.com/. It would be very easy for the Government to develop something similar for use in schools and is an easy way to educate everyone, as I'm sure children could be encouraged to impart what they have learned to their family. ",
        "background": "I would like to see training provided to children in schools as to how to behave around dogs, in particular, the method of 'Be a Tree'.  The rationale behind this is in order to help prevent dog bites as a number of parents/adults are not aware of the behaviours that can lead to them. ",
