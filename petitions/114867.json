        "action": "Have an enforceability paragraph included in every court order made by a judge",
        "additional_details": "By including an enforceability paragraph will give the relevant authorities the additional tools required to do their jobs more effectively. This will hopefully help better protect our children families and friends. I cannot bring back my son jai but hopefully with your help we can help others. Therefore I would be grateful if you would sign my petition to try to make a change.  It only takes 2 minutes to do but could potentially be life saving. Thank you in advance for your support",
        "background": "After the death of my son jai at the tender age of 4, I learnt that all court orders are not necessarily enforceable, as they do not include powers for removal or enforcement. I cannot understand how an order made by a judge is not enforceable. Were is the deterrent or logic? The purpose of a judge?",
