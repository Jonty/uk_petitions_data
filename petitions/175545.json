        "additional_details": "Racial divide and the concept of the 'foreign other' is not natural. No child is born to notice that others are of a different skin tone to them - it is something that society engrains in us over time. Children must be taught that we are all equal for this country to truly prosper and lead from the front. Almost all hate crimes could be avoided if people were taught about racial equality from primary school onwards. The PM must be more proactive and not shirk her responsibility in this regard.",
        "background": "The state of race relations in the UK (and Europe) is worse than it has ever been during the course of my life. The concept of racial equality and appreciation of other religions, cultures and ethnicities must be taught from primary school onwards, so as to ensure that the UK operates harmoniously. ",
