        "additional_details": "The current Act prohibits commercial airlines from discriminating against passengers with disabilities. However it has no provision to protect the rights of those who,because of their disabilities and for safety reasons, cannot sit in a standard airline passenger seat so must remain seated in their personal wheelchairs like my son. he is prevented to travel except by land vehicles,trains,or ships.This is a blatant breach on their civil rights and access to affordable and expedient transportation",
        "background": "My Son and many many others like him cannot access air travel as he needs to remain in his wheelchair at all times. To transfer a young adult from his chair to a seat requires a hoist, furthermore the seat is not designed to meet his posture and he will be in major discomfort whilst flying.",
