        "action": "Hold a second EU membership referendum with voting extended to 16-18 year-olds",
        "additional_details": "If 16 and 17-year-olds had been allowed to vote - as with the 2014 Scottish referendum - the result would have been very different. \r\nPolling shows that 82% of 16-18 year-olds would have voted REMAIN. With 1.46 million 16-18 year-olds in the UK, that would have matched the 1.2 million difference between OUT and IN - and changed the result decisively. \r\nMany experts have urged a second referendum. Our membership of the EU affects the entire world, all UK citizens - and especially the young. ",
        "background": "The EU membership referendum resulted in a very close win for LEAVE. Only 37.4 % of eligible voters in fact voted OUT. \r\nBrexit would affect the youngest generations more than anyone else; as in the Scottish referendum, the UK's 16-18 year-olds should be allowed to vote - in a second EU referendum.",
