        "additional_details": "Auto Immune Hepatitis affects 1 in 10000 people. There is no cure although it can sometimes be managed with medication it generally results in the need for a transplant. There are numerous conditions that affect the liver that can lead to transplant such as biliary atresia. All of these conditions are not self inflicted yet the individual is penalized and has to pay for medication for life. I have researched this and diabetics do not have to pay for their medication so why do transplant patients",
        "background": "My daughter, aged 14 was taken ill last year with a rare liver condition called Auto Immune Hepatitis requiring a liver transplant. She received this in December but then we found out she would be on medication for life and once she reached 18 this would not be free although she needs this to live.",
