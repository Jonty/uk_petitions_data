SIGN AND SHARE for Justice for Chunky.",
        "background": "Recently a chihuahua dog called Chunky was brutally attacked by thugs & it was one of the worst attacks seen by the RSPCA. Chunky had his neck broken, eyes set on fire, fed drugs and dumped. This is UNACCEPTABLE, the attackers were only banned from keeping animals for 5 years. This is not enough.",
