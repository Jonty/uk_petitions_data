        "action": "Protect the financially vulnerable with a system which blocks lending.",
        "additional_details": "We appreciate it would be impossible to vet every person who applies for lending, yet we would like the credit reference agencies to apply markers to credit files to prevent lending to vulnerable people being agreed. \r\n\r\nThese could be applied by carers or medical professionals either on a temporary or permanent basis. We believe this would not only provide relief for the carer but also protection for all vulnerable adults no matter who the lender may be.  ",
        "background": "Currently, in the UK, we do not have a system that protects people that are financially vulnerable and who do not have capacity to make such important financial decisions. Meaning vulnerable adults can be signed up to credit agreements accumulating debt without the carers knowledge.",
