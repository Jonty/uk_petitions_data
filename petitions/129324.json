        "additional_details": "For many women their career is over when they have a family as they want to return to their profession more flexibly but no jobs are available. The private sector needs to mirror the public sector where many opportunities are available. \r\nThey will then be able to utilise the skills of women they have trained for much longer and this will lead to more women in senior roles.\r\nThis is timely with the new legislation regarding equal pay.\r\nWe understand that some senior roles can't be done part time.\r\n",
        "background": "The aim is to encourage large companies to offer more senior part time or job share work, to mirror the public sector where many such roles are available, e.g. teachers and doctors.  More transparency should help inclusion, and lead to a better gender balance at senior levels in the private sector.",
