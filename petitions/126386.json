        "action": "Call on the UK Government to urge the EU to increase tariffs on subsidised steel",
        "additional_details": "Due to State subsidies & overproduction, the Chinese steel industry has undercut EU steel by selling at prices which are lower than the production costs. This process has had the effect of depressing the whole market & jeopardising the future of steel making in the EU, including in the UK. Tata Steel, for example, has decided to sell all its UK plants citing cheap imports as a contributing factor. Any future steel production in the UK would face the same issue unless our government acts swiftly.",
        "background": "The dumping of subsidised Chinese steel threatens the existence of the UK steel industry with, potentially, thousands becoming unemployed. This is not just a problem in the UK; cheap imports threaten steel making in the wider EU. We should call on the EU to impose higher tariffs on such imports. ",
