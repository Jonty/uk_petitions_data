        "additional_details": "To stop the charges being levied unfairly there should be a 14 day cooling off period before any service charges, secondly, as many of these services don't send a confirmation text that a subscription has been set up the mobile phone user may not know. The law must be changed to stop these unfair subscriptions and charges.",
        "background": "Many mobile phone users have found themselves subscribed to premium rate services which are charged to their phone bills simply because they closed an unwanted pop up advert while browsing the internet. There is no cooling off period, and usually no confirmation text so bill payer is not aware!",
