Surely if the rent was lowered there would be smaller claims for Housing Benefit.  That can only be common sense to lower the rent and reduce the amount of Housing Benefit being claimed?? There is nothing included in her \u00a3189.00 per week rent, e.g. water rates or care taking facilities.",

She is under so much stress and anxiety trying to get work to cover the rent, where a flat with Circle 33, that is 2 minutes away is \u00a3129.00 per week. ",

Most Housing Associations will have different types of rent across different properties which they own, including social rent, affordable rent and market rent. Housing Associations are independent of Government and Parliament so the Government is not responsible for the rents they charge.\r\n\r\nThe Homes and Communities Agency regulates some aspects of rents charged by Housing Associations. This regulation is the responsibility of Government, so we could accept a new petition about rent regulation, for example, calling on the Government to prohibit Housing Associations from charging anything more than social rent on their properties."
