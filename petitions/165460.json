        "additional_details": "Also, as minor as it seems, there seems to be an inequality with how cats, dogs and other pets are treated. For example, people are obliged to care more when a dog is hit by a car than say a cat or rabbit. They should be treated the same, with everything. This includes health treatment and how they're advertised when up for adoption, among other things.",
        "background": "Animal abuse is a serious issue in the UK, yet it's been neglected to an extent. There should be stricter laws in place to protect animals, such as cats and dogs, and punish those who neglect and abuse them severely, for example. This includes those who breed them improperly, licenced or not. ",
