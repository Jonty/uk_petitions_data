        "background": "In 2014 stats show that some 220 people were killed in crashes in which a driver was over the legal limit, 880 were seriously injured. Nearly 1 in 6 of all deaths on the road involve drivers who are over the legal alcohol limit. This is still too high and people still think it's OK to drink-drive.",
