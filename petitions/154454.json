        "additional_details": "The referendum of the 23rd of June 2016 was biased by conflicts of interest and false information on both sides of the debate. Citizens of the United Kingdom were not aware of the implications of their vote until after they had made it. Parliament now has a mandate to act that does not accurately represent the views of the people of the United Kingdom or the issues at stake. The outcome of the referendum should be discarded and it should be run again properly.  If citizens aged 16 and 17 can participate that rule should be applied equally not just in Scotland.  ",
        "background": "Whilst Parliament is sovereign it has a duty to ensure that when a question is put to the people it is clearly explained and understood equally by all citizens of the UK so that they can provide Parliament with a clear and decisive mandate to act on their behalf. ",
