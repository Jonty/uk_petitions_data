        "additional_details": "The current government is divided and in disarray following the referendum in which the electorate has expressed a slight preference for leaving the EU. The United Kingdom needs a strong and united government to lead the nation through this complex and difficult process, and the electorate deserves an opportunity to confirm that this is really the direction we should be taking. An early general election would provide a clear mandate for starting the process of leaving the EU.",
