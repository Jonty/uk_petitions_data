        "additional_details": "One of the main reasons the suicide rate for men is so high is the stigma around mental health. Many men feel like they have to stick to the stereotype; stay strong and act \"manly\", meaning they don't express their emotions and do not seek help when they need it. I believe the money should be used to set up services for men in Manchester to use, which allows them to talk about their problems and express how they feel with no one judging them or mocking them for being \"feminine\"",
        "background": "Worryingly of the 6,233 suicides in 2013 a shocking 78% were men. The council were recently given a \u00a36 billion budget for the NHS, I believe more of this money should be used to help support males who are suffering from mental health issues and also to break the stigmas around these issues ",
