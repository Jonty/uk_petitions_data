        "additional_details": "During the process, methane gas and toxic chemicals leach out from the system and contaminate nearby groundwater. Methane concentrations are 17x higher in drinking-water wells near fracturing sites than normal wells. Contaminated well water is used for drinking water. There have been over 1,000 documented cases of water contamination next to areas of gas drilling as well as cases of sensory, respiratory, and neurological damage due to ingested contaminated water. http://www.dangersoffracking.com",
        "background": "Scientific evidence is overwhelming that fracking leads to devastating consequences for the environment. It is unacceptable that this is allowed to happen for a small amount of people to profit from what will be our misery and expense. ",
