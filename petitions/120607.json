        "action": "Reduce state pension age for construction workers",
        "additional_details": "There are many life expectancy studies, relating to all occupations , that will back up this petition and the HSE will confirm the occupational hazards and illnesses, that construction workers are exposed to on a daily basis. The studies do vary with data suggesting that construction workers die between 6  to 10 years earlier than people in white collar office occupations. Construction workers morally deserve a period of rest,  just as much as other workers do, at the end of our shorter lives. \r\n",
        "background": "I,ve been an electrician in construction since i was 16 and constantly hear about many colleagues having very little or, no retirement due to ill health caused by the exposure to chemicals, asbestos etc.  and the physical toll to our bodies, especially joints, due to the nature of our work. Help us.",
