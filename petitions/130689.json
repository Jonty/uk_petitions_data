        "additional_details": "Our dog was part of the family as i'm sure most dogs are. If someone runs a dog over and they are at fault then I believe they should be senented for killing the dog, what if next time it's a child? \r\nThe law classes dog's as property like a T.V. if your T.V breaks you relace it, you can't just replace a dog with another as they become part of the family.\r\n",
        "background": "Our family dog was recently run over by a speeding motorbike. Our dog was on a lead and this only happened because the rider of the bike was speeding. The law classes dogs as a possession so the rider of the bike can not be sentenced for killing our dog. ",
