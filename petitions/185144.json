        "additional_details": "Almost every piece of plastic ever produced still exists today. Most single-use plastic straws are discarded, often winding up in landfill, or contributing to the 8 million tons of plastic entering the sea every year.\r\nFollowing the introduction of the 5p charge on plastic carrier bags in England, usage fell by 85% in just 6 months. Millions have been donated to charity as a result of the scheme and millions more have been saved in clean-up costs. We can achieve the same with plastic straws. ",
        "background": "The average plastic straw is used for just 20 minutes, but will long out-live its user. The majority of plastic straws are not recycled, often winding up in landfill or in the ocean. Introduce a 5p charge on plastic straws to reduce the UK's plastic waste, for both the environment and the economy.",
