        "additional_details": "I spend hundreds of pounds a year to ensure my work is up to standard. This is not what university is about.\r\nYour grade should not be based on how much you are able to spend on modelling materials and printing, but your actual skills.\r\nI would like to see the student loan company take the cost of a course into account when deciding loan amounts.",
        "background": "Studying at university is an incredibly expensive thing to choose to do, however the added cost of buying materials and printing work for those on art-based courses means that, without extra help from family and carers, it's virtually impossible.",
