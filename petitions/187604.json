        "background": "In the town where I live my cousin was walking home from work and found a Goldfish outside our local park in a bag during freezing cold temperatures.\r\nThis fish obviously wasnt wanted so somebody dumped it.\r\nWe have animal friendly circus companies now so why is the cruelty at other places allowed?",
