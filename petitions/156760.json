        "additional_details": "My son saw a picture that was on my Facebook page and it stated dads are just as important as mums.  I was shocked at my 7 year old sons response he looked at it laughed and said with no hesitation no they are not and walked away. I was so upset at this because one day my boys will be dads too. And they will start life having a very  low estimate of themselves as fathers.  And I think it's time for dads to make a stand for our children...",
        "background": "it's diabolical that legal aid has been removed from family law. Dads all over the country are not getting a fair hearing and through lack of knowledge and unfair rules that favor the mother we are loosing are kids. the law needs to be changed to stop mothers alienating fathers from their own blood",
