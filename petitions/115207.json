        "additional_details": "I feel we all need to take action because a lot of people are suffering and the suicide rate will only rise otherwise because not only do people who suffer from depression and etc have to deal with the illness but they have to deal with the ignorance and stigma attached aswell. I don't think this is right at all because it backs people into a corner and then they feel that there is no way out. I am speaking from experience and I feel that only people who have been through it truly understands what it's like to suffer with a mental health issue and we need some empathy and not judgement from everybody else who doesn't know what it's like.",
