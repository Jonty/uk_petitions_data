        "action": "Introduce a health/sight check for drivers over 70",
        "additional_details": "This petition asks the UK Government to introduce a basic health/sight check and simple driving theory test at 70, repeated at five-year intervals. If these tests raise any doubts about the ability of the driver, they should have to sit a practical driving test.\r\nIn a recent accident, an elderly driver using the wrong lane of a motorway caused a fatal accident. The petitioner himself has been knocked from his motorcycle twice by elderly drivers. \r\n",
        "background": "The number of elderly drivers is growing, and pose a serious road safety risk. UK police do not record the 'at fault' driver, but studies in the USA suggest drivers over 75 are as significant a risk as teenagers. Currently, elderly UK drivers never face any form of re-test or health check. ",
