        "additional_details": "Only a small minority of party members elect their leader; if they win the most seats in a General Election they become PM. A directly elected PM need not be a party member or politician but perhaps someone without has succeeded in other areas of life and can form a cabinet of the most talented MPs and not just their party members thereby reducing party politics. At the end of their term elected PM will be judged by the public as whether they fulfilled their promises to you.",
        "background": "The allusion of regaining sovereignty it false after the EU referendum. No one directly elects a PM. It is government policy to have directly elected Mayors so it follows that for the most important elected official in the UK should also be directly elected and not assume power. ",
