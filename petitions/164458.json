        "additional_details": "There is a fee of \u00a38.40 per item for medications, for someone like my mum who could pay a potential fee of \u00a351.60 a month for a illness that she can not help, or can not be cured. With her \"season ticket\" she pays \u00a3132 a year!\r\n\r\nIn Scotland and Wales, prescriptions are free. Over 65's also do not pay, aswell as people with problems such as diabetes or thyroid disorders. \r\nThis differs from people with chronic illnesses, who often can not work and get less money.\r\n ",
