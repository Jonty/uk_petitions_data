        "additional_details": "\r\nWe live in a society that thrives off advanced technology, therefore we should be taking advantage of all the opportunities available from this privilege. We are no longer restricted to text books and the cruel, unnecessary practices such as dissection; other methods such as sophisticated computer software are available and have been shown to teach anatomy and complex biological processes. This is the perfect chance to leave a controversial and cruel practice in the past. \r\n",
        "background": "As a student who is obliged to take part in these \"experiments\", I am able to stand up and protest against cruelty. I am aware that many children are upset and disturbed by dissection, but would not have the confidence to refuse to participate and confront their teachers on the matter. \r\n",
