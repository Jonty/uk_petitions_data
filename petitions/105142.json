        "additional_details": "With the advent of social media and networking, it is now easier than ever for individuals to set themselves up as rescues.  Whilst there are laws to safeguard the wellbeing of animals, there are none to control who should be allowed to create an organisation to do so and many animals are being rehomed without assessment and preparation or proper follow up care.\r\n\r\nThis is not acceptable and does nothing to promote responsible pet ownership",
        "background": "We request that all organisations calling themselves Animal Rescues or Sanctuaries (including those registered with the Charities Commission) to be registered and inspected annually",
