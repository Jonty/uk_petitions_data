        "action": "Stop foreign workers taking British jobs in culturally important industries",
        "additional_details": "This must be applied to all, particularly to Sports clubs and especially football. The only exception should be that each club is allowed 1 coach & 1 player to be non Brit. The invasion of football with foreigners is hurting the ability of young Brits to develop & gain experience, this is hurting the national team. There are 100's of talented young Brits who could fill these roles so foreigners aren't required. Culturally significant industries are Sport, Media and Show business.",
        "background": "We petition the Government to apply any immigration controls implemented Post Brexit to all industries, even culturally important ones, with very few exceptions even if the company or foreigner is extremely rich. Especially where there are young British people eager to do the jobs with the skills",
