        "additional_details": "I was referred to Tavistock in London in April/May 2016 and my referral got accepted around November 2016, I am still currently waiting for an appointment 9/10 months on from my referral date. From personal experience, the NHS are an incredible asset to the UK and without it we'd undeniably be in a much worse position. However, Gender Clinics are very far stretched and I struggle with the wait hugely which has major impacts on my mental health. I'm not the only one with this issue, fact.",
        "background": "There are currently two Gender Clinics in the UK - one in London and one in Leeds. The waiting list for both clinics can be up to 18 months, sometimes even longer, because of the increase in acceptance and openness about gender identity.  ",
