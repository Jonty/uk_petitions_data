        "additional_details": "Fake News is not new. In the late 1980s and early 1990s Boris Johnson reported on the European Commission. At the time: \"Many of his fellow journalists ... were critical of his articles, opining that they often contained untruths designed to discredit the Commission, with The Guardian's John Palmer stating that \"as a journalist he is thoroughly irresponsible, making up stories.\" \" From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson#The_Times_and_The_Daily_Telegraph:_1987.E2.80.9394 (17-02-2017)",
        "background": "Over the years a lot of fake news has been about the EU that has been repeated so often that people now think its TRUE. The DCMS inquiry into the impact of fake news on the democratic process may show that the result of the EU Referendum is unsound due to the undue influence of this deceptive news.",
