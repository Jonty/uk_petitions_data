        "additional_details": "The biggest outstanding questions is whether or not an article 50 invocation can be withdrawn or not. Others are around the scope of what can be negotiated and what needs to be agreed before the conclusion of article 50. The Government should establish all outstanding questions from the public and seek answers from the EU before article 50 is ever invoked.",
        "background": "Article 50 of the EU describes the method of how a country leaves the EU. There is insufficient information within the text of the article to properly understand how the mechanics of it would work. The government should seek answers to all outstanding questions prior to invocation.",
