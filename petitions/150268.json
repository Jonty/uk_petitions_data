        "action": "Revoke the Barnett Formula immediately and make all UK subjects equally funded",
        "additional_details": "Since the result of the referendum, the SNP (elected by around 1.5 million voters) is attempting to subvert the political process. In part, the extra funding they receive via the Barnett Formula is funding their process and gaining them political support. As an English voter, I believe that this is unfair. I call on the government to revoke the Barnett Formula immediately in the hope that Scotland will realise how precarious their financial status is, and to give the UK a level playing field.",
        "background": "The SNP have been disruptive in the extreme and do not recognise the financial support they receive from the other UK members. Their leader has reacted negatively to the wishes of the UK as a whole, yet continues to receive additional funding over, say, an Englishman. This is unfair in the extreme",
