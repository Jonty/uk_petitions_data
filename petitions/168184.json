        "additional_details": "If the UK remains a party to the European Convention on Human Rights, vegans may have to rely on foreign courts (in Strasbourg) for protection.\r\n\r\nBut if the UK also withdraws from the European Convention on Human Rights, vegans may not be protected at all.\r\n\r\nSo either way, it is vital that the Government's Bill of Rights, intended to replace the Human Rights Act, provides just as much protection.\r\n\r\nWe would also expect to see the same protection for all other groups currently protected by the Act.",
        "background": "By protecting vegans from discrimination and bullying, the Human Rights Act makes it easier to stay vegan - indirectly reducing animal exploitation.\r\n\r\nBut leaving the EU, and replacing the Human Rights Act with a Bill Of Rights, puts such protection at risk.\r\n\r\nMore at http://veganrights.uk\r\n \r\n \r\n",
