        "additional_details": "After the July referendum MPs are now discussing what we should do and when we should do it. \r\n\r\nThis is because the options weren't clear enough and it is in the interests of democracy to ask the population how they want to deal with Europe with regards to the key issues of membership, economy, trade and immigration.\r\n\r\nIn short, as we currently have no public consensus on a plan, we are currently set to have a new Prime Minister elected only by Tory Party members choose what we do.",
        "background": "A referendum not grouping policies on what we should do about the EU so the decision isn't made without asking the people.\r\n\r\nSuggested options -\r\n\r\nRemain in the EU\r\nLeave but remain in the EEA\r\nLeave the EU & EEA, keeping trade agreements \r\nLeave all EU agreements",
