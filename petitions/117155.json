Peoples and businesses ruined possessions  out on the streets \r\nSome of this could have been avoided by providing flood defenses, keeping drains,gullies clear, not building on flood planes and  many other reasons.\r\nThe Government should be funding this before sending aid abroad, many of these countries don't require it\r\n",
        "background": "Stop the Government sending money abroad in International aid when its required for flood defences in the UK.\r\n \u00a312 billion has been sent abroad this year, much of this on anti-flood schemes.\r\nThe latest figures show the anti-flooding budget is down by 14 per cent compared with last year\r\n\r\n\r\n.
