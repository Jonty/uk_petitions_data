        "additional_details": "NHT would be in addition to VAT but NOT be applied to direct income.\r\nFor example current VAT at 20% could be raised to 21% to include 1% NHT. The government could no longer be blamed for not having enough cash as the NHT would be a disclosed figure and allocated directly. We should also reduce grants to the FA and other organisations not in need and reduce overseas aid. This saving can be converted as an NHT income.",
        "background": "Most people in the UK seem to be happy with paying extra to fund the NHS. An new NHT would target funds directly to where they are needed and not form part of a central pot. NHT could be applied to the following: Petrol and diesel, Alcohol, tobacco, UK visitors at port of entry (\u00a325.00) etc",
