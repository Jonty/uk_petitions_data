        "additional_details": "Many professionals and nursery owners do not take wages or are dipping into their own personal savings and money just to pay their staff wages. Our salaries are very poor and do not pay a living wage. The Government and OFSTED are forever changing the goal posts. Morale is at an all time low and I know many people in the industry are barely expected to stay solvent for another year without proper funding being set. Which will be very unfortunate for under 5's and families in general.",
        "background": "The industry is grossly underfunded and with the possibility of doubling of the funded hours going from 15 to 30 hours it is causing a very important area of education to be basically on it's knees. We work very hard to give children the best start in life only to be let down by lack of funding. ",
