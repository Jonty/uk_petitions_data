        "action": "HM government to allow Parliament a debate and vote on the UK's Brexit strategy",
        "additional_details": "48% of voters in the referendum voted to stay in the EU and thus in the internal market. If just 5% of leave voters want to leave the EU but stay in the internal market, an overall majority wants to stay in the internal market. A majority of MPs want to stay in the EU and the internal market. The UK is a representative democracy and as the referendum did not address the Brexit negotiating position, it should be voted on democratically by our elected representatives not decided by government.",
        "background": "We the undersigned call upon HM government to ask Parliament to debate and vote on the strategy for Brexit before triggering the procedure for leaving the EU set out in Article 50 of the EU Treaty. The referendum was a democratic process and implementing its result must also be done democratically.",
