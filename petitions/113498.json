        "action": "Stop the UK Government from cutting student nurse bursaries.",
        "additional_details": "Student nurses in England currently only receive a \u00a31000 non means tested bursary from the NHS. Any other finance received is based on household income. A student nurse is required to work 37.5 hrs a week for 50% of the 3 years they are training. The cutting of bursary funding will lead to an exacerbation of the current nurse shortage. A newly qualified nurse will be burdened with a massive debt when only being paid \u00a321,478 per annum. This will discourage people from joining the profession. ",
        "background": "George Osborne and the UK treasury are looking to axe funding from Health Education. They are considering cutting student nurse bursaries and making student nurses take loans to pay tuition fees. STN's work on wards for 50% of their course, they already receive minimal financial recompense for this.",
