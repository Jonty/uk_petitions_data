        "additional_details": "Not enough guidance is issued to buyers from banks and/or estate agents about the sheer importance of buying a property without a full survey. A law change is needed to make it mandatory that full structural surveys are conducted prior to purchases either from the buyer or similar to Scotland Home report; from the seller",
        "background": "4 in 5 home buyers do not bother with full structual surveys.  This can often lead to thousands in repairs and structural work which can put enormous strain on families.  A mandatory home survey system similar to Scotland home report is needed to protect buyers and save families misery of repairs.",
