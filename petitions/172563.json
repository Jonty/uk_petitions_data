        "additional_details": "The park requires the installation of street lights to run around the internal perimeter of the park to allow for winter recreational use for the public. The loop proposed is roughly 3 miles long with the lighting being in keeping with the style of the park.\r\nIn winter, the public are forced onto the surrounding roads/pavements, yet there is clear evidence that the park is needed throughout the year in the evenings and should be maintained to allow this under section 10 of the open spaces act.",
        "background": "Victoria Park, Tower Hamlets, shuts at dusk every day of the year. Unfortunately in winter this can be late afternoon.\r\nIn summer the park is used for dog walking, exercising, commuting, general recreation and unfortunately these activities are currently suspended due to a lack of infrastructure.",
