        "action": "Reform International Postage Carrier Handling Fees",
        "additional_details": "This petition calls for an end to the practice of postal carriers charging excessive fees for their service.\r\n\r\nIn order for a company to levy a fee for a service, a contract must be willingly entered into by both parties. Currently, the recipient of a delivery is not required to consent to any such contract. In addition, the recipient is not normally offered the choice as to which postal carrier is used. Therefore, the fee that they pay is pre-determined by the sender's choice of postal carrier.",
        "background": "Buying goods from international sellers is difficult when it comes to knowing how much the recipient of said goods will pay. This is due to the taxes and fees levied. \r\n\r\nCarriers will pay these duties on behalf of the recipient to release the goods. For this, they usually charge an unfair fee.",

You might want to bear in mind that the UK Parliament is unlikely to be able to pass legislation which is binding on sellers who are outside the UK jurisdiction. "
