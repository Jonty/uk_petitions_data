This means it would remain private property and therefore remain as derelict land with disused buildings that continue to attract criminal trespassers and squatters which is not beneficial to anybody and surely see the house prices affected in Peakirk, which was once awarded the title of 'Best Kept Village' ",

In return they will gift the village with a desired amenity and the remaining parkland for public enjoyment.  ",
