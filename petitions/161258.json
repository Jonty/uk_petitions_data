        "additional_details": "Government reports show the downward spiral in numbers. An offer of just 1% pay rise is just not acceptable, for the hard work, long hours and low pay that our officers have to put in. Especially in a modern environment filled with danger, our officers put their lives on the line, every day that they report for duty. They are not permitted to industrial strike action and have little in the way of representation. The people of the U.K. Now need to show our officers that we support them. ",
        "background": "The number of Police officers continue to drop every year down to 207,140 as of March 31st 2015. More and more harsh cuts effect the safety of everyone, leave Police forces stretched and workload too high for each officer. Pay for officers is also too low and only getting 1% is a slap in the face.",
