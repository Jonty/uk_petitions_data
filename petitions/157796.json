        "additional_details": "The aim of this Petition is to give a voice to the people of UK regarding who should be appointed the next Leader of the Conservative party, and therefore the next Prime Minister, since named party is currently in power. As things stand the people DO NOT have a say in the matter, and there is a grave possibility that if the wrong individual is appointed, UK's exit from the EU could be misconducted or altogether prevented, and the will of the people denied. ",
        "background": "The majority of the people of UK have voted in favour of Brexit, with an expectation that its main proponent, Mr Boris Johnson, would be PM. This as well as a large proportion of the Remain supporters being in favour of the same. Therefore the will of the people is for Mr Boris Johnson to be PM.",
