The Employment Tribunals Act 1998 s6 provides that a person may appear in person or else be represented at an employment tribunal by: (a) counsel or a solicitor, (b) a rep of a trade union or an employers\u2019 association, or (c) any other person in whom the party desires to represent him. To legislate that parties and advisers in family proceedings had the same right as those in employment disputes would ensure free choice, equality & access to justice.",
