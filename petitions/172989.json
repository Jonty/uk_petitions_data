        "additional_details": "Microchips in domestic pets were introduced so, should an animal be lost or found injured, an owner could be located and notified. \r\nThere is no current legislation which states any authority who comes in to contact with animals has any legal obligation to scan them. \r\nDogs and cats can be collected & disposed of by councils without having been scanned and owners will never be informed. This leads to great distress and upset when the owner has a right to be informed of the fate of their companion\r\n",
        "background": "Bodies working in the animal sector, such as vets & shelters, usually scan for a microchip. However this is not compulsory and there are other authorities who will not scan at all such as a number of councils. All authorities working with animals, by law, should be required to scan all domestic pets",
