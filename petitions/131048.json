        "action": "Make all infant formula packaging plain and display clear health warnings.",
        "additional_details": "Formula companies spend a vast amount of money on making their product attractive to consumers and this aggressive marketing undermines a woman's ability to breastfeed. Switching from breastfeeding to formula puts a greater strain on an already stretched NHS as it increases the risk of diarrhoea, obesity, and ear and lung infections to name but a few. The Lancet states that \"from tobacco, to sugar, to formula milk, the most vulnerable suffer when commercial interests collide with public health.\"",
        "background": "According to a recent study published in The Lancet, the U.K. has the lowest breastfeeding rates in the world. Breastfeeding is by far the healthier choice for mother and baby. However, currently health warnings are portrayed as \"benefits of breastfeeding\" rather than risks of artificial feeding.",
