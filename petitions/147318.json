        "additional_details": "On 23/06/16 we voted on Britain's membership of the European Union. The leave campaign won by over 1.2 million votes or 52-48%. The remain camp now want to ignore the democratic will of the people and hold another referendum. This is undemocratic and will cause the complete collapse of the government and lead the country to civil unrest. We cannot allow this to happen. Please ensure our politicians follow the democratic process and now invoke article 50 of Lisbon treaty without delay.",
        "background": "The Remain camp is attempting to overturn the EU referendum result. The leave camp won the campaign and the democratic will of the British people was to leave the EU. Any attempt to hold a 2nd referendum should be immediately dismissed and Article 50 of Lisbon treaty should be invoked without delay.",
