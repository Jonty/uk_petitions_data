        "additional_details": "Our government don't want to raise the issue of oil scarcity and the threat it poses, but they must answer these questions to avoid a war based on lies again.\r\n\r\n1. How bad is the problem with finite oil resources?\r\n2. Can the world survive by sharing these resources or is it too imbalanced? \r\n3. If we can't survive by sharing these resources then is the only answer war? \r\n\r\nWe need truth around oil scarcity vs control for the people and our governments to be able to force this global understanding.",
        "background": "The UK government must uncover that they and their allies seek control of oil resources in the Middle East with any required force. Currently the spin on this action is that we as a nation are to be scared by islamic extremists who threaten our western values and safety. We deserve the truth.",
