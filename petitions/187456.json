        "additional_details": "Unsafe abortions are a major cause of maternal mortality worldwide - 45,000 women die of unsafe abortion annually (WHO).\r\n\r\nTrump's gag rule puts NGOs in the terrible position of having to decide between continuing to offer or advocate safe abortion and cutting off a significant funding stream (the US is the largest donor to global health efforts in the world - KFF.org).  \r\n\r\nThe Netherlands is leading a campaign to plug the deficit and has already attracted 20 countries. The UK must do its part.\r\n",
        "background": "In January, the Trump administration reinstated and expanded the \"global gag rule\" banning US federal funding for NGOs worldwide that provide abortion services or information, leaving a $600m funding gap for family planning services and work on combatting viruses like AIDS in developing countries.
