        "additional_details": "UKIP admission of 'fake' \u00a3350 m figure, alternative spending proposal untrue. Government improperly simplistic 'silly question' based only on minority Tory, UKIP sectional preference. No programme for proper pre-vote information. UK now wish to delay 'A50' notice indicating extreme uncertainty of negotiations and future. Clearly no idea from either camp of how to negotiate separation. UK risks ridicule in the shocked world view. Clear to all Boris Johnson used Brexit bandwagon for leadership bid",
        "background": "Lies & panic misled voters. Implications messy, widely destructive. Voters now question the slogans, 'immigration' known to be misleading,  deprived areas voting unaware of EU funding. No Brexit future plan, no information re EU operation. Serious international issue needs serious preparation.",
