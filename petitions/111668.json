        "additional_details": "We don't have to bail the banks out. We can allow them to crash, jail the ones that have committed financial crimes and sell off the bank and give the money back to the people. For the sake of these crimes repeating themselves we need to send a strong message out to anyone who attempts to do such a thing that you will be imprisoned if you do so. Let's bring justice back to the people and get this job done! Launch a 24hr court service just like the government served for the looters back in 2011.",
        "background": "Iceland have done it & after a year their economy is booming, so why can't we? In the 2008 recession many bankers that were responsible for the collapse got away with financial crimes and are still free and wealthy till this day, while the rest of us have had to suffer with the impact for years now.",
