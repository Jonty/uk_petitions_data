Advertising is banned in any form.\r\n5. You have to be 18 to buy it.\r\n6. Indoor public smoking is banned.\r\n7. Alcohol is worse for your health but is actually encouraged.\r\n8. Many more (inc. new anti-tobacco laws and doctors wanting to ban sales to those born after 2000).\r\n\r\nI agree don't encourage it, but at least\u00a0respect those that want to do it.",
