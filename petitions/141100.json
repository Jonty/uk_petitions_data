        "action": "Let the UK stay in the EU.",
        "additional_details": "The key arguments put forward by the Leave campaign appear to have been false. We will not have  \u00a3350m a week for the NHS, or be able to reduce immigration significantly in practice, and if we want to remain in the EEA, we will have  to implement EU rules, so we will not take back control. It is foolish to harm the prosperity of our country for no real gains. Parliament is sovereign, and does not have to accept the referendum result. Doing so would be irresponsible. ",
        "background": "The result of the June 23 referendum was not sufficiently decisive to justify leaving the EU. Leaving risks breaking up the UK, and is not supported by the young people who will have to deal with the economic consequences. Leaving takes away our freedoms to move around and buy from the EU.",
