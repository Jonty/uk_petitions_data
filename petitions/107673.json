        "additional_details": "England is already one of the most overcrowded countries in the World. England has a population density of 410 people per square km. This makes England the eighth most crowded country in the world, just behind India and nearly twice as crowded as Germany and 3.5 times as crowded as France. Such rapid population growth has severe impacts on the provision of public services such as school places and our precious NHS and sets more strain on our infrastructure.",
        "background": "I completely understand and sympathise with the crisis that is occurring in Syria and across Europe but we have limited & stretched resources. I agree we can do more to help but that doesn't automatically have to include accepting thousands more immigrants into the UK. We can help in other ways. ",
