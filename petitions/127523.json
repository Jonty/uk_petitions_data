        "additional_details": "The Union flag is most often used by respected and admired organisations, like The British Legion. Certain right wing organisations  try to attribute authority to their message by using the flag at their demonstrations. This is an insult to those who have served under the Union Flag. The Indian subcontinent supplied the largest volunteer army ever, 1.2 million, 400,000 Islamic in WW2 winning 21 V.C.'s. The Poles provided 16 RAF squadrons with 303 squadron being the most successful of WW2.",
        "background": "The Union flag flies over all in the UK and is a symbol of unity. Some organizations on the extreme right are using this symbol to promote division. Recently a certain organisation of the right was using Union flags in a demonstration outside a mosque in London. This disrespects the flag.",
