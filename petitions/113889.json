        "action": "Abolish vehicle excise duty and replace it with an additional fuel tax.",
        "additional_details": "The number of vehicles without road tax - Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) - doubled to 560,000 this summer according to the Department for Transport's survey, months after the paper tax disc was abolished in October 2014.(BBC News  26/11/2015) - VED is not working and my proposed replacement would be both more fair and enforceable.  It would also ensure that those who use the roads most, and have the least fuel-efficient vehicles would pay the most.\r\n",
        "background": "This would ensure that those who use the most fuel pay the most.  It would be impossible to avoid paying duty.  The current checks on VED payment should be replaced by a check on correct car insurance - either an insurance disc or camera checks.",
