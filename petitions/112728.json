        "background": "I feel that it is time a realistic cause be united behind, while it is totally impractical to \"close our borders\" and to \"welcome all refugees\", I believe we can all agree that the political leadership of the United Kingdom has been weak and ill positioned in recent months, shape up, or I'll do it.",
