        "action": "Limit the public use of drones",
        "additional_details": "I would like greater expansion and enforcement of drone no-fly areas better as serious threats can be caused.There have been cases where drones have been flown into prisons and where drones have been flown over major cities without authorisation which could be potentially life threatening for the public in light of the recent terror attacks in France and Paris. Terrorists could use this equipment. Islamic state already uses drones for surveillance missions and propaganda purposes.",
        "background": "We believe that the public use of drones is a very real threat to the public and to the community around you. For example there is very easy access to drones and could be used in the wrong way. For example planes have had near misses which could have caused potential threats to the passengers.",
