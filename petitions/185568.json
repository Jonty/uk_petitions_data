Also, we believe that it should be a statutory requirement that left handed pupils receive specific teaching to meet their needs, to help them master legible handwriting and continue to love writing.

Primary schools have been forced to cut corners, using a continuous cursive method from Reception to simply tick the boxes of the handwriting statements in the Interim Teacher Assessment Framework.",
