        "action": "Hold a referendum on the UK remaining in the EU and voiding the previous vote",
        "additional_details": "Despite impartial information & guides, the EU referendum was unfairly influenced by the mass media to vote to Leave. However, the majority of voters in deprived places which qualify for EU funding have voted to leave. They must have been lacking accurate information and awareness of the implications to the economy and their personal finances and could be considered as self-harming. By making voting compulsory for all aged 16+ a more fair & informed decision can be reached. Consider it a retrial",
        "background": "The EU referendum has been blighted by lies, mis-truths and a lack of understanding of the real implications to the economy, investment, environment and immigration. Most importantly, the majority of people are unaware of the real implications to their finances & work lives. Votes for all aged 16+",
