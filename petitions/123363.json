        "additional_details": "A regular class on the curriculum could cover a lot of information, making a large difference. It could prevent patients showing up in A&E for a broken nail or hair extensions that got stuck (these are examples of actual cases). \r\nAll of this could be prevented in future because they will have been educated to know how to deal with illness and minor injuries and when to see a doctor.\r\nWe can't predict the fate of the NHS, but we can prepare our children and teach them to use the NHS respectfully.",
        "background": "High school students across the UK should be receiving training for looking after their health.\r\nKnowledge could save lives.\r\nImagine a future for our NHS with less strain on the system because people are trained to manage basic issues like fevers, understanding dosages, minor cuts and sickness.",
