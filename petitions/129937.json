        "additional_details": "There have been many videos on Facebook going around of animal being abused and the criminals have only being given a fine which is just not enough. They should be punished like any other criminal for the harm that they have done. Animals can suffer the emotional and mental torture for the criminals have done. This is not fair for somebody who is voiceless and cant escape, only cry, squeal, be scared, shaking and trapped. This is wrong. Please sign, share and tweet.",
        "background": "I have seen may stories of animal abusers and neglecters getting away with just a fine. I believe and demand they should be given a full proper minimum sentence term as a punishment for what they have done. Animals have feelings, not just physical but emotional and mental scars.
