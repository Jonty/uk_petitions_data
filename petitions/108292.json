        "additional_details": "The Cabinet acts in opposition to the interests of the people. Its policies are detrimental to the long term health and prosperity of the people. Judged on its own policies it has failed. The deficit has not been reduced and any talk of a \"recovering economy\" is semantic. Poverty, destitution and misery increase with disturbing regularity. There is a xenophobic culture of militarism that appears to drive policy which benefits only elite aristocratic, political and business classes.",
        "background": "The current UK government Cabinet was elected with 24% of electoral support. This figure is too low to be considered a credible mandate for the policies it implements and the agendas it pursues.",
