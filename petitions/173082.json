        "additional_details": "We now have 120,000 children living in poverty. We have over one million people being forced to rely on Foodbanks. We are in the throes of a period of austerity, where the poorest and the most vulnerable in our society, have been made to pay for the mistakes of the bankers. We have had now for years the funding for public services cut year on year. \r\nBut we can afford to pay \u00a3369 million pounds to make repairs to a castle on behalf of the richest woman in the country.\r\n\r\nThis is just wrong",
        "background": "I am appalled that in this time of austerity, with the attacks on the income of poorest and most vulnerable, the government should choose to fund part of the refurbishment of Buckingham Palace to the tune of \u00a3369 million. This being prioritised over our most vulnerable and poor is appalling.",
