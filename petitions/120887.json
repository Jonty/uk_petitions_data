        "additional_details": "The College of Policing plan to pilot this in 2017 and introduce it in 2019.\r\nWe need to keep policing open to all. It does not require a degree, it requires common sense, bravery and compassion.",
        "background": "Alex Marshall and the College of Policing are planning on introducing a requirement for new police officers to first obtain a degree. This will impact on candidates from deprived backgrounds and plunge recruits into debt. Policing will no longer be open to all. It will be for the privileged few.",
