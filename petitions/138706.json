He should follow the honourable course taken by David Cameron and resign.\r\n\r\nBecause George Osborne and the cabinet are not competent in running the finances of the UK and will cause thousands of children and other families to enter poverty and will cause thousands of more crises within the UK.",

We say unfairness and injustice were at the heart of last week\u2019s budget, which included cuts to benefits for the disabled. We call for the chancellor to stand down and stop with the lies. ",
