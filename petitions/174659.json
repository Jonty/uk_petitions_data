        "additional_details": "Many cats are hit and left to suffer or die on the side of our roads. I want to make it a legal requirement to report the accident involving a cat and for the person to take the cat to the local vet or charity to check for micropchipping details for the owner to be informed of the state of the cat, whether it be deceased or in need or treatment. Many owners suffer with never knowing what has happened to their cats, they are part of the family and do not deserve to suffer.",
        "background": "Unfortunately, many cats are hit on UK roads regularly. Many people hit cats on the roads and leave them suffering or dead with their owners devastated at home with no closure of what has happened to their beloved fur baby. This is a welfare issue that can be avoided by reporting the accident.",
