It seems ludicrous that contactless payments exist as it is just giving fraudsters an easy option of stealing from you. I was informed by Natwest if I wanted to take contactless off my card I would have a restricted card which would not work in a lot of outlets such as petrol stations this is ridiculous!  ",

How long does it take to type in a pin number really!? There are a number of security risks with contactless where card details can easily be stolen through scanners.",
