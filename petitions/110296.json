        "action": "Advise parents in advance of after school detentions.",
        "additional_details": "Currently legislation published on gov.uk states that Schools don't have to give parents notice of after-school detentions or tell them why a detention has been given. Research confirms, !most secondary schools will give upto a 30 minute detention after school the same day without informing parents. I believe in this day and age that no child should be detained after school without parental consent and notification. Safety is key here, a parent should know where their child is at all times.  \r\n",
        "background": "Currently the law states that a school do not have to inform parents if they are detaining a child after school for a detention. I believe that the school have a duty to inform a parent if their child is being given a detention. Preferably 24 hours notice or by phone call on the same day.",
