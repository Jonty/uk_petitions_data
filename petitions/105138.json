        "action": "Stop fraudulently accusing EEA Family members of Sham marriage, Regulate HO",
        "additional_details": "One such case was when a couple that has a baby was accused to be involved in a marriage of convenience and the home office barrister even went to the lengths of saying that the couple made the baby just so that the father of the baby can stay in the UK and that all this was done for money. Its ridiculous and if you look at the statistics its clear that most of these claims are made against Indians/Pakistani/African citizens.\r\nThe Home office is abusing its power.",
        "background": "The Home Office has started to wrongly accuse all or most couples applying for confirmation of residence in the U.K as being involved in a Marriage of Convenience / Relationship of Convenience . It's noticeable that there is a clear discrimination against Indian/Pak/African citizens.",
