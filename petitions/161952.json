        "action": "Abolish same roof rule and 1979 rule for historic sexual abuse victims",
        "additional_details": "My father and mother were recently jailed for what he did to me as a child I and my sisters were told to make a claim for compensation. We did but as my abuse ended in July 1979 and it was my father that sexually abused me the law says it was ok and I am entitled to nothing. This is not about the money this is about another slap in the face for abuse victims coming forward it needs to be changed.",
        "background": "If you were abused by a family member living in the same household the Ministry of Justice thinks that's ok. If your abuse ended prior to October 1979 that's ok too. The CICA will not pay out any form of compensation if you fall into either of these categories, an unfair and unjust rule.",
