        "additional_details": "As part of a parliamentary discussion, MPs should consider whether the terrible Jewish holocaust/genocide differs from that which overtook the Armenia population [of E Turkey] around 1915. Nearly two million innocent people were killed during those events.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, why, since the Jewish genocide has been officially recognised by HM Government, is it the case that the Armenian genocide remains unacknowledged - given the criteria set down in the 1942 UN declaration on Genocide?\r\n",
        "background": "I would like HM Government to recognise the events that overtook the Armenian population [of what is now E Turkey] around 1915 as 'genocide'. HM Government to follow the lead of EU partners - such as France & Austria - who already recognise those events as 'genocide'. \r\n",
