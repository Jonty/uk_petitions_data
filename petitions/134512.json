        "action": "Implement 3 month cooling off period for the EU referendum",
        "additional_details": "There were many claims and counter claims made during the EU referendum and a heated and heady level of debate. The decision is a crucial one for our country and can't be taken lightly. Over the coming 3 months more data and evidence of the implications (positive and negative) will become clearer as discussions are had and ideas explored. The decision is so momentous that we believe the public should be asked to confirm their decision to leave after a 3 month cooling off period. ",
        "background": "We call upon the UK Government and Opposition parties to implement a cooling off period for the EU referendum so that a second ballot is required 3 months from now to verify the publics intent to leave once they have understood some of the actual implications of the UK leaving the EU.
