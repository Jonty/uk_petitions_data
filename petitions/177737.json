        "additional_details": "We spend around \u00a312 billion of taxpayers money on foreign aid, yet our own health service is in crisis, we have pensioners living in worse conditions than immigrants. If money is going to foreign aid, it should be given through the thousands of British charities dedicated to foreign aid  and not for the government to spend when we have major issues in our own nation that \u00a312 billion could fix.",
        "background": "Our government is sending millions of pounds to foreign aid, in many cases this money is sent to nations that have huge issues in their countries but their governments are spending money on weapons and space programs rather than their in need population",
