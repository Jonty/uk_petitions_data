        "additional_details": "The voting age is 16 in the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey (three self-governing British Crown Dependencies).\r\n\r\nThe test that the electorate should be required to pass before being able to vote should:\r\n\r\na) be short\r\nb) have it's content approved by both leave and remain campaigns\r\nc) be neutral, impartial, non-leading etc\r\nd) not be designed to reduce the number of people able to vote, but to ensure that they are sufficiently aware of basic, key facts about what the EU is and how it operates etc\r\n",
        "background": "1. The EU Referendum was perilously close at 52%, yet the 16-18 age group likely to be most affected in the long term were not able to vote.\r\n\r\n2. Due to misinformation by campaign groups, to register to vote one must pass a short test to demonstrate knowledge of basic relevant facts about the EU.",
