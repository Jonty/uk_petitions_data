He would have us believe (from his Q&A at Felixstowe) that a Post-Brexit deal would be slower and less perfect - but the reverse is certain to be the case, given that such a trade deal would have only two parties to accommodate instead of 29!",

Voters are being systematically misled on a wide range of issues. Truth and honesty are being sacrificed in a series of Government-driven attempts to subvert democratic processes.",
