        "action": "Introduce a Compulsory Mature Drivers Assessment at age 70",
        "additional_details": "The Mature Drivers Assessment is not a driving test, it is a friendly 60 minute assessment providing the mature driver with advice and certification indicating excellent driving, competent driving or giving advice to the driver who isn\u2019t quite up to scratch and providing actions on how they might improve. Thus, helping to keep all road users safer.\r\n\r\nThe aim is not to discriminate, the government spent a lot of their focus on the younger driver and they need to focus on the mature driver as well.",
        "background": "It is a known fact that as we all get older our reactions become slower, driving abilities can deteriorate and confidence can become progressively worse.\r\n\r\nDue to recent events/accidents on our roads, it's time the government put something into place to ensure older drivers are safe to be driving.",
