        "additional_details": "11,000 people mainly women will lose their jobs as a result of the failure of BHS. Sir Phillip has taken massive amounts of dividends from the company and due to his actions the pension fund has a massive shortfall. Why should the workers suffer and the tax payer pick up the bill for their redundancies when both Sir Phillip and Dominic Chappell have siphoned millions from BHS. Sir Phillip is not worthy to hold a knighthood and we call for him to be stripped of his knighthood.",
        "background": "Sir Phillip Green sold BHS for \u00a31 to fmr bankrupt (Dominic Chappell) in 2015  He  withdrew massive amounts of money in dividends transferring this out of the country  via his wife's company based in Monaco whilst not ensuring that the company pension scheme was adequately funded.",
