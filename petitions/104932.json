        "additional_details": "The Avro Vulcan is an iconic piece of British aviation history built at a time when we were the envy of the worlds aviation community, we simply cannot allow her to live out her days in a museum/heritage centre being stared at by people wondering what she was like and watching videos. She is as much a part of our heritage as the spitfires, hurricanes and lancasters and played an integral part in the Falklands conflict, SHE WAS BORN TO FLY SO LETS KEEP HER THERE.",
        "background": "At the end of the present airshow season 2015 Avro Vulcan XH558 will be grounded forever due to the removal of support required under CAA regulations for her to fly. We have museum pieces, what we need is an airworthy example for future generations not you tube clips.",
