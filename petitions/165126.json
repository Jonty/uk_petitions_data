        "action": "Restrict Rail Franchise Owners paying excessive dividends when performance fails",
        "additional_details": "The PPM of the GoVia Thameslink Group (Southern, GEX and TL) is around 70% in 2016 so far - against the target for of around 86%. One in 3 trains is late.\r\n\r\nThe service that funds their dividends has failed to meet acceptable standards, and annual fare increases continue to be applied which contribute to that dividend.\r\n\r\nThis petition seeks to apply legislation that forces Franchise Owners to limit dividend distribution when PPM and other measures fall materially, and serially, short of target.",
        "background": "Some Train Operating Companies have fallen far short of their Public Performance Measures (PPM).\r\n\r\nSimultaneously Franchise Owners - such as the Go Ahead Group - continue to pay material dividends that offer investors an attractive yield (e.g. 4-5%) which is 10 to 20 times the typical savings rate.",
