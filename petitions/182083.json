        "additional_details": "While there are undoubtedly imperfections in the EU which need correcting,\r\nwe demand two things. \r\n\t1\tThat our MPs do their duty to protect the country and vote to continue membership of the EU. \r\n\t2\tThat the EU becomes more responsive to the citizens of it's member states, and less to the self interest of those administering it. As an immediate demonstration of that intent, it stops it's money wasting migrations to Strasbourg.   \r\nWe want our stable and inclusive country back. ",
        "background": "In the referendum on EU membership, the electorate was given much mis-information, and had the result been reversed, the leavers had said they would demand another vote. Changes in the world and the increasing possibility of a \u201chard Brexit\u201d means there is a real threat to the stability of the UK",
