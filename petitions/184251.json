        "additional_details": "There's a growing worldwide indifference towards animal welfare issues and society's relationship with these creatures and the natural world is becoming detached. A myriad of cruelty and abuse by individuals to dog fighting gangs continues hourly, whether in slaughterhouses, on traditional or intensive factory farms, in the wild and at home. This abhorrent behaviour is accepted by many in our communities, encouraging desensitized youngsters to continue in these acts of barbarity; this must end.",
        "background": "All animal cruelty offences must be dealt with in mandatory sentencing, starting with a five year unpaid community service order. Serious offences should demand unlimited fines from \u00a310,000 with imprisonment for business directors, managers, farmers and individuals with their business closures.",
