It isn't safe to have up to 12 patients to 1 Nurse. \r\nAvoidable mistakes are being made daily on wards due to low levels of staffing! \r\nImagine it was your mother, father, nan or grandad who was admitted to hospital where the Nurse can't give them the best care",

The government need to recognise this is wrong and jeopardising patient safety! Make the legal limit 1 Nurse: 8 Patients.",
