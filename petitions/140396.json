The nations interest is paramount so the need to confirm this is obvious. Presently there is no legal requirement to leave. We have been told that we can expect to leave on \"good terms\" so naturally once this has been provided, without complaint, it should be the nations right to give them the final leave or stay mandate.",

Without this they can not act with the knowledge that the have sufficient support of the nation.",
