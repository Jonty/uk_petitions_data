        "additional_details": "The ban was originally but in place because small clubs feared that fans would not want to attend games because they could watch it from their own sofa's but SkySports and the PL have both said that when a game is shown on SkySports or BT there is usually a high demand for tickets. At this moment this is just a stupid ban that will probably be reversed once someone comes to their senses and realizes that time have changed and we now have more info regarding this.",
        "background": "For a while now 3pm football or the 3pm blackout has been banned because fears over attendances but we can clearly see from matches that are shown live at other times actually increase attendances and therefor prove that the decision to ban 3pm matches was idiotic and not very well thought through.",
