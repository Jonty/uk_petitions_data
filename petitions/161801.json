        "additional_details": "VOTE LEAVE TODAY was the front cover of the Daily Express, on the day of the EU referendum. A newspaper should report news for the benefit of the people. Not sway opinion for its own secret agendas. The first 24 hours after the killings in Nice, BBC and all news outlets kept stating Mohamed Bouhlel had no known terrorist links. Yet in the same breath, kept claiming it to be a war act & terrorist attack. If no links, this reporting is biased & inflammatory. Set laws now to stop the propaganda.",
        "background": "UK media is now completely corrupted & has become a weapon of mass destruction in itself. We urgently need revised legislation, to ensure that it is no longer used as a tool to sway public opinion in false or self destructive directions. We need this now for the good of the UK & more so for mankind.",
