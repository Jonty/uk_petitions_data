        "additional_details": "Now with the new car tax rules it is easy to get fined for no road tax as you have to purchase road tax or declared (SORN) off road when you purchase a vehicle.\r\nThe previous car owner has to cash in the road tax, but looses the cost of the tax for the whole month that the sale took place, but the new owner has to pay road tax for the same month.\r\nNice scam for the government double road tax for the month that change of owner took place.",
