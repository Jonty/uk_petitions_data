        "additional_details": "Coursework allows students an opportunity to express their voices and opinions in an education system that seems content in becoming pure indoctrination. It lets them showcase, articulate and evaluate all that they know and have learnt as well as applying this abstract knowledge to real issues. It's all well and good for children to learn of Shakespeare and his plays but not knowing how to properly formulate arguments which are logical and coherent will hinder them in the future. ",
        "background": " I am someone that reaped the fruits of coursework and controlled assessments. It allowed me to learn how to produce academic literature, the kind one needs in the real world. The current changes to the GCSE represent a desire to return to a tried, tested and failed system based on rote learning. ",
