        "additional_details": "As somebody who is fundamentally non-religious, I have always been amazed at the tax-free statuses of religious organisations. Even if God IS real, why should his representatives not pay tax? Their reason: They provide crucial social services, and that 200 years of church tax exemptions have not turned us into a theocracy. Taxing religious organisations won't make us a theocracy, especially if they're ALL taxed. Hospitals also provide social service, they're taxed; so why not religions..?",
        "background": "Religion, whether you believe in it or not, is a business. It always has, and always will be. In 2013 the Church of England's revenue was \u00a31.41 billion; taxed at just 5% would have generated \u00a370,000,000! This is ONE religion in ONE year..! If there is a God, wouldn't he want to help our country...?",
