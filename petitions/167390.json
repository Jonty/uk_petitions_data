        "additional_details": "I believe that given the option the majority of people in the UK would support a return to public ownership,  regardless of political persuasion. If necessary this might be an option for the larger metropolitan areas to run as pilot schemes initially , with a local poll conducted independently of any political party.",
        "background": "The privatised utility companies run a virtual monopoly with an arcane pricing structure designed to confuse. There was no evidence of significantly more inefficiency when they were previously in public ownership and unlike transport we all rely absolutely on utility companies for our wellbeing. ",
