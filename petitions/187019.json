        "additional_details": "Landlords get a bad press, unreasonably. They provide homes where Councils can't or won't. Most aren't rich,  just one property, for example where a couple marry and move in together, renting out the vacant 'other' property.\r\n\r\nAn example, like myself, adding to their pension. Benefit Tenants payments are paid direct to the Tenant. The recipient has several hundred pounds 'in one go' on many occasions this money is spent, but not on rent...I have experience of Tenants treating this as 'partytime'",
        "background": "Reinstate Housing Benefit direct to Landlord. Since payment arrangements were changed, a great number of Landlords are not receiving their rent as it is paid direct to the tenant, this can go on for many months and run to many thousands of pounds of arrears and thousands more in fees to get it back",
