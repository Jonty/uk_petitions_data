        "additional_details": "This government wants to take some of our rights away.\r\n1) The Worker's Rights Directive - this will go and allow Employers to make us work longer hours for less money.\r\n2) The Court of Human Rights will go. It would be harder for us to get justice.\r\n\r\nThese are just two. There could be many more rights that we could lose if the government goes ahead and put in a British Bill of Rights without the whole of the British people decide in a referendum.\r\n",
        "background": " British people should have their say as to which one they want. That's all the British people who should have the right to decide, and not just the 36% that voted for this government. It was British lawyers that set up the Human Rights Act and it is there to protect us. ",
