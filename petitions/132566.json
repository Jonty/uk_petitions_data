        "action": "No confidence in the Government's Naval Strategy",
        "additional_details": "We the undersigned via this petition wish to show our dismay with the Government\u2019s naval strategy, caused by underfunding, resulting in new ships unfit for purpose, delays in building the Type 26 Frigate and overspends on other projects.\r\nMore money should be allocated to the naval budget by reducing the amount spent on foreign aid\u201d",
        "background": "The Government should increase the effectiveness of the Royal Navy by designing and building the fleet into a credible and efficient navy by reducing the colossal waste and inefficiency in defence procurement.\r\nWe need to change the Royal Navy into an effective navy that can be fit for purpose.\r\n",
