        "additional_details": "As the Community Action Group (What Watton Wants) was setup last year, when the Market Town of Watton in Norfolk was being swamped by over-development.  Watton wants sustainable development with the necessary infrastructure being put in place to support the increase of properties, people and vehicles.  This includes schools, doctors, leisure facilities, drainage, services, commuter links and employment opportunities.  Housing also needs to satisfy local people.",
        "background": "Housing comes first, then infrastructure. In Watton it seems that this is not the case.  Facilities are not in line with the houses being built.     \r\n\r\nWe are totally powerless.  Legislation seems to be in favour of Developers/Land Speculators who are unfamiliar with the area. ",
