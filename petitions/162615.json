        "additional_details": "This affects us all by making it more difficult for us by forcing us to deal with matters during these specific times and not in evenings/outside office hours. The Government is here to serve us, the people, not the other way round. This is an example of self serving bureaucracy gone wrong. It's also wasteful, as it encourages people to deal with the matter by post instead of using the website. This wastes paper (and therefore kills trees) and creates unnecessary administration costs.",
        "background": "The DVLA website is only open Monday to Saturday 8am and 6pm to deal with certain issues (for example, telling them when you have bought or sold a vehicle). This is ridiculous. A website should be open 24 hours, seven days a week. There is no reason for it not to be. ",
