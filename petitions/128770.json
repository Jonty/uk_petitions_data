        "additional_details": "Of \u00a3470 bn of consumer debt, \u00a350 billion is now owned by debt purchase companies, who buy bank and credit card balances for 2-10% of their value and then use the Courts to get 100% repayment, making super profits in the process. One company owns \u00a317bn of consumer debt and reported a profit of \u00a3196 million last year.By reducing the statute bar to four years, the number of claims would be reduced, the Courts could cope better, and original lenders would be OK. Consumers would be the winners  ",
        "background": "Currently, creditors can sue for repayment of debts for up to 6 yrs after default or payment. The Courts are overwhelmed. In 2014, there were 1.5 million claims issued and 410,000 judgments with 54 weeks from claim to hearing. By reducing the statute bar to 4 years, this would reduce the claims. ",
