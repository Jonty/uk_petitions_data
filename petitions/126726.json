        "additional_details": "Barford (2016) stated that It's a tradition that dates back to the 1930s. Every new mother, regardless of background or income, gets a baby box from the government. The box contains a stash of supplies - bibs, bodysuits, nappies, a sleeping bag, outdoor gear, bathing products - as well as a small mattress. Putting the mattress in the bottom of the box creates the baby's first bed. ",
        "background": "BBC news Vanessa Barford (2016) wrote a brilliant article discussing the benefits to baby boxes in Finland. Since the boxes were introduced cot death dropped significantly in Finland and now Finland has the lowest mortality rates in the World. ",
