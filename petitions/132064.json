        "action": "To make the A52, A15, A16, A17 in to dual carriage ways",
        "additional_details": "By converting the four major roads throughout Lincolnshire into dual carrigeways this may potentially reduce traffic congestion within the main towns, decrease the risk of road incidents and encourage safer trade within the county. Within a year the A15 alone has seen an increase in road traffic fatalities due to an increase of vehicles on the roads - a dual carriageway on this particular road may make life easier for thriving agricultural and industrial businesses but it could also save lives.",
        "background": "The road systems in Lincolnshire have long been neglected resulting in unsafe potholes, faded road markings and an increase in road traffic collisions over the years. Due to the growth in population and industry the road in Lincolnshire simply cannot cope.",
