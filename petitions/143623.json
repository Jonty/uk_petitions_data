        "action": "2nd EU referendum to decide close 52/48 margin must include 16 and 17 year olds",
        "additional_details": "There are no plans ready for Britain to leave in place. There is no strategy and the exit once initiated is 2 years. When 16 and 17 year olds are eligible to vote there may be instability in Sterling, the credit rating of Great Britain may change from stable, the options for moving for work or education will be limited. Many areas are not aware of the grants they benefit from given by the EU. Figures used by the leave campaign have been verified as inaccurate by the Institute of Fiscal Studies.",
        "background": "The referendum on leaving or remaining in the EU is not only unprecedented, but did not include the opinions of 16 and 17 year olds who are not eligible to vote. The consequences of leaving the EU are far reaching, and may take decades to resolve. The opinions of these younger people are vital.",
