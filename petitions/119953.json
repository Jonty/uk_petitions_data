        "action": "To stop parents paying for children they have been refused access to maliciously",
        "additional_details": "There are enough parents who have come out of relationships and had their children dangled in front of them and used as a weapon by their ex partners. I feel that if a parent stops the other parents access they are then forfeiting the right to gain financial help of their children's parent. Unless the courts deem the parent hasn't got the right to see their children I feel this should be law as this effects too many families in this country.",
        "background": "I am wanting parents who have been maliciously refused access to their children the right to choose if they pay the other parent maintenence instead of been forced to by the child support agency when they are not allowed access due to no fault of their own just jealous ex partners.\r\n",
