        "additional_details": "If this isn\u2019t done we can never expect to live in a fair society. Without funding, the only people who are able to change our country will be the very people who want it to remain the same. To protect our democracy, this must be opposed.\r\n\r\nIf equality and social mobility are regarded as important in a society, that society will provide all with equal access to the whole education system. Education will be free or subsidised in so that people are not disadvantaged based on their background.\r\n",
        "background": "The UK government currently provides NO FUNDING for postgraduate study. \r\n\r\nWe\u2019re looking for the 100,000 signatures required for the issue to be debated in The House of Commons. Let\u2019s build a fairer society together.\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU in advance.\r\n\r\nPlease SIGN AND SHARE!",
