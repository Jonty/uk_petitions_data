        "additional_details": "Proposal: Party A is victim to racist or xenophobic behaviour by Party B. Party C is witness to the event and gives a statement. A document states Party A will not press charges if Party B agrees to pay a significant fine OR attends a Humanity awareness course which will aim to educate and promote tolerance and understanding. The course completion will be subject to the course provider certifying that party B demonstrated remorse and engaged with the subject matter. \r\n",
        "background": "We need to promote tolerance and equality now more than ever. This proposal is IN ADDITION to The Equality Act 2010. A number of racist and xenophobic offences do not reach a conviction in court due to a lack of evidence. We propose that some incidences could be settled under Civil Law. ",
