        "action": "STOP ANIMAL ABUSE!\r\nTo make the punishment worse for those who abuse animals!",
        "additional_details": "We have to show people that if you do abuse animals then you will be punished. The definition of abuse towards animals is  'Intentional infliction by humans of suffering or harm upon any non-human animal' \r\nDont get me wrong, people do get punished for their actions but, if we want to get our point across, we need to make it tougher. If we make the punishment worse, for example, Jail Time, then we may be looking at less people who abuse animals. Can you imagine your pet/ animal being abused to death point or starvation? Please sign the petition and make a difference!",
        "background": "The point of this petition is trying to make the punishment worse for people who abuse animals. People who abuse animals, might get a fine, community service, not aloud animals again but this is not enough! In our country, we believe in animal rights, so we have to prove to people that this is true.",
