        "additional_details": "London is a country apart from the UK. We have different demographics, a higher per capita GDP, we are better educated - and more cosmopolitan. We like the opportunities that the EU offers, the freedom, the potential for personal and economic growth. All these have been taken away from us overnight. We say enough. We say time to stand alone. Time to look to the future, not the past. An independent London to rejoin the EU. ",
        "background": "On June 23rd, the U.K. voted to leave the European Union. A clear majority of Londoners are against this decision, with 59.9 % voting to stay. Add in an estimated 1m disenfranchised EU citizens, and an estimated 72% of Londoners would prefer to remain. Enough - we say it's time to leave the UK. ",
