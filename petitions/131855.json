        "additional_details": "Either this issue stems from an honest mistake or it does not.\r\nIf it is an honest mistake then the only reasonable course of action is to own up and try to set it straight.\r\nIf it is not an honest mistake, then it appears to be a callous and calculated plot perpetrated by a corruption that runs through the heart of the party.\r\n",
        "background": "The government should end the current controversy over allegations of electoral fraud by changing the law such that the rules are made unambiguous.\r\nIf the party in question apologises for the mistake and the affected members step down there should be no need for expensive investigations.",
