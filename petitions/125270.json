        "action": "Government to recognise that men also face sexism.",
        "additional_details": "Recent television campaign to prevent domestic violence called 'Disrespect Nobody' does not recognise that a male can face domestic violence. \r\nFemale teacher that paid student for sex receives community work sentence, whereas footballer who had relations with female is given a custodial sentence of 10 years with a minimum of 5 years, despite being consenting sex. \r\nRape is described in dictionaries as 'most often done by a man to a woman', this needs rectifying immediately. ",
        "background": "Recent government campaigns have shown very clearly, and wrongfully, that men cannot be domestically abused. It is important for the British people to recognise that sexism isn't only something that can be brought on to a woman but also a man, to give men a feeling of personal security, too. ",
