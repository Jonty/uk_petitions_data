        "action": "Do not build an extra runway at any London airport. Increase efficiency.",
        "additional_details": "CO2 concentrations are increasing and this is causing global temperatures to rise. Rather than focusing on increased capacity for air travel, encouraging it, we need to better use the airports we have and link them with better (and greener) public transport. This is of paramount importance if we are serious about anthropogenic climate change and considering the Paris agreement. Perhaps we could create jobs in tree-planting, conservation and green energy instead?",
        "background": "Rather than spending millions on building a new runway we need to better use what airports we have and increase the speed and efficiency of public transport. If we are to meet global CO2 reduction targets this is of paramount importance. Air travel needs not be idolised.",
