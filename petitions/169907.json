As well as how unfairly Scotland is treated buy the rest of the UK they seem to forget about all the English money that is used to help and support Scotland. So i propose we have a show of hands to see how many people in the rest of the UK would want to become separated from Scotland. I think that Scotland would be shocked at the result of this partition",
