        "additional_details": "The age of rapists has gone down, there are so many more cases of children raping children in these upcoming years, occurring at as young as the age of 3. The impact of such careless flaunting & lyrics that are constantly shown to children is massive, it seems insignificant to many but it is not. It's gradual. Younger & younger, children are posting explicit contents on their social media sites, having sex before they understand sex properly and more kids are getting pregnant, at as young as 13.",
        "background": "There is sexually explicit content everywhere, nobody is making any effort to cap the behavior or vulgarity that young children are exposed to every day. It desensitizes their views on sex, leads to watching porn at a young age, which teaches them an unrealistic and dangerous view of sex.",
