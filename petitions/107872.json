        "action": "Revive our secondary education by making all subjects mandatory till 18 yrs old.",
        "additional_details": "Having only studied a handful of subjects which were selected as their 'Options', our children are limited as to which subjects they can pursue study in in the future. This leads to many children leaving education early and opting to work menial jobs as they are otherwise unable to return to education easily to start again from GCSE level in the subjects they didn't take as, 'options'.\r\n\r\nHow can we expect a child of 14 years old to know which subjects to study and build a career in?",
        "background": "Our children deserve to leave school with a good all round education in all academic subjects. Under the current system, our children choose their options in year 9 & only continue studying a handful of subjects. As such, many children are raised with a very poor level of general education.",
