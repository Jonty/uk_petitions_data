        "additional_details": "The United Kingdom Parliament is responsible for the defence, foreign affairs and overall good governance of British Overseas Territories (BOTs). \r\nThe U.K. Government has the power to suspend 'self governance' of BOTs, which are classed as internally self governing parts of the UK. This was demonstrated in 2009, when self governance was partially suspended for the 'Turks and Caicos Islands' due to Government corruption. Action should now be taken on BOTs exposed as tax havens.",
        "background": "It has come to our attention that British individuals and companies are exploiting tax laws of British Oversea Territories, enabling large scale tax avoidance and evasion.\r\nIn a time of budget cuts, we believe this to be immoral and urge the Government act in accordance with it's responsibilities.",
