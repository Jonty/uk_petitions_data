        "additional_details": "As if it isn't hard enough to raise our daughters to love themselves there are now TV ads encouraging women to change their bodies to gain confidence. And if this wasn't hard enough for adults to deal with, the ads being played during the days at weekends mean many young girls are becoming self conscious of their bodies from a young age. Is this an innocent mistake or  purposely planting the seed of hate in to a child's head to gain a future customer?",
        "background": "young girls are being targeted by marketing teams across the UK as they encourage women to change their bodies to gain confidence. Help stop cosmetic surgery ads from being played during day time hours and encouraging our children to think badly of their body for not being \"amazing\" like on the ads.",
