        "additional_details": "My son is 16 and has Autism, I worry every day about him being bullied, assaulted or attacked because of his disability.\r\n\r\nI read an article recently that truly sickened/shocked and upset me that there are human beings out there that think it's ok to tie a teenager with special needs upside down from a tree and beat them to death, words truly fail me.\r\n\r\nPunishment for this type of crime is too lenient, especially for teenagers who think it's a laugh to publicly humiliate vulnerable/disabled people.\r\n\r\nTeens and adults with Autism, learning difficulties and mental health issues should feel safe and protected as not all of them have a 24hr carer or a guardian angel watching over them all of the time.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition and keep the vulnerable safe.",
        "background": "I am sick and tired of reading about teens and adults being targeted and on occasions killed because they are vulnerable and an easy target, they may have mental health issues/autism/learning difficulties but they are human and have enough in their lives to deal with without being attacked.",
