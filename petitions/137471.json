        "additional_details": "During the recent EU referendum we had a campaign where both sides produced misleading \u2018facts\u2019 & blatant lies on which many voters based their voting decision. \r\n\r\nPromises were made which have no statutory or government accountability, and many voters will have based their decision on these promises. \r\n\r\nWe also had non official groups publicly campaigning,  issue leaflets and posters as a way to bypass spending limits set for the 2 officially recognised campaigns. \r\n\r\nThis should not have happened",
        "background": "We call on the government that:\r\n-In the event of evidence that campaigning \u201cfacts\u201d are proven false & intended to mislead in order to prejudice a vote result; any such vote will be be investigated as election Fraud.\r\n-Only officially recognised campaigns may campaign during elections & referendums",
