We pay to see the show and experience it live!. Most shows are recorded by professionals, there is no need for some youtube jockey recording for a few hits. I wrecks the views and diminishes the experience of being there when it is inevitably put online. Ban it. Let the gig be just that, the band playing to the crowd who are there.",
