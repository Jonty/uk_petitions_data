        "additional_details": "Having just one day off here and there does not allow many people to porperly relax and recharge before starting work again. \r\nHaving two consecutive days off means everyone can enjoy a full day of leisure time without having to consider working the next day, and it allows an individual proper rest time.",
        "background": "With the rise of the 24/7 economy and zero hour contracts, more and more people are having single days off throughout the working week.\r\nEveryone should be intitled to have two consecutive days off in every seven day working week. The 'weekend' does NOT have to include Saturday or Sunday.",
