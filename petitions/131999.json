        "action": "Make it legal that there is a 2 hour minimum break per day for  live in carers.",
        "additional_details": " Most live-in carers are too afraid to speak up in case they lose their job or get bad references. It is very common for carers to work up to 16 hours a day, plus getting up during the night. Most carers get paid from \u00a365 to \u00a395 per day and are still expected to have a happy disposition and fulfill all their duties - often without breaks. Slavery was abolished in the UK nearly 200 years ago. Please stop live in care givers being exploited  give them the voice and rights they deserve.",
        "background": "Make it legally binding that all live-in care work,  though agencys ensure a 2 hour minimum break per day for carers. There should also  be a waking night carer throughout the night if necessary. carers are exploited by care agencies and private employers as there are no fixed rules for breaks",
