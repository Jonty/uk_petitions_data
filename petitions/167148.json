        "additional_details": "Children who fail the 11+ suffer a severe blow to their self-esteem and motivation at a critical time in their development. \r\nFigures suggest that these children (70-80% of the total) go on to do worse at secondary modern than they would have at a comprehensive. \r\nSelective areas have the largest achievement gaps in the country. \r\nIn fully selective Bucks, the 11+ pass rate for FSM children was 4% in 2014, compared to 20% for state pupils and 53% for private school pupils.",
        "background": "Selection harms children, divides communities and lowers overall attainment. The 11+ exam is inherently unfair - evidence shows that it selects on the basis of prior opportunity and social background. Poorer children, including high ability poor children, lose out most.",
