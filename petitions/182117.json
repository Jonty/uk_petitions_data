        "additional_details": "I definitely think this approach will incentivise the UK government to take a long, hard look at the way public money is spent and realise that a lot more citizens are suffering because of the way things are currently done. \r\n \r\nI believe that if a basic income was guaranteed then that would alleviate the suffering of people struggling to keep a roof over their heads, buy food and pay the most essential bills like electricity, gas, heating, water and things like that, especially those living in poverty. We all know that even at the moment people that are on the minimum wage (which was supposed to help people to be able to live above the poverty line) are STILL struggling to make ends meet?!",
