        "background": "HS2 has been the most controversial vanity project ever.\r\nThe 'Y' would be a better option, and is needed-HS2 is not. The cost has spiralled beyond belief and the money saved would be better spent on a larger proportion of the British population.\r\nStop before the country is bankrupt by it.",
