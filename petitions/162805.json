        "action": "Reintroduce the capital penalty for serious crimes.",
        "additional_details": "The fundamental law of the European Union forbids the use of the death penalty in any of the Member States, as does the European Charter of Human Rights.  However, with the forthcoming secession from the EU and abolition of the ECHR, thought should be given to its reintroduction, notably in cases of a) Mass murder; b) Rape, sodomy, or unlawful carnal knowledge of a minor; c) Treason (but NOT offences against the Official Secrets Act), by means of lethal injection.",
        "background": "The capital, or death, penalty has been a feature of criminal justice the world over for millennia.  While the principle of rehabilitative justice persists in the United Kingdom to the point of being considered the primary paradigm, there are some people who can not be rehabilitated.",
