        "action": "Propose a referendum on whether or not HM Government should trigger Article 50.",
        "additional_details": "This petition is due to the sheer number of people expressing they voted incorrectly to leave, some as a \"dissatisfaction\" vote and the fact the vote was too close to be a satisfactory result. Also the backtracking on spending proposals (eg NHS) clearly left many feeling deceived by the out campaign. UK citizens deserve honesty and integrity from their leaders to make truely informed decisions and that did not happen. ",
        "background": "Following the EU referendum and the fact UK citizens can now see it's effect more clearly and are better informed of future plans, we the undersigned propose HM Government hold a further referendum on whether or not to trigger Article50. The result of this should then determine a 2nd referendum.",
