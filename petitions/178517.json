        "additional_details": "73% of 18-24 year olds voted to remain, as did the majority under 45: it is their future you are deciding. The Leave campaign was based on many outright lies, among them promises that we would not leave the single market or the customs union; many Leave voters are showing regret. We remind you of how Labour were made to answer for their decisions on the Iraq war. You, the elected MPs, are the people\u2019s true representatives and the future of the country rests in your hands and on your conscience.",
        "background": "The ruling that Parliament must vote on whether Brexit is put in motion makes the MPs directly accountable to the people for the most important political decision of a generation. We urge you to listen to the overwhelming expert advice against Brexit and consider what real mandate you have for it.",
