        "additional_details": "I've been a paid care worker and nursing my mother in law I know how isolating this can be, there is no one person to turn to, you have to fight and persist to get anything done. Often having to get MP's involved to get  basic of care equipment. This is not right when you are identified as a carer there must be a universal package that kicks in and your needs looked at before situations reach crisis point. Health and safety goes out the window for unpaid carers they need equipment and training.",
        "background": "Unpaid carers save the country millions but are isolated, untrained, lacking equipment and reaching breaking point. They need respite and training to the same standards as paid carers. They need knowledge on what is available to them and need support before the situation reaches crisis point.",
