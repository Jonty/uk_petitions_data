        "additional_details": "There is a strong case for an effective second chamber of people to scrutinise legislation and propose amendments where appropriate. Not all of the 729 plus current peers should sit in the house. Instead a body of 250 sitting members should be nominated by party leaders in proportion to each parties representation in the House of Commons, but to include a least 20% neutral (non party) members who have particular qualifications or expertise. This latter group to be appointed by Select Committee",
        "background": "The House of Lords has become an unwieldy and ineffective institution that has fallen into disrepute. It does not represent the broad political spectrum in the elected House of Commons and is wholly unaccountable to the public.",
