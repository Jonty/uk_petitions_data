        "additional_details": "America has helped save the UK in both world wars. America also helped in the Northern Ireland peace agreement. Without America there would be no Nato or UN. Donald Trump has done more in ten days than most US presidents do in four years. His love of the UK knows no bounds given his investments here. A knighthood is the least of what he deserves. ",
        "background": "Donald Trump is the first leader of any major nation to do what he said he would do in an election campaign. Some of us may disagree but he is putting America and the UK first in his administration. He should be made to feel welcome and the UK government must recognise his love of the free world.",
