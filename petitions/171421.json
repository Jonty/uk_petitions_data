        "additional_details": "The FTSE 100 average yearly gain is 5.4% (Motley Fool UK).  Yet average yearly earning income increases between 2001 and 2016 is just 2.3% (ONS). Clearly a CGT rate of 20% benefits the wealthy.\r\nCGT shouldn't change for companies, only for high net worth individuals. Capital investment is essential to our economy; and individuals won't be put off investing if they have to pay 40% on their profits like everyone else. Changing CGT would improve inequality and provide revenue for the government.",
        "background": "Only wealthy people make large gains on their assets; yet they pay the same as working people earning \u00a311,000 to \u00a343,000 per year; this is obviously unfair and perpetuates inequality. Let's create a fairer society where our taxes don't benefit the wealthy and everyone really pays their fair share.",
