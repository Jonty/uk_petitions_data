        "additional_details": "They are loan sharks who destroy peoples lives. The UK got along fine without them before and we don't need them or their crooked ways. Their APR is so high that struggling families pay them back and then have to take money from them again just to survive. What kind of government do we have if we allow families to fall into a trap and commit suicide over these disgusting companies. ",
        "background": "Pay day loan companies are worse than loan sharks, in a recent story a boy killed himself after Wonga emptied his bank account, this is not the first time someone has killed themselves.",
