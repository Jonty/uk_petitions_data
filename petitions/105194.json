        "additional_details": "Perhaps one of the greatest flaws in our democratic system is that the ordinary citizen has absolutely no say whatsoever in how laws are made. This means that government only works for the top few, and the current political establishment. The ballot initiative will change all that. Such a system is already in place in Switzerland, there's no reason why the UK can't have it.\r\n\r\nRead about it here:\r\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1435383/How-direct-democracy-makes-Switzerland-a-better-place.html",
        "background": "The ballot initiative is where a petition signed by a certain number of citizens can bring about a public referendum on a certain issue or put any law which doesn't violate international law to a referendum. This will ensure that our voices are heard and will massively restore trust in our system.",
