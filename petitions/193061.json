        "action": "Give 50\u2019s women a break from NI payments from age 60 to make up for lost pension",
        "additional_details": "The 3 Pension Acts impacted all women born from 6th Apr 50 to 5th Apr 60.  Those worst affected were women born on or after 6th Dec 53 all of whom have lost at least 5 years pension under the 2011 Act.  Women born on or after 6th Oct 54 lost 6 years.  So a woman born late 1954, who was expecting to receive her pension in 2014, now has to wait until 2020! This petition proposes a means by which at least some compensation can be delivered correcting the injustice of these women having to pay NI. ",
        "background": "50\u2019s women were badly affected by the Pension Acts of 1995, 2011 & 2014 losing 5 years state pension at a stroke at short notice.  It is unfair that those working beyond 60 have to pay NI, losing money from the wages they expected not to need to contribute to the pension they had been promised. ",
