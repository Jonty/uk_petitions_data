        "action": "Allow international students extended time on their visas after graduation.",
        "additional_details": "I have many friends who have put thousands of pounds into the UK economy through education fees, accommodation, local businesses, supermarkets, transport. Days after graduation have had to return or are made to return with no experience within their field of study to take back home after in some cases putting their life savings into their education. Countries such as India take on our companies allowing us to outsource but provide minimal opportunities to students from India or elsewhere.",
        "background": "Some international students have to return home days after graduation as they as then classed as illegal immigrants, they spend a lot of money to study here in some cases \u00a340,000 for a degree and it is unfair they have no opportunities after their graduation. ",
