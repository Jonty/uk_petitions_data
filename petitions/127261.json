        "additional_details": "It is becoming more consistent, with modern driving convention, that the middle lane is being incorrectly used as the primary driving lane. This above all, is dangerous practice and causes delays. It effectively limits 3 lane motorways to the middle and right hand lane when drivers do not use the left hand lane.\r\n\r\nThe government should consider instructing the Police to give out more penalties to drivers committing this offence. Additionally penalties should be more severe to act as a deterrent.",
        "background": "I'm accordance with The Highway Code, 'Rule 264' states that all drivers must keep to the left-hand lane when not overtaking. The Government should consider to enforce this law more stringently and issue with greater frequency the number of penalties to penalties to drivers who commit this offence.",
