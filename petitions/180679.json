        "action": "Halt Brexit process & seek legally binding mandate from public post-Trump",
        "additional_details": "Following the election of Mr. Trump and the subsequent change in US government administration, the US has changed position on numerous issues, with controversy following certain actions too numerous to mention here. We are specifically concerned with where this leaves the UK in our Brexit negotiations given HM Government's timetable for withdrawal, in light of the overwhelming disquiet shown over aligning ourselves with the new US administration against the relative stability of EU membership.",
        "background": "The recent change in the US government administration and their subsequent rhetoric and actions have placed the UK in a perilous negotiating position during the Brexit process. Reality of Brexit is also more well defined than pre-referendum meaning public opinion may have changed significantly.",
