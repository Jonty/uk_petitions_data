        "additional_details": "While parents have the statutory right under Section 71 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 to withdraw their children from RE lessons and acts of collective worship, many parents are reluctant to separate their child from classmates. Also, many schools do not keep the religious elements separate from the rest of the worship, and parents would not risk their child missing the entire event.",
        "background": "All state schools (even without religious designation) in the UK are required under a 1944 Act to hold a compulsory daily act of worship of Christian character, which is not just archaic, but outright discriminatory.\r\n\r\nWe would like to see religious education to be objective and educational",
