        "action": "Compulsory teaching of Economics at GCSE level.",
        "additional_details": "The effect a decision will have on the economy is central to any debate or issue. To make an informed decision, people require knowledge (e.g how free markets work) and the effect their vote will have on the economy. Knowledge of Economics allows students to make educated and substantial choices.\r\n\r\nBy teaching Economics, this is providing students skills for adult life, a major issue with schools as they fail to teach students skills useful in adult life such as budgeting, taxes and employment. ",
        "background": "Teaching Politics does not help voters make an informed decision on matters such as the EU Referendum, as it is largely an economical matter. It gives us little insight to the implications of our decisions. Economics gives children factual knowledge to allow them to form decisions on such matters.",
