No matter which opinion you were of Remain/Leave, those who just don't like it / regret their vote / didn't even bother to vote don't get a second chance. It shouldn't work that way as every vote does count. Manifestos are subject to more scrutiny than campaign propaganda. Together we stand and divided we fall. Never more apt.",
        "background": "In the aftermath of the Referendum on the EU the country is divided.   Another Referendum will add to this division. A General Election gives the electorate another say and creates a clear mandate.  In order to do this the Fixed Term Parliament Act needs a motion of no confidence.",
