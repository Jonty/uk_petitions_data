        "additional_details": "The M42 is a good example. Between the M6 at Birmingham and the M1 south, lorries pull out whenever they please causing massive queues and shunt crashes during 'rush hour' times. This needs to stop!",
        "background": "Create enforceable ban on lorries 5.5 tonnes and over using the outside lane on dual lane motorways, to be especially strict during heavy commuting hours. It causes a huge risk to public safety with exaggerated accordion effects and shunt crashes due to high closing speeds. Also slows down traffic!",
