        "additional_details": "To leave the EU is not a detailed plan, it's a slogan. For this reason alone, I think a public inquiry into this fiasco is necessary. Furthermore, many of the statements put forward by the leave campaign groups are now being retracted. Given these promises will have influenced people to vote to leave, how can this be tolerated?\r\n\r\nThen we hear that Scotland will potentially break the union, that MPs have to vote to implement article 50 anyway and the whole thing seems\r\npoorly thought through. ",
        "background": "On 23rd June 2016 the UK voted to leave the EU in a referendum instigated by our Prime Minister. The questioned posed was to remain or leave. However, no explanation of what leaving meant was provided. How can a country make such a decision without being told what the choice actually meant?",
