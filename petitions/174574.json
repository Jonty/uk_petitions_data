        "action": "Add gender-neutral name fields to the marriage certificate",
        "additional_details": "In answer to the previous petition that the mother's name be added to the marriage certificate, alongside the father's [https://www.change.org/p/mothers-names-should-be-on-marriage-certificates], the Home Office decided that it cannot agree to adding the mother's name, as that assumes couples have opposite-gender parents, and the idea is therefore exclusionary. Gender-neutral name fields is the obvious solution to this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "This petition proposes that two gender-neutral name fields be added to  the marriage certificate, to replace the father-only field. This suggestion is to enable parity, irrespective of gender/sexual orientation.\r\n",
