It's clear that you are concerned about rogue builders ripping people off, but it is not clear what action you would like the Government or Parliament to take. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking for the directors of building companies to remain legally responsible for the work of the company even after it has closed down.  \r\n\r\nYou can find out about more your rights and how to deal with rogue builders here:\r\nhttps://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/getting-home-improvements-done/problem-with-home-improvements/"
