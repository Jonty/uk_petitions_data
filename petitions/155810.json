        "additional_details": "Many people believed the NHS would get an extra \u00a3350m/week if we left the EU, and were swayed by it when they came to vote.\r\n\r\nThe politicians, major donors, newspapers and newspaper proprietors behind the Leave campaign need to make good on their promise. They should therefore be jointly liable to pay to the NHS \u00a3350 million out of their own funds, every week until they are all bankrupt.",
        "background": "During the Brexit referendum the Leave campaign said \"Let\u2019s give our NHS the \u00a3350m the EU takes every week\". As soon as they won, they backtracked from this claim, and did it so quickly that one might conclude they never meant it in the first place. ",
