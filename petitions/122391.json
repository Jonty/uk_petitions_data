        "additional_details": "D and E are purchasing a property jointly which is intended to be their main residence. E already owns a property, which was previously used as a main residence, which he will not have sold at the time of purchase - even though it is for sale. Upon purchase, as E will own two properties and has not replaced his main residence, the higher rates will apply. \r\n\r\nYou get a refund of the higher rate if one of the property is sold within 18 months.\r\n\r\nIt is unfair to have to pay the higher rate upfront.",
        "background": "From April 1 2016, if you buy a new home and have not yet managed to sell your current home, for any reason, you will have to pay the higher rate of stamp duty UPFRONT. On a \u00a3250,000 purchase, you will have to pay \u00a310,000 stamp duty instead of the normal amount of \u00a32,500. See example, below:",
