The Home Secretary will use these powers when justified and based on all available evidence. \r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister has made clear that he completely disagrees with Donald Trump\u2019s remarks. The Home Secretary has said that Donald Trump\u2019s remarks in relation to Muslims are divisive, unhelpful and wrong. \r\n\t\r\nThe Government recognises the strength of feeling against the remarks and will continue to speak out against comments which have the potential to divide our communities, regardless of who makes them. We reject any attempts to create division and marginalisation amongst those we endeavour to protect.\r\n\r\nHome Office\r\n",
