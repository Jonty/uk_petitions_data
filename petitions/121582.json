        "additional_details": "It is unacceptable that the British, be expected to keep abusers in prisons and risk re-offences upon release. As they are released from prisons, they remain a very real danger to the children of Britain while police struggle to bring grooming gangs to justice. We call for any immigrant child abuser to be deported and British Citizenship revoked, immediately following a guilty verdict in a British court of law.",
        "background": "Professor Jay's independent report finally provided evidence that 97 % of abusers were of Pakistani origin. Thousands of lives have been destroyed by a total disregard for British law and contempt for British children. ",
