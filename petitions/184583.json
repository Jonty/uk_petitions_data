        "additional_details": "The Lords is an outdated and wholly undemocratic throwback to the past and the percentages of members from each political party are disproportionate to those elected by the people in the commons. This allows for political points scoring and undermines the very core principles of a democratic society where the voices of the majority of we the people are meant to be central.",
        "background": "The unelected members of the House of Lords will be seeking to add amendments to the article 50 notification bill that were not approved by our democratically elected members of parliament.\r\nSeek to limit the damage the House can do to the democratically expressed will of the people.",
