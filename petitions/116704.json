        "additional_details": "Evidence: the daily blinding from oncoming traffic which abuses the fog light switch.\r\n\r\nIt is not an excuse that \"if forgot to turn them off\" when there is clear indication on the dashboard of them being on.\r\n\r\nThis is tantermount to wreckless or careless driving.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be little police power to enforce this offence. Before there is a tragic accident, something must be changed in the law.\r\n\r\nOnly when drivers may have points upon their licence for this specific offence, like speeding or indeed dangerous driving, or indeed using a mobile phone while driving, may they actually find the off switch for their lamps.",
        "background": "All road users are sick and tired of being blinded by the use of fog lights in non foggy conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is often the case that road users intentionally use these for their benefit whilst blinding other road users and potentially causing accidents, even in extreme circumstance, death",
