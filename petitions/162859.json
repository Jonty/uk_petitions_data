        "additional_details": "School is our first experience of institutional life and so, as a priority, it should be inclusive and harmonised from the outset. Religion is used in our schools as a context to teach ethics. A Comparative History of Religion will foster objectivity and tolerance, which are themselves virtuous. A Comparative History of Religion will produce an empirical lesson in social harmony that is psychologically wholesome, undeniable and therefore enduring. ",
