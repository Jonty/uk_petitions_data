        "action": "The House of Commons to call a General Election following the EU referendum",
        "additional_details": "The result has deeply divided the country and historically constitutional change in most countries has required a clear majority. For example, for the House of Commons to call for a General Election requires 2/3rd vote in favour.\r\n\r\nIf an unelected Prime Minister leads the negotiations on such a slim majority this will lead to a constitutional crisis with no public mandate to enact the result of the referendum.\r\n\r\nA general election will allow for a mandated government to respond to the referendum.",
        "background": "The EU referendum result was a small majority in favour of changing the status quo. With the stated resignation of the Prime Minister this means the government will be negotiating significant constitutional change lead by a leader who has no public mandate.",
