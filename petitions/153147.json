        "action": "Allow students aged 16+ whose parents receive financial aid to gain employment.",
        "additional_details": "By allowing students to gain employment it allows them to learn financial sustainability and also gives them vital work experience which is widely needed to gain future employment. I am a 17 year old student who has to volunteer to use up spare time as I cant gain employment. I would like to earn my own money but cant due to legal reasons. Even if I could only earn a certain amount would be better than none. So please help me with this petition and sign and share to gain work rights for students",
        "background": "Students who's parents receive financial aid from the governments benefits system should be allowed to gain employment as they currently are not. If a parent or career receives benefits then the house hold income must stay the same to what is provided by the government.  ",
