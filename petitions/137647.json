Many Leave voters already regret their choice as the constitutional and economic implications become clear. The decision to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty to take the UK out of the EU is so important that it must have the overwhelming support of the British people, which is not the case. Otherwise, the democratic rights of all those people who did not vote to leave will have been violated. ",
