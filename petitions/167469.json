        "background": "Norway has announced that it plans to allow hunters to kill 47 wolves living in the wild, despite the species being listed as \"critically endangered\" on the 2015 Norwegian list of endangered animals. This represents the cull of up to two-thirds of the country's total wild wolf population.",
