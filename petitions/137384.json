        "additional_details": "Brexit is happening but those who already have their homes here should not be punished. A long wait must be avoided, not just for those EU citizens, but for our economy too. Uncertainty dents consumer confidence which impacts on amounts spent, reducing tax income to spend on vital services.\r\n\r\nThe government must ensure that there is a quick, easy process for visas to be granted to EU citizens already living here & they are called upon to take urgent action to confirm this will be put in place.",
        "background": "After Brexit, EU citizens ability to stay in the UK is uncertain. Friends & colleagues who were born outside the UK but made their home here have made a valuable economic & non-economic contribution. We want to ensure they can remain in their homes with the minimum distress, concern & paperwork.",
