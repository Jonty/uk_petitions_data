        "additional_details": "It is widely believed Joseph wanted his remains be kept at the hospital for medical research. Although not on public display, there is no evidence this was his wish and his bones have been bleached to such an extent no DNA can be extracted. Joseph's mother Mary Jane is buried in Welford Road Cemetery  with Joseph's younger brother William who died when he was five years old. We believe he should be returned to Leicester and given a christian burial and laid to rest with his mother.",
        "background": "Joseph Carey Merrick, otherwise known by his stage name The Elephant Man was born in Lee Street in Leicester in 1862. He spent the last years of his life at The Royal London Hospital on the Whitechapel Road in the East End of London under the care of Dr. Frederick Treves. He died in April 1890.",
