        "additional_details": "As well as increasing the number of training places available to people aged 18, the number of places available to people in their 20's (both with and without a first degree in another subject) should be significantly increased to improve access to medicine as a career.  Currently to secure a place at medical school you have to demonstate an excellent academic record, a committment to medicine and a track record of helping others, usually by the age of 17.",
        "background": "To meet future demands for healthcare, whilst managing the hours worked by doctors, we need more doctors.  There are currently lots of talented people who want to train as doctors but can't because there are not enough places at medical schools.",
