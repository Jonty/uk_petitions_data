        "action": "Consider independent representatives in all future referendum campaigns.",
        "additional_details": "This petition has been set up in the wake of the European referendum whereby both sides of the debate contained large degrees of scaremongering and, retrospectively it would appear a number of false statements.\r\n\r\nWe feel that the clear choice in a democratic society is for independent (non-political) representatives to debate both sides in future (based on facts) and with no bias.",
        "background": "For all future referendum campaigns, we would like to see the appointment of independent and impartial representatives debate both sides of the argument (with the budget split evenly).  We feel that by doing this, each sides argument is based on fact and not for political gain.",
