        "additional_details": "You would not leave your door open in all weathers at home.\r\n Legislation exists to improve energy efficiency in new buildings but High street retailers routinely keep external doors open simply as a marketing tool. Automatic door openers offer some benefit but these are often disabled simply to encourage shoppers to enter and buy. Legislation applying to all retailers will provide a level playing field and reduce any perceived marketing benefit which drives the current bad practice.     ",
