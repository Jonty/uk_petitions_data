        "additional_details": "The campaigns we saw did not nearly go far enough to provide people with the information they needed to make a fully informed decision when casting their vote.  Vital topics such as residency of current EU citizens, the ability of UK nationals to work and travel around the EU, how the money currently being spent on the EU would be redirected, how trading might continue, and the overall effect on the economy were neglected.  Further information is required to allow an informed ballot.",
        "background": "The campaigns surrounding the EU Referendum did not contain sufficient accurate or honest information to allow the electorate to make an informed decision.  I call upon the Government to anul the referendum and hold another once the public has the information required to make an educated decision.",
