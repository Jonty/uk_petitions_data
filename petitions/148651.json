        "additional_details": "Her Majesty the Queen is currently Queen of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Her kingdom has been hugely successful in economics, science, arts and sport and is admired internationally. The EU referendum result is already having dire impacts. It may, ultimately, mean that she is no longer monarch of Scotland and she may even lose Northern Ireland. It is, therefore, in her own interests to put a stop to the break up of her Kingdom and the resulting negative impact on her subjects.",
        "background": "Leaving the EU will break up the UK. The resulting economic chaos is reducing our standing internationally. The Queen of the UK has ultimate veto on government policy and can dissolve Parliament. David Cameron could prompt her Majesty to save us and her own position. We ask him to do so.",

The Queen, on the advice of the Prime Minister, no longer has the power to dissolve Parliament and call a General Election. The Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, which came into force in 2011 under the Coalition Government, removed the power to set the general election date from the Government and gave a power to the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nAn early general election can only be called under the Act if either a motion (as worded in section 2(2) of the Act) that there shall be an early parliamentary general election is passed by the House of Commons with at least two thirds in favour of the motion; or if a motion of no confidence (as worded in section 2(4) of the Act) is passed by the House of Commons and the House does not pass a motion of confidence (as worded in section 2(5) of the Act) in the Government or an alternative Government within 14 days. Aside from these triggers there is no way to replace the Government through an early General Election."
