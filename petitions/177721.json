        "additional_details": "Despite a \u00a34m regeneration project only a few years ago, the centre of Renfrew is now constantly crowded with cars, buses and other vehicles. On a daily basis, even outwith peak travel hours, Canal St, High St and Hairst St  are congested with traffic resulting in massive rises in air and noise pollution within the town centre. This has made living, commuting and travelling within the centre - and periphery - of Renfrew extremely difficult and unsafe. ",
        "background": "As residents living in Renfrew, it has become increasingly frustrating watching the High St and surrounding areas become overrun with traffic and it's related issues.This has made living, working and travelling extremely difficult particularly as this is an area with lots of businesses and a school.",
