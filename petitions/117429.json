        "additional_details": "Many domestic pets are petrified of these noises and very loud bangs and many of them need a vet\u2019s intervention to help them cope with the stress and fear caused.  We shouldn't need to sedate pets in order for them to cope with man made noises like this.  It\u2019s cruel, insensitive and inhumane.",
        "background": "Many animals are terrified of the loud noises the fireworks of today produce.  This New Year\u2019s Eve sounded like a war zone.  Bangs have reached an unreasonable level and I don't see any need for bangs to be so loud they make windows vibrate or sound like they have been produced by the Army.",
