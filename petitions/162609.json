        "additional_details": "The 6 week holiday is to long for many reasons.\r\nI suggest taking 2 weeks off the 6 week break.Let children have these 2 weeks a year in term time,this way there will be no set period each year for holiday companies to include them in high season rates, as there would be if added to half term breaks.The teachers could take their 2 weeks the last week of the Summer and Autumn terms, as these are wind down weeks and not much work takes place,it could easily be covered by TA's or relief teachers.\r\n",
        "background": "I have 2 children and have worked in a school for 6 years.\r\nBooking a holiday in the school break can be double the amount than in term time,as the travel firms give school holiday weeks high season rates, making it impossible for lots of families to go away on holiday.\r\nLets change this.\r\n",
