        "action": "Allow parents to use tax-free childcare vouchers to increase schools funding",
        "additional_details": "The idea:\r\nMany working parents like me pay into a childcare voucher scheme for under-5s, where up to \u00a3243 per month can be used tax-free towards nursery.  \r\nThe government should extend this scheme so that is continues for working parents of over-5s and their schools. \r\nThis means that if parents choose, and are able to make a voluntary financial donation to a school, it is not taxed; thus helping to fill the funding gap.",
        "background": "Schools funding in England is at a critical low - some are threatening a 4-day week to reduce the financial deficit.  This will profoundly affect our children's education.  \r\nMy local school receives just \u00a315.16 per child per day.  It is not enough to cover even basic teaching requirements.",
