        "additional_details": "This is a totalitarian tactic damaging the impartiality of the BBC. The BBC is the only juggernaut working on behalf of the public with everyone's interests at heart. It's possible that if we allow government to rip the heart out of this organisation then, eventually, there will be very little truth being broadcast to the population. We cannot rely on the newspapers alone as they don't belong to us, & b) Many, including The Daily Mail & the Sun are owned by people such as Rupert Murdoch",
        "background": "Government intend to draw up new proposals for a 'radical overhaul' in how the BBC is governed & audited. Currently the government hands over our licence fee monies in order to pay for our beloved BBC. In recent years there have been drastic cuts & reshaping but these new measures are very worrying.",
