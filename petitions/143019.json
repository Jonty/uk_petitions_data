        "additional_details": "Leave campaign included claim to spend \u00a3350m per week on NHS. How can this be implemented? Leave suggested that immigration would be controlled/reduced but now we have politicians being interviewed stating that there could still be freedom of movement. A General Election would allow manifestos to be laid out as to what each party would prioritise in divorcing from the EU, and the settlement they would wish to achieve. Otherwise where is the democracy?",
        "background": "Due to the result of the EU referendum to leave, there was clearly no plan in place about what happens next. The people who voted to leave have a wide variety of priorities and there was no manifesto as to what exit strategy would be. Prime Minister has announced resignation.",
