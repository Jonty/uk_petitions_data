        "additional_details": "An online consultation began on 22nd July 2016 with little account taken of the need for accessibility for those with disabilities. \r\nWe note with concern that this consultation started during the busy summer holiday period when many people are away or otherwise occupied.This is a matter of considerable concern for residents of Portsmouth, Southampton and the IOW. It also disenfranchises many students who study in the two cities and on the island but may be away during the summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The local authorities of these areas are proposing sweeping changes to the way local government works. This will result in the creation of a new Solent Combined Authority headed by an Elected Mayor.\r\n\r\n",
