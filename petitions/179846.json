        "action": "Stop the DVLA from passing driver details to rogue private parking companies.",
        "additional_details": "I demand action to stop the DVLA passing personal information of UK drivers to rogue parking companies who demand, intimidate and threaten individuals with illegal fines. I understand that the DVLA feel they can and receive a payment of \u00a32.50 for each transfer of details. I believe the DVLA are contravening the Data Protection Act and also profiteering from this action. Challenging parking on private property comes under civil law. They are not the same as local govt or law enforcement agencies. ",
        "background": "I have recently been sent official looking letters by 2 Separate companies demanding payment of \u00a3100 for parking on a private road.  This is civil law and they are not official authorities who under statute of law, are entitled to demand and process fines by way of a fixed penalty notice.",
