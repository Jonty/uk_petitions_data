        "additional_details": "Over 20 Billion cochineal insects are killed each year just to make the food additive E120. There are many other alternative red food colourants that don't involve the killing of insects or any other animals, like E162, Betanin. I am amazed that this colourant is still legal for use in the UK. E120 is mostly used in red sweets and drinks. Vegetarian or not, would anyone want to eat these insects?\r\n\r\nReferences: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmine https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betanin http://youtu.be/dJ0hNYb6nhY",
        "background": "I am 15 and I have been a vegetarian for about 7 years, and over this time I have discovered lots of ingredients in food that are not suitable for vegetarians. One on these ingredients is E120, Carmine. It is an unnecessary red food colourant made from the pulverised bodies of the cochineal insect.",
