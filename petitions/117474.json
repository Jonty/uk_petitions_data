        "additional_details": "A government backed scheme would allow those at risk to obtain some flood cover, even with high excess, to enable rebuilding to begin and to replace many of the items lost.\r\nIt would allow small business to continue to trade and continue to employ people in the local area, thus mitigating further against the tragedy of flooding. \r\nMuch of the flooding is due to planning consent causing additional run off into flood pains where premises have been allowed to be built. The problem will worsen. \r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The north of the UK has seen record for damage and many of those affected are unable to get private coverage for flood due to previous incidents.  \r\nBoth private individuals and businesses have been heavily hit and this is on the back of many other areas of the UK previously affected.",
