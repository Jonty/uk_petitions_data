I recently took him to the urgent care centre on the 5/12/16, because his lack of breathing and chesty cough. I was sat there for four hours to only be told he's fine and his chest is clear. He had no observations done. The next day my son was rushed to hospital and I was told he was lacking oxygen really bad (65 out of 100 to be persist) he then had to have 5ml of steroids (oral) 8-8 failed my little boy. ",
