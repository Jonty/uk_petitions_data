        "additional_details": "Through a carefully crafted Referendum in which the people of S.Cameroon were refused a third option 'Independence' through the UN's fear of not creating many small states, The people of British S. Cameroons are still suffering the slavish effects of colonialism under La Republic. After Almost 55 years of marginalization, brutal impunity and gross miscarriage of injustice we the people want an autonomous state and it is incumbent on the UK Government to help our people regain their Liberties",
        "background": "In September of 1961 the British Government refused to grant British Southern Cameroon independence as an autonomous state but rather transferred the baton of 'Master' to La Republic Du Cameroun that had become independent in 1960, hence refusing the people of BSC the right to self determination.
