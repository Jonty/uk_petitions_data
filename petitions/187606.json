        "action": "The UK Prime Minister and Parliament must publicly condemn Trump's BBC ban",
        "additional_details": "This unprecedented decision is not only an affront to freedom of expression in general, but also an insult to the professional integrity and ethics of the UK public service broadcasting system. The UK PM has invited Trump to pay a state visit in our country, which will be also covered in the news by the very same public organisation that he has now publicly distrusted. The UK PM and Parliament must unequivocally condemn President Trump's BBC ban as well as all his attacks to the media. \r\n\r\n",
        "background": "On 24th February, UK public service broadcaster BBC and several other media outlets were barred from attending an audience with US White House Press Speaker. This happened only hours after President Donald Trump had tweeted that \"fake news media\" were \"the enemy of the American people\".",
