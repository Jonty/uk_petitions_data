        "additional_details": "The right to freedom of speech is a right that has been fought for and even died for throughout history. It is a right that we have inherited and it is a fundamental human right that should be protected at all costs.\r\n\r\nThere are many laws that stifle free speech, the 2006 Racial and Religious Hatred Act in particular. This law is open to interpretation to the extent that many people fear retribution for simply voicing a negative opinion. ",
        "background": "The Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006 is open to misinterpretation. It is a law that stifles freedom of speech as many people fear losing their jobs, or even arrest and imprisonment for voicing an opinion that is taken the wrong way. This prevents a rational discussion of important topics.",
