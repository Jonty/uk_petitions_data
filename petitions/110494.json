AB has learning difficulties, dyslexia, child like behaviour and is schizophrenic. No one knew AB's problems, including her family as AB wasn't able to express herself. \r\n\r\nCurrently AB is made to believe she has supernatural powers and is a 'Faith Healer'. These people exploiting her will not allow her to obtain Mental Health Support. \r\n\r\nHow can you help AB through our current Laws & Legislations?",
