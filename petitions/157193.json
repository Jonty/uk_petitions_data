        "additional_details": "As many politicians and leaders have correctly stated, this event marks an unprecedented point in modern history and therefore deserves to be done correctly and with the continued will of the people.\r\n\r\nOnce the leadership campaigns have been conducted and all the main political parties have a definitive way to describe to the people how they would proceed in negotiations for a withdrawal, then a mandate should be sought from the people to choose who they want to represent them in this matter.",
        "background": "After the recent referendum the people recognise that all political parties have had to abandon their election manifestos and reinvent themselves. This means that we have a government & opposition that nobody voted for.\r\n\r\nWe therefore believe a new mandate is required for negotiations with the EU.",
