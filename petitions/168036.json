        "additional_details": "With Some 60% of Tribunal appeals for ESA/DLA and PIP overturning the original decision by the DWP, there should be some type of penalty towards the original Assessor and Decision Maker. \r\nWhere proof is provided by the claimant that the health issues deserve these benefits, and the claimant appeals to Tribunal and wins, the Assessor and the DWP should have a financial penalty. Claimants are 'Sanctioned for missing appointments, let then be sanctioned for getting it wrong!'",
        "background": "More than 60% of DWP decisions are overturned by Tribunals, which shows DWP and/or Assessment companies are in it for the money! Not because they care. Financial penalties would save millions of Tax payers money, They would soon get it right! Appeals should NOT be needed in genuine cases!",
