        "additional_details": "A REGISTERED vehicle which has INSURANCE will be traceable when it comes to NtO (Fines) etc... \r\nBut if Un-registered / Un-Insured = No parking fines, No speeding fines EVER and driver/owner untraceable to authorities unless they are caught in the act with the vehicle. I petition to enforce a power for police to seize any vehicle on a public road that is not lawfully insured regardless if the owner has been caught driving it or not.\r\nWe must be Proactive and not Reactive in crime prevention! ",
        "background": "Currently Police don't have the power to seize vehicles that are parked unattended and uninsured on our roads under S.165 Road Traffic Act 1988 if its taxed etc. A huge problem is criminals buying these cars, not being the registered owner therefore evading possible penalties incurred.",
