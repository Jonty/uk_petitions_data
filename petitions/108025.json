        "action": "Legislate to revive the concept of 'hostis humani generis' and apply to ISIS.",
        "additional_details": "We know enough about ISIS to proscribe them. They actively involve themselves in murder, rape, and slavery. They boast about this as a recruitment device. They openly commit genocide against people and specifically target the cultural inheritance of mankind. They are brigands, cut-throats, and slavers.\r\n\r\nAll states should be permitted to take whatever action as they are able, to destroy them, without fear of vexatious legislation.",
        "background": "The concept of 'hostis humani generis' was utilised by the Admiralty in the 19th Century to police piracy and slavery. We need to draw upon this legacy and clearly describe ISIS in such terms to eliminate legal ambiguities concerning action taken against known members, whatever their jurisdiction.",
