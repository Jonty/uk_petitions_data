        "action": "Set up a Commission of Enquiry into the Bromley Housing Transfer of 1993",
        "additional_details": "The privatisation of Bromley's entire housing stock was the first and the largest exercise of its kind. There were a number of apparent irregularities in the process, arguably setting dangerous precedents:-\r\n1) Public servants, Bromley Council housing officers, were actively involved in canvassing for the transfer, an apparent breach of normal protocol requiring public servants to be apolitical;\r\n2) The 'election' was one-sided, with glossy literature on one side only, this deemed wrong by the UN.",
        "background": "In 1993 Bromley Borough council tenants were given the unenviable task of choosing between a cash-strapped, cost-cutting council and privatisation of the entire housing stock, apparently for all time. This seems a peculiarly heavy democratic burden for any electorate to bear, especially the poor.",
