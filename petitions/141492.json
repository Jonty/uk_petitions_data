        "additional_details": "Without trying to cause offence, most people voting that are over the age of 70 probably won't be around to feel the effects of their decisions, with some based on personal vendettas rather than being informed. Meanwhile, the younger generation must make the best of the situation handed down to them. This referendum has been heavily skewed and our government should represent the interest of the WHOLE of society. A 2nd referendum must take place with provisions for 16 & 17 year olds to vote too.",
        "background": "The people of the UK (exc. 16 & 17 year olds) have voted to leave the EU. I'm all for democracy but when you have a situation where you exclude 1.5 million people from voting on such an imperative issue (AND THEIR FUTURES) a stand must be taken. 75% of young voters had voted for \"remain\".",
