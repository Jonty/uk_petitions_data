        "additional_details": "The Burka has already been banned in several Western European countries and the European Court of Human Rights has confirmed that such a ban is legal.\r\n\r\nEveryone in England, including Muslims, should oppose the insidious spread of this vile piece of clothing, which imprisons women, threatens social harmony, fuels distrust, has grave health implications and is a potential security risk.",
        "background": "The increasing fashion for young Muslim women in England to wear the burka (in contrast to their mothers, who do not) is one of most sinister developments of our times, it is also a direct attack on the indigenous Christian cultural heritage of England.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
