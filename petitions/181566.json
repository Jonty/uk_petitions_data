Then a specialist should come out to talk to the disabled person and determine what they can do to help. If needed this poor individual should be taken to a hospital designed to help people with mental health issues. The NHS try to help such people but they can only do there best. Please help these people just because you cant see this disability doesn't mean it isn't there. ",

From the moment someone dials 999 they should only be talking to trained professionals who have specialist skills in helping mentally disabled people. ",
