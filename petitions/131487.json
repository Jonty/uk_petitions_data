        "additional_details": "The Leeds City Region tram-train proposal will not alleviate congestion in the worst affected areas of the city. Its principal merit is its branch to Leeds Bradford Airport - something that is well needed. However, by investing into a German style metro system that functions as an underground within Central Leeds and a tram elsewhere, and by concentrating on areas most congested, Leeds can lose the embarrassing burden of being the largest city in Europe without a 21st century transport system.",
        "background": "Leeds is Europe's largest city without an underground or tram. The cost to build either is constantly heralded as 'too great' by governments yet Nottingham, Sheffield, Edinburgh, Cardiff etc. have all been granted transport permissions that Leeds, a larger city, has not.",
