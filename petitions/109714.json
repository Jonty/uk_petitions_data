        "additional_details": "Calais has long been a magnet for migrants hoping to reach Britain. In 1999 the Red Cross-run reception centre Sangatte opened, but was shut in 2002. Now over 3000 people live in squalor in the Jungle camp & smaller border encampments, some of which  have been bulldozed with people losing their passports & papers. Many lack essentials such as safe drinking water, adequate food, sanitation & proper shelter. Gangrene & dysentery are common (Doctors of the World). The crisis must be resolved now.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Over 3000 people are stranded in \"dire living and reception conditions\" (UNHCR) in & around Calais, many camped on a disused refuse tip. We ask the Government to work urgently with France both to improve conditions in the camps & implement a humane process to decide the fate of these people.",
