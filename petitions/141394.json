        "additional_details": "The Houses of Commons role is to represent the will of the British people, it is a privileged position that many seek during various elections, but only those successfully elected are asked to serve.\r\n\r\nMr. Lammy has shown that he is in contempt of such a service, does not respect his entrusted office or the British people. His suggestion calls to ignore the 17,410,742 majority who voted to leave the EU on the 23rd of June 2016. It is such that I believe his immediate resignation must be tabled.",
        "background": "London MP David Lammy has called upon Parliament to ignore the will of the British people regarding the Referendum on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union, this is completely unacceptable and in contempt of our democracy.",
