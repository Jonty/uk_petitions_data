The outcome was clear, and we are determined to deliver on the decision and to make a success of the UK\u2019s departure from the EU.\r\n\r\nAs the Prime Minister has stated, there can be no attempts to remain inside the EU, no attempts to rejoin it through the back door, and no second referendum.\r\n\r\nWe are preparing for a smooth and orderly exit from the EU and we will trigger the legal process which starts this by the end of March 2017.  By working with our European neighbours, we are confident we will be able to deliver a deal that works in the mutual interests of both the UK and the rest of the European Union.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Exiting the European Union",
