        "additional_details": "The PCS union have presented evidence to MPs that show that sanction rates are monitored at the level of the adviser, the team, the office and the district, and that some individual managers take action with their staff if sanction rates are \u201ctoo low\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe sanctions regime now also affects an increasing number of Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) claimants \u2013 who are too ill or disabled to work currently, but whom the DWP consider will be capable of work at some time in the future.",
        "background": "Sanctions and Work Capability Assessments are unfair, disproportionate and cruel. They are leading to the deaths of our citizens, causing suicides, mental health issues and increasing the involvement of the police, hospitals and social services. WCAs regularly overrule medical professionals advice.",
