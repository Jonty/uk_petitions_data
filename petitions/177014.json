        "additional_details": "They could be products which:\r\n\r\n- in their production cause no harm to the environments they are produced in, \r\n- no harm is caused to any animals which are part of the products production, \r\n- all parties who help create the product are paid a fair and decent amount in return for their work.\r\n\r\nExamples of products like these would be free-range eggs or FairTrade products.\r\nWith this, the general public will be more inclined to buy these, as they will be more affordable.",
        "background": "We the undersigned are demanding that the government promise that once we have left the EU and have control over a V.A.T, products which can be considered \"ethical\" shall have a V.A.T cut in order to make them more affordable for people and families in the U.K.",
