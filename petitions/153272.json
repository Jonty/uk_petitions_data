        "additional_details": "The EU referendum produced a 52% / 48% vote in favour of leaving the EU. This referendum has caused passionate debate and disagreement across the UK; within families, amongst colleagues, and across generations. \r\n\r\nVoters on either side agree that the campaigns did not clearly present the facts, and overstated their positions. The facts will not be clear until our new relationship with the EU has been agreed.  \r\n\r\nThe British public deserve the facts. \r\n\r\nThe British public deserve another vote. ",
        "background": "Following the UK's vote to leave the EU on 23rd July 2016 a subsequent new relationship between the EU & UK shall be negotiated under Article 50. The British public deserve the right to decide whether this deal is right for them and the United Kingdom. ",
