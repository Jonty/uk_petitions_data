The use of palm oil shoud be regulated to curb its use and clear proactive labelling on the front of products to encourage and facilitate palm oil free shopping as well as to encourage manufactures to make alternatives available. ",
        "background": "Manufactures using palm oil in everyday products is contributing to deforestation. It is an abuse of power & influence, as many consumers lack information, opportunity and means to make a palm oil free choice. For others not choosing palm oil is unreasonably difficult and time consuming.",
