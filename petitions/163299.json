        "additional_details": "Over the last two years I have gone through great troubles to arrange contact with my son Lucas. Since going through this I have noticed that there are several people going through the same... Alienation, unfair judgement in court, expensive solicitors. The CMS has sonics  legal power to peruse the money but don't do the same for contact. Making it easier to seperate a non living parent from their child with no obligation to maintain a healthy relationship between them. This must be stopped .",
        "background": "For the CMS to enforce that mediation must be attended by both parents in exchange for their  services. Both contact and maintenance are discussed and put to the courts. Solicitors and mediatiors can attend. Saving so much trouble and heart ache. ",
