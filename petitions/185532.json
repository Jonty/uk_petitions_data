        "additional_details": "The Scottish Government stated the 2014 Referendum was a \"Once in a Generation\" vote; their own White Paper stated a UK-wide EU referendum was a possibility if Scots voted \"No\". Despite a policy pledge to pursue another referendum if the UK voted to leave the EU and Scotland voted to remain, the SNP did not win an overall majority in the May Holyrood Elections.  The Green Party made no similar policy stipulation. Therefore, it is contended no mandate exists for the terms and timings of IndyRef2.",
        "background": "Should the Scottish Parliament vote to hold another Independence Referendum, the UK Government should honour it, but control the terms and timings of IndyRef2. Specifically, it should take place well after Brexit, rather than before or during, so voters can first assess its effects to Scotland.",
