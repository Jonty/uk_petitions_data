        "action": "Rearrange the school year so that it reflects our non secular 21st century world",
        "additional_details": "A reorganisation should be made to better support family life and the educational needs of children.  Children thrive on routine and removing education for extended times is unhealthy for them and family life.  Parents get limited holiday in most jobs and a lot of children are left in childcare for extended periods during the holidays whilst parents juggle childcare and work.  The cost of this childcare financially cripples families and is disruptive to learning over long periods.",
        "background": "Our school term organisation and holidays have been set up to meet the needs of Victorian England and a secular society.  We live in a modern non secular community where in most families both parents work.  School provides a means of allowing parents to work and gives stability to children.",
