        "additional_details": "The UK government has no current plans to improve continuity of care for students studying away form home.\r\n\r\nStudents under the care of mental health teams still face months of waiting lists. By this time students are often back home. Due to their time throughout the year being split between two locations, often students can go their entire student life without much needed mental health care.\r\nStudent suicide rates rose by 50% between 2007-11(Office for National Statistics). More needs to be done.",
        "background": "One in four of us experience mental health issues in the UK each year.\r\nWith 2,266,075 students attending university in the 2014/15 academic year (Higher Education Statistics Agency), we at Hope At Hand are urging the government to not only talk about mental health, but for action to be taken.",
