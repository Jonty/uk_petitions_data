        "additional_details": "The first ever Lavazza shop opened in Turin, in 1895, all thanks to Luigi Lavazza. He was passionate about his work, which led him to discover all sorts of origins and different characteristics of the coffee plant. \r\nHe studied religiously the art of blending to provide the very best coffee which we all know and love.\r\nWe want it back. We want the wonderful, generous and kind staff back. We want our spot, that place we used to go to where we could relax and reflect. Please join me in this!",
        "background": "The store came to Southgate place back in 2014 and took off well from the beginning. It became a popular hub for people of all ages where they could experience the quality of Italy's best-known coffee in a stylish and comfortable environment. On January the 7th, the store was closed, suddenly. ",
