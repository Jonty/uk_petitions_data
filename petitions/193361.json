        "additional_details": "Follow an accident my leg was badly broken. The doctors were able to save my leg but I now have a frame holding it together.  I was rejected for a blue badge as i was told I could walk 100 meters on crutches. I had to appeal explaining that the frame was no guarantee I would recover and without it I would not be able to walk at all plus it's very painful. While in this condition I need access to disabled parking so I can open the car door fully when getting in and out.",

Currently anyone anyone with \"temporary\" conditions like this do not qualify.  A short term badge should be introduced. ",
