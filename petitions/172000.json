The ballot paper needs to give a credible alternative.The electorate needs a way to encourage postive campaigning and ultimately reject a set of bad candidates.I believe by giving everyone the option of quanitfiably registering their frustration with candidates/campaigns we can force politicians away from devisive language and personal attacks & increase turn out.
