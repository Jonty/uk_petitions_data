        "action": "UK government to ban any and all Halal product's from the United Kingdom.",
        "additional_details": "British citizens are against cruelty to animals. Current law requires animals to be stunned before slaughter - rendering them insensible to pain until death supervenes. Compared to Halal, The animal must be alive at the time of slaughter.\r\nNo electric shock, bullet or any other means should be used before slaughtering. Using any such method may lead to the death of the animal before it is cut. Islam prohibits Muslims from eating any meat coming from an animal that is dead before slaughter.",
        "background": "If You Buy Halal,  You Are Indirectly Financing Terrorism Via Zakat. One of the purposes of the Zakat tax is to support those struggles in the Cause of Allah. The Noble Qur\u2019an states that Allah\u2019s Cause entails supporting Mujahideen or those who are fighting in the battles and wars of Allah.",
