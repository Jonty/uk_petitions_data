        "additional_details": "More than one in five children at some primary schools in England start their first and final years of primary school underweight, figures show.\r\n\r\nAllowing school meals to be paid for with childcare vouchers would ease family costs and increase take-up rate.\r\n\r\nHence, we hereby petition the Government to make it possible to pay for School Dinners via the Child Care Vouchers scheme.",
        "background": "For a family with 2 children, school dinners cost in the region of \u00a3900 per year. With family costs rising rapidly and well ahead of wages, this is becoming increasingly unaffordable for many parents.",
