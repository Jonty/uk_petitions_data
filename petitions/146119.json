        "additional_details": "It has been impressed upon the citizens of this nation that the recent EU referendum is a permanent, once-in-a-generation decision with no going back. \r\nIn light of this, we the undersigned, believe that parliament should uphold its democratic principles and not allow the few who are dissatisfied to trample over the rights of the 17 million plus voters who decided to leave. Thus parliament will hold no further referendums on EU membership until we are fully divorced from the EU.",
