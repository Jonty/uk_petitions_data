        "additional_details": "Digital pens naturally handle text, checkboxes, sketches, unstructured notes and client signatures, making them ideal for surveys, audits, maintenance and repair records, sales visits, research questionnaires and dispatch notes.\r\nSwitching to digital pen to gather and send information leaves your field staff to do what they do best \u2013 more effectively and much quicker.\r\nThe end result? Greater productivity, better results and happy customers. You can\u2019t put a price on that.",
