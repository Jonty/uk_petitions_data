Also a child I held at aged 6 months dies of hyperthermia this saddens me to know that murderers in this country are bein treated better than thease poor children. They have a very inspiring community spirit one which you would not find in the uk. Thease people are without light. Heat. And proper sanitation. There are newborns being born and living without sterile bottles ect. This is no place fit for an animal never mind children. Please help",
        "background": "I have currently been making monthly visits to the camps with an organisation. And I must say they are living in terrible condition there are a lot more children that are getting seriously ill with the poor cold weather. They are not dangerous in any way and just want a safe warm ace to live. ",
