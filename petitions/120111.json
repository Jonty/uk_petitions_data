        "additional_details": "When I see tender documents running into several hundred pages I seriously doubt a drive from government to widen up the supply chain to SMEs as the resources are simply not available.\r\n\r\nAdd to this the increasing burden of health & safety legislation, compulsory employment surveys, automatic enrolment pensions, four annual tax returns etc etc and we are drowning in a sea of petty admin, struggling to focus on running our business.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "I own a small business and am encouraged to hear government talk of making things easier for small & medium-sized businesses (SMEs) to supply government yet find no evidence this is happening.  \r\n\r\n",
