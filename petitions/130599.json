        "additional_details": "I am asking that the government discuss creating measures to ensure that all tenancy deposits are protected in a government backed scheme by private landlords. I submit that landlords should face a penalty for failing to protect tenancy deposits immediately after 30 days and not solely if a tenant takes their landlord to court usually half way through or at the end of a tenancy agreement. ",
        "background": "Though the Housing Act 2004, Section 213 lays out what is expected of  private landlords and the requirements relating to tenancy deposits; a significant amount of private landlords fail to protect deposits put down by their tenants and escape the penalty for failing to do so.
