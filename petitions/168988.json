        "background": "The EU Referendum result of June 2016 mandated that Britain leave the European Union.\r\n\r\nHowever, there exists no mandate whatsoever for any particular terms of Brexit. Quite the contrary; it is now generally recognised that the Leave campaign omitted all detail of what Brexit should look like.",
