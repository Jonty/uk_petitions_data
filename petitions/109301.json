        "action": "Allow children who go to nursery to have priority admission to attached school",
        "additional_details": "Many parents feel they are no longer in control of their children's education. I myself feel very affected by this as my daughter is at a nursery and because I don't live in that area I may have to send her to a school away from the friends she will have made and to a school I don't feel is going to be the best road for my daughter to get the best education in my opinion.\r\n",
        "background": "I think it's really important for parents to have some authority when choosing education for their children. All parents have different views and opinions on where they want their children to go to school, and this would make it ideal for children to have priority when going to an attached nursery.",
