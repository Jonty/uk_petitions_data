        "additional_details": "See our website http://www.savegoringgap.org.uk/.  The Railway Action Group support rail electrification but want Network Rail to take regard for the Goring Gap AONBs and to properly consult and re-design. It is currently failing in its statutory duties, especially those under Section 85 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000: \"...in relation to...land in an area of outstanding natural beauty, a relevant authority shall have regard to the purpose of conserving and enhancing the natural beauty...\".",
        "background": "Network Rail is installing large, inappropriately prominent metal masts and gantries throughout the Goring Gap as part of its electrification programme.  We ask that they devise & install a less intrusive, more sensitive design better suited to two special AONBs - as their statutory duties require.",
