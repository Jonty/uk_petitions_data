        "background": "The executive order suspends more than half a dozen measures to reduce climate change and boosts fossil fuel production, rolling back vital Obama-era rules aimed at curbing climate change. \r\n\r\nIf the executive order is successfully instated, the rate of climate change could increase rapidly.\r\n",
