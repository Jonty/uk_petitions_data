        "action": "Cease referring to any religion as \"a religion of peace\"",
        "additional_details": "Politicians it seems, routinely try and persuade an angry public that certain religions are peaceful. Almost as if they are trying to convince us that there is no threat. There is no evidence to prove that these subject religions are peaceful, on the contrary there is plenty of evidence that they are not. We the undersigned petition members of the Government and other public servants to cease making these unfounded claims publicly.",
        "background": "It is not uncommon after terrorist atrocities for politicians to declare the religion who's followers committed the atrocity \"a religion of peace\" or words to that effect. These claims are unfounded and can most certainly not be proven. These statements are bound to cause distress to those affected.",
