        "action": "Prevent a constitutional crisis & break-up of the UK through a 2nd EU Referendum",
        "additional_details": "This petition is to strengthen the one started by William Oliver Healey and call for a 2nd EU referendum. If you have signed that one, please sign this one. There is too much at stake for this to be decided by only the narrowest of majorities. Much of the leave campaign is being revealed to have been lies, even by the leaders themselves (e.g. the weekly \u00a3350M figure). The future of the UK as we know it is at stake. This petition is also a call for a stronger political leadership in the UK.",
        "background": "The EU referendum was always about more than just the EU, and it is now clear that there is a high chance that the no vote may lead to Scotland and NI breaking away, leaving a much diminished England by itself. If this is to end this way, the mandate to do so must be much stronger than just 52-48. ",
