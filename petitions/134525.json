        "action": "Allow children to vote after passing quiz which proves understanding of politics",
        "additional_details": "Children will have to live with the ramifications of political decisions longer than any of the voting population. Some, not all, children are very passionate about current issues and have relevant ideas and perspectives to share. We believe it would be irresponsible to allow all children the vote, as many have little to no understanding or appreciation of politics. However, we argue that age is not a fair classification in determining one's right to create change.",
        "background": "We believe that children should have the right to vote if they can demonstrate their understanding and interest in politics by passing a quiz. We think it is unfair that citizens are given the right to vote solely based on their age, when some children have a better understanding than some adults.",
