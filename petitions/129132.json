        "additional_details": "I believe this issue should be debated & the man should be stripped of his knighthood. \r\n\r\nHe wrote a well publicised letter describing the alleged behaviour of Liverpool fans that again blamed them for the disaster. \r\n\r\nFollowing recent inquest decision he has not made any apology for his remarks displaying a complete lack of respect for e bereaved & city of Liverpool. \r\n\r\nHe does not display or command the respect of such s high honour that had been bestowed on him ",
        "background": "Since 1989 this man has displayed little if any empathy towards the bereaved & their families following this horrible disaster. \r\nHe encouraged the lie that Liverpoool fans were to blame for the inaction of South Yorkshire Police & other authorities. \r\n",
