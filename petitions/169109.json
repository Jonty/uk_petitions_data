        "additional_details": "One might argue that smoking is okay as it is still considered outside. However on the street people have the option to cross the road or move away whereas, at a station platform passengers do not have this option and instead must inhale second-hand smoke. \r\n\r\nLondon Overground stations prohibited smoking on surface platforms. Merseyrail is clearly behind modern times. If London has adopted this policy then why hasn't Merseyrail?\r\n\r\nIt is of this author's opinion that the Health Act 2006 should be amended so that smoking should be banned on any train platforms in England.\r\n",
        "background": "\"Smoking is permitted on our surface stations\" - Merseyrail.org\r\n\r\nMerseyrail allow smoking on their surface (i.e. outside) platforms. This is a disgrace! Platforms can become very congested with people and thus causing others to inhale second-hand smoke, including children and pregnant women. ",
