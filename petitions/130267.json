        "additional_details": "Dogs have been savaged within dog walkers vehicles, poor restraints result in injury, dogs have been lost and have been injured and killed on walks through irresponsible behaviour of the professional walker. Heat exhaustion from travelling in vehicles too long and being left unattended whilst collecting and dropping off. Smoking in vehicles, allowing multiple dogs to roam without management, creating an unsafe enviroment for other walkers and their dogs.",
        "background": "Commercial dog walkers should have standards of care and competence. The vehicles should be fully equipped to carry dogs safely, education surrounding management of multiple dogs, in the vehicle and on the walk, should be examined and a license to carry out business required to satisfy these areas.",
