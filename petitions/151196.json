        "action": "PM to write now to the EU under Art. 50 Lisbon Treaty, to start withdrawal talks",
        "additional_details": "It is also essential that the government now takes immediate steps, together with leading advocates of Britain leaving the E.U., to prepare for our exit from the E.U., pending the appointment of a new Prime Minister. Our current partners in the E.U. and the European Commission itself also seek an early conclusion to separation negotiations. Stock market and currency turbulence would settle down, once it is known that Article 50 has been triggered.",
        "background": "The British public have voted to leave the E.U. To avoid prolonging the period of uncertainty, it is in our interest that negotiations to finalise our separation from the E.U. be completed as soon as practicable. It is therefore essential that we trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty immediately. ",
