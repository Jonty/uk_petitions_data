        "additional_details": "The only overriding factor shall be public votes. No representation or \"seats\" to represent groups of people. 1 Person = 1 Vote. \r\n \r\nThe public can vote 'Yes' - OR - 'No' to any subject and can vote in any manner E.g. Online, Phone, TXT and Postal. There will be a minimum number of votes required.  \r\n \r\nEXAMPLE: \r\n\"The government wishes to end \"tax credits\" Do you want to end Tax Credits?\"- \r\n1.6million people voted AGAINST this - 440,000 voted FOR this. - This oucome means that tax credits remain.",
        "background": "The Public can over-rule ANY policy/law/person based on votes for and against each and every decision proposed by government. \r\n\r\nThis system is much like the current Petition system, except instead of voting for a debate on a subject, the will of the people is simply carried out without debate.",
