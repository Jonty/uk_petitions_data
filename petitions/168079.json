It's diagnosed in pregnancy and is where a mass forms in the brain putting strain on the heart to provide this mass with more blood. So many children die because either because it's too late to treat them or because of complications. \r\nThis needs to stop! \r\nI nearly lost my little boy and I won't sit and watch it happen to any other parent. \r\nMoney needs to be invested in helping doctors diagnose and treat children before it's too late. ",
