        "action": "Improve safety legislation for coaches so no more children get injured",
        "additional_details": "Improved legislation is needed.\r\nIf safety legislation is passed this should apply to all coaches, not just ones manufactured from that date.\r\nOperators should not be able to hide the age of their coaches behind private plates and there should be a far better system of visibility and transparency over the age of the coach, the level of safety equipment it has and the licence history of the operator. Otherwise you really have no idea what kind of coach your child is getting on or how safe it is! ",
        "background": "Two years ago our son almost died when he fell out of a faulty door on a coach at 60 mph.  It has highlighted to us that safety legislation is only applied to newer coaches and operators can hide the age of coaches behind private plates. This is a dangerous combination that needs to change.",
