        "action": "Stop the removal of NHS bursaries for student radiographers and nurses",
        "additional_details": "The NHS bursary supports the student to undertake clinical placements as part of their training. These can be up to 16 weeks in duration and in rural areas the distance between the campus and hospital is uncommutable, requiring the student to pay rent on their main accommodation plus rent, living and travel expenses in their clinical setting. This is financially disadvantageous to students in rural areas like Cumbria, Devon and Northumberland and will have a negative impact on the profession.",
        "background": "An NHS bursary is currently available for students studying Radiography and Nursing. This is essential financial support as these courses involve both clinical and academic components. The Government is proposing to remove these bursaries and replace them with student loans.  ",
