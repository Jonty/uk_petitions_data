        "additional_details": "Following the close referendum result the consequences of the outcome have been more clearly understood by the electorate, deep divisions are evident in many areas. This proposal is designed to rebuild unity by making Parliament only accept the proposed 'informal' negotiated terms if so mandated by the electorate. As the voting intentions of each candidate are shown on the ballot paper, the result will either finally confirm the 'exit' referendum result or supersede it.",

This proposal allows the electorate to accept or reject the outcome of 'informal' negotiations with the EU through Parliamentary Democracy.
