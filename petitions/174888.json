This report should not go ahead and all Brexit information should be kept top secret. Away from people that quite frankly don't deserve to be called British. If we end up with a compromise we will be no better off then leaving and no better off then staying. That's why we want a general election if we can't get a full withdrawal.",
        "background": "The people that voted to Leave the EU in the referendum are starting to feel that there concerns are not being taken seriously enough. They were told by both sides exactly what leaving the EU means. They want out and want a full withdrawal. Pro EU voters shouldn't scupper our vote in any way.",
