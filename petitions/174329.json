Certainly the less educated are unlikely to take the process on (yet again, proving that those less informed are taken advantage of)\r\nThe requests for information (which they already have), and practice of making \u201coffers of compensation\u201d  lacks any integrity,  and I am astounded that such practise is allowed and has been going on for so long without intervention.\r\n",
        "background": "The process of claiming PPI is disingenuous and immoral.  The lenders and insurance companies know very well who they have sold PPI to - and have (with the governments backing) created a process that puts the onus on the claimant rather than those responsible in order to avoid payment.
