        "additional_details": "The Fixed-term Parliaments Act requires a general election to be held every five years. However, if a motion for a general election is agreed by two thirds of the Commons then a general election can be held before the end of the five years. \r\n\r\nThe public debate surrounding the EU referendum highlighted the problems of laws being passed by unelected individuals, accordingly, the UK should be led by an elected Prime Minister. As it stands, this can now only be achieved via a general election. ",
        "background": "In June 2016 the UK voted for independence from the EU. A large portion of both remain and leave voters believe that the EU's governance by unelected commissioners is undemocratic and flawed. This petition asks for a general election to be held to ensure that the UK is governed by an elected PM. ",
