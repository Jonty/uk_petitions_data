        "additional_details": "I understand that a fee will have to be charged as alot of work goes in to setting up the case but an initial one off fee will be better to help cover the costs.Alot of parents cant work together for a range of reasons including domestic violence,why should our children pay the price of them not being able to work together,they lose out receiving less funds towards their upbringing and quality of life.A one off larger fee should be done to start a new case and carry on maintaining existing ones\r\n",
        "background": "I feel parents are penalised if they cant work together they shouldn't have to pay continual fees in order to have help in receiving the financial assistance for their child. An initial larger one off payment would be better.When deducting fees monthly the kids are losing out long term its not fair.",
