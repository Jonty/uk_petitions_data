        "additional_details": "If we were to leave based on this referendum, we could be leaving based on votes that were made out of uneducated opinions and no proper understanding of what this means for the future of the UK. Given that the outcome of the referendum was close with 51.9% in favour of leave, the final decision should go to parliament, and I urge MPs to vote AGAINST the result in this case.\r\n\r\nThis vote was not legally binding - http://uk.businessinsider.com/green-eu-referendum-not-legally-binding-brexit-2016-6\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "MPs are elected by the general population to make decisions on our behalf. I believe they have more knowledge on what the outcome of this referendum means for the UK and therefore should make the overall decision.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of MPs were in favour of remaining in the EU.",
