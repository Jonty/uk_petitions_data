        "action": "Authorize London to secede from the UK and become self-governing and autonomous.",
        "additional_details": "Similar arrangements have taken place elsewhere in Europe and worldwide, such as Monaco, Andorra, Hong Kong. London is the financial heart of Europe and its jobs, security, wealth and investments should not be controlled or decided upon by other regions of England who have chosen to abandon the EU and the European Project. Alongside Scotland, London and other major affluent and urbanized areas in the UK whose population voted REMAIN by majority should be permitted to stay within the EU.",
        "background": "Given the referendum vote and the overwhelming REMAIN vote across London, it is clear that the city does not share the same vision or ambition as the rest of England and Wales. In order to ensure London continues to thrive, it should be allowed to give legitimacy to the will of its residents.",
