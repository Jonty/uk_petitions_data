        "additional_details": "Speaker Bercow has indicated that he is disinclined to permit President Trump to address both Houses in Westminster Hall because of his temporary moratorium on refugees. \r\n\r\nHowever; such an address would not be about the man. Instead it would be a celebration of the Transatlantic Alliance at this critical time in British history.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, declining an address could unneccessarily jeopardise an  opportunity to get the best possible deal with the US in subsequent trade and diplomatic talks.",
        "background": "The US/UK relationship has never been more important.\r\n\r\nPresident Trump is an Anglophile, represents our most important alliance & has stated that we will be at \"the front of the line\" for trade deals.\r\n\r\nWe should celebrate this relationship via an address to both Houses  during his state visit.",
