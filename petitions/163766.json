        "additional_details": "I have video and photographic evidence of the fouling which has been left to rot for weeks/months where the garden is unfit for human use as confirmed by the local dog warden. The council had no housing officer covering the area so no one dealt with the complaint. Police could not act however if they could then this situation would not have got out of hand. And we wouldn't have to wait for the council. ",
        "background": "I live in a council property where the garden is shared. Another tennant leaves his dogs to defeacate in the garden without clearing it up. The council haven't acted in 4 months and police say can't enforce as land is not covered under the dogs (fouling on land) as its private or council property.",
