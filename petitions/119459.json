        "additional_details": "Wolverhampton Wanderers will have only had 2 home 3:00pm games on a Saturday from 28th Nov to 2nd April mainly due to Sky TV moving things around. Families and friends don't meet like they used too. People miss games they have paid for, people buy train tickets in advance for away games that they now can't attend and can't get refunds.  We are not the only ones Leeds, Forest, Derby and a few others all suffer too. Sky don't care.\r\n\r\nIt is unfair, disproportionate and fans have had enough.",
        "background": "Up and down the country normal everyday hardworking football supporters are suffering as a result of Sky TV constantly moving games from Saturday 3:00pm kick offs. Wolves and Leeds have had this done 13 times this season. Families don't meet anymore, people are out of pocket. We want a limit of Five",
