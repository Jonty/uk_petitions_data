        "additional_details": "2014 scottish independance from the UK referendum & 2016 UK membership of the EU referendum. These are two examples where calls for a 2nd referendum should be cancelled out by law, the decision has been made and should be respected.  ",
        "background": "To protect the democratic purpose of a refurendum a 2nd should not be held just because people disagree with the outcome. Having the law would mean people are fully aware of the consequences of voting in the first place. Its unfair for people to cast a vote then have to worry it could be overturned",
