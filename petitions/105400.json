        "additional_details": "The current Licencing regulations for 16 year olds are ridiculous, dangrous and outdated, its time to change them. And the best way to do that is to change the CBT system and reducing the A1 test age to 16. It is incredibly dangerous to be restricted to 30 in a 60mph limit. so we should introduce a CBT theory test, Hazard perception test and give 16 year olds the option of taking the A1 test so they can ride a 125cc motorcycle if they frequently use main roads. less danger! less accidents. ",
        "background": "Improve the current CBT system by introducing the theory test and hazard perception test and move the minimum age for the A1 test to 16 so 16 year olds may ride a 125cc motorcycle if they pass the A1 test. this would mean less accidents involving young riders due to them being able to do NSL",
