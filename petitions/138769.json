        "additional_details": "16 and 17 year old people have demonstrated that they have the maturity to make informed decisions. The precedent has been established in the Scottish referendum.\r\nIt is clear that there are significant age-related demographic differences in opinion between the young and old of this country, and as this affects the young much more than the old, they should be entitled to have an opinion about the UK place in their future world",
        "background": "Because of the long term and cross-generational impact of the Brexit decision, young people today will spend up to 40 years of their lives influenced by this. 16 and 17 year will be in their 50's before they have a chance to review this decision.\r\n ",
