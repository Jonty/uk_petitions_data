        "additional_details": "There are so many gay/bisexual men who would love to give blood however they are unable to. Both gay/bisexual and heterosexual members of the public should be treated the same. If the NHS are worried about potential risks in blood then there should be a pre screening process for everyone regardless of sexuality. Gay/bisexual men are being discriminated against and the notion that it's only men who have sex with men who can't give blood is homophobic and outdated. ",
