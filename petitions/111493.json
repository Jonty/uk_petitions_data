This cannot be allowed to continue, as it is backwards and prevents improvement and change to be properly debated.",
        "background": "The technique known as \"filibustering\" has been used historically in the House of Commons to block bills by talking for an extraordinary length of time, sometimes over an hour and a half, which means that the House cannot vote on the bill.",
