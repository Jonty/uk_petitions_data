        "additional_details": "Statistics taken from the World Health Organisation website.\r\nAllowing 16 and 17 year olds onto the roads with a fraction of the knowledge they require to be safe is contributing to the loss of life and terrible injuries sustained.  Introduction within the curriculum of driving experience based simulation and attitudinal work would, without doubt, save lives. A vast majority of those students will drive or ride on the roads.  ",
        "background": "In 2014 1700 died on the roads of the UK.  In the same period 300 drowned.  Such loss is horrific and devastating to all those involved.  We address water danger by teaching swimming in schools yet there is nothing formalised in relation to road user education.  Help us change this and save lives.",
