        "additional_details": "I believe that this part of the criteria should be removed from the NHS check list for IVF. I can understand the rule if both of you already have a biological child.\r\n\r\nThe government are neglecting someone from having their own biological child. Not everyone can afford \u00a35000 for private IVF. Give people with no biological child a chance!!\r\n",
        "background": "For 4 years me and my husband have been trying for our own baby together. Struggling with PCOS which is a hormone imbalance that can stop you from ovulating. I\u2019ve been told that because my husband already has a child from a previous relationship we are not entitled to NHS funding for IVF",
