        "additional_details": "It is important that the full scale of any manipulation is known, so that trust in democracy in the UK is restored and any necessary precautions can be developed.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that in the US/German cases, promoting a fear of immigrants has been a major tactic.\r\n\r\nGerman BfV statement: (16 Nov 2016; Reuters) http://reut.rs/2gZS17j\r\n\r\nUS CIA/FBI statement: (16 Dec 2016; Washington Post) http://wapo.st/2h9yKg0\r\n\r\nEU referendum: (14 Dec 2016; The Independent) http://ind.pn/2i2Jeh5\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The CIA in the US and the BfV in Germany have both spoken of Russian attempts to manipulate elections. \r\nIt is naive to think that the UK would somehow be exempt from or immune to such assaults. There are rumours that the EU referendum was similarly targeted, and future elections remain vulnerable.",
