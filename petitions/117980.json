        "additional_details": "Commonhold successfully exists in many countries of the world. This petition calls on the Government to actively promote Commonhold and ensure that all new properties built which would normally be sold as leasehold are sold as commonhold to take effect by 2020 and to help sort out the problems associated with leasehold tenure. The Commonhold and Leasehold Act was introduced with good intentions but vested interests seem to have been allowed to let it wither before it could do its job. ",
        "background": "Commonhold was introduced in the 2002 Commonhold Act and was supposed to alleviate problems associated with leasehold properties. Complete lack of government support means only about 15 commonholds have been registered. Even the relevant minister is from the Justice rather than the Housing Dept\r\n",
