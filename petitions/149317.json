GPS were of no help and we were dismissed each time. It took my health visitor to tell the gp there was something wrong for them to tell her to tell me to go to A+E the next day she was diagnosed with T-ALL and the swelling in her face was due to a tumour in her chest pressing on her airways she couldn't breathe properly + needed oxygen",
