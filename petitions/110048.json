        "additional_details": "S.55 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015 requires the Lord Chancellor to carry out a review of the operation of the criminal courts charge 3 years after it came into force so that no review will occur until 13 April 2018. Amending s.55 will permit the Lord Chancellor to carry out that review now, avoiding the problems identified in the attached blog (https://www.kingsleynapley.co.uk/news-and-events/blogs/criminal-law-blog/a-compassionate-magistrate-and-a-lamentable-government).",
        "background": "An immediate review is needed of the law requiring a criminal courts charge to be imposed on offenders irrespective of means to pay. Lack of confidence in the legislation is widespread and is leading to judicial resignations. The review must fully involve the public, practitioners and judiciary.",
