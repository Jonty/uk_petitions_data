        "additional_details": "A maximum cap should be introduced on prices of ferry crossings. The monopoly of the two large companies that provide crossings needs to be regulated. Islanders are stuck having to pay extortionate fees. ",
        "background": "Currently there is no regulation on the fares charged by the ferry companies. They charge astronomical fees that they hike up as and when they choose. \r\nThis is causing a lack of tourism and is unfair to residents who have to travel regularly and have no choice. Make this a public interest service. ",
