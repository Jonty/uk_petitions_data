        "additional_details": "Charging money based on lies is called fraud and is illegal. Something with no evidence which can not be proved false should be treated the same as something that is not true.\r\nThe general nature of such a law would mean that all future supernatural claims of any type would also require evidence. This is similar to the general legal high and tax avoidance approaches.\r\nTo argue against such a law is to argue for the ability for the general public to be deceived by claims with no basis in evidence. ",
        "background": "We rightly require evidence for people to claim health benefits on products. This standard isn't applied to other products and organisations outside health.\r\nProducts or organisations which solicit payment or donations based on supernatural claims should be required to present supporting evidence.",
