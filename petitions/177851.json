        "additional_details": "I live in Milton Keynes, in an area called two mile ash where aluminium is used, I am fairly far away from the cabinet I\u2019m connected to which causes me to get a max connection of 10.5Mbps download and 1Mbps upload. Houses further than me experience a worse drop off rate however an area near me called Emerson valley, where they've used copper can reach speeds of 54Mbps download and 13Mbps upload copper makes a big difference and should be the standard for a modern faster England.",
        "background": "I have an old aluminium line that goes a fair distance which causes a lot of drop off in the connection, as aluminium is a worse conductor in comparison to copper. Households across England get offered broadband packages that connection lines cannot deliver due to old forgotten aluminium cables.",
