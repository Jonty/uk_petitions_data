        "action": "Demand easy re-registration of British-registered vehicles in other EU countries",
        "additional_details": "A core principle of the EU is freedom of movement of citizens and labour. Migrating citizens' vehicles should be easy to re-register in EU states if the registrant presents an EC Type Approval Number as printed on the UK V5C. This number proves EU-wide road conformity for the vehicle.\r\n\r\nThis is supported by  EC directive 2007/C68/04 which states that a vehicle already registered in a member state should not be tested again on the same criteria at re-registration or have to undergo further tests.",
        "background": "British citizens re-registering their vehicles abroad (in the EU) are experienced serious and costly administrative obstruction, or being refused. Vehicles presented in EU states with accompanying V5C that states the vehicle's EC Type Approval Number should be allowed easy and low-cost registration.",
