        "action": "Make it a criminal offence for a business or service provider to ban guide dogs.",
        "additional_details": "Currently, unlike for taxis and private hire cars, the law doesn't specifically say guide and assistance dogs must be admitted. This is wrong and leads to confusion. Moreover, other than for taxis. Matters are dealt with personally by the victim, at their cost via the county court. This is not the case for other types of discrimination. We call for a prosecuting authority to take the cases on, on behalf of the Crown. ",
        "background": "It is a criminal offence for taxis or private hire drivers to refuse to carry guide or assistance dogs, unless they hold an exemption. This petition calls for parity so the same applies to businesses and service providers. We also call for police to be the prosecuting authority via magistrates court",
