        "additional_details": "According to the Office for National Statistics, \"Nearly three-quarters (73%) of female victims of rape offences and over three-quarters (78%) of female victims of other sexual offences recorded by the police were aged under 30. Male victims of rape and other sexual offences were even more likely to be aged under 30 (88% and 84% respectively),\" in the year ending March 2015. It is crucial that young people know what consent is, how to give/receive consent and tear sex without consent is rape",

Yet it is vital that young people are informed about practicing safe sex, what consent is and its importance and sexual orientations in order to prevent unwanted pregnancies, STDs, rape & confusion about sexual identity",
