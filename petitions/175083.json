        "additional_details": "Suicide rates and the likelihood of depression & multifarious mental illnesses in people who have undergone conversion therapy is astonishingly high. People most vulnerable are minors - young people. Conversion therapy and identity destruction demolishes these people; nobody should ever sustain emotional and mental torture and that is indisputable. This therapy is abusive and malicious; healthy human beings should never have to experience this agony.",
        "background": "Reparative treatment remains legal, despite being psychologically damaging and unethical. Nobody should endure mental and emotional pain believing that their sexual orientations and nonconforming gender identities are just curable illnesses.",
