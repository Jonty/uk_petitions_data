        "additional_details": "Food poverty is the inability to have an adequate and nutritious diet, often due to a lack of money. In the UK, someone is considered to be living in poverty if their household income is less than 60% of the median UK household income annually.\r\n\r\nCharities depend greatly on public donations to offer food and support services for those in need. Businesses donating their food waste to charities would increase the support they receive to help people overcome poverty.",
        "background": "In the UK, around 13 out of 65 million people are living in poverty; about 20% of the population. With an increasing number of people falling into poverty, charities (foodbanks) require more donations to support and meet the needs of the people.",
