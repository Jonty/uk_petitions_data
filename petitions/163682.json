        "additional_details": "I purchased a new build on help-to-buy from a reputable builder who benefitted (\u00a3600 million in bonuses alone) by miss-selling their houses. The floor space of the house is 6.5% less than advertised. The losses are significant based on the correlation of area to price.The NHBC guarantee provided for new homes must protect interests of the home buyer from the builders. This is a failing system. The advertised floor area and design must be proven before the sale with the right to cancellation.",
        "background": "The rights of the home buyer must be protected with more stringent regulations.  Consumer rights for home buyers must be implemented and enforced. Legislation must force builders to resolve items (floor area, design etc) prior to sale. stronger regulation must be enforced for after sale responses.  ",
