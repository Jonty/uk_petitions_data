        "additional_details": "A politicians promised policies should be treated as a verbal contract.The law says verbal agreements and oral contracts are generally valid and legally binding as long as they are reasonable, equitable, conscionable and made in good faith.\r\nIf a politician makes a promise then it should be treated as a verbal agreement. \r\nReasonable exceptions such as a banking crisis should be allowed but only within set guidelines.\r\nMy aim is to stop politicians knowingly telling lies in order to gain power.",
        "background": "During election campaigns the electorate is routinely lied to by politicians for the sole purpose of winning an election. People listen to a candidates pitch which promises certain policies. They then vote for that person based upon those promised policies. Once elected promises are often broken.",
