        "additional_details": "\r\nHealth and Social Care does not only focus on our elderly, we need to protect individuals with disabilities too. At present there are no definite ratios given by the CQC in regulation 18 (staffing, 2016). Many of us are administering life saving medication without three years of university training and are carrying out tasks to fulfil individuals needs. A \"National Living Wage\" of \u00a37.50 per hour does not support us in our own daily lives. ",
        "background": "After undertaking some evidence based research that clearly suggests that our social care system in the UK is at a major risk of collapse, I am asking that our government please give social care extra funding and an urgent agenda. ",
