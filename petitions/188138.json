There is no other place to park in the area, so it would require him find a space elsewhere (20 mins away) and walk back home. Not good for a man of great age!! \r\n\r\nWe got in touch with our local council and they said parking permits cost \u00a350-70 per year? But why? Where does the money go? Yet again, proving that the government gives to the rich and takes from the poor. An utter disgrace. ",
