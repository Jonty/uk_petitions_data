        "additional_details": "People would rather earn a decent wage than feel like they have to be supported on benefits by the government.\r\n\r\nReducing business taxes in this way would encourage more business to set up and invest in their companies. Also would encourage more businesses to set up in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe government spends an estimated \u00a330 billion a year on Tax Credit. Don't give handouts to people give them a decent wage and some pride in themselves.",
        "background": "Increase the National Minimum Wage to a fair and decent level so those at the lower end of the employment ladder don't just have to survive or fight tooth and nail to get by. Instead of giving people 'benefits' like Tax Credits use that money to reduce Business Taxes so employers can cover the cost.",
