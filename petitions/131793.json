        "additional_details": "http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/man-part-head-missing-who-8037089\r\n\r\nI feel that if an appeal is won using these regs when they haven't been considered by an \"assessor\", then the company is at fault and should not only refund the Government the charge for the assessment (\u00a340-\u00a360 +) but also cover the tribunal fees (\u00a31000+).",
        "background": "When assessment providers declare people \"fit to work\", they rarely consider ESA Regulations 29 and 35. The Work Capability Assessment (WCA) training manual explains these regs but many assessors are unaware of them. This places vulnerable people at risk, e.g. Kenny Bailey\r\n",
