        "background": "The Leave campaign at 52% and Remain at 48% only realized a turnout of 72%. This means that in effect the Leave vote was a mere 37% of the electorate and does not give a mandate to exit Europe. Moreover to take such drastic steps over a difference of 4% seems highly irresponsible.",
