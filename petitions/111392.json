        "additional_details": "The British motoring public are already paying for the privilege of using our roads by way of the the Vehicle Excise License, high duty on fuel, ever increasing insurance premiums, together with overall vehicle running costs.  They should not, therefore, be penalised further when buying or selling a vehicle.  This is an obvious and highly disreputable means of ripping the motorist off and increasing revenue into the government coffers.",
        "background": "Seller receives a refund on full months remaining only, so the month during which the sale takes place has already been paid for.  The new keeper shouldn't have to pay for this period as well, but should become responsible for the tax from the beginning of the following month.",
