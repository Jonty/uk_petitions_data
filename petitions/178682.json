        "additional_details": "On Holocaust Memorial Day of all days, Donald Trump signed Executive Orders that amount to a de facto ban on Muslims and refugees entering the United States. On the same day, the UK Prime Minister met with him and proclaimed the strength of the friendship between our nations. Friends don't let friends enforce a bigoted, ineffective, paranoid and religiously-motivated border policy. \r\n\r\nThe UK should model good humanitarian behaviour and accept all of those turned away by the US during this crisis.",
        "background": "We ask the Prime Minister to condemn President Trump's orders banning citizens of Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Sudan and Somalia from entering the USA and preventing Muslim refugees from travelling to the USA. We also ask that the UK accepts all those turned away by the USA during this crisis.",
