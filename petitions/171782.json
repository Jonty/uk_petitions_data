        "additional_details": "The government preferred to produce a brief for an athletics only stadium which would be largely disassembled after the games with the lower tier remaining in place as a permanent athletics facility to replace the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre. With the original Olympic design finalised and being built, the government had a change of heart and a bidding process for a multi-sport post-Olympic legacy was launched.",
        "background": "The original structure became the new home of West Ham United from last August. The conversion costs \u00a3272m, of which the football club will pay just \u00a315m plus annual rent of \u00a32.5m, bringing the final price tag to \u00a3702m. \r\n\r\nProblems with the seating will now cost the tax payer more millions to fix\r\n",
