        "action": "Lower the age to use bookmakers and to bet at races to 16.",
        "additional_details": "Betting as an industry has contributed 6 billion to our economy, which is 0.5% of GDP. In addition, it has created over 100,000 jobs and generates \u00a3700 Million in taxes. Reducing the ages for betting at the bookies and races would mean that the mentioned figures would only expand. Also, within bookmakers and races, you are only liable for the amount placed, therefore a \u00a35 loss will be just that. Lowering the gambling age, with the right education and warnings, will be beneficial for all.\r\n",
        "background": "With sixteen year olds being able to gamble within the National Lottery, various other lotteries, football pools, forms of non-commercial gambling and prizes gambling, it seems inane that they cannot place a bet if they're at a horse race, or even if they're watching one on the television.\r\n",
