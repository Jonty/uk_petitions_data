The number of cyclists is increasing, so is the rate of accidents. Too many ride at night with no lights, if cars did that, we'd get pulled in.... Make the roads safer and fairer for all road users. What person in their right mind would go down the left side of a lorry that's turning left? Training would help and create jobs!",
