        "additional_details": "All Parliament's planned recesses should be abandoned.\r\n\r\nGiven the importance of the negotiations, it seems fair to assume that our Parliament is 100% committed to getting the job done. This seems unachievable if Parliament spends as much time as currently diarised on holiday and away from the task at hand.\r\n\r\nThe only way for MPs to show their commitment to we, the people, is to immediately state their intention to work wholeheartedly until the job is done.",
        "background": "On March 29th Article 50 will be triggered. Parliament is set to recess on March 30th. \r\n\r\nDue to the time constraints on the UK government negotiating the UK's Brexit deal it seems appropriate to not spend quite so much of that period on holiday.\r\n\r\n",
