        "additional_details": "On the NHS Website, the opening hours are clearly stated, for the Minor Injuries Unit Trowbridge, daily from 7 a.m until 11pm. Thus leaving residents during the night potentially vulnerable, and at risk, if injured or ill. It is unrealistic to expect people to travel such a distance to Bath RUH, especially given the strain that Hospital is also under,with Staff shortages and lack of resources at crucially busy times. Surely it is more logical and viable to reinstate services within our Town. ",
