        "additional_details": "For example, in my constituency of Gosport, I have access to the Gosport Ferry - wherein I can access Portsmouth with ease. Child tickets range from 5 - 15 years of age, and adults tickets are 16+ ... how is a 16 year old an adult?! Another example is at cinemas, yes, teens have discounted tickets, yet why are we exploited due to our age bracket? We are STILL children.",
        "background": "As a 16 year old, I earn a lower amount than those 18+, yet I am still expected to pay adult prices for public transport, tickets, and the like. I am not legally an adult; I can't vote for my future, or buy age restricted products, and I earn a child's wage - I am therefore, a child. ",
