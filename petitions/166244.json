        "action": "Make learning a foreign language compulsory from the 1st year of primary school",
        "additional_details": "Communication is key in international business and the UK government wishes to see more students taking up a foreign language at university. To facilitate a future nation of polyglots we need to prioritise foreign language as a core subject for children. Starting from the age of 5, or younger, when it's easiest to learn, and to be taught continuously through to adolescence so that every future adult has at least basic secondary language skills.",
        "background": "The UK has one of the lowest levels of multi-linguistic speakers. By keeping up with our European neighbours we will open up travel for the individual and business for the nation. The best way to learn a foreign language is to learn continuously from a young age, when the brain is most capable.",
