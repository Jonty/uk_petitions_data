        "additional_details": "Not only would this hand a private company a successful NHS agency which makes a profit and has an effective monopoly on staffing, it would also divert crucial funds away from the NHS at a time when it is struggling more than ever with successive budget cuts and increasing pressure on services.\r\n\r\nPrivate companies put profits before patients. The Government must not be allowed to sell off yet another part of our NHS.",
        "background": "NHS Professionals is the in-house recruitment and staffing agency of the NHS. The government is planning to 'seek external investment' for the organisation - i.e. sell it off to a private, profit making company.",
