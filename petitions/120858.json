        "additional_details": "These families are spending months without central heating, relying on a couple of tiny fan heaters to heat an entire house with young children in them. Others have serious damp issues that result in mould growing on walls so fast it needs removing on a daily basis.\r\nThe contractors drag the issues out for months on end despite daily complaints and when they do attend they either don't have the correct parts to fix the fault or it is only for a 15 minute appointment where the repairman is only authorised to carry out a \"temporary\" repair such as painting over the mould patch.\r\n",
        "background": "The current contractor, CarillionAmey, is failing in its obligations to maintain the accommodation provided for our armed forces personnel.\r\nOur servicemen and women's families are being left for months on end with serious faults including broken boilers, damp, mould and pest infestations.",
