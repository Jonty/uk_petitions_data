        "action": "Sugar Tax: Government to re-debate Sugar Tax and potentially scrap Sugar Tax",
        "additional_details": "The Sugar Tax compromises and demonizes the use of a natural substance and promotes synthesized products. Sugar has been used for centuries to sweeten food. We know the side effects of its excessive consumption. In comparison, artificial sweeteners are a new phenomenon. Not enough conclusive research has been carried out for the Government to decree that sweeteners are a healthy alternative to sugar. For example, research into aspartame concluded it is both safe and a potential source of cancer.",
        "background": "Debate to consider: undesirable side effects of artificial sweeteners (AS); aspartame approved at current levels of consumption. Levels may increase due to ST; choice to consume natural product (sugar); tax from ST to research health impact of AS and fund nutrition education\r\n",
