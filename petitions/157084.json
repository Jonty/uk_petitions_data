        "action": "Make it compulsory for schools to teach all kinds of religion in schools equally",
        "additional_details": "Recent political movements have lead to a 52 percent rise in race related reports. I believe this starts at home and in school. If we educate our children in school about every religion we can they will develops educated views and become more tolerant and accepting of others. This is so very important to our multi cultural society and progression as humans that we need to get this movement to change the way we teach.",
        "background": "Schools are currently teaching religious studies or religious education to our children which is heavily based on Christianity. If it was compulsory to teach all religions and cultures our kids would have more understanding and be more accepting to people with different beliefs reducing segregation.",
