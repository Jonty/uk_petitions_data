Yes we have many places for these people like \"feed the homeless\" but what about the people sat alone on Christmas Day with nobody, reminding themselves they are alone! By signing this it will show the government their funding would be useful and many people in the community would love the opportunity to volunteer. Thankyou for reading please sign! See what we can do. ",
        "background": "With Christmas day coming up many people will be spending it alone and walking into new year alone, this petition is to try and get the government to agree to try and fund places for people like this. As people of the community to volunteer to help give the homeless and others to not feel alone.",
