        "action": "Change legislation allowing the electorate to demand an early general election.",
        "additional_details": "I propose that if 40% of those who voted in the previous general election demand that an early general election be called, then it should take place within a reasonable amount of time.\r\n\r\nAt present the public sector is being attacked with pay and pension cuts for staff (up to 30% for Doctors) and cuts to the provision of services (Police and NHS are at breaking point).  Additionally, welfare benefits for the most vulnerable in society are also being cut.\r\n\r\nThis act would allow the public a voice.",
        "background": "We live in a democracy and it should be the case that when the electorate are no longer happy that the Government represent the views and feelings of the electorate, they can demand and cause an early general election to take place.",
