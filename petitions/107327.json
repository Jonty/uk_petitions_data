Births from migrants and asylum seekers accounted for 47%. With what is happening in Hungary and Calais with an endless flow of migrants this figure will be far higher in 2015. Can our NHS and benefit system take the strain?\r\n\r\nPlease visit the link below for further information. It is quite alarming!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.migrationwatchuk.org/what-is-the-problem\r\n\r\n",
