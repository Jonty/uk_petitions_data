        "additional_details": "The Referendum was about economics & trade. The media & certain politicians made it about blaming hard-working immigrants.\r\n\r\nThe EU Referendum was not supported by the educated or the young.  It was not supported by the cities.\r\n\r\nLondon has a bigger GDP than many states. My city, Norwich, has thriving links with Europe as does Cambridge.  \r\n\r\nWe in the cities who voted to Remain in the EU see no alternative but to petition to be allowed to leave a country determined to commit economic suicide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The EU Referendum should never have happened.  The UK is a REPRESENTATIVE democracy ie we select and pay politicians to do the business of Government for us.  A decision so momentous should not have been handed to an electorate unqualified to comprehend the magnitude of the task. ",
