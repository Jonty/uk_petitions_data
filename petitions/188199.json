        "action": "Ban consumer products sold in the UK from using non-recyclable packaging.",
        "additional_details": "There must have a been a time before the plastic bag. How did our culture operate? There are alternatives to all non recyclable packaging, though if not banned or policy changed then companies will always seek the cheapest option. For innovation in our industries to happen, a need for change must be known. The UK's need is for a plasticless (if not reduced) future. Let the UK lead the world with environmental policies.",
        "background": "With ever greater needs to protect the environment and our climate, the UK should become innovators in implementing environmental policies. Banning unnecessary non-recyclable packaging will reduce landfill and increase the UK's recycling abilities as less non-recyclables will be wrongly recycled.",
