        "action": "Don't leave the EU without guarantees of Vote Leave's promises",
        "additional_details": "We believe that leaders must be accountable, and that promises to voters matter. If and when HM Government invokes Article 50, the UK will have to leave the EU within two years, even if it cannot get a good deal. Any EU country could prevent the UK joining again. We call on HM Government not to leave the EU, and not to invoke article 50, without guarantees that these Vote Leave pledges will be met.",
        "background": "The Vote Leave campaign said the UK could have: 1. \u00a3350 million a week back from the EU, for spending on the NHS, 2. Control of migration policy, and 3. Continued access to the single market.\r\nWe call on HM Government not to leave the EU without cast-iron guarantees to meet these three key pledges.",
