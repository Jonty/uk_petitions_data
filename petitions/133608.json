        "action": "Give MPs a Free Vote on Continued EU Membership",
        "additional_details": "The EU referendum on June 23rd 2016 produced a small majority vote for the Leave campaign. This poll is purely advisory and not legally binding. The result is sufficiently close that MPs should seriously reconsider the economic, social and cultural impacts of Brexit before making a final decision on this subtle and difficult issue. This will only be possible if the major political parties withdraw the whip, which may be used to force MPs to blindly adopt the referendum result.",
        "background": "We the undersigned call the leaders of the major political parties to give MPs a free vote on whether to invoke Article 50 following the result of the EU referendum on 23rd June 2016. We believe that MPs should be allowed to decide on this complex issue without compulsion from party hierarchy.",
