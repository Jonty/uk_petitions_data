        "additional_details": "An analogy: Imagine that you are elderly and your son has put you into a home.  One day, he asks you whether you would like to leave it, yes or no.  You say yes, and afterwards you realize that you don\u2019t know whether he intends to put you into a better or worse home, let you live with him, or put you out on the street.  Whatever he chooses, he insists that you agreed to it.",
        "background": "The referendum question offered no specific alternative to EU membership, therefore no course of action can be said to have been democratically agreed by the British people.   In committing us to leave with no agreements in place, the Government fails in its duty to protect British interests.",
