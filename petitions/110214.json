        "additional_details": "It is considered a mixed system due to its combination of Proportional Representation and First Past The Post. This system is currently adopted by New Zealand, Romania and Lethoso. This system would allow the UK to cope with its new era of multiparty politics whilst still allowing citizens to be in contact with a local representative.",
        "background": "The MMP voting system is currently used in New Zealand, it ensures that constituencies still have representatives whilst ensuring that seats in Parliament are given proportionally to the amount of votes a party receives. This would stop the major faults the UK currently has with the FPTP system.",
