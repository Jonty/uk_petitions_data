        "action": "Move Trident programme, with all the jobs and funding to an English shipyard.",
        "additional_details": "Trident is a UK defence programme.  Scotland is opposed to the programme AND wants independence from the UK. However, the SNP still expects an equivalent investment in jobs and industry. It is their right to oppose Trident if that is their belief.  However, they should live with the consequence of the investment and jobs going elsewhere.  For a change have consideration for the majority of the UK, not just a minority with a total population smaller than a solitary major UK city.",
        "background": "The SNP is campaigning against the renewal of the Trident programme. However they still demand the investment and jobs to be committed to Scotland to aid their economy. This is wrong. There are still shipyards in England so move the programme to Devonport or similar together with jobs and funding.",
