        "additional_details": "An independent medical expert stated that if Isabel had attended at her hospital in London she would still be alive today. The hospital there accepts children up to the age of 18 years. A teenager\u2019s physiology is different than that of an adult and therefore requires a different level of treatment. The upper age limit for treatment at a Childrens Hospital should be standardised at 18 years.",
        "background": "Isabel Gentry died from Meningitis B on 20/5/16 aged 16yrs. The inquest in to her death found that she had received substandard medical care. One issue was  Isabel\u2019s age as it was unclear whether she should go to the Children\u2019s or Adult A & E. Hospital guide lines state 16+years are Adult. ",
