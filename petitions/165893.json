        "action": "Introduce retesting of drivers every ten years to reduce accidents and deaths",
        "additional_details": "If the driving standards were improved this would reduce the number of accidents and deaths thus reducing costs of the police, NHS and fire services, as well as reducing the emotional heartache to the familys who lose members and loved ones due to bad driving. \r\nIt would create jobs as more examiners would be needed and the price of each retest should include a professional eyesight test too.\r\nEverybody think they are good drivers so prove it and reduce their car insurance.\r\nEverybody wins.",
        "background": "I feel every driver should be retested every ten years to evaluate their driving skills. At the end of each assessment the driver should be given a grade based on their driving. This should be used on their insurance so that good drivers would pay less thus encouraging poor drivers to take training",
