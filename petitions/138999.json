This referendum would see our country crumble, our economy has already fallen, many countries and banks are pulling out of the UK as a result. It is our duty as the people to ensure that our country stays strong and our democracy isn't crushed.",
        "background": "The UK represents 4 nations. It is unfair and undemocratic that the UK can leave the EU without the unanimous decision of all 4 nations and their people. As Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain, this referendum does not represent the UK in its entirety.",
