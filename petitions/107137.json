        "additional_details": "It's only human to sympathise with the plight of people who are suffering in their home country, who would risk death to leave and find a safer life. However, I have spent 30 years of my life seeing images of Ethiopian children, bent double, a bag of bones DYING of dehydration, starvation and preventable diseases. I have seen under 12s working for a living, in sweat shops, doing back breaking work. There are wars, famine, injustices everywhere, even in Britain. That is sad, but that is life.",
