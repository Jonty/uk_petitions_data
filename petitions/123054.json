        "additional_details": "I sometimes meet people who recall their science classes as a series of facts. Students need to understand the role of peer review.\r\n\r\nMany people recall their history classes as a series of facts rather than a rich tapestry of sometimes conflicting stories where the evidence varies in quality.\r\n\r\nWe are living in times that prove, with deadly effect, the consequences of dogmatic teaching of religion. ",
        "background": "Those responsible for teaching children are to have a duty of care to establish a context where received wisdom is fallible, and critical thinking valued.\r\n\r\nReligion or \"faith\" provides no grounds for exemption from this duty. \r\n\r\nLegislate and take measures to enforce this in all schools.\r\n",
