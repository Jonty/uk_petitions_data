            "details": "Some people have a negative association with the word \u2018benefit\u2019 as synonymous with the means test; however this legal description provides consistency with other contributory benefits.\r\n \r\nIt is, of course, also consistent with private pensions where traditional pension schemes which are earnings linked such as final salary schemes, known as \u2018Defined Benefit\u2019 schemes. The pension paid out by these schemes is defined as a \u2018benefit\u2019.\r\n\r\nState Pension entitlement is based on having paid into the National Insurance scheme for a required number of years.  However, use of the word \u201cbenefit\u201d for retirement pension (latterly known as State Pension) has always been classified in law from the time of the1946 National Insurance Act, which applied from the inception of the National Insurance scheme. No offence is intended by the use of this term.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the term \u201ccontributory benefit\u201d, forms the legislative framework of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992.   Section 20 of that Act is entitled \u201cDescriptions of contributory benefits\u201d. Contributory benefits under Part II of that Act are listed, and the sixth is retirement pensions.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the introduction of the new State Pension from 6 April 2016 is also classified as a \u201cbenefit\u201d under Section 1(1) of the Pensions Act 2014.\r\n\r\nThis word is also used to describe the advantages (benefits) provided through private pension arrangements.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Work and Pensions",
            "summary": "The State Pension is described in legislation as a \u201cbenefit\u201d in order to root it within the existing social security framework as a statutory scheme paid out of monies in the National Insurance Fund.",
