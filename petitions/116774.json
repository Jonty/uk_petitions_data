Not only children do these adverts affect but adults too! It should be a choice to see adverts of this nature and not forced upon our screens. Especially for example someone with a background of abuse and then a NSPCC advert comes on telling details of abuse suffered, this can be distressing to say the least towards vulnerable people.",
        "background": "There's various adverts on TV containing details of human & animal abuse, malnutrition, starvation. Whilst I agree it is important to try and help and gain publicity in order to do this I feel we should be able to choose to see this and it should include a trigger warning before coming onto screen",
