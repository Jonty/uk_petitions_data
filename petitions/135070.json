        "additional_details": "Looking at the percentages of votes of categorised age groups, the highest percentage of people who had voted to stay within the EU stands with 18-25's. This exemplifies how the younger generation have a voice and if 16-17's get a chance to vote, they get to speak up for their future. As this age group is starting to think about their future, universities, they should have an official say in how they wish to begin their lives as independent individuals. ",
        "background": "16-17's deserve a right to vote for their future. Studying abroad is going to become more difficult to get in to, stripping people of countless opportunities whilst at university. Why should an older generation dictate a future the younger generation haven't had any say in or particularly want?",
