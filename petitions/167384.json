        "action": "The abuse of a redhead should be made a criminal offence as a form of racism.",
        "additional_details": "I am a strong believer in this being a form of racism and I will never believe it is okay for people to be tortured for being different. People get trauma treatment and counselling due to insecurities and mental illness triggered by the abuse and harassment. People can be rejected from work, friendships, relationships and school events for it. It can have a long lasting impact on those affected and even lead people to suicide. ",
        "background": "It's racial abuse and harrassment and works the same as being harassed for having a different colour skin or having a different god. \r\nIt is an 'accepted' form of abuse in society which is wrong as this amount of bullying and mental abuse is dangerous for a person's insecurities or mental health.",
