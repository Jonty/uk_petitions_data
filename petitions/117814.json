        "action": "Maintain and dredge our rivers - the UK's natural drainage system",
        "additional_details": "It would seem that river authorities, the environmental agency and other well meaning organisations protect specific species in isolation and fail to see the primary function of rivers and flood plains  - which is  to drain our island and take rainwater to the sea.  We should trust the power of evolution and ingenuity of individual species to adapt and adjust (think urban foxes!)  - We need to dredge rivers and maintain them - they are the best drainage system we have. ",
        "background": "For centuries we maintained our rivers and saw them as an essential drainage system that required regular and thorough maintenance. They were a crucial part in protecting our homes and properties from flooding whilst still supporting a diversity of wildlife species and varied plantlife.",
