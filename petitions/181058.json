        "additional_details": "We demand that the Home Office issue written reasons for the refusals of all Dublin III family re-unification cases promptly, giving minors the chance to appeal and prove the authenticity of the relationships.\r\n\r\nWe demand that the Home Office comply with Articles 6 and 8 of EU directive 604/2013, to which they are bound, and ensure the safe transfer of those children who were in the Calais 'Jungle' who have family members waiting and willing to welcome them in the United Kingdom.",
        "background": "The Home Office has refused to give reasons for denying requests for family reunification to hundreds of children previously living in the Calais 'Jungle'. This has caused their cases to stall, extreme stress and frustration and in some cases children are running away from accommodation centres.",
