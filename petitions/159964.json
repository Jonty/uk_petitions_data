        "action": "Change the law on combustion engine assisted push bicycles",
        "additional_details": "In countries such as Australia it is almost encouraged to use these vehicles as an alternative to cars. They are easy to use, build and repair, are very economical and cause less pollution than a single person travelling in a car. I believe that similar laws should be in place here to allow oppertunities for people who may not be able to afford or run a car or who wish to choose alternative transport. They will help to reduce city traffic and emissions and help to keep roads clearer.",
        "background": "In the UK it is the law to register, MOT, tax and insure a push bike with a combustion engine on. There are many kits available to fit to your push bike that range up to 80cc. In many countries they are exempt from registration and insurance with success and I think that the same should apply here.",
