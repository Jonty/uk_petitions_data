        "additional_details": "Moreover, not acceptable that these EU citizens are required to pay fees and go through very bureaucratic Home Office procedure to obtain security of their rights! I strongly oppose any costs as they entirely must be absorbed by Government because when EU people entered the country they were given the promise to be able to live in this country as long as they wish. In addition, due to busy schedules that many of these EU citizens lead in this country, I urge to cut the red tape down to minimum!",
        "background": "It is extremely unfair that hardworking, multi-talented and highly motivated EU citizens are not certain about their legal status post-Brexit. I urge the Government to take immediate action and show respect towards 5% of this country's most valuable population.",
