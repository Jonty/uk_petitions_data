        "additional_details": "The 'average person' currently does not necessary know the importance of staying or leaving and the effects it may have on them should we stay or leave. Therefore with such a major decision it's paramount that as a nation overall, votes are a fair sample. Not the majority of people who wanted to call the referendum in the first place to leave.",
        "background": "On Thursday 23rd June the United Kingdom will be voting to decide whether to stay in a 'reformed' European Union or leave. This is the biggest decision of a generation (far beyond a single government). It's only right that a required turn out be the same as the previous general election (2 thirds). ",
