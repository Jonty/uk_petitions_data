        "additional_details": "In the USA, VW have been forced to work hard to fix the emissions problems, have given compensation and in many cases, are buying vehicles back from customers. In the U.K. they have sent customers a letter promising fixes in early 2016. The dates have passed and VW has not resolved the issues. Please sign this petition to have parliament consider how to force VW to be more responsible and respectful of its customers.",
        "background": "VW has failed to support its customers in a timely manner in the U.K. The US government has been much harder with VW and has supported its consumers much more than the U.K. Government has done. Please consider whether VW should be more accountable. ",
