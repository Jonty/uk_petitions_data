        "additional_details": "Statistics show that suicide is the biggest single killer of men under the age of 45. \r\nThe idea of having signs has already been done in Japans Aokigahara Forest, where hundreds of people have gone to commit suicide. There are now signs which read  \"Your life is something precious that was given to you by your parents\" while another one states ''Do not be troubled alone.\" What i'm suggesting is signs with The Samaritans and other local mental health services details on to contact. There is help.",
        "background": "Imagine feeling that there is no hope left in life, nothing to live for. These thoughts go through peoples heads daily and they consequently end their lives. Some people may have no one to talk to, but there are services that can help. I believe putting the information out there will save lives.",
