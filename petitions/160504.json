One pair of glasses cost me nearly \u00a3300.\r\n\r\nThe buy one get one free offers advertised do not include thinner lenses so if a second pair is required (eg prescription sunglasses which with some conditions light has a major impact) you have to pay twice for the lenses.\r\n\r\nI currently have thinner lenses in my latest pair and from the side they are at least 0.75cm thick so would be considerably worse without",
