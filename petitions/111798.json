        "additional_details": "I am writing this petition because there is no recognition for this addiction besides gamcare which is aligned with the big bookmakers in the uk and try to get you to gamble responsibly with small amounts, could an alcoholic just have half a lager and stop no is the answer. Most drs dont understand this problem which is purely a mental urge. This problem needs better recognition instead of thinking of the billions of \u00a3's profits,but the actual lives it ruining. ",
