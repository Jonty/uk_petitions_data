        "action": "Make NATS rethink their amended pricing policy for the use of AFPEx.",
        "additional_details": "There are a lot of GA Airfields in the UK struggling to stay alive. One way of generating vital revenue is the allow commercial operations to make use of their facilities. NATS have changed the regulations so that those airfields that allow these activities are now going to be penalised  by the introduction of a grossy inflated charge for a service that should be free. Have NATS carried out an assessment on the impact this will have on GA airfields - clearly not.\r\n\r\nPlease support this petition.",
        "background": "AFPEx is the Aeronautical Flight Plan Exchange service that has allowed users to file and receive flight plans and associated aviation data. For a long time NATS offered this as a free service and it is much valued by the General Aviation community as a whole.",
