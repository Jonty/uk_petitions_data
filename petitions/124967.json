        "additional_details": "The Education white paper published March 17th, 2016 states: \u201cWe will expect all governing boards to focus on seeking people with the right skills for governance, and so we will no longer require academy trusts to reserve places for elected parents on governing boards.\r\n\u201cWe will offer this freedom to all open academies, and as we move towards a system where every school is an academy, fully skills-based governance will become the normal across the education system.\u201d",
        "background": "By law, parent governors currently have reserved seats on a school governing body, allowing parents to engage with management. Without them, Academies will not be answerable to the community for their actions. If your village school sells it's playing field or has poor results you will have no say.",
