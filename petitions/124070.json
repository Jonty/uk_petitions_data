        "action": "Stop all terrier work",
        "additional_details": "As a campaigner I have witnessed both legal and illegal terrier work. Both are cruel because there is fine line between legal and illegal. Terrier work is underground hunting. Since foxes do not live naturally underground - they only enter a sett or earth to escape danger or give birth. Foxes are reluctant to defend themselves when cornered but will fight to defend their cubs - this can also cause serious injury to the entered terrier. Banning all terrier work is the only civilised option.",
        "background": "Terrier-work is the most cruel part of fox hunting. It causes fear, pain and distress to foxes being dug/flushed out and killed. ",
