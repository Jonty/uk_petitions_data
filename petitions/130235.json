        "additional_details": "If a group of travellers dumps vast quantities of bulk rubbish and human waste while they occupy public land, it costs tax payers' money to clean up. In these circumstances, the group's behaviour forfeits their right to live in this way. If they knew they could lose their vehicles/caravans, maybe they would behave differently. It's time to put a stop to this anti-social behaviour. Sign the petition and let's get our MPs to raise this issue in a Parliamentary debate!\u201d",
        "background": "Recently a travellers community has twice descended on our village, and twice been rapidly evicted by the local Council. The travellers, who act with a wholesome contempt for the law, have twice caused an indescribable and costly mess. This is a UK-wide problem. It's time to stop to this behaviour.",
