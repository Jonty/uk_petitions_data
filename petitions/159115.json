We would all still be British citizens under the Queen and sovereign parliament in Westminster. \r\nLondon, NI and Scotland could remain in the EU.\r\nThis would be cheaper, simpler, more flexible and quicker than Brexit.\r\nWe request that the UK government hold a referendum on all realistic options for the relationship between the UK and the EU.",

Great Britain and Northern Ireland are in the UK and therefore the EU, while the Isles of Jersey, Guernsey and Man are in the British Isles but not in the UK or the EU.\r\n",
