        "additional_details": "The government extended the deadline for registration and conducted an expensive campaign to try and persuade UK citizens to vote 'remain'.  The largely pro-EU people of Gibraltar were also allowed to vote.  Turn out at the polling booths was extremely high which, according to experts, should have favored the 'remain' campaign.  Despite these factors, the result was a clear majority for 'leave'.",
        "background": "The UK government held a referendum on membership of the EU.  The result was a clear majority for 'leave'.  The UK prime minister, David Cameron, following the result stated that there can be 'no doubt' about the outcome.  Some are calling upon the government to hold a second referendum.",
