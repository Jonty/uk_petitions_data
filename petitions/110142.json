        "action": "Introduce safety requirements for left hand drives trucks entering UK roads",
        "additional_details": "The U.K. Motorway network is seeing increasing volumes of European trucks and the number of accident being attributed to poor vision by the drivers of these vehicles is increasing in proportion.\r\nThese accident cause injuries, deaths, road congestion and delays.\r\nIn particular our trunk routes motorways are being seriously affected. We could avoid these significant cost to the UK economy. That could be prevented by stopping trucks entering the UK unless they have this equipment fitted.",
        "background": "These trucks have unique safety issues when used on UK roads because the driver has limited vision of the right hand side. On motorways this creates a major risk to other road user risking lives.\r\nI want minimum standards:\r\nBlind spot mirrors\r\nRight hand side cameras\r\nAnti collision bleepers",
