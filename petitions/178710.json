        "additional_details": "Dogo argentinos are used as family dogs and guard dogs In their native country, just like GSD's, dobermann's and Rottweilers, they are renowned for their loyalty, and maternal instincts, to ban on dog because it looks menacing is wrong, as it promotes people to keep them for all the wrong reasons, just like every other dog consistent training and socialisation makes them perfect pets and companions, they are smart and are a reward to own because of their close loving bond with their owners.",
        "background": "Since 1991 this breed has been banned in the UK under the dangerous dogs act 1991, I propose that this law to either be heavily changed or removed, as people are becoming more aware that with this specific species the dogs themselves are not the problem, but the people that misuse and abuse them.",
