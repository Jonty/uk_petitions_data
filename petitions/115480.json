        "additional_details": "By our own reckoning only 50% of us are confident in our political knowledge and 77% say that they know less about the issues in elections to the European Parliament than they do in general elections.\r\n\r\nIs this a good base to make this important decision from?\r\n\r\nAckerman and Fishkin, the scholars who devised Deliberation Day, have shown that access to information can change opinions. \r\n\r\nWe owe the future of our nation just one day to create a more informed electorate for such a monumental decision.",
        "background": "Already politicians on both the In and Out sides have been using spin and misinformation to help strengthen their arguments. We need a way that helps everybody to see the truth about the UK and the EU.\r\n\r\nA paid bank holiday event would allow everyone to weigh up the facts and make their decision.",
