In light of recent events the very heart of democracy is being attacked by younger generations either through demanding that the outcome of a democratic vote is changed.

        "background": "Its obvious from the outcry from the referendum that younger generations lack the emotional maturity to except a vote which does not go their way. As such the voting age should be increased to a point of life of which they are emotionally mature enough to accept a democratic decision ",
