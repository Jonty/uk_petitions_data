        "additional_details": "Sea levels are set to rise by twice as much as anticipated by the end of this century, showing that we are not prepared for the extent of the problems that this on going issue will create. The record for the lowest area of ice coverage in the Arctic is set to happen either this year or next year which creates yet another issue for our wildlife, which has been ignored because we rank the life of an endangered animal that doesn't contribute to pollution lower than our own.",
        "background": "I understand that the government is already trying to cut down global warming but I still don't believe everything is being done. The purpose of a government is to better our future by learning from what has gone wrong. Flooding will increase with global warming, as will the cost of flood repairs..",
