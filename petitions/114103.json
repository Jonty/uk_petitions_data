        "action": "Carry out air strikes on ISIS in Syria",
        "additional_details": "ISIS has the explicit goal of imposing their brutal and fascistic ideology on Iraq and Syria, as well as the wider world. They have proven their capability of organising attacks on Europe, and have executed British hostages.\r\n\r\nWhile military intervention will entail civilian casualties and possibly increase the risk to the UK in the short term, inaction also leaves us with blood on our hands. If we do nothing, we condemn Syria to further violence at the hands of both ISIS and the Assad regime.",
        "background": "In response to their campaign of violence against the Iraqi and Syrian people, and the attacks carried out in Paris, the UK should join our allies in conducting air strikes on ISIS in Syria. In addition, we should support moderate rebel groups, with the long-term goal of regime change and democracy.",
