        "additional_details": "The EU referendum was a 'once in a generation' event, which caught out many voters, due to a lack of availability of properly informed facts. It appears to me that there were very many protest votes aimed at authority in general, which were perhaps meant only as a strong  warning rather than a machine of massive (possibly devastating) economic change. We need a second vote to check that the correct decision has been made before it is too late.",
        "background": "The current Government decided to call an EU referendum without having properly investigated how to proceed after a 'leave' vote. They assumed that it wouldn't happen and have created chaos, confusion, frustration and much anxiety as a result of this. A general election will validate our decision.",
