        "action": "Prevent the local authority budget cuts affecting adult and children social care",
        "additional_details": "Furthermore, Central Government should provide more funding to local authorities in respect of Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards. There is an increase in responsibility following the decision in Cheshire West, and Birmingham (DOLS and Children). To cut funding from these areas when the need for such services is increasing, alongside statutory responsibilities increasing is totally irrational, unreasonable, unjustified and unfair.\r\n\r\nStop the cuts to social care!",
        "background": "Central Government are cutting budgets to local governments which then affect the most vulnerable of society; children and vulnerable adults. Providing social care to children and adults is a statutory obligation and therefore the cuts should not affect these services.",
