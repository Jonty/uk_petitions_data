        "additional_details": "Swastikas are illegal in Germany and should be illegal in the UK too.\r\nLet us not forget the hundreds of thousands of people who lost their lives fighting Nazism in the last world war and people who think they are somehow being patriotic by having these symbols of hatred engraved in their skin are actually just spitting on their graves.",
        "background": "Sporting a Nazi swastika tattoo is as much a hate crime as speaking such sentiments. They should be made illegal if they are visible and tattoo parlours should be punished under the law by fines and prison sentences.",
