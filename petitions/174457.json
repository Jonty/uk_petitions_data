        "additional_details": "The planned dates of RMT / ASLEF industrial action (as of 01-12-16) means that 23 of the next 30 working days will have disrupted services.\r\nService was already poor prior to the strikes with ongoing staff shortages causing regular delays or cancellations. This has been compounded by changes to overtime and rota swapping practices. Passengers have to regularly endure long delays to journeys and overcrowded carriages. Recently thousands of BHAFC supporters were left stranded due to cancellations.",
        "background": "Passengers are caught in an escalating war between Southern Rail and its unions. Commuters find it increasingly difficult to get to work/school. Commuter businesses suffer such low sales on strike days many stay closed. \r\nWe want to know why government will not step in and help us.",
