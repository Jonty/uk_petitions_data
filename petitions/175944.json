        "additional_details": "Examples of \"filibustering\" are Philip Davies MP talking out votes on issues such as reversing the progress on NHS Privatisation, making homes fit for human habitation and giving all children First Aid training in school! These and many other vitally important issues are swept aside by this nonsensical practice. We have voted for our MPs to speak for us, and \"filibustering\" makes a total mockery of that. Please help end this practice and ask the Speaker to stop them in time to vote. ",
        "background": "In recent times there have been numerous hugely important debates in Parliament which have been prevented from being voted upon by this scandalous practice known as \"filibustering\". We want this to be made illegal, so that issues can be dealt with as the people request. ",
