        "additional_details": "The events unfolding as families and individuals flee areas torn by war have now reached the proportions of human catastrophe. We cannot ignore this and cannot solve this catastrophe by sticking to existing failed policies. We need a paradigm shift in thinking and we need new solutions. However those fleeing need hope and they need answers now. Leaving them to die is no answer and we must save lives first and only then can we be allowed the luxury to debate global policy and solutions.",
        "background": "The time to sit on our hands while many die must end. Almost all of us who are in the UK feel deeply about the need for a humanitarian response and we need it immediately to avoid unecessary deaths. Accepting 100,000 is equal to only about 150 per parliamentary constituency. ",
