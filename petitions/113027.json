        "additional_details": "After discussing my issue with Britax, the 'in car safety centre', car seat safety, halfords, toys r us, and mothercare, it comes about that other than a \u00a3600+ special needs car seat, the only other option for safety for a larger child still needing a harness, was a Britax Advansafix which means a child can be held in by harness till 25kg for \u00a3225.\r\nHowever this has not been safety tested in all cars.\r\nWhy does a larger childs safety cost such a ridiculous amount and why is there not more choice?!",
        "background": "Children who are 18kg generally need to go from a stage 1 car seat with a harness to a stage 2 high back booster seat with an adult seat belt.\r\nCar seat laws are judged on weight not age.\r\nWhat happens when a 1 year old is 18kg but climbs out of an adult seat belt? What seats are actually available?",
