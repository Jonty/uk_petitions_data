        "additional_details": "The vote has been taken to leave the EU and now we should be able to decide who we think will represent us during the negotiations. We cannot leave it in the hands of such a deceitful and hateful party. It is clear that neither side of the debate were prepared for this outcome and both sides neglected or lied to many members of the public. This should not go unaccounted for and we as a public need to voice our dissatisfaction with their actions and elect a new government to take us forward",
        "background": "The government are in a mess. The remain campaigners took no time to consider what would happen following a vote to leave the EU and now their leader has resigned. It seems that the leave campaigners also don't have a clue what to do and there will be disagreement about who should lead the party.",
