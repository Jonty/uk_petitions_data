        "additional_details": "If your employer say they will pay you \u00a310 per hour for a fifty hour week, then you only receive \u00a3350, you'd feel a little more than a little miffed - but that's exactly the \"deal\" we are being sold by the Government with increased retirement ages.     By their own admission, you need to pay N.I. contributions for 35 years to get a full State Pension.     So why are we expected to work longer?     Any individual completing 40 years contributions should have their pension payable from that point.",
        "background": "Recent State Pension changes means many people will contribute around 50 years N.I contributions before they will receive a State Pension, despite the Government themselves saying 35 years is the amount of contributions needed to create it in the first place.     Pay the pension at 40 years maximum.",
