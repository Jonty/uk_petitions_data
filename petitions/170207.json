        "action": "For Parliament to ban the non-stun slaughter of animals in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Both the RSPCA and the BVA are firmly of the view that animals who are not stunned before slaughter suffer.\r\n\r\nThe view of the previous Government was completely unsatisfactory and ignored widely accepted scientific evidence.  Additionally, the University of Bristol has released research indicating that many Islamic scholars agree stunned meat can remain Halal.\r\n\r\nRegardless, it is time the United Kingdom joined Norway, Iceland, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Denmark, and Sweden in an outright ban.\r\n",
        "background": "The United Kingdom has a proud and admirable record in animal welfare.  When the RSPCA's forebearer came into existence in 1824, it was the first such body of its kind.  It is shameful that almost two centuries later we still permit the inhumane slaughter of animals based on religious grounds.",
