        "action": "Introduce Targeted Sanctions and Travel bans on President Trump and Inner Circle",
        "additional_details": "Targeted sanctions similar to those applied to senior Russian leaders can be used to pressure US leadership to return from the brink of fascism before it is too late. It is important to stand early against tyrants before they can remove democratic checks and balances and the UK needs a democratic USA as ally.\r\n\r\nPeople included in the sanctions should at least include the President, his children, VP, Steven Bannon, the US Cabinet and nominees and the immediate families of all those mentioned.",
        "background": "President Donald Trump is breaching the US constitution, ignoring judicial orders breaking international law and separating families with his executive order revoking visas and has fired the acting Attorney General for refusing to defend an unconstitutional position.",
