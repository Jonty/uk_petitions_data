        "background": "Wayne Rooney has been truly awful this year and is undeserving of a spot in England's squad for Euro 2016 in France. Being named captain has forced Hodgson in a comer to pick him, when there are a number of players in much better form. Wayne Rooney must therefore be made ineligible for selection!!",
