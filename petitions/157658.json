        "additional_details": "The Leave campaign made false claims and Leave voters feel conned and mislead. \r\n\r\nMounting evidence suggests that Leave voters voted on domestic issues, such as more funding for the NHS, schools and other public bodies.  Some Leave voters voted in protest at Westminster and the establishment. These are domestic issues unrelated to the EU.  Leaving the EU will not solve these problems.\r\n\r\nArticle 50 must not be invoked unless there is a genuine mandate of the UK electorate to leave the EU.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Before Article 50 is invoked parliament and the government should debate whether the Leave vote is a genuine mandate to leave the EU.\r\n\r\nEvidence suggests that many Leave voters voted on the basis of false promises, misrepresentations and domestic issues. Brexit implications were not understood.\r\n\r\n",
