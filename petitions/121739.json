        "additional_details": "Additionally http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/ In these times of austerity when public servants are being told they can have 0-1% rise because there is no money but some MP'S and other members in the House Of Commons seem to think it is fine to claim for beeswax candles for example. Some expenses claims are more than 2 members of the public on minimum wage earn all year.  Why do our political class think this is fine, because they can and do seem to get away with it.",
        "background": "IPSA was meant to work in the interest of public funds raised by taxes, it is clear that this is not the case. http://goo.gl/2AgVXM and http://goo.gl/fcdt5t It is time IPSA was replaced with a public board fully transparent and accountable to the public. ",
