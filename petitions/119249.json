        "additional_details": "Quite rightly the university's chancellor Lord Patten said students with such views \"should think about being educated elsewhere\u201d.\r\nThe Rhodes Trust is a force for good in this world: www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/rhodes-trust\r\nWe should never forget our history good or bad, it is the future that counts and without Rhodes there would be no Rhodes Trust.  What Rhodes did in the 19th century can not be undone.  What his legacy can do in the future is not yet written, we will regret this in the future.",
        "background": "Students at Oxford have voted in favour of removing the statue of Sir Cecil Rhodes from Oriel College. This is a shameful example of political correctness gone mad.  Will Bomber Harris, Churchill and Cromwell be next? These students should be looking to the improve the future not desecrate the past.",
