        "additional_details": "The 101 non-emergency number being a paid service as opposed to a free phone number has various negative repercussions. If the person making the call to 101 is, for example, calling from a mobile phone on a Pay-As-You-Go Tariff and has no credit remaining, then they will not be able to make the call, and then would have to resort to calling 999 in order to get in contact with the Police. This would in turn waste time for those who have to actively deal with actual emergency calls.",
        "background": "As it currently stands in the UK people who which to contact the police to either report a crime of for anything that wouldn't be deemed an 'emergency' are advised to call the police on 101. Unlike 999 the 101 number is not free to call, and charges at a normal network rate.",
