        "action": "Introduce a Codified Constitution into British Law.",
        "additional_details": "The UK constitution is unwritten  (uncodified) and has no higher laws meaning in simple fact once a political party is elected they can more or less act as they please. This is because sovereignty is vested in the hands of the government of the time meaning they will have true executive power and have few to no restrictions. Also, as we are soon to be leaving the European Union the bills and acts imposed by this union will be up to question including the Humans Rights acts which were imposed by the European Convention on Human Rights. Furthermore, this means we must introduce a rigid and comprehensive constitution which in practice will strengthen human rights and stop any radical government taking away the civil liberties of the people. \r\n",
        "background": " A codified constitution will not only bring in great democratic change but will also  help protect the civil liberties of our people as well as control the power in which parliament holds. \r\n ",
