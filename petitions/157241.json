        "additional_details": "In Switzerland, when around 0.6% of the population signs a petition, it triggers a referendum (https://www.ch.ch/en/referendum/). This system works well in a country of more than eight million people, and there is no reason why it wouldn't work well in the UK.\r\n\r\nA committee or group should be set up to administer these petitions so they do not needlessly consume government time. Note that only a small number of petitions a year would receive the needed signatures.",
        "background": "Engagement with politics is continuing to decline. Direct democracy is part of the solution. \r\n\r\nWhen an official petition receives around 250,000 signatures, it should result in an official, binding referendum.",
