        "additional_details": "Traumatic brain injuries are caused by a blow to the head that disrupts the brain\u2019s function. It can lead to temporary or permanent disabilities. Fifty percent of these types of injuries are due to bicycle, car or pedestrian-vehicle accidents.\r\n\r\nAccording to American Journal of Public Health reports, city bike sharing schemes increase the risk of brain injury by 14 percent.\r\n\r\nTFL promotes the use of helmets among cyclists, so please extend this to providing helmets with the Santander cycles. \r\n",
        "background": "Deaths and injuries among cyclists have risen sharply year upon year, and a large part of those injuries and fatalities is caused by cyclists not wearing a helmet. Santander cycles in London are provided without helmets, meaning that there is incredible danger to the cyclist when they rent a bike. ",
