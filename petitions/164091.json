        "additional_details": "People believe that if you see a mental health specialist then your classed as a mental health patient and fear of being sectioned sets in. By changing this term we can hopefully have more lives saved by letting people feel more relaxed about their personal health issues and maybe they will find the strength to speak out.\r\nFrom personal experience i was worried about driving into a mental health unit after suffering depression. i then asked for an alternative venue to have my meetings.",
        "background": "Many people take their own lives through depression and various psychological health issues. The term \"Mental\" creates a huge stigma and fear for many people who feel if they see someone from a mental health service then it will affect them later for work etc. ",
