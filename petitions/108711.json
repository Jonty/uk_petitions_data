        "additional_details": "Everyone should be against the cruel \u2018sport\u2019 of dog fighting, past and present. There is NO justifiable reason to throw two dogs into a pit and watch them tear each other apart. Because of illegal dog fighting the American Pit Bull Terrier has been discriminated against by an outdated law known as the Dangerous Dogs Act (DDA) 1991. It is well-overdue for that law to be lifted. Unfit dog owners should be condemned and prosecuted, not the breed.",
        "background": "The American Pit Bull Terrier is a wonderful dog, well-known for its intelligence, strength and loyalty. Sadly, the breed has been unfairly stigmatised as overly aggressive and dangerous. There is no such thing as a dangerous dog, only a dangerous owner. ",
