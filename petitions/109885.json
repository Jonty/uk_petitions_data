        "additional_details": "Pay day loans, overdraft fees and high interest credit cards are just a few examples of mistakes that teenagers make when starting to deal with their own personal finances. If children were taught at school this could give them a greater awareness on what is good and what is bad in terms of financial facilities available to them which in turn will lower the risk of debt and bad credit which will affect them in later life.",
        "background": "Far too many children are coming out of school with little or no knowledge on how to deal with their personal finances once they get to the necessary age. Children should be taught about the ways in which facilities like overdrafts, credit cards and loans work in order to give them a head start.",
