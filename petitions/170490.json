The same rules should apply for the women in which are accusing them of it. Women who falsely accuse men should get a jail sentence the same as what the man would have got for doing so. ",

In other cases, people who are accused of making false accusations may be prosecuted for wasting police time.\r\n\r\nIt is not therefore clear to us how you would like the law to be changed. \r\n\r\nYou may find this guidance from the Crown Prosecution Service helpful:\r\nhttp://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p_to_r/perverting_the_course_of_justice_-_rape_and_dv_allegations/\r\n"
