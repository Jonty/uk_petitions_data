        "action": "Create a national register of individuals banned from keeping animals.",
        "additional_details": "The current legislation is not fit for purpose.  It is easy for an individual, previously convicted of cruelty to animals, to go out and buy another pet, perpetuating unnecessary suffering and cruelty.  A national register must exist that lists all individuals banned from keeping animals ensuring that their conviction is enforceable, and therefore meaningful.",
        "background": "Bans on keeping animals are currently unenforcible as no national register exists.  This petition argues that a national register should be created listing all individuals who have been convicted of animal cruelty and banned from keeping animals.",
