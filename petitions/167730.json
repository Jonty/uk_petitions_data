        "additional_details": "Businesses in the Kelham Island area are having their trade strangled by new heavy-handed parking measures which make it impossible for employers, employees and customers to park. \r\n\r\nThe many construction developments across Kelham Island have been given free-roam to park as and where they like and forcing Sheffield City Council to enforce parking regulations against residents being able to park within half a mile of their own home. \r\n",
        "background": "We, the people of Sheffield, ask Sheffield City Council to reevaluate these new authoritarian parking restrictions (entire streets of double-yellows) in the Kelham Island are, which have left many unable to park near their homes and others unable to park near their place of work.",
