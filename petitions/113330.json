        "additional_details": "The war in Syria was illegal from the start, sponsoring the so called \"Moderate rebels\" and the \"Free Syrian army\" was a geopolitical risk that was a clear mistake. Only the Great British people can choose the correct Prime Minister to lead us now. This is very urgent as we must take effective action to stop funding terrorism and hold David Cameron accountable for his mistakes.",
