The Government did not address this question directly in its obfuscatory response.",
        "background": "The Government clearly considers this petitions site an irrelevance. Its response to the 2 most-signed petitions (4.2m & 1.9m signatures respectively) were entirely dismissive. A later petition's question was evaded. Rather than maintain this charade, this site's funds should be used elsewhere.",
