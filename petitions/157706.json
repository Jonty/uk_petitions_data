        "action": "Resolve UK's membership of EU before government irreversibly invokes Article 50.",
        "additional_details": "The UK electorate were not told that the referendum would be legally binding. The result therefore provides evidence which can be used to inform MPs and the government.\r\nOf the total UK electorate approximately 37.5% indicated a wish to leave the EU and approximately 62.5% did not indicate a wish to leave the EU.\r\nLeaving the EU is an irreversible step which cannot be overturned at the next election.\r\nThe majority of UK citizens did not vote to leave the EU.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Almost two thirds of the total UK electorate did not vote to leave the EU. The EU referendum result is not legally binding and so government should not seek to impose the result on the UK without the democratic legal ratification of Parliament following a fully informed and factually correct debate.",
