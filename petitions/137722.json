        "additional_details": "Scotland are going to get an in/ out referendum because they voted to stay and the rest of the UK (excluding Northern Ireland who will probably get a referendum too eventually) voted for Brexit. It's only fair Norwich gets the same treatment. ",
        "background": "In the recent UK referendum the population voted to leave the European Union. This vote was not reflective of the population of the city of Norwich, Norfolk where the overall majority vote was to remain and for this reason a referendum should be held to decide whether Norwich remains within the UK.",
