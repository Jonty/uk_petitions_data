        "action": "Hold a second referendum on leaving the EU once exit terms have been negotiated.",
        "additional_details": "During campaigning ahead of the EU referendum, many parties, including politicians and supporters on both sides of the debate, noted that the structure of any agreement to leave was uncertain. The terms that the UK would negotiate with the EU were subject to claim and counter-claim on both sides.\r\n\r\nThe public, therefore, were not aware of the full nature of the 'leave' outcome at that time and should be given the opportunity to vote on again once an agreement with the EU is reached.",
        "background": "On 23rd June 2016, the UK voted to leave the EU. The terms of the departure have yet to be agreed with the EU, and the possibilities vary widely on key issues such as access to the single market and limiting immigration. Once terms are agreed, a second vote should be held to confirm the decision.",
