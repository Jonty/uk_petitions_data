        "action": "Call for parliament to honor the outright ban on fracking in National Parks.",
        "additional_details": "This sudden change of plan is effectively an annulment of the previously agreed upon laws surrounding fracking in the UK. Ministers used a statutory instrument \u2013 a form of secondary legislation \u2013 to push through the new rules, which means legislation can pass into law without a debate in the House of Commons. MPs voted in favour by 298 to 261. Fracking has an enormously detrimental affect on the environment and well-being of it's inhabitants, something so serious needs to be, at least, debated.",
        "background": "The government agreed upon an outright ban on fracking in Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Sites of Special Scientific Interest, World Heritage Sites, and Groundwater Protection Zones but have since utilized a parliamentary loophole to allow themselves to frack 1200 meters below such areas.
