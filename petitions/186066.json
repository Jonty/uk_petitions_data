In the last Parliament, the House showed it could take forward incremental measures - such as allowing peers to retire and enabling peers to be expelled for non-attendance or serious misconduct. More than 50 peers have retired since the facility was introduced. Where there are further measures that can command consensus from across the House, the Government would welcome working with peers to look at how to take them forward.\"\r\n\r\nThe petition and Government response can be found here: \r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/170686\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
