        "additional_details": "\r\nThere is no such thing as a safe slurry tank. Gases are produced by bacteria during the decomposition of slurry, these can kill instantly. The gas settles in a cloud over the top of the slurry during mixing. \r\n\r\nIt stays in these tanks maybe for a number of months and a lethal combination of gases build up, including methane, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and worst of all, probably, hydrogen sulphide.",
        "background": "Slurry is a mixture of manure and water. Waste from animals are stored  during the winter when cattle are kept indoors, to be spread during the warmer months. It has to be broken up & mixed, to be spread. At the mixing stage the odourless & invisible gases are produced that can kill within seconds.",
