        "additional_details": "The effect the media's portrayal of 'perfection' has on young people is that \u2018self worth\u2019 is based solely on an unattainable, generic, no-room-for-difference physical appearance. By passing this simple law stating that an image has been edited, by literally showing that models do not naturally look the way they are presented, we can raise awareness for the true beauty of \u2018imperfections\u2019, individuality and that gorgeous spectrum that is body-size. Reintroduce reality and humanity into the media.",
        "background": "We call for the Government to pass this simple yet awareness-raising law that ensures all edited images must state that they have been tampered with. We also hope to decrease the value that physical appearance has in our society, increasing the value of other qualities that truly make us human.",
