        "additional_details": "A really crucial detail about the  EU referendum has gone virtually unmentioned and it is probably the most crucial detail: Parliament doesn't actually have to bring Britain out of the EU if the public votes for it.\r\n\r\nThat is because the result of the referendum on Britain's EU \r\nmembership is not legally binding. Instead, it is merely advisory, and, in theory, could be totally ignored by UK government. \r\n\r\nI'm starting this petition to get this debated in parliament\r\n",
        "background": "The result of June 23 referendum on Britain's EU membership is not legally binding. It is merely advisory.\r\n\r\nNo legal provision was included in the EU referendum legislation that requires UK Parliament to act in accordance with the outcome of the referendum.",
