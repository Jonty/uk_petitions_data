        "additional_details": "Every young person above the age of 14 should have a say by direct representation or through a responsible representative. Everyone over 80 should have a half vote. \r\nEvidence: see rise of right wing voices, see devaluation of the pound and our exports, see NHS promises broken, see immigration problems, see devaluation of our great nation in the world's eyes, see rich anti-EU leave campaigners making money of the situation and gaining influence, see voices of young people, see stats and surveys",
        "background": "Everyone has seen the problems and devaluation since the last EU vote.At the same time very few of the promises that were made have been upheld.Leaving is the biggest decision in 50 years and will influence everyone.I suggest a vote or similar to indicate a majority of people are still saying yes.",
