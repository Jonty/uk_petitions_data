        "action": "Parliament must refuse permission to invoke Article 50 of the 2007 Lisbon Treaty",
        "additional_details": "It is very clear that the result of the UK referendum has unleashed forces that were not adequately illustrated to the electorate during the referendum campaign. Namely the constitutional break up of the United Kingdom, the undermining of the political process itself, the vast loss of the UK's economic and international political influence. Now that these forces are becoming clear, Parliamentary action is required to preserve our national interest.",
        "background": "Due to the inconclusive result of the 23 June UK Referendum, invoking Article 50 will lead to further political, financial and constitutional crisis. Further consideration needs to be given by Parliament to the full implications of the result and to the potential of a second referendum.",
