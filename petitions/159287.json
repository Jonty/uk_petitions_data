        "additional_details": "As part of upcoming negotiations with the EU, the UK could ask for additional \"EU citizen\" passports to be issued each year, in line with the number of EU immigrants that the UK will accept.\r\n\r\nThe EU could track the total number of UK citizens eligible for free movement status. Applicants would pay an admin fee to retain their \"EU citizen\" status. \r\n\r\nUK citizens who wish to retire in the EU and not contribute with income tax would pay a Health Surcharge, due on residency in their chosen country.",
        "background": "This petition proposes the introduction of a two tier UK passport system, allowing citizens who wish to keep their current free movement rights and status as \"EU Citizens\" to do so.\r\n\r\nA deadline could be set for registering for the scheme before upcoming UK negotiations with the EU.
