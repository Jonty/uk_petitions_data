        "action": "Reinstate A&E, renovate, modernise and expand High Wycombe General Hospital.",
        "additional_details": "Lives are jeopardised by transit times along country roads which are unsuitable for the task and make overtaking ambulances a traffic hazard. There is inadequate infrastructure to service the population, and that of neighbouring towns for whom Wycombe provided a closer A&E option. This petition calls upon the NHS, Wycombe District Council and Wycombe MP Steve Baker to renovate, modernise and expand the General Hospital in Wycombe, and reinstate Wycombe A&E as a flagship for the NHS in Bucks.",
        "background": "High Wycombe is a busy market town and hub for London commuters. As a newer college town its growing population has increased medical needs. Its Accident and Emergency Services were relocated to Stoke Mandeville, Bucks, which is 15.7m away (27 mins via the A413), or 13.2m (26 mins via Hampden Rd).",
