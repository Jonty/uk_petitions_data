It is also sold on Amazon.co.uk and in many independent retailers. \r\n\r\nOne of the options in the game is to select the personality type 'pervert'.\r\n\r\nThe girls are forced into positions of a sexual nature and their expressions are often depicted to be distressed.\r\n\r\nThe game currently has an age rating of 16. I believe this game should be banned as it endorses paedophilia. ",
        "background": "In Gal Gun, players exploit young school children for sexual purposes and also use force to compel the young anime school girls to agree to sexual advances. It deals entirely with making sexual advances on young children. Gal Gun is banned in Australia and New Zealand have recently followed suit.",
