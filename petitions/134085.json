        "action": "Create a cross Party committee to ensure a positive, inclusive exit from the EU",
        "additional_details": "With 48.1% of the UK population voting to remain in the EU this morning many of us have woken up to the shocking news that we are to leave the EU. We need to work together to ensure we build a positive outcome for everyone in the UK, and ensure that all Parties work collaboratively. The Government should urgently commit to a cross Party committee to oversee the implementation plan for the exit of the EU.",
        "background": "Many UK citizens fear that the EU exit will lead to a divided nation, governed by fear, hatred towards migrants, and a reduction in the investment in our public services. We need a moderate and progressive cross Party commitment to unity and hope. We want a urgent commitment to collaboration.",
