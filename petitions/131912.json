We can only accept petitions about matters that the Government or Parliament are responsible for. The Prime Minister of the UK - who chooses the members of a government - is not chosen by the UK Government or Parliament. After a general election, the Queen decides who to invite to form a Government. In practice, this is usually the leader of the political party that wins the most seats in a general election.
