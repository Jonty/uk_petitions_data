        "additional_details": "The toll charge was only originally until bridge is paid off.\r\nThe system can't force foreign drivers to pay and  around 250,000 foreign drivers have not paid since the introduction of the new system in December 2015\r\nThe window to pay is too short.\r\nThe ANPR system fines a lot of people that it shouldn't due to mixing up letters.\r\nThe fine is too much compared to the charge.\r\nThere is no reasonable alternative route.",
        "background": "It's about time we stopped the government from using the Dartford toll as a money making scheme. The toll was originally to pay for the building of the bridge and that was paid off more than 10 years ago. We already pay road tax and that should be more than enough for the upkeep of the bridge!",
