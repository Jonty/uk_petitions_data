        "action": "Remove the Barnett Formula, and give true equality to the United Kingdom",
        "additional_details": "The Barnett Formula was designed as a temporary one year government funding principle but has now persisted for almost 40 years. Before his death, Lord Barnett described the formula as being now, so unfair to the regions of England that he was embarrassed to have his name associated with it. This spend currently equates to the following, an extra \u00a31,623 per head, or 19 per cent, is given to Scotland compared to England. Public spending being 19 per cent higher in Scotland than in England giving rise to for example Free Tuition Fees for Scottish students, this has inevitably resulted in the formula becoming controversial, divisive and morally unsustainable.\r\nIn 2013 Scotland received \u00a310,152 per capita, Wales \u00a39,709 and England \u00a38,529\r\n",
        "background": "This petition proposes the scrapping of the Barnett formula and realigning of funding throughout the regions of the UK to be devised by a body independent of political parties of the UK ",
