        "additional_details": "I have been living in the UK for 8 years. I paid 11K for my MSc studies and have been paying NI and income tax monthly. I have applied for 4 different types of visas (4*\u00a3800 = \u00a33200 visa fee). I am not able to apply for residency yet so another visa application which will cost me over \u00a3800 plus another \u00a3500 NHS surcharge. It seems unfair that as a working wife of a British citizen and mother of a British daughter, I have to pay and an illegal immigrant, doesn't have to pay. ",
        "background": "Some non-EU visa applicants have to pay \u00a3500 NHS surcharge even if they are paying NI and income tax. This includes skilled workers and spouses of British citizens. They don't pay if they are asylum seekers, illegal immigrants or married to EU citizens, even if they have never contributed anything.",
