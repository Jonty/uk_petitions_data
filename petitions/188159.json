        "additional_details": "Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS) 5% of children in divorce or separation will experience some level of parental alienation. In some countries, governments put in place legislation to prevent such behaviour. In Mexico, parents guilty of alienation can receive a 15-year jail term, while in Italy it carries a fine. The UK does not have legislation, judges are starting to recognise parental alienation, leading to some children being removed from the offending parent.\r\n",
        "background": "Parent Alienation is damaging to children's mental and emotional well-being, and can interfere with a relationship of a child and either parent. This can cause a child to be mentally manipulated or bullied into believing a loving parent is the cause of all their problems.\r\n",
