        "additional_details": "100 billion pounds, yes you heard right, 100 billion pounds!!! That money could be supporting the likes of the NHS and other public services which are under funded and desperate for more cash to be injected. We are not a super power and not the Policeman of the world, the likes of the USA will still maintain theirs. A million people still rely on food banks, to spend this sort of money on these weapons is madness. Instead of food banks we could use the money to help folk not kill them.",
        "background": "I am calling for the scrapping of the nuclear replacement for Trident. The 100 billion pounds this will cost can be better spent supporting the likes of the NHS and other public services which are under funded and desperate for more cash to be injected. To spend this on weapons is madness.",
