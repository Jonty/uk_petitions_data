        "action": "A total ban on the sale, import and export of ivory, including pre 1947 pieces.",
        "additional_details": "Under certain circumstances ivory can still be sold, imported and exported in the UK. The truth is that the laws imposed have not been successful in their purpose. Essentially, the police and the judicial system are far too stretched to monitor the trade of each piece of ivory, allowing auctions (online in particular) and market traders to sell ivory items without the correct paperwork allowing illegal pieces to slip through the net. This only fuels the illegal trade and the poaching in Africa. ",
        "background": "Every year tens of thousands of elephants are killed by poachers for their ivory. The slaughter is so severe that it is estimated between the years 2008 and 2013 as many as 50,000 were killed. The killing is brutal. Poachers will shoot the elephant multiple times to kill it, then hack the tusk off.",
