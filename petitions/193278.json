        "action": "Delay the decision to make cuts for specialist medication for rare illnesses.",
        "additional_details": "The level of funding being proposed is much lower then many other treatments, and the decision to make cuts is being rushed through to quickly without taking serious consideration for the families and patients this will impact. By delaying the decision, this will allow patients groups more time to provide evidence that prove that this medication provides a better quality of life and also slows down the illness progressing as quickly as it would without the medication.",
        "background": "Treatments for rare diseases are incredibly difficult to bring to market due to the small patient populations. It means that the cost per patient treated is therefore much higher. This doesn't mean that these individuals don't need the medication which successfully provide a better quality of life.",
