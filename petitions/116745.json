        "action": "Revise the language requirement policy of NMC  registration for non EU nurses.",
        "additional_details": "They have years of invaluable experience behind them and they already have an idea about the know-how's of the healthcare setting. Many of them are already medication trained and taking the responsibility of the patients they look after. Many counties like us use IELTS to test such nurses but have relaxed their rules in recent past, Australia being the latest one. Also when compared to EU nurses these non EU nurses speak much better English & have more command on language. They could be valuable",
        "background": "There are many Non EU qualified nurses who are working as supporting healthcare workers role in the UK because they are unable to get registered with NMC. \r\nHelp to integrate them as proper registered nurses by relaxing laws on IELTS so that can help reduce the shortage of nurses in the country.",
