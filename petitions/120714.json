        "action": "Set a legal target for the power sector to decarbonise by 2030.",
        "additional_details": "The government's own advisors on climate change, the Committee on Climate Change, recommends reducing emissions from power to below 100g CO2/kWh (compared to 450g in 2014) to decarbonise the power sector. Energy investor clarity is also needed for new technologies to develop, and with this development is also the opportunity for new jobs and economic growth. These new technologies are either soon cost competitive with conventional sources or will be by 2030 (such as offshore wind by 2025).   ",
        "background": "A decarbonisation target will virtually eliminate greenhouse gas emissions in electricity. It will ensure that the UK meets its climate targets and presents strong commitment against climate change to other countries, as well as ensuring the government cannot backtrack on climate change mitigation.",
