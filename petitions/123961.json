        "additional_details": "The reason I am bringing this to the for is because I have had a neighbour starting work at 15:00 approx and continuing until 22:00plus for over two months.  I have a son studying for his GCSE exams and we all work and just want to relax.  The other side have young children.  I have asked them to stop earlier and it has fallen on deaf ears with complete denial.  I feel this is a reasonable request that will make life more harmonial whilst still allowing what needs to be done, the time to do it.",
        "background": "We all suffer nuisance neighbours from time to time.  If there is a law then it makes life easier to destinguish right and wrongs.  If there is a 20:00hrs stoppage to mechanical D.I.Y it makes people consider others and what they are putting them through. ",
