        "additional_details": "Moving business rates to VAT will level the playing field for SME's, rather than penalize UK firms for being in the UK. Often mistakenly compared to council tax, business rates are archaic and do not include refuse collection or any other service, and takes precedence over any other bill - it is deemed a statutory debt without any compromise that can lead to businesses filing for bankruptcy.\r\nhttps://www.retail-week.com/topics/5049347.article\r\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3123850",
        "background": "From high-street retailers to SMEs attempting to grow, Business Rates are a burden that can only be overcome by charging more, making them less attractive compared to online retailers and imports. These rates have no bearing on the revenue of a business, and absolutely nothing is provided in return.",
