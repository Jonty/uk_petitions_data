        "additional_details": "You can see yourself when applying for car finance, loans, credit cards, etc if you have a poorer credit rating you are going to be charged more than someone who has a higher credit score. It should be the same for everyone as it isn't fair. Its taking for granted those in a more desperate situation. Its not fair that someone could pay 100 more a month for the same thing, over the same amount of time based on their credit rating. Its extortion, robbery and unfair",
        "background": "It doesn't make sense that people who may of struggled with their financial situation are charged higher interest rates. It makes the poor poorer. Maybe people could get out of their money problems if they werent penalized for having poor credit and charged more than someone who has excellent credit",
