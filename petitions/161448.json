        "additional_details": "There are many people alive today who are able to lead fulfilling and active lives because they had a second transplant. The advice of the clinical community has been ignored, effectively handing most of these patients a death sentence.\r\n\r\nAnthony Nolan shared the story of Emily, who needed a second transplant: \u2018I want to know why the NHS thought my life wasn\u2019t worth fighting for. This could save my life, there was still hope - why didn\u2019t they feel it was necessary to try everything possible?'",
        "background": "In July 2016, NHS England announced that it is no longer routinely funding second transplants for patients with blood cancers and disorders. The judgement comes despite a group of experts, including clinicians and patients, recommending second transplants are funded.",
