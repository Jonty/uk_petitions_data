        "additional_details": "Campaigners increasingly make use of false or misleading information in an attempt to win votes.  It is unreasonable to expect each individual to verify each claim made by the each campaign prior to casting their vote.\r\n\r\nCampaigners should be required to substantiate claims they make by citing reputable sources that can be accessed by the electorate.  An independent body could be created to review claims to confirm their validity and ensure that false claims are withdrawn publicly and swiftly.",
        "background": "We (the undersigned) believe that the electorate should be in possession of the facts before making their decision on how to vote and it therefore should be a requirement of an election/referendum that no false claims are allowed to stand.  This should be a basis principle of an electoral campaign.",
