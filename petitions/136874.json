        "additional_details": "During the EU referendum, Londoners cared more about significant issues such as the potential effect not the economy and trade, rather than deciding to vote based on immigration, false facts and anti-establishment or anti-political party sentiment.

        "background": "Due to major political and cultural disparities that have been highlighted during the EU referendum campaign, there have been demands amongst Londoners for their own devolved government, which would have significant power including some control over economic and immigration related policy.",
