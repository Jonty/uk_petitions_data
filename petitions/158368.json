        "action": "UK Government to stop using the term 'Islamic State' & refer to them as 'Daesh'.",
        "additional_details": "I am a Muslim living in the UK. When I hear the term \"Islamic State\", \"ISIL\" or \"so-called Islamic State\", I wonder why we are assisting the terrorists in their hate campaigns. I find it an insult to hear the term used, as would the 400,000 Muslims that served this land in World War 1 or currently serving in the army. These terrorists are referred to as \"Daesh\" in predominantly Muslim countries. The term \"Islamic State\" is a perversion of a religion, consisting of 23% of the global population.",
        "background": "In the wake of many terrorist attacks around the world, the British Government must not associate the religious beliefs of 3 million UK Muslims with that of a terrorist organisation. Doing so aids hate crimes and the social campaigns of the terrorists. The name \"Daesh\" should be used in parliament.",
