        "additional_details": "For 10 years I've strived for UK residency, but lost a dream job due to an employer not recognising my right to work while my leave was extended under section 3C. This law protects my right to work during visa renewal, but employers often choose British citizens instead. We want the Home Office to issue an official document confirming this right, to help prevent discrimination by employers. The often lengthy visa renewal process can cause unnecessary stress and uncertainty, which could be alleviated by this document.",
