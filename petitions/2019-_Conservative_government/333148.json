        "action": "Create more teachers to teach the Arts in schools.",
        "additional_details": "I am worried and concerned that children\u2019s access to the Arts is declining. \r\nOur research has shown that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find teachers who are trained to teach music, drama, dance, DT and art and design.\r\nTherefore there needs to be more arts teachers, especially when children go back to schools in September. Lockdown has exacerbated educational inequality, especially for students who come from less economically privileged backgrounds and the arts can close that gap.",
        "background": "Between 2010 and 2018 the number of arts teachers has decreased in England\u2019s secondary schools. \r\nSchools need more Arts teachers, not less. This can change by creating a bursary for drama teacher training. There needs to be more incentives to encourage people to train and teach the arts in schools.",
