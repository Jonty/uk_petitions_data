        "additional_details": "The Government paid \u00a320m compensation to owners of the freed slaves under the Act. Nothing was paid to the slaves themselves for their time being kept as a prisoner forced to work. To make compensation payment, a \u00a315m loan was taken out which was not repaid until 2015.\r\n\r\nThis means descendants of slaves who work in the UK up to 2015 actually contributed to clearing the debt that was created because of a payment made to their ancestors' owners, just so that they could be freed. This is ridiculous.",
        "background": "We'd like the Government to refund the tax contributions that helped to clear the Slavery Abolition Act debt up to 2015 to taxpayers who are descendants of slaves owned by British slave owners. We feel it's immoral for descendants of British slaves to have contributed towards clearing this debt.",
