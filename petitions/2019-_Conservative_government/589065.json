        "action": "Make all car insurance  polices government funded for drivers aged 17-25",
        "additional_details": "When young drivers pass their driving test at a young age of 17, the insurance companies are likely to straight away charge a very high price exceeding \u00a31000 before they even start driving their car. This isn't fair as these drivers are not guaranteed to crash their car and those who do not crash their car will have spent all that excess money on the insurance policy for no reason. If the government fund car insurance polices for this age range then life could be less stressful for them.",
        "background": "I want the government to pay for car insurance polices to drivers aged between 17-25, because at these ages drivers are likely to get charged more on their insurance polices than other drivers in the fear that younger drivers may have an accident more often, although this is not always the case.",
