        "additional_details": "Air Weapons accounted for 31% of firearm offences in England & Wales in 2021. Prosecuting offences involving air rifles can be more difficult because most air rifles do not leave identifiable marks on missiles. Air weapons are used to kill/maim wildlife & domestic pets and are used in vandalism/common/serious assaults. Scotland addressed this in 2015 in the Air Weapon and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2015. We need the same in England & Wales so that Police can better protect people by removing air weapons where licences are breached, or have not been obtained.",
        "background": "Make air weapons subject to licensing under the Firearms Act 1968, so these are regulated in a way which protects public safety. Registering the purchase of Air Rifles/ Air Pistols/ Air Guns is not required now. We believe that licensing is needed, with appropriate penalties for licensing failures.",
