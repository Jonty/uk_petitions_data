This damages children and destroys lives. CMS immediately charges the victim and takes months to respond when calculations are wrong (too high), don\u2019t include expenses (mortgage payments, rents and travel) which are forced due to the abuse. Loving parents can find themselves homeless due to miscalculation which take over 6 months to correct.",

CMS should only take the first payment after they have given an opportunity for the paying parent to explain their new expenses as a result of the abuse.",
