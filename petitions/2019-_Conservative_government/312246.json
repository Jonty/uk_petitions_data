        "additional_details": "I'm a final year Film and TV student at University. My course heavily relies on borrowing equipment and going out to record. When corona virus reached the UK and we were all told to stay inside and avoid going out, my University told us that the loans counter and computer labs are closed and we won't be able to use access them. Despite this, the Univeristy is still expecting the products from us, even though many of us are unavailable to complete the projects without the needed equipment.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to postpone the deadlines for University students effected by the Covid pandemic. Not everyone is able to continue their University projects at home, and due to the student's facilities being closed, followed by the lockdown we are unable to produce good quality products.",
