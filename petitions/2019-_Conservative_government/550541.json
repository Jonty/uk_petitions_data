        "additional_details": "Too often, a resignation as a PM means very little, as the MP still holds sway within their own party and know that many of the things they\u2019ve started cannot be changed. If there were the looming possibility of another party having one of their MPs as a PM, this would stop abrupt resignations as this would need to be factored in. This would also allow the public a chance to look at different views and have a vote on who is running the country, rather than a small section of MPs voting on this.",
        "background": "Within the past few years, we have had a lot of Prime Minister resignations, from different parties. Then the new PM is voted in by a minority of people, being those in their own party. I would like to see a general election called when a PM resigns to allow the public to decide on a new PM.",
