        "additional_details": "I would like to start a Petition to Abolish the Welsh Assembly. We are not happy with being governed by Mark Drakeford. Things have got worse over the last 6 months since the Covid 19 situation, the job losses , businesses and livelihoods. Now the alcohol ban at the most crucial time in the hospitality sector has been crippled by this latest rule.\r\nWe would therefore like to start a petition to hand the control back to Westminster.",
        "background": "One in four people voted for the Welsh Assembly. We can overturn this as we are not happy with having different laws to the rest of the U.K. We are all part of Great Britain and Westminster should be in control of our laws not Wales.",
