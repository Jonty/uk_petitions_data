        "additional_details": "I aver that the BBC's primary function is that of a global news Broadcaster, as the founders so wished it to be. This was so true in WW2.  I would like this topic to be debated in Parliament. The BBC should be asked to remove their \u201cgeofencing\u201d restrictions policies, thus allowing global access to United Kingdom's news broadcasts, so that we may all be able to, once again, freely look directly back into our home country's news - wherever we travel, work and choose to live.",
        "background": "In times of crisis it is important that \u201cbroadcasting\u201d is not diminished in any way by restrictive technologies. I want the government to force the BBC to open its \u201cgeo-fenced\u201d UK news services to allow all British citizens working, travelling and living abroad - full and unrestricted access to it.",
