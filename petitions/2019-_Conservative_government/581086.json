        "additional_details": "Being able to communicate in a secure and private manner is imperative in society. People have a right to be able to message, or email other people, with encryption, knowing that their message is safe and no one else should read it. The UK government increasingly wants to break encryption standards or to make companies to include \u201cback doors\u201d where the government can read the communications. Back doors will almost always be used by bad people too.",
