        "additional_details": "Around 26% of global emissions come from food. Most individuals don't have the time to research the environmental impact of their consumables. Implementing this policy will help consumers make more environmentally friendly choices and put pressure on companies to develop products that are better for the planet. In addition, the need for companies to assess environmental impact will result in a boom of jobs in the environment sector. Britain will lead the world in enabling green consumer choices.",

In a similar way, details such as mean equivalent carbon emissions, land use, water use, ecological impact and resulting pollution should be clearly visible on the front of consumer goods packaging.",
