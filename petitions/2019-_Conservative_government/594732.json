        "additional_details": "Excess alcohol use affects around 20% of the population, is responsible for 1 million hospital admissions a year, thousands of deaths a year and increases vulnerability to many other life-threatening physical and mental health problems. It's estimated that dependent drinkers occupy 1 in 10 of NHS beds but budgets for alcohol treatment have been cut over recent years. Some health-related information on labels is voluntary and the industry contributes nothing to treatment - we think they should.",
