Under the Code, MPs are also required to \"observe the general principles of conduct identified by the Committee on Standards in Public Life in its First Report as applying to holders of public office\" (the Nolan Principles). We're therefore not clear how the change your petition calls for would achieve the outcome the petition suggests.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about the MPs Code of Conduct here: https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmcode/1882/188202.htm#_idTextAnchor000\r\n\r\nYou could have a petition calling for lying to be made an explicit breach of the Code of Conduct, to enable such behaviour to be investigated and acted upon, if that is something you'd like to see happen.\r\n\r\nYou might like to sign this petition which calls for a related action:\r\n\r\nCreate a new body to review & oversee the Code of Conduct for MPs and sanctions: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/616356"
