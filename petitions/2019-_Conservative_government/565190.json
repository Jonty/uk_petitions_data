        "additional_details": "Today 41,385 people tested positive for covid-19 and a further 357 people have died. Millions of people are under a tier 4 lockdown but keeping schools and colleges open won't bring the cases down enough for the tier system lockdowns to be effective. Closing schools and colleges for a minimum of 4 weeks will not only help to reduce the numbers but also protect those that are vulnerable. The new variant is rapidly spreading and I fear keeping the schools open will spread it even faster",
        "background": "Reclose schools and colleges due to increase in COVID-19 cases and the new variant. We are seeing cases of students and teachers catching the virus since schools have reopened and a new variant is rapidly increasing across London and the East/South East of England",
