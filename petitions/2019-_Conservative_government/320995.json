        "additional_details": "As an example I have to get 4 buses a day to travel to and from school, added up this would range from \u00a3120-150 a month in fees. Minimum wage for an under 18 would not add up to this much so how are they expect to pay? If you want them to pay, up the minimum wage so it can be afforded! Many families struggle and have to have free school meals to help tackle their financial problems, travel fees would be an inconvenience to their bills at the end of the month as this money could have gone to bills.",
        "background": "Travel should remain free for under18s! Many families can not afford a car to take their child to school let alone pay hundreds of pounds a month for tfl. Seeing this charge would reduce the amount of children in school as their parents may not be able to afford to send them on a bus!",
