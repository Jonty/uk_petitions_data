My wife can't go back to work whilst our baby is still in hospital & has never been home. We can't claim disability or carers allowance as our baby has never left hospital since birth. We could lose everything after March due to this bill being delayed.\r\n",
        "background": "The government has agreed to introduce neonatal leave and pay entitlement but not until April 2023, this is completely unacceptable & it needs implementing immediately.\r\n \r\nOur baby was born in June 2021 at just 24 weeks gestation, he wasn't due until October,  he was 16 weeks early.",
