        "additional_details": "Around 7,500 horses leave racing annually. An industry study found that two years after leaving racing, over 11% of them were reported dead and over 31% could not be accounted for. \r\n\r\nA tax on race horse breeders, owners, trainers, bloodstock companies, racecourses and bookmakers would raise the necessary funds to care for horses who leave racing, and ensure that they are not slaughtered.",
        "background": "Horses from the British and Irish racing industries are slaughtered in Great Britain because the racing industry will not provide for them. A tax should be imposed on the racing industry which would be used to fund the care of horses who leave racing, ensuring that they are not prematurely killed.",
