        "additional_details": "In my office, we dont sit at the same workstation everyday. Keyboards, mice, chairs and desks are all shared by a team of 50+ and my office will not be the only one. Some employees are being asked to self isolate for 7 days when the government recommendation clearly states it should be 14 days. Employees are worried that they will get infected while at work and end up passing it on to their kids unknowingly when they get home. This is a serious issue and requires adequate and serious action.",
        "background": "Closing offices and call centres helps delay the quick spreading virus from infecting large groups of people at the same time and puts employees at less risk. Introduce methods of working from home or at least deep cleaning offices and reopening when everyone has tested negative for COVID-19",
