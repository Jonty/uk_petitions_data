        "additional_details": "The very small amount of leave that is given to new fathers contributes to a culture of unbalanced responsibility in child-rearing between mothers and fathers - this has contributed to a reduced ability of mothers to progress in their careers, and the gender pay-gap.\r\n\r\nA consultation called Good Work Plan: Proposals to support families was established by the UK government and closed in October 2019, yet the results have not yet been published.",
        "background": "To progress towards more equitable child rearing and working lives for parents, we want an increase in standalone paternity leave from 2 weeks to 12 weeks that is adequately compensated through statutory paternity pay at 90% of the father\u2019s/partner\u2019s salary for the first 4 weeks and 50% for 8 weeks.",
