        "additional_details": "\"Using menu labels to limit calories was related to binge eating among women and was associated with more weight-related concerns, dieting, and unhealthy weight control behaviors among both women and men\" Larson et al., 2018\r\n\r\nMental health services in the NHS are already hugely stretched. Calorie labeled menus will not only worsen the mental state of those currently seeking help for eating disorders but will increase the number of suffers. \r\n\r\nThis spike in demand for MH services is avoidable.",
        "background": "I am asking the Government to retract the idea of adding calories to restaurant and bar menus. I have had disordered eating my entire adult life and have just got a hold on it. Adding calories to menus would bring my disordered eating back, and worsen the mental health state of thousands.",
