        "additional_details": "Racism is steeped heavily in ignorance. It is very easy to see yourself as superior to another man if you believe that you were the originator of everything good and modern in the world while he was historically nothing more than a slave. Educating people about black history contextualises the human experience and gives common ground between both white and black students. It would break down cultural barriers and diminish false stereotypes of black people being \u201cpoor and underdeveloped\u201d",
        "background": "The Government should change the National history curriculum to encourage schools to include more aspects of Black History. It is an often under looked part of world history and deserves to be integrated into the teaching of our students, particularly in a multicultural nation like Britain.",
