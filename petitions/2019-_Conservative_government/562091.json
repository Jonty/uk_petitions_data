Because Kent has now been placed in Tier 3 of the restrictions we cannot have our guests for a reception to celebrate our marriage. Not only are we devastated but our florist and caterers are losing out on crucial business. With only 15 guests allowed there would only be a maximum of 20 tests needed per wedding.",
