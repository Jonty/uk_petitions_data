        "additional_details": "With the rise in children with special educational needs, we believe classroom assistants are an essential part of education, offering specialised educational support on a one to one basis or a small group. Some teaching assistant contracts are being offered on a part-time only basis, with only term time hours paid around minimum wage. This can mean low wages across the year and can contribute to a poorer standard of living.",
        "background": "I think zero hour and term-time only contracts should be prohibited for teaching assistants. Fair employment legislation is needed to protect the rights for classroom assistants across the education system. All contracts should include paid annual leave.",
