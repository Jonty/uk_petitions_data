        "additional_details": "Year 10 and year 12 are now dealing with the consequences of school closures. Some of these children are stressed and unwell and are trying to work through this period . They should receive discretion for their examinations as they are \u2018key\u2019 academic years and are now trying to work through this period but will inevitably have \u2018gaps\u2019 in their learning ; children will go back to school/college and be at very different levels of learning . This can be prevented by alternative assessment in 2021.",
        "background": "Due to COVID-19 school/college closures ,students in both the current year 10 and year 12 are still expected to complete their 2021 key examinations (A-Level and GCSE) however these students should be allowed discretion for these exams : they should be assessed on their class grades .",
