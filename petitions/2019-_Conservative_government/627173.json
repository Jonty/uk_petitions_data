        "additional_details": "The cost of living crisis affects us all, but not equally. Research shows workers from ethnically diverse backgrounds are nearly twice as likely to have been told they won\u2019t be getting a promised pay rise this year due to inflation. Furthermore, 67% of racially diverse working professionals believe that a white colleague doing the same job is on a higher salary.\r\n \r\nEthnically diverse workers are more likely to experience stagnant wages and therefore more likely to experience economic hardship.\r\n",
        "background": "We need to make businesses accountable for their pay disparities. Since mandatory gender pay gap reporting was introduced, pay disparities between men and women have started to decrease. We are now calling for mandatory ethnicity pay gap reporting to try and do the same for the ethnicity pay gap.",
