        "additional_details": "Parliament has created new rules each day that delay and stop the economy from opening. The evidence is there to see that whilst this is a horrible disease, this does not affect the majority of people within the UK and blanket measures have placed the burden on those in society that are least at risk. We have suffered enough under rules and legislations designed to stop the spread which haven't worked and leave us with ruined lives, deaths, depression and economic ruin for generations to come",
        "background": "Have a debate and create a law that requires the goverment to publish the number of people that must be vaccinated before we can re-open the economy. Once this number is hit then the law requires the government to open up every sector of the economy.",
