        "additional_details": "University students across the UK want restrictions scrapped specifically online learning because 1) we are paying 9K+ in tuition fee costs plus accommodation costs (where applicable) to realise our learning experience is still online compared to other education establishments; FE Colleges and schools. 2) because despite the government saying in debate that the \u201cquality of learning and/or teaching is the same\u201d it clearly is not. It is an injustice to all students of HE that we are ignored.",
        "background": "University students would like the Government to consider heavily the proposition of scrapping restrictions, specifically that of online learning especially in an environment where we are paying an incredulous amount, only to be learning through a computer screen.",
