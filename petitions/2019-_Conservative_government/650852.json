        "additional_details": "I want to ban backyard breeders, not just anyone should be able to breed dogs simply because they need money. Every breeder should be accountable with compulsory licensing and regulations enforced to stop poor genetics and the flooding of rescues with unwanted dogs. Many jobless people breed dogs for money and it\u2019s always the dogs that suffer, we must put a stop to this as a country of dog lovers. This is the only way to protect dogs in the future",
        "background": "I want the UK Government to Ban backyard breeding of all breeds of dogs. We need to protect dogs and make breeders accountable and follow strict guidelines. We need more enforcement to protect dogs from the people using them to make money. Compulsory licensing is needed now",
