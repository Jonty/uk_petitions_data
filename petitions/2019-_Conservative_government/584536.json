        "additional_details": "The UK has access to over 400 million doses of various covid vaccines. We should take into consideration the size of the UK population and the struggle globally to attain vaccines across the world as third world countries struggle to afford the purchase of measures of protection from covid. Obviously time will be taken as the UK population is vaccinated but any amount left must be shared globally or else we risk endangering exposed populations, like India, who struggle to control and stop the outbreak of coronavirus.",
        "background": "The UK government must discuss the steps that can be taken to help battle covid globally and asses what steps the UK can take to help other countries reduce the damages caused by covid on other countries. This petition is to bring into conversation the way we can use our privilege for good.",
