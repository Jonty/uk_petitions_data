No practice now seems to be working with the NHS. I have been left with no other option but to enroll us at a private clinic after nearly 2 years of no dentist check-ups.\r\nI was shocked when they give me the initial start-up costs, which were more than 3 times higher than usual for the same services on the NHS.",
        "background": "I am concerned that families will suffer and general dental care will deteriorate amongst the population. \r\nPlease make it mandatory for all private dentists to offer priority to NHS services, most of us cannot afford private dentist services.",
