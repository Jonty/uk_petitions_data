        "additional_details": "We believe an urgent review of CAFCASS is crucial to uphold children's rights, ensure transparency, improve system functioning, restore public trust, and adhere to international standards.\r\n \r\nA review could identify any issues, such as biases or operational flaws, and inform any necessary reforms for better child representation in court, safeguarding their welfare.\r\n \r\nWe think a review could also enhance accountability, allow existing concerns to be addressed, and demonstrate the Government's commitment to the children involved in family court cases.\r\n",
        "background": "I urge the Government to conduct an urgent review of the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS), and implement any necessary reforms to address issues identified. This could include new training requirements, enhanced monitoring of case handling, and new guidance for staff.",
