We have guide dogs for people with physical disabilities. Legally recognising and developing a policy and programme to train emotional support dogs can only help to improve and mitigate against detrimental effects to someone's MH & Wellbeing. Animals have been proven to help with a person's overall wellbeing. It is about time we were given the same rights.",

Equalities office say \"there's no intention to change this for animals to be trained & legally recognised for people with Mental Health (MH) conditions\". Thus discriminating people living with MH illnesses.",
