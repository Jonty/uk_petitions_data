        "additional_details": "It seems unfair that people can get on public transport and in taxis, but people cannot conduct driving tests in sterilised cars, with only 2 people both who are wearing PPE. \r\nKey workers are struggling day to day with their jobs and we are all reliant on having these tests when they have been booked to be able to do our jobs. The last lockdown the DVSA conducted driving tests for key workers, it only seems fair in an unknown situation that this is done again.",
        "background": "Many of us are struggling with employment and being able to travel. Driving tests for key workers are essential during this lockdown. There has been no priority for any key workers during this pandemic. We have had multiple tests cancelled at short notice and received no priority in rebooking.",
