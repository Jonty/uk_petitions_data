        "additional_details": "The wearing of facemasks appears to have become optional in some quarters and this places staff and other service users at risk. The use of a lanyard is flawed as these can be purchased online. \r\nIt is also the case that some people cannot be bothered to wear them. The staff of retail outlets are instructed not to challenge for fear of repercussions as they have no legislative back up.",
        "background": "1) Introduce legislation that ensures all persons wear facemasks whilst in retail outlets including members of staff. \r\n2) Empower retail staff to challenge those refuse to wear a mask. \r\n3) Issue a certificate for those genuinely unwell who cannot wear a mask.",
