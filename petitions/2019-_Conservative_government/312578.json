        "additional_details": "The government has took into consideration A-level and GCSE students, however they have not considered university students. This is a very difficult time for many people and adding the stress of university studies has given a lot of anxiety and de-motivated students. Furthermore this will disrupt future plans and careers people have set out. Many changes have occurred which students have not been prepared for and all occurring at once which is very overwhelming.",
        "background": "Allow automatic passes for all university students for this year due to the virus. No one has considered the stress this virus has caused for students. We are expected to continue our studies from home which is extremely difficult and unfair to base our grades in these circumstances.",
