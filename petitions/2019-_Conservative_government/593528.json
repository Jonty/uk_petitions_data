        "additional_details": "The situation in which the UK Government is not accepting the EU Covid Certificate for entry to the UK by travellers from the EU (unless they are registered with a GP in the UK) presents an unwarranted barrier to UK citizens resident in the EU, most of whom are not registered with a UK GP, but who are free to travel to any other EU country on presentation of the EU Certificate. We ask that this barrier be removed.",
