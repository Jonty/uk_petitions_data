        "additional_details": "The current circumstances present an opportunity to request airlines to reduce their emission intensity, to help the UK conform to the UN Paris Agreement. This needs to include actual commitments to reducing emissions rather than just offsetting. Worse crises than the one we\u2019re living through could happen if we don\u2019t take action to create a sustainable future.",

Currently the government don\u2019t include international flights in the UK carbon budget, and not enough is being done to reduce emissions from this sector.",
