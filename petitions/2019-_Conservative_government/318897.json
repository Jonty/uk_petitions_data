        "additional_details": "Carers and essential workers are frightened and already have very limited availability to PPE. They are relying on donations of homemade PPE and have limited access to regulated PPE. These people have no access to testing for Covid 19 and have very few medical services since the centralisation of many hospital services. People are living in fear in rural areas and it is causing much mental health issues and anxiety.",
