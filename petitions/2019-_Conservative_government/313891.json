These numbers are also disproportionate to the rest of the UK with England and Wales seeing a collective increase of only 17%. It is clear from this statistic that the current laws are not working effectively, especially in Scotland. In a fair democratic system, the Scottish Government should have the power to change away from the current policy to better protect its people.",
