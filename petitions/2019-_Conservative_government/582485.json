The combined weight calculation of 3500kg MAM could be reconsidered to current vehicle weights and safety capabilities as these have changed since 1997.",
        "background": "Driving licences issued after 1997 no longer automatically include BE towing entitlement.\r\nThe current laws don't make sense eg. I can pull a caravan or a trailer in a fiesta but not in a safer 4x4 due to weight restrictions in the current laws. Either BE should apply for all trailer towing or none.",
