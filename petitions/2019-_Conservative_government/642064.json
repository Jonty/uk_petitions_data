They pay annual fees to ensure their cats are vaccinated. Cat owners have their cats microchipped to ensure that these loved feline members of the family can be returned in the event of such unfortunate circumstances. They are microchipped for a reason.\r\n\r\nWith a change in the law, it is our hope that drivers may be more cautious and think twice about their driving behaviour.",
