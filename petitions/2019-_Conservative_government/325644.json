Schools and staff already do more than simply \u201ctolerate\u201d diversity.\r\n \r\nTeachers should appreciate and celebrate differences. By thinking passed the tolerance paradigm, we should be closer to reflecting modern society.\r\n \r\nThe Government must take responsibility for the terminology used in employee materials, training programs and in speech. Replacing the word \u201ctolerance\u201d in the Teachers\u2019 Standards is one step towards this.",
        "background": "Although \u201ctolerance\u201d is considered to be a politically correct term, it is time to review its use in the Teachers' Standards due to the connotation that there is something about our students/colleagues\u2019 rights, faiths and beliefs that teachers are to \u201cput up with\u201d.",
