        "additional_details": "Certain titles are able to be inherited by a female in their own right, but many cannot be implemented nor inherited by a female unless they get married or have a son. This we believe is outdated, forming the old misogyny of men owning property over women. This has previously had cross-party support in Parliament but has not progressed. We see no reason why. For a well-known example, Princess Charlotte will not be able to become a Duchess in her own right until she marries. We see no reason why.",
        "background": "Previously discussed and supported in Parliament under the Hereditary Titles (Female Succession) Bill. Enable all titles, inherited or gifted, to be owned by women in their own right. Women should not need to be married or have a son instead to stable their ownership of a title or land.",
