Why can\u2019t we go back to face to face as it is less risk? \r\nLike I said GP surgery\u2019s are using covid as a scape goat and it feels like patients are getting neglected.",
        "background": "Ever since covid the GP\u2019s have been doing telephone calls and very rarely face to face. This needs to change back to face to face no matter what. This has lead to loads of misdiagnosed cases and missed information. It feels like the surgery\u2019s are using covid as a smoke screen to do less interaction",
