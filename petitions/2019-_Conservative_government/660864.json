        "additional_details": "The cost of living accommodation at university can be extortionate. The minimum maintenance loan often does not cover the full costs. Students who come from low income families are able to receive a higher maintenance grant. Students whose parents earn more than a certain amount have to take the minimum grant - they cannot apply for more - this is unfair. Students should be given the choice. They should be able to take informed decisions, with parental advice, they are adults.",
        "background": "Students can apply for a full tuition fee loan for university - it is not means tested. The maintenance loan should be the same, students should be able to apply for the amount they feel they would need. Penalising children of high income parents is not fair. They are not dependents at 18.",
