        "action": "Ban the sale of all animals from pet shops and third-party sellers",
        "additional_details": "Many animals are bred on a massive scale to supply pet shops and other sellers. These animals are often kept in cramped, unsanitary, and unsuitable conditions, behind closed doors. They are dispatched to retailers across the UK, which can involve long stressful journeys as well as sickness, injuries, and fatalities, and there is no transparency regarding the origin of pets for sale in shops. The ban on the third party-sale of puppies and kittens should therefore be extended to all animals.",
        "background": "Lucy\u2019s Law is a step forward in tackling the issue of unscrupulous breeding and selling of puppies and kittens, but there is a need to extend these rules to other animals. Rabbits, small mammals, reptiles, fish and birds need to be protected too.",
