        "additional_details": "Aircrew have a hard enough job staying hydrated, moisturised and healthy. While non-passengers, such as aircrew, are permitted to take food and drink into security restricted areas for personal use during their work shift, subject to certain conditions, the liquid restrictions are still too strict and we believe other countries have more relaxed rules. This affects daily lives for food products containing liquids which do not meet these conditions and so cannot be taken through security to the aircraft. Aircrew already have access to the flight deck and other sensitive areas therefore the regulations surely don\u2019t have much point in preventing incidents.",
        "background": "The Government should remove restrictions on the volume of liquids operating aircrew are permitted to take through screening security.",
