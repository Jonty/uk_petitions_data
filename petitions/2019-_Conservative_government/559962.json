Facilities have ensured the highest level of cleanliness, hygiene and santisation as well ensuring social distancing throughout. We feel they should be allowed to continue to participate in their organised sports activities e.g. gymnastics, trampolining, dance etc. Strong evidence exists showing a 20-30% reduction in depression in individuals who participate in physical activity daily.
