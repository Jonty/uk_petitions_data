        "additional_details": "Displaying such signs should encourage road users to use all available lanes and merge in turn instead of queuing in one lane, which can cause dangerous blockages at junctions and roundabouts.\r\n \r\nWe think this will reduce incidents of road rage - this happens when some road users attempt to use all lanes and merge in turn as recommended in the Highway Code only for other road users to position their vehicle in a way that restricts their progress. This can be dangerous. Road rage can also occur because people queuing feel road users using all lanes and merging in turn are somehow jumping the queue.\r\n \r\nWe think these changes will make the roads safer for all.\r\n",
