Bank Holidays can give people more time for recreational activities and provide wealth and employment for retail, hospitality, wholesale and tourism industries. \r\nOther countries worldwide are entitled to many more public holidays, including: Spain-14, Finland-15, Slovakia-13. The EU average is 12 days, which we are no where near!",

England and Wales have just 8 Bank Holidays, whilst Scotland have 9 and Northern Ireland 10.",
