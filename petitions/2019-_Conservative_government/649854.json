        "additional_details": "It is illegal to use privately owned e-scooters in public places, including roads and pavements, but many people do so, including under 18s. People using e-scooters often drive dangerously in traffic and on pavements, and there have been several cases of pedestrians being knocked over by e-scooter users. We believe all use of e-scooters in public places should be banned, in the interests of public safety.",
        "background": "We want the Government to ban all e-scooters in public spaces, including the current hire schemes, with on the spot fines for anyone using an e-scooter in a public place. We also want it to be illegal for under 18s to buy or own an e-scooter.",
