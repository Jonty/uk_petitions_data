        "additional_details": "It is important for the government to do this so that British citizens returning from Bulgaria can get back to work as soon as possible without having to quarantine for two weeks. Taking away quarantine for people returning from Bulgaria should not be a problem, as Covid infection rates there have been low - even lower than a lot of the countries which are included on the list. Many people book holidays or go to see family in Bulgaria, so this is not an unreasonable ask.",
        "background": "The list of countries you can visit this summer without quarantining when you return to the UK has been published, but does not include Bulgaria. It should be added to the list, as it has low infection rates and many people want to go back this summer to see family.",
