The review published its report in 2022, and the Government responded in 2023. You can find out more about this review, and reads its report and the Government's, here: https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/independent-review-of-childrens-social-care\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
