        "additional_details": "Africa and the East has been extremely important to the history of human civilisation. They made the greatest leaps in developments in the sciences/maths of any civilisation, only to have their progress wiped out by the Dark Ages. Africa and the East barely enters the British curriculum, and when it does it is usually when we are taught about western interference and investment, or politicianry (and even then the realities are not taught in detail at all, or unless History is taken as an option).",
        "background": "Improve the curriculum so that the only time Africa / the East ever enters is not as a source of politicians for the west, in a whitewashed version of Ancient Egyptian history, or some modern geography about the sociopolitical problems and wars in those areas. This is simply unacceptable.",
