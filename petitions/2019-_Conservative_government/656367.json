        "additional_details": "I think the Government should legislate so that landlords must provide discounts for single occupant tenants. I think many working individuals, who live on their own, are completely overlooked in society. Single occupants are expected to pay the same rates for rent as 2+ more occupants. This can mean single occupants have less opportunities to save money and end up working more hours to generate income in order to cover the rising rates of cost of living. This is inequality.",
        "background": "Single occupants are expected to pay the same rates as couples / 2+ income households. Consequently, many single occupants spend a higher proportion of their income on outgoings for rent, effectively being penalised for not cohabiting.",
