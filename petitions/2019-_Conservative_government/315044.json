        "additional_details": "Businesses above 51k can still be small to medium businesses. Our rateable value is 57k but still a small business. There is a huge void of businesses not getting help and helping those over 51k is crucial as they pay higher rates, tax and VAT. There needs to be more cash grants available for businesses over 51k up to 100k. If not tens of thousands will go bust causing a massive negative impact on the economy in the long term",
        "background": "We are a bar/nightclub and have being forced to close with no income. Youve given cash grants to businesses who pay little to no business rates yet the ones like us who pay high rates valued above 51k rate value have being left out to dry. The banks havent helped us and our insurance refuse to pay.",
