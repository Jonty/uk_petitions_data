        "additional_details": "Given the recent news regarding XL Bully dogs it seems the ban is inevitable despite many disagreeing with the decision. Myself and many other owners have put countless hours into training our dogs. We believe not all of these dogs needs to be on a lead and muzzled. Many XLs have been well socialised and exposed to different environments, and we believe are safe to the public. It is unfair to the dogs and owners who have really put time and effort into raising beautiful well mannered dogs.",
        "background": "I believe owners should be able to pay for a Government recognised independent assessor to come out and see if a dog should be subject to any new requirements to be muzzled and on a lead in public places. I believe restricting the freedom of dogs to socialise and explore away detrimental to them.",
