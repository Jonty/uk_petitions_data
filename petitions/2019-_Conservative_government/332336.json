        "action": "Change student loans interest from compound to a fixed percentage from start",
        "additional_details": "The current system punishes students who want to go into lower paying jobs. Not only do they arguably get less value for money from their tuition fees, but will end up paying back debt over a longer period of time, and pay back more. It seems unfair that earning less has knock-on financial effects throughout your life. Changing the system to having the interested calculated the moment the degree finishes at a fixed value at least means that people who need longer to pay it back, pay the same amount.",
        "background": "Currently student debt increased with an interest of RPI +3% every year. The issue is that graduates who go into lower paying jobs end up paying back more over their lifetimes due to the accumulation of interest. Having a fixed value, say 15%, calculated the moment your degree finishes avoids this.",
