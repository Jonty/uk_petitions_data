Regardless of actual causes and results, the UK public believe that the failure of the Track and Trace program was an unwarranted, unacceptable and profligate waste of an enormous amount of public money. The UK public want to know where this huge sum of public money has gone to. The UK public deserve to know how and where their hard-earned taxes have been applied. The UK public deserve to know if there has been any improper application of public money. These needs can only be met by a full and independent public enquiry.",
