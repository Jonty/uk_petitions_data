The reason why I feel it would be much more efficient because there is a lack of public trust in the Government and Parliament .With our ever changing environment Assembly members are from all walks of life with no political agenda helping to lay down the foundations for decisions to be made, I feel it would have a better public acceptance and understanding .",
