        "additional_details": "Camping and living out in the wild is part of the heritage of all mankind, a law prohibiting it across the country is unnatural. Some may be happy to say goodbye to those days however many others feel that there is a freedom in departing from the modern world and living as we have been for the majority of human existence. Unfortunately those that enjoy this are restricted from this freedom due to lines drawn on a map. It should be the right of everyone to freely roam the country we call ours.",
        "background": "Reinstate Freedom to Roam across England, it is unnatural that we are restricted from going exploring England's beautiful scenery due to arbitrary boundaries. The UK has beautiful scenery and landscapes, it is a shame that this barrier to entry for some of these sights should be in place.",
