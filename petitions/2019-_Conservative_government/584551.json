        "action": "Now is the Time - to share vaccine doses with other countries",
        "additional_details": "A high proportion of UK citizens have been vaccinate. Meanwhile other countries vaccination programs have hardly begun or are going slowly for lack of doses. The WHO and others say 'we are not safe until all are safe'. The government says it will share surplus doses, without defining what this means or when it will happen. It is time to give doses to other countries, even if this means slowing our own program. It is the only humane thing to do, as well as ultimately benefiting the UK.",
        "background": "The UK has sufficient vaccine doses to immunise it's population against Covid19 and is even preparing for a booster 3rd dose. It is now urgent to share doses with countries who have been less able to secure them, to help stop the spread of the disease and development of variants of the virus.",
