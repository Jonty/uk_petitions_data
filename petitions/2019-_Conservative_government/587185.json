        "additional_details": "Leaseholder law means leaseholders face crippling waking watch  building insurance costs. They must also pay towards cladding, missing fire breaks, faulty fire doors etc. Having bought apartments in good faith, following correct legal process, they face ruinous costs through no making of their own. \r\n\r\nMental stress, depression and unable to sell, lives have been put on hold and their personal stories are heartbreaking. \r\n\r\nThey deserve a full and independent inquiry into how this happened.",
        "background": "Figures suggest 1.9 million leaseholders are now considered \"mortgage prisoners\". Government blames builders, builders blame building regulation, inspectors blame builders. Innocent leaseholders have a right to know who was responsible for one of the greatest building scandals in UK history.",
