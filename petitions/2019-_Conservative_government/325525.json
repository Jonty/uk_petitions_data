        "additional_details": "The British government must take full responsibility for its colonialist and imperialist past. Robert Clive raided and plundered India during the late 1750s on behalf of the British Empire. His two terms of administration in Bengal were full of misrule, despotism, bribe-taking and misuse of power. The only type of society that would continue to overlook his unethical behaviour 263 years on is one that is mercenary and imperialistic.",
        "background": "Robert Clive brutally pillaged and looted India in the late 1750s on behalf of the British Empire. If we continue to have this statue erected it shows that the British government glorifies and memorializes a treasonous government whose founding principle was the expansion of a barbaric empire.",
