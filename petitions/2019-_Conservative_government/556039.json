        "additional_details": "Breeding of animals often involves forced and repeated impregnation and artificial insemination, control over a gentle being's entire life, taking away their free will, and removing their offspring to be kept in captivity or slaughtered.\r\n \r\nThe way the industry operates has been termed as rape and murder by some animal rights organisations. There is clear recorded evidence in the UK documentary Land of Hope and Glory. Please end these unnecessary, violent practices.",
        "background": "We believe Animal Farming and Fishing are inherently abusive industries where sentient, innocent and gentle beings are treated totally inhumanely. Plant-based and lab cell technology means that there is absolutely no need to breed or slaughter sentient animals.",
