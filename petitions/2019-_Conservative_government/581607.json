        "additional_details": "The pandemic has highlighted an ecological crisis it has helped exacerbate. With single-use PPE being used at an unprecedented rate, we are compounding the plastic problem, which is having a profoundly negative effect on our planet, in our oceans, and is now making its way into our food.\r\n\r\nThe devastating effects of continuing down our current path will be felt by everyone. For the sake of our children and future generations, we must act now!",
        "background": "With biodegradable plastic becoming much more prevalent, now is the time to transform the NHS, making them leaders in the fight against ecocide by replacing all single-use plastic PPE. PPE aprons, masks and gloves would be an easy first move, followed by transfusion bags, syringes and tubing.",
