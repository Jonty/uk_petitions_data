        "additional_details": "We call on Government to:-\r\n\r\n1.  To make funding  available to medical and veterinary practices,  pharmacies, and hospitals to enable them to take back and recycle all blister packs.\r\n\r\n2.  To make pharmaceutical companies take responsibility for their waste under the Extended Producers Responsibility regulations and fund recycling initiatives.\r\n\r\n3.  To accelerate the pharmaceutical industry's introduction of more sustainable packaging.",
        "background": "According to Statista (2023) the top 3 drugs prescribed in 2021/22 totalled 126 million items (definition - each time a product appeared on a prescription). \r\nFew recyclers accept the waste and at present Supadrug pharmacies (using Terracycle) will only accept an individual's own used packs.",
