        "additional_details": "Many puppies are being sold in poor health or with undetected congenital health defects by unscrupulous breeders without any record of veterinary checks.  Many puppies are also being bought by hasty or inexperienced buyers without recommended viewings with mum or a verifiable dam.  A mandatory vet check record including health status of pup, presence of mum, and verifiable identifiers of pup and mum including microchip numbers, breed, sex, colour, and contact details of breeder and licensed vet would provide a stronger level of protection and reassurance to puppy buyers regarding poorly bred puppies and dishonest breeders. Welfare standards of puppies bred and their mums would also increase due to mandatory 'Pup with Mum' vet check records to be included with puppy sales.",
        "background": "New legislation should be passed to require all puppies sold under the age of legal import (currently 15 weeks) to have a written veterinary health check record from any licensed UK vet where mum is also presented and vet-checked for general health and likelihood as the legitimate dam.",
