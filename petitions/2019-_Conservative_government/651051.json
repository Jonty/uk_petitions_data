        "additional_details": "The reason behind creating this petition is individuals who do not qualify for the \"Skilled Worker visa\" due to taking the risk of being self-employed and finding themselves having to leave the country 2 years after graduating. Such people can have a high potential for the economy based on their education and their businesses may grow and provide further jobs for the economy. Currently after 2 years, these people have to leave the UK and build these businesses elsewhere.",
        "background": "We would like to see an option for visa extension off the back of the Graduate Visa to allow self-employed people the right to stay and work. The Visa could be extended on an annual basis based on certain criteria, such as NI paid, or a tax threshold.",
