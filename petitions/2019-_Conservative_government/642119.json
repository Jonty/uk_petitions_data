Without the working class (which is the majority) they money wouldn't be there. I'm fed up with you spending my money on things I do not get a say in!!! Moving the barge to a central location, to enable MPs to use it as & when they need to, would save us millions. It would highlight those that are there for the people & those that are there for \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3!",

This will cut out need for subsidised meals, expenses on 2nd homes & save \u00a3millions each year. If its good & safe for migrants, it's good & safe for all humans!",
