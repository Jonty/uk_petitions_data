        "action": "Mandate standard fuel be ethanol-free & allow lower VAT for fuel with ethanol",
        "additional_details": "New research suggests that bioethanol production can contribute to increased levels of CO2, which stem from the farming of the crops used for biofuel and it's transportation from where it is produced to where it is used. When the vehicle burns the fuel it can also cause damage to the vehicle thus lowering overall fuel efficiency. Therefore any mitigation of CO2 emissions from using the fuel is cancelled out. \r\n \r\nIgnoring this ethanol issue means we could be doing more damage to the environment, The consumer hasn't seen a price reduction despite petrol being diluted and the ethanol means less MPG is achieved.\r\n",
        "background": "The goal of this petition is to mandate that all regular petrol in the UK be ethanol-free and for any alternative fuels with an ethanol content its VAT should be lowered by a percentage up to 20% in accordance with its ethanol content (I.e. E5 = 5% off VAT & E10 = 10% off VAT)",
