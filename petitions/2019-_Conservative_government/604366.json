        "action": "Appoint a medic, not banker Richard Meddings (ex-TSB). as Chair of NHS England.",
        "additional_details": "The already underfunded NHS is at breaking point because govt. has failed to control the pandemic. Appointing bankers as Minister of Health, and now Chief of NHS England, just adds to our fear that the govt. just sees illness as a business opportunity. Insurance based healthcare would endanger the lives of millions unable to pay for meds/treatment. It seems health insurance is just for the healthy/wealthy. NHS England should be chaired by someone for whom patient care comes first, not profits.",
        "background": "Appointing a banker as Chair of NHS England is one more step towards full privatisation of our health service. This position should be held by someone with medical experience who understands the challenges faced by today's health service.",
