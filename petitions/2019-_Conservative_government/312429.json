        "additional_details": "Key workers have to brave the very thing everyone is sat at home isolating from. They go to work to help keep the economy from completely collapsing. Whether it's saving lives on the frontline, food and packaging, policing, looking after and caring for the elderly or less abled. If it wasn't for the key workers the whole country would be flat on it's face.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt's great people are standing and shouting from their doors to show appreciation for the key workers. But surely the country can do better as we all know a little extra in the pay packet goes a long way.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThese people go to work to keep the country turning whilst everyone else can self isolate and get paid 80% of their wages. Show\u00a0some love to the key workers and give them a bonus for the effort they put in.",
