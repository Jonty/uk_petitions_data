        "additional_details": "Extending the deadline would prevent \"rushed\" house viewings at a time where the infection rate is high, preventing further potential spread of the virus.\r\n\r\nThe extension would also help maintain the stimulus within the housing market during a period of continued turbulence, through economic downturn and widespread redundancy (or reduction in earnings).\r\n\r\nThose requiring a move to downsize, to reduce outgoings, would also be more able to do so.",
