We have to pay approximately \u00a32000 per pupil, per year to travel to school. \r\nThis is to our nearest state Grammar School.\r\nIt is unaffordable by many parents.",

Academies are already included in the current transport rules. We could also accept a petition calling for a cap on school transport prices, if that's something you'd like to see happen, but you'd need to make clear how that was different to subsidised transport.
