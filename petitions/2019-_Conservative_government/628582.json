        "additional_details": "Students at secondary school age should learn about issues that they may face as adults and even currently facing. Sexual Harassment reports in schools have risen and it's important for all students to understand what they are experiencing. Especially year 10s and 11s have to learn the laws around sexual harassment because it will soon be inforced on them if they continue such behaviours into adulthood.",
        "background": "Modify the national curriculum so that PSHE lessons have to teach about what sexual harassment is defined as and the laws regarding this in British legislation. This content should be aimed at senior school aged young people.",
