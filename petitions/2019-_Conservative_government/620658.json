        "additional_details": "The sugar tax was introduced on soft drinks in 2018, but we believe this has not been effective. With the cost of living going up, the last thing people want is additional taxes.\r\n \r\nWe also want plans to restrict businesses from offering multibuy deals on 'unhealthy' foods, due to be introduced in October, to be abandoned. Instead of making unhealthy food more expensive, the Government should look at making healthy food cheaper.",
        "background": "The public should be able to eat and drink what they want, without Government intervention. Some people can also be allergic to sweeteners, making products with sugar substitutes unsuitable. We want the sugar tax, and plans to stop multibuy offers on 'unhealthy' foods, to be dropped.",
