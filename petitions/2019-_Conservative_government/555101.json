        "additional_details": "Not granting John Sentamu a peerage would be unfair as a peerage is usually handed out automatically to retiring Archbishops of York. As Archbishop he used his ministry to strive tirelessly towards trying to make UK society fairer and more just for people of all backgrounds. He had the courage to challenge and speak out critically against the UK\u2019s political and economic ruling elites on important moral issues. Importantly, BAME people are under represented in the House of Lords.",
