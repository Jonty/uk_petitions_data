Current nutritional labelling can make it difficult to work out how much carbohydrates are in a product. By adding carbohydrates to the list of items that are listed in \"Front of pack\" nutrition labelling, the Government can make it easier for people to find potentially vital information about the carbohydrate content of products.",
