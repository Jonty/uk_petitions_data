        "additional_details": "One of the causes of the gender pay gap relates to mothers being seen as the primary care givers. As statuary maternity leave and pay are greater than paternity, the law reinforces this view. If the two are made the same, it will remove an obstacle for men to stay at home with the baby. If employers grant extra benefits to mothers, that could undermine this, so any benefits should extend to all parents. This could strengthen families and improve gender equality.",
        "background": "Change paternity, maternity and shared parental leave so that statuary leave and pay are equal for all parents. Extra benefits offered by employers should be the same for maternity and paternity. This will decrease the gender pay gap...",
