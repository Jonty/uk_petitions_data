No one has been able to provide an example of any real benefit to Brexit other than whimsy and jingoistic slogans which are not backed up by any sort of detail or evidence.  The costs keep mounting. More examples of damage to our scientific, research and education communities abound. Industry and agriculture will be negatively affected by new border controls that we were promised by government we would not have.  We need to reverse this decision.",
        "background": "Due to recent  broken promises by Ministers and the likelihood of foreign interference, we can no longer have confidence in the decision. The government must allow a second referendum for the people of this country to vote again, now that we have more information.",
