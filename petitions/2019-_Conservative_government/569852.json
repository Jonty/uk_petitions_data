        "additional_details": "If deemed medically necessary, dental implants are free on the NHS but if not, these can cost \u00a31400 per tooth privately, significantly out of reach from the disposable income available to those most at need.\r\n \r\nGeneral checkups and everyday care can cost upwards of \u00a340, this is simply not justifiable for those living on the poverty line. We believe that this is detrimental to the health of these citizens and call for change in the pricing or funding for such action. Additionally, the impact on mental health is significantly overwhelming.",
        "background": "Currently dental care is only free for under 18s, pregnant and new mums, NHS hospital patients, and those on low income benefits. We call for the Government to fund a provision for free dental care for all; this should be included with the care the NHS provide currently.",
