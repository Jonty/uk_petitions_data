Potentially even postponing future class auditions and finish our teaching, students who have already paid, until our training is complete to the standard we were expecting and signed up for. Please note my school charge \u00a311k a year and we are certainly not getting the full potential of this.",
        "background": "I am asking for drama schools to have to extend courses (which are currently running) after coronavirus and social distancing has finished. This would be without extra fees, as online learning does NOT prepare or train actors for a working environment.",
