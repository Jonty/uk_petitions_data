        "additional_details": "A second wave of the new coronavirus this winter could overwhelm this NHS and force the UK back into lockdown. Vaccinating more people in the UK against seasonal flu could help reduce numbers seeking medical treatment, easing pressure on the NHS. Many people currently don\u2019t receive the flu vaccination because they can\u2019t afford to pay for it. Until there is a vaccine for the new coronavirus, fewer people requiring medical treatment for seasonal flu could free resources for those with Covid 19",
        "background": "Offer everyone in the UK a free flu vaccination this winter to ease pressure on NHS in case of 2nd wave of the new coronavirus in addition to those currently offered the vaccine",
