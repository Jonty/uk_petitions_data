        "additional_details": "Recent events are the latest example of where a hospital trust has failed to report a pattern of unexplained deaths to police. Such cases damage and impact on the NHS and public confidence in it. Independent scrutiny and investigation is vital in such cases. This petition calls for a legal requirement on NHS Trusts to report matters to police where a pattern of unexplained deaths occurs within a health or care setting or, where concerns are raised by a number of staff.",
        "background": "In light of recent events and the reluctance of the Countess of Chester Hospital to report a pattern of unexplained deaths in the neonatal unit to police, to create primary legislation that places a legal duty on NHS Trusts to report such matters to police for further investigation.",
