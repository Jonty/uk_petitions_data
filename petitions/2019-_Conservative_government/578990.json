        "additional_details": "97% of women have experienced sexual harassment from men. It\u2019s time to take responsibility for the fact that the issue lies with men, not females, not how they dress, not how late it is, not if they\u2019re drunk. The issue starts and finishes with the attitude men have towards women. By educating males from a young age about what is acceptable and what is not, that statistic could be dramatically reduced, and women can stop living in fear of being harassed, assaulted and abused.",
        "background": "It should be mandatory to educate all young men at school to not sexually harass women. The earlier that men realise the issue starts with them, and not the female, or what she wears or if she is drunk, future generations of women stand a better chance of never having to experience sexual assault.",
