It is also due to the time it takes for professional help to arrive; anything longer than 5 minutes, you\u2019re against the clock to recover oxygen to the brain. Businesses currently do not legally need to provide AED equipment and the cost of suitable equipment puts some businesses off \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d.
