        "additional_details": "Many parents don't want their children to have phones or use social media especially so young, but nobody wants their child 'left out' or bullied for not being included in the world of technology and so most parents allow their children to be involved with lack of understanding and powerless in some ways to protect their children from online harm including mental health disorders. Social media can be damaging to children, yet I don\u2019t think the companies are held accountable. Protect future generations.",
