        "additional_details": "Food banks could be improved significantly if the Government provides funding as currently they are funded by the public. In 2021 to 2022, the government collected \u00a3715.5 billion in tax which is a 22.5% increase from the year before and leads people to believe that taxes are extremely high at the moment. If people knew that the money was going to help other people in need by providing food, they might not see it as such a bad thing.",
        "background": "We want the Government to start funding food banks because at the moment, only the public funds food banks. Families who are struggling are dependant on food banks, especially after Covid-19. Parents are finding it hard to provide for their children and everyone should have the right to food.",
