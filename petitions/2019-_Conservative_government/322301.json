You can find out more about the ICO here: https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/information-commissioner-s-office\r\n\r\nIf you want the Government to change the powers the ICO has to take action against data holders, you could start a petition about this, or to remove the exemptions that permit data holders not to release certain records, you could start a new petition about this, but it would need to be clear what action you want the Government to take.\r\n\r\nAlso, while you are correct that EU law on GDPR will cease to apply to the UK at the end of the transition period, the Government has incorporated this legislation into domestic law, so it will continue to have effect until it is replaced."
