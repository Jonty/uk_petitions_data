        "additional_details": "Local concerns about new certificated sites are disregarded by Camping & Caravanning Club, thereafter the Club is unaccountable. On one site they expanded from 5 to 80 recreational units, with one entrance & single-track access, with no planning control despite objection from all local authorities & MPs.\r\nThe Ministry\u2019s response refers to an Article 4 Direction, which local Councils do not use.\r\nRural communities face years enduring dangerous effects of the increased volume of tourist traffic etc.",
        "background": "Caravan and Camping Associations benefit from exemption certificates & effectively do as they like. We want checks in place which will give locals a voice, protect their rural amenities & provide local authorities the power to have more control, especially when the area & its roads are unsuitable.",
