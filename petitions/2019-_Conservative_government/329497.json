        "action": "Mandate 40000\u00a3 minimum starting annual salary for all UK postdoctoral positions.",
        "additional_details": "The majority of ground-breaking scientific discoveries in the UK are made through the scientific excellence of postdocs. Yet, given the cost of living and family maintenance, they struggle to support themselves. Most postdocs work 50-60 hours/week (irrespective of contractual minimum) but their pay is not commensurate with their effort, causing chronic stress which in turn greatly diminishes the achievable productivity and long-term economic and social gains from scientific research in the UK.",
        "background": "I hereby put forward a formal request to increase the minimum starting salary of all postdoctoral positions in UK to 40000\u00a3 yearly.",
