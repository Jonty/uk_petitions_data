These are the most evil of crimes and a child is the most innocent of victims.\r\n\r\nA child must be protected and be safe.\r\n \r\nToo many offenders have short sentences and go on to re-offend.\r\n \r\nJustice is not served for all the children affected by adults who commit crimes against children, who are our future. They need protected and current sentences fail to do this.\r\n\r\nIncreasing sentences should keep offenders off the streets and away from our children!\r\n \r\nBeing abused causes many life-long issues that do not allow a person to heal and justice is needed to those who have suffered at a bare minimum.",
