        "additional_details": "I\u2019d like the government to allow pet bereavement leave in the work place, for some people losing a pet is as emotional as loosing a family member. It\u2019s not an easy thing to get over and to be expected to go to work straight after an animal dying can be very difficult. We care, feed, protect and love our pets like a child, when the time comes we need time to grieve, they are not just pets they are members of the family and we need to start treating it this way to help people deal with the loss.",
