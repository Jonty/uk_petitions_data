        "additional_details": "Alot of people who move into social housing, move in to very run down properties. Some spend thousands over the months and years turning these houses into their homes. Most live in their council owned homes for very long periods of time, raise their children there, work locally etc.. Unfortunately rent to buy no longer exsists in Wales but I feel it should be brought back so that people who wish to buy are not forced to leave the homes they live in and love and they are able to purchase the house they have been renting.",
