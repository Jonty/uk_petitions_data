        "additional_details": "The majority of uni halls which are still opening are insisting payments for those remaining on campus; however the majority of us didn\u2019t have a choice but to stay. Likewise those living in private accounts are still required to Pay rent for the foreseeable future whether they are living there or at home. Therefore I\u2019m petitioning for a freeze in these rents. Furthermore I\u2019m imploring the government to increase the student loan amount, as we are unable to apply for any extra funding at present.",
        "background": "Many students have lost there jobs due to the conrona virus and yet are still expected to pay bills and rent, therefore I\u2019m proposing an increase in student loan, as we are excluded from applying for the current financial aid. As well as freeze on both private and university owned accommodation.",
