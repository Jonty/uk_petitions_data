It is disrupting people's work and studies.",
        "background": "With the latest travel update, Turkey is on the amber list. However, as the Turkish vaccination is not still recognized by the UK, compulsory house quarantine continues. Turkey currently offers BioNTech/Pfizer vaccines. We demand that the vaccination certificate be accepted as valid by the UK.",
