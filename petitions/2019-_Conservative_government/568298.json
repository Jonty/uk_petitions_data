        "additional_details": "The government must take action to help university students. A level and GCSE exams and coursework have been cancelled, why have university students been given the same treatment? Along side this we have still had to pay our usual, minimum of, \u00a39,250 a year, for shortened online lessons and minimal to no support from staff. It is unacceptable that no one in parliament is representing us university students, and that no action has been taken to help us through a pandemic.",
        "background": "Education has been a struggle for university students across the UK since the start of the first national lockdown. We have been pushed aside, with no help for funding or exemption of exams/coursework.It is unbelievable that the Government believes what they have put into place for us is acceptable.",
