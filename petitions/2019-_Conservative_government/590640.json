        "additional_details": "A mobile company recently applied to construct a 20m 5G mast on a residential green space impacting the local amenity. This green space includes several mature ash and lime trees, as well as protected wildlife. \r\n\r\nResidents raised 191 objections, plus an objection from the Council Tree Officer, resulting in the application being rejected.\r\n\r\nHowever, under the new Planning Bill, neither the council nor the residents will be allowed to raise objections to developments of this kind.",

Phone companies should replace and share existing masts on used brownfield sites rather than new sites. Councils and residents should always be consulted.",
