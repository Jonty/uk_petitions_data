We believe this is not appropriate, and all claims of sexual offences should be handled by the civilian police, who we believe are better able to support victims and investigate in an impartial manner.",

I believe the military police do not have the training and expertise to investigate these cases or support victims, and that all such cases should be handled by the civilian police.",
