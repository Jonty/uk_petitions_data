        "action": "Make Windrush Day an Official Bank Holiday in the UK",
        "additional_details": "The UK is yet to nationally acknowledge that the Slave Trade and the Windrush generation, made this nation what it is today. The appalling treatment of the Windrush generation by our Government in 2018, had a huge social and emotional impact on its victims and caused major disruption to their lives.\r\nWe are yet to see the Government exercise their full power, in repairing this fractured relationship. A public Bank Holiday will serve as a much needed day for communities to reflect, heal and unite.",
        "background": "The Government must dignify those who came to the UK as part of the windrush generation, by giving us a National Bank Holiday. Although Windrush Day currently exists, this now needs to be a national day of celebration and strongly reflected in the teachings of British History within all schools.",
