We believe the only winners are arms companies.\r\n\r\nGiven the magnitude of commencing or becoming embroiled in armed conflicts, the UK Government should seek the explicit agreement of its voters. Currently, the convention is that the House of Commons should have the opportunity to debate the deployment of military forces, prior to doing so, except in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\nThe Commons derives its power from the people. The people need to be heard.\r\n",

This agreement should be based on a public referendum, as their MPs are under no obligation to vote according to their constituents' wishes.",
