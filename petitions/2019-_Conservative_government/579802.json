        "additional_details": "Endometriosis is a debilitating disease where the lining of the uterus (endometrium) grows in ectopic sites, such as the ovaries, fallopian tubes and the pelvis. It occurs in 1 in 10 women but takes approximately 7 years to get diagnosed.\r\n \r\nAround 30-50% of women with endometriosis are infertile and as there is no cure for endometriosis, there are very limited options to conceive naturally. One way of managing symptoms is surgery, which actually increases the chances of infertility.",
        "background": "Women with endometriosis should have the option to freeze their eggs on the NHS, due to the high percentage of infertility (30-50%). Women undergoing chemotherapy have around a 40% chance of being infertile, yet they can get their eggs frozen on the NHS and women with endometriosis cannot.",
