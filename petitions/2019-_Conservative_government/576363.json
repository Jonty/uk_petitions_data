        "additional_details": "We want the Government to make it possible for more young people to have access to the arts. Funding for arts subjects such as music, drama and dance has been cut back over the years. This is to the point where some schools and 6th form colleges aren't running these courses at GCSE or A level, or offering musical instrument lessons. As a result many young people who wish to go into the performance field are either unable to or are severely hindered.",
        "background": "Some students are unable to take A-level music due to their 6th form not having enough funding to run the course. This hinders the chances of students who want to go to music college. We would like more funding put into music, drama, and dance education.",
