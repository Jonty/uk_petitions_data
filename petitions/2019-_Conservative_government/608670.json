        "additional_details": "To quote Laura Chepner, Chair of the Vegan Society's Education Network: \"The Equality Act 2010 places a duty on educators not to discriminate against vegan children and students. Currently the Government only asks that schools make 'reasonable choices' when deciding whether to cater for vegans in their care. Those who choose not to are discriminating and it is about time that the grey area became black and white. Vegan options in 2022 should not be optional.\"",
        "background": "The School Food Regulations 2014 create requirements for schools to provide portions of certain foods, but do not specifically require schools to provide a vegan option. This should be amended to require schools provide the option of a nutritionally balanced, hot vegan meal on a daily basis.",
