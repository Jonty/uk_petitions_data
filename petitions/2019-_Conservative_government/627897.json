        "additional_details": "Regardless of the weather, sun damage happens all year round & skin cancer rates continue to increase in the UK. There is a lack of awareness that SPF should be applied all year round & that sun damage occurs in everyday life not just a summer holiday. One of the greatest barriers to consumer usage is cost. The Government has a responsibility to educate on the importance of SPF and removing the VAT sends an important message, whilst helping to reduce the cost pressures facing consumers today.",
        "background": "There is a current cost of living crisis in the UK and consumers are stretched now more than ever. Sun-care protection is essential and as such should not be subject to VAT.  Removing VAT will help to make sunscreen more affordable for everyone and encourage increased usage.",
