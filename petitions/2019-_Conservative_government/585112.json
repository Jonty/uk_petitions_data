        "additional_details": "The circumstances surrounding GCSE and A level exams was blurry for an entire year and a half. Over the past few weeks, mini assessed pieces of work have been sprung upon students with only three days notice. These exams have been taking place every single day since late April, only allowing students the night before to revise the content on the paper. Considering lockdown and other mitigating factors, students will not be performing to the same standard that they were prior. This provides them with a grade that does not truly reflect on their ability.",
        "background": "Allow students teacher predicted grades whilst making assessments optional inside of schools. This would ease the pressure from current GCSE and A level students.",
