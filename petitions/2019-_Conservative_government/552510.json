We could accept a petition calling for either of things, but it would need to be clear whether you want this Bill to be abandoned or amended.\r\n\r\nFurther, your petition claims that the Bill decriminalises torture. The Bill does not decriminalise any activity, but changes the law around how certain alleged offences can be prosecuted. You can find out more about the effects of this Bill here: https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8983/\r\n\r\nYour petition also claims that the Bill breaches international human rights law. The Government has published a memorandum stating that in its view the provisions of the Bill are compatible with the rights in the European Convention on Human Rights. While we could accept a petition raising concerns about the human rights implications of this Bill, we could not publish a petition that contained unqualified and unsubstantiated assertions that it breached human rights law.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petition, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nAmend the Overseas Operations Bill.
