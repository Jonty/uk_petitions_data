        "action": "Raise additional temporary taxes for those that can pay for Covid-19 and the NHS",
        "additional_details": "In these exceptional times, temporary additional taxes should be raised so that those in a fortunate position can collectively support the nationwide fight against Covid-19.\r\n\r\n1. Increase the top rate of tax from 45% to 50% for 2 years.\r\n\r\n2. Implement a wealth tax of 1% on net assets above \u00a31 million excluding primary residence (and any debt liabilities) for 2 years.",
        "background": "The government has rightly announced a comprehensive economic rescue package for Covid-19 and more for the NHS. However, further funding might be needed, and taxes should now be increased temporarily for those that can bear it, so the UK's debt pile doesn't get even bigger for the next generation.",
