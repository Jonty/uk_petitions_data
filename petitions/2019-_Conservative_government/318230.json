        "action": "Reverse the changes to Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme for Nursery workers",
        "additional_details": "I would like the Department for Education to revisit their decision to exclude state-funded nurseries and workers from the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. These workers have supported some of the poorest and vulnerable children; now they're facing further poverty and debt despite holding down full-time jobs. They have an equal right to any worker for support and a fair furlough package, no matter who funds the nursery places.",
        "background": "In an update last week DfE altered its guidance to say nurseries who offer funded places will only be able to furlough a proportion of staff.\r\n\r\nThis means some nursery staff workers are now facing being laid-off and relying on Universal Credit (much lower than their wages).",
