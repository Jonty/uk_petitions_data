        "additional_details": "With the cost of living rising many parents have to choose between childcare or utilities / food. But if there's no child care many are unable to work resulting in a vicious circle.\r\n\r\nBy introducing state funded nurseries children would have a warm place to go to with access to food during the week & their development would be looked after.\r\n\r\nBy allowing parents to go back to work, the gov income would increase via taxes too as more would contribute hence would cover the cost of such nurseries.",
        "background": "The government to introduce solely state funded nurseries for children between the ages  of 40 weeks & school age. (SMP ends after 39 weeks.)\r\nThese nurseries to have capacities proportionate to the local area, provide at least 3 meals (one hot meal per day), allowing parents back to work full time.",
