        "additional_details": "There is more than the weight of sentencing, there is the weight in public opinion of how serious a crime is.\r\n \r\nWe believe the current definition of rape discourages victims of other non-consensual penetration to come forward, because other sexual offences can be regarded as less serious. This can increase the fears victims have of not being taken seriously.\r\n",
        "background": "Change the Sexual Offences Act to include any penetration of the vagina or anus. Currently rape only covers using a penis without consent to penetrate the vagina, mouth, or anus of another person. This excludes other acts of penetration, and means women cannot be charged with rape.",
