It\u2019s becoming impossible to afford second properties due to the over inflated costs of properties particularly in the south! It\u2019s unfair that the north house prices are far less than the south. People are struggling to save for deposits without the extra costs of stamp duty. Please consider this as the councils are not providing enough housing, without the private rental sector there could be a huge increase in homelessness. Do the right thing and scrap the stamp duty!",
