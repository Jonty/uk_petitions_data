        "additional_details": "Some people cannot afford to house their birds effectively enough to stop the flu being passed through their faeces. It can cost a lot of money to keep birds safe. If you have under 50 birds then you should not be subject to rules on preventing the spread of avian flu. It should be up to the owner what action to take.",
        "background": "We want the Government to exempt owners of under 50 birds from rules put in place to prevent the spread of avian flu. Some owners are not able to implement the measures required, and might rather run the risk of their birds contracting the flu and needing to be culled.",
