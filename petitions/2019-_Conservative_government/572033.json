        "additional_details": "The EU has 143 diplomatic missions around the world. All countries have granted full diplomatic status except the UK. There is no reason to do this and it's bad foreign policy. We need to be on good terms with our nearest and biggest geographical neighbours and trading partners. The lower status is a downgrading from previous status and is logically perceived as an insult. If the UK wants to be seen as open for business and a global operator, it needs to have a more positive foreign policy.",
        "background": "Request the UK Government to award the EU ambassadorial team the normal privileges and immunities afforded under the Vienna Convention. Witholding them sends a negative signal to our neighbours and main trading partners. Demand a change from petty and spiteful to a more positive foreign policy.",
