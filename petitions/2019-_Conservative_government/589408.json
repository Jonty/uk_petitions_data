        "additional_details": "Thousands of British Pakistanis are stuck either in Pakistan or in United Kingdom because of the hotel quarantine requirement. Not everyone can afford astonishing cost of \u00a31750 for a hotel quarantine. We urge UK government to remove Pakistan from Red List and atleast move it to the Amber list so people can reunite with their loved ones, while still home isolating for 10 days on return to the UK.",
        "background": "Corona positive cases in Pakistan have come down significantly since the country was added to the Red List. Now the cases are just under 3% of the tested population. There is no evidence of Delta variant anywhere in the country. It makes no scientific sense to keep Pakistan in the Red List anymore.",
