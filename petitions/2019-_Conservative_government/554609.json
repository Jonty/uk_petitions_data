        "additional_details": "Prior to COVID 19 my sector (puppetry) was global in reputation, reaching millions of audiences with an estimated turnover of \u00a358million (2019). This success was mostly built on a flexible, self employed workforce (65%) with low earnings (30% lower than average real wage). Many are still unable to work. Keeping the support level at 80% will give the self employed & their families a better chance to get through these difficult times, & ensure we do not lose skills & knowledge needed to rebuild.",
        "background": "From 1 November, HMRC will only offer a grant equivalent to 20% of monthly trading profits for self employed. I urge the government to keep the support at its current level of 80%. Many self employed are still unable to work due to social distancing.",
