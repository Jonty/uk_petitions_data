        "additional_details": "This needs to be drastically changed and force an acceptable wage for all HGV drivers from 7.5ton to C+E Arctic Drivers, We believe wages for 7.5 ton should start at no less than \u00a315 per hour class 2 cat C \u00a317 starting no experience and CAT C+E arctic at \u00a320 per hour bearing in mind the lack of facilities if tramping at side of the road and lack of comfort making less than unskilled jobs plus a minimum \u00a330 night out payment per night otherwise we will continue to lose drivers and not replace!!!",
        "background": "Raise wages to avoid another critical shortage and to show respect for the professional training and fees of cpc etc drivers have to pay every five years yet currently we can earn the same or more in an unskilled job cleaning or mcdonalds, very poor facilities this shows no respect 4 the industry!",
