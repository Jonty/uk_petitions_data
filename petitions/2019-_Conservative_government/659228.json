        "additional_details": "We think that fines for more than a 10-minute phone wait for gas, electricity, water, phone, public transport and other vital service companies should be introduced. Long waits can affect many people, especially older people who are nervous of new technology. They should be able to speak to a person \u2013 and should have a specific line that doesn\u2019t put them through to a computer. In my role as managing director for a small business, I have wasted hours trying to contact the right people to deal with problems and this takes time away from running my company.",
        "background": "We think the Government should clamp down on phone waiting times for companies providing vital services, and require these companies to set up specific phone lines for older people. We think these businesses need to service their customers in good time. ",
