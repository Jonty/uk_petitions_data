While selling products with no evidence of efficacy may already be illegal under fraud legislation, media outlets are still free to spread misinformation without consequence. A new, specific criminal offence is needed from our Government to send the clear message that these actions will not be tolerated during a time of national crisis.",

This false information exposes the most vulnerable to harm and leads to extra strain on our NHS.",
