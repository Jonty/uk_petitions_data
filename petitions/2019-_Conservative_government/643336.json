We want a statutory minimum of 30 years, no matter the age.\r\n \r\nChildren are killing children and many are able to start a new life after the 12 years, but what about the family of the murdered victim - they can't just start their life again. I believe more strict sentences would make perpetrators think twice about planning to murder innocent children of our land.\r\n",
