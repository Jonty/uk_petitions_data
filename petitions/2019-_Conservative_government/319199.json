        "action": "The premier league season 2019/20 should be declared null and void.",
        "additional_details": "The government and parliament should take a lead and put pressure on the Premier League to stop the 2019/20 season indefinitely (as has been done in France).  The Premier League\u2019s proposal to play the remaining fixtures at neutral venues would compromise the integrity of the competition.  It would be highly hypocritical of the government to limit families from going to the park, but then allow numerous highly paid superstars to congregate in a small penalty area (whilst corners are being taken).  Social distancing rules should be based on the principle of equality.",
        "background": "Although football is our national sport, it would be highly irresponsible to re-start the premier league season 2019/20. Profits should not be prioritised over and above the need to maintain and improve good public health during the Coronavirus pandemic.",
