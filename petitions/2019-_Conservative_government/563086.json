        "additional_details": "It is unfair that different sections of society have different privileges with regards to TV access. Prison inmates have cheaper access to television channels than most hospital patients. The people in hospital may have also paid their TV license fee for the year, but they are not at home and so cannot use the service that they have already paid for. Why should they pay again?",
        "background": "My father in law was in hospital, waiting for a hospice place. During a visit, it became apparent that he did not have free access to television channels. In hospital the charge can be up to \u00a310 a day. Long stays result in hefty charges and some people may not have the funds.",
