        "additional_details": "We believe there is an unfair difference between those who can afford a private pension and those who cannot. This, depending on their circumstances, may affect the age at which they can retire.\r\n \r\nPeople who are solely dependent on the state pension as income in retirement have to wait until the age the government decide they can draw the state pension which could mean working longer as the retirement age is extended.\r\n \r\nI wonder at what age politicians generally retire? Conversely, I wonder at what age the person sweeping the politicians' streets will be able to retire.\r\n",
