Rather than raising standards it is a criminal disadvantage for at least 10 percent of UK students.\r\n\r\nThe Government should review how children with dyslexia are supported and assessed to ensure that they are not unfairly disadvantaged or discriminated against.  To ensure this, it must also fund specialist assessors/teachers within schools.",
