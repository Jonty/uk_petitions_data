It is clear that the impact of the restrictions in place on maternity wards as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has not been properly considered and that the experience of pregnant women could be positively improved either by allowing birth partners to be present in person, or via video conferencing facilities.",
        "background": "We are calling on the Government to allow pregnant women to nominate an individual, from the same household or bubble, to accompany them through every stage of their pregnancy and to urge NHS England to issue unambiguous policy direction around the legality and use of video conferencing facilities.",

You should check with your maternity team and sonography unit for their policy on visitors attending antenatal appointments, including scans."
