        "additional_details": "Remove this unnecessary assessment that can cause problems due to it causing unnecessary stress and mental health problems for people who already have illnesses. The assessments are also done by people who don't know each individual person's problems and are determining people\u2019s lives using a system that can have unfair results. This is unacceptable, and should stop.",

Many claimants have to go through this assessment every 3 years, and these are often done by a person that doesn't know you or your individual illness.",
