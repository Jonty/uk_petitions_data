The assessments are also done by people who don't know each individual person's problems and are determining people\u2019s lives using a system that can have unfair results. This is unacceptable, and should stop.",

Many claimants have to go through this assessment every 3 years, and these are often done by a person that doesn't know you or your individual illness.",
