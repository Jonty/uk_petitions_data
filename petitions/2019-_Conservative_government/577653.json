        "additional_details": "Taking away this lifesaving aid will impact on many people on the brink of famine. A famine caused by war and Covid-19 pandemic.  \r\n \r\nThe only way to avoid these tragic consequences and protect UK own reputation is to rethink the decision to cut down funding for the world\u2019s most vulnerable people right now.",
        "background": "Yemen is the world's worst humanitarian crisis right now. This is not the time to be cutting down aid to millions of Yemenis who are desperately in need for this to survive. This would result in stopping many emergency programmes that save many lives during these difficult times for Yemen.",
