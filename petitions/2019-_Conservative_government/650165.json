        "additional_details": "There has been a significant rise in antisemitic hate crimes (+1,350% in London, according to the police) and open support for the terrorist organisation Hamas, following Hamas' attack which killed 1,400+ people in Israel. Support for Hamas and/or denial of the atrocities has been visible both online and in public, including at recent protests. We are concerned that many UK residents openly endorse antisemitism and even terrorism, and that this presents a huge issue for national security. This must be addressed now.",
        "background": "Hold a public inquiry into the prevalence of antisemitism and support for antisemitic terrorist organisations, such as Hamas. This should investigate the root causes and how to tackle these abhorrent hateful ideologies, and lead to action with a targeted pro-tolerance and anti-extremism campaign.",
