        "additional_details": "The Greek marbles & statues are a major part of the Greek inheritance and history,the government should be in the position to undo the wrongs of the past and allow the people of Greece to access the inheritance, freely without the need of leaving the country.The weight of the historical and cultural meaning of the Greek marbles and statues and artifacts held in the UK are the same or even more than the Crown jewels. Imagine if the Crown jewels were sold via a occupier to some foreign country and you have no access to them.",
        "background": "Approve the return of them back to Greece where they will take the rightful place with all the other ancient Greek artifacts.As history dictates that UK bought them but not from the Greek but from the Turkish,so legally the didn't obtain them from the lawful owner.",
