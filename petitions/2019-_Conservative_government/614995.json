        "additional_details": "The Refugee Council predict that the tax-payer will be coughing up over 1.4bn to pay for this scheme. The government must abandon these inhumane plans to shirk its responsibilities toward vulnerable people claiming asylum in the UK, and pledge to protect those who so desperately need it. \r\nThey must ensure that UK asylum seekers are safe. Sending asylum seekers to Rwanda, a country that is not a democracy, with a terrible human rights record, jeopardises their well-being.",
        "background": "The government has announced plans to send asylum seekers arriving in the UK to Rwanda to detention centres for an indefinite time.\r\nThis scheme fails to offer people fleeing war the option to make their lives in the UK, placing the most vulnerable in a country with a poor human rights record.",
