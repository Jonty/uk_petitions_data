Which we do.\r\n\r\nYet now, at this unprecedented time and when we need them to repay just a tiny fraction of that support we gave them, they instead see it as an opportunity to wet their beaks & push high interest loans on unreasonable terms.\r\nIf they can\u2019t step up, then it\u2019s time they were driven out and brought under public control.",
