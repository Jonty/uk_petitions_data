        "action": "Remove the time restrictions on disabled bus passes.",
        "additional_details": "There are many disabled people who cannot drive. A small journey to an able bodied person may be impossible or dangerous to a disabled person and so financially accessible public transport options are vital. Additionally, around a third of disabled people live in poverty. For these people especially, the time restrictions on the disabled bus pass effectively enforce a curfew, massively decreasing independence.",
        "background": "disabled bus passes are only valid for travel between 9:30am and 11:00pm in many counties. This time restriction undermines the purpose of the disabled bus pass which is to help make public transport financially accessible to disabled people, many of whom rely on busses to travel.",
