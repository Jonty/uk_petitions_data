To reduce period poverty, improve menstrual literacy and tackle the climate emergency, the Government must act to make this sustainable option more accessible.\r\n\r\nWe call on the Treasury to remove this burdensome financial barrier and encourage environmentally friendly consumer behaviour.'\r\n",
        "background": "In January 2021 the UK Government abolished the VAT on menstrual products, but failed to include period pants which continue to be taxed at 20% because the Government classifies them as a garment. The tax code must be brought up to date in line with products like tampons, pads, and menstrual cups.",
