        "additional_details": "Young people who have periods during school hours are sometimes denied access to toilets. This prevents young people from having a period with dignity, causing shame, embarrassment and preventing them from changing period products. We believe this is inconsistent with the right to dignity and basic human rights - as per the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Bright Futures NE propose young people with periods, by law be given a right to access school toilets.",
