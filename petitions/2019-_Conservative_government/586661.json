If someone has a British spouse/children they should be treated better by the Home Office, because this is the country of their family and may be their country sooner or later.\r\n \r\nThe law should return for what it used to be before July 2012 for spouses, with the ILR route reduced to 2 years, and also extended to all family visas.",
