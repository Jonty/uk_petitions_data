This relates to the current stereotypical characterisation of cyclists as aggressive 'MAMILs'.\r\n\r\nChanging the imagery to a step-through bike could make it more inclusive.  It will say that cycling is for all genders and ages (step-through bikes are not just 'women's bikes'), for people with disabilities, people who ride slower, people who wear ordinary clothes etc.  In short: everyone, not just cyclists.",
