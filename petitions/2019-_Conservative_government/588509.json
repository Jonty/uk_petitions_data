        "additional_details": "While GCSEs can still be used as a main indicator, teachers should be allowed to propose an increase based on classwork and previous papers. GCSEs as of now are an inaccurate indicator of potential, especially for GCSE students in 2022. This is something which affects future candidates and should be taken into consideration.",
        "background": "Current year 10 students have missed almost 6 months worth of their GCSE content. It's completely unfair to base a grade which stays with you for life on a series of exam papers. Classwork and previous exam papers can also be used to help determine a grade.",
