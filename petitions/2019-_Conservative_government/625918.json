Plagued by in flighting and division, they are unable to elect a leader who can unify the party and take advantage of the parliamentary majority won in 2019. The current Prime Minster has managed to destabilise the economy during her very short tenure. The markets and public need certainty and consensus on direction which the current government cannot achieve. The damage to our country and economy needs to stop now.",
