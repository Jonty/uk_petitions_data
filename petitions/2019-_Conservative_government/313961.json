        "action": "Require face masks to be worn in all public enclosed spaces (COVID-19 crisis)",
        "additional_details": "Face masks have helped slow down the spread of COVID-19 in South Korea. The leading expert there (Dr. Woo Joo Kim) says face masks work. The main reason is that they stop people who unknowingly have the virus from accidentally spreading it to others. They also have a secondary benefit of reducing the chances of catching the virus through airborne transmission. A requirement to wear face masks, in addition to regular hand washing and social distancing, will hugely reduce the spread of the virus.",
        "background": "It should be made compulsory for all people to wear face masks in shared enclosed spaces, such as shops, public transport, and workplaces. They should not be required in the open air or homes. This requirement may also help pave the way for more places to re-open, due to the increased protection.",
