It\u2019s not right after doing the mandatory 11years at school they should have the choice if they want to stay on and do this at school. I\u2019m sure many people of the ages 11-16 will support me on what I\u2019m saying as they are tired of school and they want to be able to go get jobs after leaving school at year 11 or get an apprenticeship.",
