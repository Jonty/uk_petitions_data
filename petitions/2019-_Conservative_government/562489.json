        "additional_details": "NICE have discontinued funding for the treatment of Nivolumab to NHS patients with metastatic Melanoma. They say the treatment is not \u201ccost effective\u201d for the NHS. This treatment is used with other drugs such as ipilimumab and is highly effective in treating metastatic disease. The use of Nivolumab increased a patients\u2019 overall response and overall survival by 32%. When patients received only ipilimumab, overall patient response sits at a mere 10-15%.",
        "background": "Retract the \u201cNICE\u201d decision to withdraw Nivolumab treatment so that patients can have the greatest chance of survival with metastatic melanoma. This immunotherapy has such life-saving effects that it is a justified spend for the NHS and therefore is in-fact cost effective.",
