        "additional_details": "Given that the Government and DVSA/DVLA agreed to extend vehicle MOT's due to expire during the lock down last year, why can this not be done for drivers and riders?\r\n\r\nThe whole idea of an MOT is about ensuring vehicles on the road are safe.\r\n\r\nIs it more dangerous to give a motorcyclist, riding the same motorcycle for two or more years, a six month extension until lock down eases?\r\n\r\nOr is it more risky to allow a potentially unsafe motor vehicle to continue on the road for another six months?",
        "background": "During lock down, all rider training has ceased.\r\n\r\nThis means that those road users with CBT certificates for riding motorcycles (keyworkers/deliver riders/commuters), cannot renew this type of licence or take the next step to obtaining their full motorcycle licence and must to stop riding.",
