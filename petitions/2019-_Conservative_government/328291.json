        "action": "Make the wearing of face coverings mandatory in schools,colleges&universities.",
        "additional_details": "Face coverings at the moment are optional in schools yet all will be wearing coverings on public transport. If face coverings are expected in other areas of society, schools should be leading by example.If distancing is reduced this safety measure is vital in small classroom settings and in school buildings which make government safety guidance challenging to put into action-with poor ventilation and narrow corridors. Schools are environments of high risk for transmission and need more support.",
        "background": "Mandatory wearing of face coverings in schools,colleges & universities should be in line with most public spaces but is not. Schools educate - they should be leading by example to show younger people the importance of this safety measure especially if distancing is reduced & class sizes increase.",
