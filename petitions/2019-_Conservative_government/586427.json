        "additional_details": "If the Government ends restrictions on overnight working then employers will be able to adjust to this. This could help 16 and 17 years olds to be able to balance their work and social life better and with ease. In addition, I feel that many 16 and 17 year olds would prefer to do shifts overnight than in the day.",
        "background": "I wish for 16 and 17 year olds to be able to do overnight shifts. Most 16 and 17 year olds are in college and busy with college work which they have to do in the day. Allowing them to work overnight shifts would mean they can work at whatever time is most convenient to them.",
