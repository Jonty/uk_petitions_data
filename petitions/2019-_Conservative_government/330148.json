        "additional_details": "Isolation and purification of a virus and proof it causes Covid19 disease using Koch postulates have not been achieved and procedures not followed (see letter to PM). This is a fatal flaw in the basis for policy and given it is not a High Consequence Infectious Disease (Mar19 announcement), and the tests used are of unknown accuracy, the possibility of a vaccine is hopeless, and the measures directed against it are beyond reason and out of proportion.",
        "background": "Independent peer-reviewed scientific evidence proving Covid19 virus is isolated & purified is required by 22/07 (or debate date) otherwise measures against something which does not exist must end. It is unacceptable that WHO advised Public Health England NOT to isolate the virus (see letter to PM).",
