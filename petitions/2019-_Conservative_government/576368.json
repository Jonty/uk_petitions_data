It is more an acceptance of moral responsibility to steer the country through rough and perilous times.\r\n\u00a340,000 per annum is still well above the average salary and I am only suggesting this be for six months. This should not affect the generous pension benefits which they currently enjoy.\r\nThink on this as the Queen Mother being able to look the East End of London in the face after bombs fell on Buckingham Palace in WW2.",
