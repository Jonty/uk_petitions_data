        "additional_details": "The crisis is too severe to wait for manufacturers to voluntarily rise to the challenge. Requisitioning of capacity is needed with the utmost urgency to save lives. If hospitals don\u2019t have enough of the right equipment people will be left to die, as they have been in some other countries. Arms manufacturers in particular have the engineering skills and the appropriate machinery, such as CNC machines, to enable them to switch production very quickly.",
        "background": "During WW2 manufacturers retooled their production lines to assist the war effort. We need a similarly urgent and rapid response to the Coronavirus crisis in order to save lives. We don\u2019t need any more fighter jets right now, we do urgently need ventilators!",
