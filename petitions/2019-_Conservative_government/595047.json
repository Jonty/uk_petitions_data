        "additional_details": "The US has spent 20 years in Afghanistan and the war cost more then $2 trillion. It also cost the UK at least \u00a340 billion. But we must not forget the hundreds of thousands of soldiers that died and the many that suffered so much to keep stability. All the suffering and investment that was put in seems to all be for nothing. If we are going to withdraw we cant leave the country in absolute chaos and disregard the people. If civillians want to escape we should do everything we can to help",
        "background": "I would like the US and UK to make sure Kabul Airport is reopened and commercial air flights are no longer suspended. I also would like their to be support staff there to ensure that the thousands trying to flee are able to. Many are trying to flee and there has been chaos at the airport.",
