        "additional_details": "I want the government to understand that one income can no longer support a family, mortgage, and cost of living, and to realign the benefit cap to cover combined household income, not individual income which penalise families where only one individual is classed as a 'high-earner', or able to work due to having a lower paid job (that won't cover full time childcare costs).",
        "background": "Currently, you have to pay back a percentage of Child Benefit payments if an individual in the house hold earns \u00a350,000 or more, yet families with a combined income of \u00a399,000 are not penalised. \r\n\r\nTwo parents could be earning \u00a349,000 per year each and not be required to pay any back",
