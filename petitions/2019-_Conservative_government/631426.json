Every prayer should be completed before the next one and by the time school has finished one of the prayers are already gone. It is essential that we complete our prayers on time and we think that we have a right to practice our religion without school getting in the way.",
        "background": "Currently, many secondary schools do not allow students time and space to pray. All secondary school pupils should be able to request this and schools should be legally obliged to provide it. Prayer is part of Islam and it is essential for Muslims to pray at the right time. ",
