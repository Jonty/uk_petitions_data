        "additional_details": "The wear of visible religion symbols starting at young ages radically lures children and teenagers towards the religion chosen by parents.\r\nChildren's and teenagers' human rights have to be protected. They should have the right and freedom to choose their own religion as at the moment often the parents are the ones who choose and decide the religion for minors.\r\nNot wearing religious symbols in schools will give minors the freedom of seeing alternative options to the religion imposed by parents.",
        "background": "The wear of religious symbols in schools is not in accordance with Human Rights Act 1998 Article 9 as minors are dressed by parents who choose and impose the type of religion on them.",
