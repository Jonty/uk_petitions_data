Wales and England have 8 public holidays, Scotland has 9, Northern Ireland has 10, whereas the average in Europe is 12 annual holidays.\r\n\r\nIn recent years we have had an \"extra\" bank holidays for the Queen jubilee and this year the King's coronation.\r\n\r\nIt is now time for Wales!",
        "background": "St David's Davids Day, 1st of March, should be a public holiday in Wales.\r\n\r\nIt is hugely important to celebrate the culture and heritage of a country and St David's Day is ideally placed to do this. This will allow the people of Wales to celebrate together this iconic day.",
