        "additional_details": "We pay Tax and NI contributions just like the rest of the self employed but we are left without the support of the new scheme. \r\n\r\nWorried and unsure of how and when we will be able to earn money to cover our bills. We are left with the option of basic universal credit, which will not cover our outgoings (some may not even qualify for this). \r\n\r\nWe urge you to help us by supporting us through these scary times and unknown territories and not leave us behind to fend for our selves.",
        "background": "Many of us are left feeling worried and abandoned. Being newly self employed, we have not yet filed a self assessment report, as we are still in our first year of trading. So we do not qualify for the chancellors new scheme to help the self employed through the Corona Virus out break.",
