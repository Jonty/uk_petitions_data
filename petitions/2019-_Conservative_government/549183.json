        "additional_details": "This is an issue I feel needs tackling ASAP because without being dramatic the co sequences could be fatal. And I think the government needs to step up and support this and implement harsher rules. I was shocked and saddened on my latest visit to my local supermarket after witnessing 30+ people not wearing a face mask whilst they shopped. I think this is outrageous and disrespectful and is putting the vulnerable in our community at increased risk.",
        "background": "I want it to become the law that face masks should be worn in public shops or shopping centre by those who do not fall into the exemption criteria. For shop workers to have the power to enforce this or refuse to serve a customer unless proper exemption can be proven. And for fines to be implemented.",
