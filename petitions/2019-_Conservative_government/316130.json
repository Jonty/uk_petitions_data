        "additional_details": "As the exams have been cancelled, I propose the summer term can run into August with the usual 1 week at half term in late June or early July and then 2 weeks off in the last week of August and the first week of September covering the bank holiday weekend. Children will not miss any time in the classroom and parents will not have to find additional resources to cover 6 week holiday after a long lock down. Students will all fall behind in their academic achievements if they are at home 16+ weeks.",
        "background": "Change the Easter school holidays which are normally 2 weeks long into a 6 week break allowing most if not all of the Covid-19 lock down to fall into this period, thus minimizing the amount of time children will be out of the classroom though the academic year. Start summer term on May 11th 2020.",
