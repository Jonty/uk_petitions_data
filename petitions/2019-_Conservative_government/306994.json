There is no reason that this model should not also be implemented by the British Government. Whatever your designation - self-employed, freelance, member of the gig economy, employee or employer, we are equal as workers, equal as taxpayers, equal as citizens of a state, and should be equally supported by our government.",
        "background": "The self-employed, freelancers and gig economy workers pay taxes, just as the employed do. As a matter of principle, we call on government to guarantee 80% earnings of the self-employed, freelancers and gig economy workers, based on an average of the past three years, treating all taxpayers equally.",
