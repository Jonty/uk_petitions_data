        "additional_details": "Pools and gyms are going above and beyond to ensure their facilities are clean and safe. This is reflected in the data which illustrates how the transmission of Covid-19 in these venues is low. Additionally, the mental and physical health benefits they provide actively reduce pressures on the NHS every day. Therefore, the benefits of keeping these facilities open and ensuring our population is mentally and physically robust enough to tackle this virus outweigh the risk of viral transmission.",
        "background": "Things have changed since the first lockdown. The colder temperatures and shorter days leave little opportunity for those working to pursue any form of outdoor exercise. Leisure Centres are a life line for many people struggling with their mental health during this very testing time.",
