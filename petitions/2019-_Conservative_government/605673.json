Much money has been lost (\u00a3100s of millions of public money) and yet no one is being held responsible for these mistakes. In the real world, people would go to jail. Public monies are being given to chums with no scrutiny or oversight. Why are MPs being given a pay rise for (best case) incompetency and worst case (theft)?",
