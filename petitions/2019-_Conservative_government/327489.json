        "additional_details": "I work in Stoke-on-Trent as a teacher. I, at one point in my life, had free school meals. I know first hand the issues that families who receive free school vouchers go through. If we can keep these children properly fed over summer it will not only help these families get back on their feet but also give the students a decent start to the next academic year. DfE data shows 25% of stokes school population are eligible for FSM. 34% were eligible in last 6 years. We can\u2019t let them down like this.",
        "background": "As part of the COVID-19 recovery strategy, maintain the current free school meal voucher scheme until September 2020 so that parents of disadvantaged pupils can \u201cget on their feet\u201d and pupils are ready for the next academic year having been fed properly over summer.",
