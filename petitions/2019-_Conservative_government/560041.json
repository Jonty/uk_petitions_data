        "action": "Replace exams with teacher assessments and optional exams for 2021 in England.",
        "additional_details": "Disruption to life caused by the impacts of COVID-19 has caused huge amounts of stress for students. With COVID-19 countermeasures preventing students from attending school or college for most of 2020, many have received a subpar education and are consequently falling behind. As such, an unacceptable amount of students will not be prepared for 2021 exams. UK Government should replace exams with teacher assessments and allow those students who disagree with their assessment to sit exams.",
        "background": "The Welsh Government has cancelled GCSE, AS Level and A Level examinations for 2021. Grades will instead be based on classroom assessments by teachers. The UK Government should do the same for England, but there should also be the option for students who disagree with their assessment to sit exams.",
