        "additional_details": "After seeing the video of that peadophile in Mitcham yesterday I can not understand how these vile people are allowed to wonder the streets after just a few years in prison. \r\n\r\nThis needs to be seriously looked at and treated as harshly as possible these peadophiles are destroying lives. The victims are handed a life sentence of trauma yet their offenders are free to walk after a few short years.\r\n\r\nExtend the sentencing for Paedophiles keep the children safe.",
        "background": "Peadophiles need to spend way more time behind bars than they currently do. They cause the victim and the victims family so much mental damage they may never fully recover from. I know this as one of my family members was also a victim, yet the offender was let out of prison after just a few years.",
