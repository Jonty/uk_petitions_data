        "additional_details": "Workplaces that employ women of childbearing age should especially provide these facilities. Having a room to express milk in at work should be no less important than having toilets and sinks. It is a human right. Women who breastfeed shouldn't be made to feel like they can't return to work because they have nowhere safe to go. Too many workplaces don't have suitable rooms so women have to choose between returning to work or not working to be able to keep providing breast milk for their children.",
        "background": "Require by law that all work places must provide a safe, clean and lockable room in which to express breast milk in and a fridge to store it in. It's essential for mothers that choose to work and still breastfeed to express, to keep their supply up, to provide for their baby and to prevent mastitis.",
