        "additional_details": "Make it mandatory for secondary schools in England to teach both classical/historical feminism in history, and modern 21st century feminism as part of PSE/PSHE.\r\n \r\nSet outlines of various feminist topics, the importance of both genders' modern struggles, their differences, their similarities, and how we can grow and change. There are hundreds of aspects of feminism that often aren't even mentioned in schools. This needs to change.",
        "background": "Modern feminism in the UK is not taught in many secondary schools. True feminism reflects both the struggles of women, and the struggles of men. Mental health is now taught about and discussed in schools, as is LGBT awareness. However, feminism is too often widely ignored or even disputed.",
