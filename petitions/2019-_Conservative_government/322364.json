        "additional_details": "My 87 year old father has just recovered from COVID-19 after 2 weeks in hospital. On Thursday 21st May he was hit from behind  by a reversing delivery van whilst taking a stroll in his quiet cul-de-sac in the retirement village where he lives. As a result of this I am setting up a campaign to make reversing cameras compulsory on vans and lorries. Surely we should no longer accept the \"if you can't see my wing mirrors I can't see you\" signs on vehicles when the technology is easily available.",
        "background": "I want reversing cameras to be compulsory for all commercial vehicles on the road without a rear view, I am particularly concerned with the increased number of delivery drivers in residential areas without rear view vision.",
