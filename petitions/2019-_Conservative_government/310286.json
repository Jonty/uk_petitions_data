        "additional_details": "Key workers are on some of the lowest wages - healthcare, food production, waste collection etc. Yet, they are expected to risk their lives during the coronavirus outbreak, along with the lives of their family members at home. Although a rise in pay will not prevent workers from getting infected, it would offer some compensation for their daily sacrifice, as well as showing appreciation for the essential work that they do. Some employers have already recognised their staff's contribution, but others must follow suit.",
