        "additional_details": "I am a survivor of abuse and the restraining order made against my abuser was not for long enough, and did not give me adequate time to move forward. A minimum restraining order of 5 years would help give survivors the protection and time they need to move forward.\r\n \r\nI am also requesting that the Government simplify arrangements for extending restraining orders, so that survivors can apply for this and a decision be made without the need for a further court hearing.",
        "background": "We want the Government to require that restraining orders be applied automatically to anyone convicted of domestic violence offences, for a minimum period of 5 years, and longer for the most serious offences. Arrangements for extending restraining orders, where necessary, should also be simplified.",
