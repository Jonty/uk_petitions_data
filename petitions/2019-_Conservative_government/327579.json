        "action": "Increase aid & funding to Yemen as it's on the brink of extinction from Covid-19",
        "additional_details": "Civilians are dying and Yemen is on the brink of extinction. People are dying from curable diseases due to the lack of healthcare. The country can be saved if the UN meets its minimum target for Yemen. 10,000 frontline workers have been de-funded and half of the country's hospitals have faced closures. The city of Aden only has 60 hospital beds with an 800,000 population. This petition is profoundly important.",
        "background": "As Yemen faces Covid-19, the UN lacks \u00a31bn in funding to keep healthcare services afloat. Consequently, half of Yemen's hospitals have closed. We are calling on the UK Government to send aid to Yemen and increase funding to the UN. We also call for arms sales to be halted immediately.",
