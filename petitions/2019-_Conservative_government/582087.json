        "additional_details": "The current method looks at an archaic view of income tax and individual allowances for a household.\r\n\r\nFor a family that has chosen to have one working parent, this is an unnecessary burden on the household finances and penalises the choice that parents wish to make in raising their children.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is to allow full transfer of unused partner's unused personal allowances between spouses and for the HICBTC threshold to be \u00a3100k per household, not \u00a350k per individual.",
        "background": "Currently any member of a household earning over \u00a350,000 has to re-pay child benefit back to the government; however this penalises households that wish to have one parent earning money and the other caring for children; this is doubly unfair with the loss of transfer of marriage allowance.",
