Other children have performed poorly and need the school environment.\r\nParents should be able to decide if their child returns to school without facing punishment.\r\nSchools should support children wish to learn at home by providing the online platforms they did throughout lockdown.\r\nThis in turn would aid the ability to social distance in schools as it would mean less pupils attending",
