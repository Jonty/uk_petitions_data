        "additional_details": "I want the Government to support bio-fuel plants to better contribute to the UK energy mix to help eventually get our non-renewable energy mix down to 10% or lower. Providing more financial support for bio-fuel plants could also help reduce the cost of energy, and so help people and families during the energy crisis to not fall into poverty.",
        "background": "I would like the UK Government to increase funding for bio-fuel plants to help the UK energy crisis and make the energy supply more sustainable. This could include funding to facilitate residential compost waste being used for fuel production.",
