        "action": "Give financial support for low income patients to access cannabis prescriptions.",
        "additional_details": "Cannabis is legally prescribed, but there are very few NHS prescriptions. Thousands of people pay private cannabis clinics for access instead. NHS doctors are not prescribing legal cannabis, effectively locking out those unable to afford private healthcare, and withholding access to a medicine which the wealthy can acquire with  no problem. This discriminates against people in low-paid jobs and on benefits, refusing them access to safe and appropriate healthcare on financial grounds alone.",
        "background": "Private patients legally pay for prescribed cannabis, and consume it without fear of arrest.  It costs \u00a3200+/year in consultations (cannabis an additional \u00a35-\u00a37/gram).  Failure to offer financial support for low income citizens amounts to financial discrimination in access to appropriate healthcare.",
