The recent closure of bars may be the nail in the coffin for many, most which are small family run businesses\r\n\r\nThe UK government must review & reverse this decision to avoid any more impact on people\u2019s financial statuses as well as the affect it has on ones mental health to those who do not typically go to pubs or restaurants.\r\n\r\nShisha bars should reopen with \u2018strict rules\u2019 in place.",
