        "additional_details": "Domestic violence is violence or other abuse in a domestic setting, such as in marriage/ cohabitation. Domestic violence is often used as a synonym for intimate partner violence, which is committed by one of the people in an intimate relationship against the other person. In its broadest sense, domestic violence also involves violence against children, teenagers, parents, or the elderly. It takes multiple forms, including physical, verbal, emotional, economic, religious and sexual abuse.",
        "background": "For too long now perpetrators of domestic violence have got off very lightly indeed. I find this is unfair especially when this impacts the victim and their children for the rest of their lives.",
