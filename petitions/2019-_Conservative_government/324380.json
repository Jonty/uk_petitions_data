        "action": "Demand the approval of a sovereignty/independence referendum in Hong Kong",
        "additional_details": "If the people of Hong Kong do truly consent to the political influence of the PRC, then it is vital that our government pushes the PRC and Hong Kong Government to hold a sovereignty/independence referendum asking whether the people of Hong Kong would like to remain part of the PRC, or become either an Independent nation or a British Overseas Territory. This is a question that has never actually been poised to the people of Hong Kong and given the recent events it is vital their voices are heard.",
        "background": "The Sino-British Joint Declaration stated that the way of life for people of Hong Kong will remain unchanged for 50 years after 1997, this in practise was to protect the democratic capitalist system that was present in Hong Kong, the national security law is in clear violation of the agreed system.",
