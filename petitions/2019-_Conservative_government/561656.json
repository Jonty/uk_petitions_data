        "additional_details": "Freedom of speech makes it possible for individuals to be able to communicate freely and also freely discern the communications shared. Selecting representatives of organisations (i.e. the state, social media platforms) to dictate what is to be communicated as information, versus what is to be censored as misinformation, could become a strategy of political rhetoric used to control a biased narrative. Attempts to criminalise free speech is a dangerous road towards tyrannical government.",

The Covid19 pandemic should not be used to subjugate freedom of speech, including freedom to discuss, criticise, and debate the proposed Covid19 vaccine and the governments response to the pandemic.",
