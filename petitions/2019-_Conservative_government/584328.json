        "additional_details": "No matter how much activism there is, these companies won\u2019t listen unless they have to. If they are no longer allowed to sell in the UK they will see great losses, and this might prompt them to change their ways and find other methods of testing their products. It is our duty to do the right thing for animals who cannot save themselves as human beings, and the government are the people with the most power to change something.",
        "background": "Animals are still being tested on by many companies that are being sold in our shops. Their engagement in animal cruelty is not being sufficiently advertised and a law should be put in place for companies that test on animals, saying they can\u2019t sell their products in the UK.",
