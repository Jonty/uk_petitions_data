Furthermore, if we go into a full lockdown and close the borders the UK could actually have a chance of being COVID free like New Zealand or other such countries who have enlisted a proper full lockdown with proper measures to limit people going out and spreading the illness. Ultimately, we need to limit reckless behaviour to ensure that the future of the country and the younger generation is not ruined",
        "background": "Close all schools and places in which COVID-19 could come into contact with people and introduce a system like Italy or Greece in which permission is needed to leave the house, enlisting fines to those who do not have such permission.",
