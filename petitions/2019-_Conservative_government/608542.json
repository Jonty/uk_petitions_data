        "additional_details": "Around 1 in 3 children have a parent with poor mental health, and these children are 3 times more likely to develop a mental health difficulty themselves. Growing up with mental illness in the family is also recognised as a key risk factor for vulnerability and harm. Yet these children receive no specific support that targets the unique adversities they face. Early, preventative help for these young people could avoid costly crisis intervention at a later stage, and break this cycle of vulnerability.",
        "background": "The children of parents with a mental illness face unique challenges. They need specific support, targeted at their needs. The Government should fund and require local authorities to provide this support. Relevant professionals should be required to make referrals where a need is identified.",
