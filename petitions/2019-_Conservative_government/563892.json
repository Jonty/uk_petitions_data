        "additional_details": "Without urgent action, these services are at imminent risk of closure which would immediately remove much needed childcare support for hundreds of thousands of children from vulnerable and key worker families as well as other hard working families all around the country. Children will also be without their much-loved clubs that support learning and development, social skills, mental health and sporting activity which reduces childhood obesity.",
        "background": "Despite the vital role the wraparound and holiday care sector plays in caring for children outside of school hours, it has been forgotten by the Government and received no direct financial support. The sector requires emergency funding to retain staff and keep services open.",
