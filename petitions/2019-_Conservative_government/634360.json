        "additional_details": "There are so many babies being born asleep under 24 weeks that aren't being registered. The truth is these babies are still human beings and deserve to be recognised properly. Its heartbreaking hearing no birth certificate can be given when your heart is breaking. When I gave birth there were 6 other mums who gave birth on the same day. Surely now in this day and age the law has to change. 24 weeks just isn't right and lots of parents want certificates to help mourn the loss of their babies.",
        "background": "I would like the law changed so all babies born still at 10 weeks and over get a birth certificate. In 2020 I gave birth to a baby girl at 16 weeks to then be told she would never be registered as a person as she was born under 24 weeks. No parent who is grieving their loss needs to hear this.",
