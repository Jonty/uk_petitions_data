        "action": "Allow registered Clinical Scientists to prescribe medication",
        "additional_details": "The current inability to prescribe medication can introduce significant delays in diagnostics and treatments for patients engaging in Clinical Scientist led services. Currently, Clinical Scientists must establish the drugs needed for a particular diagnostic test or treatment but then refer patients back to their GP or another medical colleague, who may be less familiar with the case, to provide the prescription. This also introduces significant burden on these staff as well a duplication of work.",
        "background": "We want the Government to change the law to allow Clinical Scientists registered with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) to prescribe medication. This could reduce delays in patients receiving essential medication, increase efficiency, and reduce the burden on other medical colleagues.",
