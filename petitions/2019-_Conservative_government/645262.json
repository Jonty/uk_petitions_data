        "additional_details": "Vasectomy is a less invasive procedure and does not alter the endocrine system / production of testosterone therefore causing less stress and physical changes to the dog. Castration has the potential to change a dogs behaviour and this can mean making a dog aggressive and potentially changing its relationships with its owner and other familiar animals in the household.\r\nVasectomy is a 100% way of limiting breeding without interfering with a dogs nature. Vasectomy details can be added to ID chip.",
        "background": "We would like to government to consider vasectomy as an additional option to castration for dogs that will be determined as an XL Bully type or other breed as described in the dangerous dogs act 1991.",
