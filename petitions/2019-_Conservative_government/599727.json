Thus, creating inequality. We believe putting financial pressure on couples could lead to many taking unsafe, unregulated routes to conceive.\r\n \r\nWe understand that government resources are stretched however everyone, regardless of sexuality or relationship status should have an equal chance of being able to start a family.",
        "background": "NICE guidance says a same-sex couple should have six self-funded, unsuccessful attempts at IUI before they receive treatment through the NHS. This is 6 further rounds of IUI, followed by IVF. One round of self-funded IUI can cost over \u00a31,000. IVF should be available to same-sex couples on request.",
