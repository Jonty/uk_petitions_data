Parents of these children have to wait 5 months to get funding.\r\n\r\nWe urge the UK Parliament to consider this petition and take immediate action to rectify this disparity in childcare provision, helping to ensure that every child has equal access to early education and care, and every parent has the opportunity to pursue their employment goals without unnecessary delay.\r\n\r\nIt feels unjust to wait 5 months until autumn term to access funding with other children who are 9 months or older, if your child turns 2 years old in April 2024.",
