        "additional_details": "There is a lot of uncertainty on how colleges are assessing their students who are resitting GCSEs this year. The government needs to make it clearer on how students are to be assessed as this is causing tremendous amounts of anxiety for students in colleges. This should be fair, and the same across the board so that all students have the same chances and opportunities.",
        "background": "Many colleges have started the academic year online with students having never gone in to classes. This is added pressure as the online learning experience has put many students, including myself, at a disadvantage. Colleges should use a coursework method instead of exams for assessing GCSEs.",
