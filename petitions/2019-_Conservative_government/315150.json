        "additional_details": "For most prisoners these weekly visits get them through their time in prison and improve their mental health, stop reoffending when released, overall rehabilitation, it maintains family ties, and prevent self harm and violence in prisons. Visits are also a lifeline for family members to see their loved ones, especially children, allowing them to continue a relationship and bond with their parent, which then improves the mental health of these children and will help prevent them becoming offenders and breaking that cycle. Children don\u2019t need to be punished for their parent\u2019s mistakes and choices in life. It would be a start to allow prisoners with young children weekly video link visits, as this suspension of visits is causing a huge impact on prisoners and their young children.",
