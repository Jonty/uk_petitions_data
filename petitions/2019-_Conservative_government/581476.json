        "additional_details": "MPs are elected by the people of this country into paid positions, where they should be expected to behave appropriately, honestly and professionally. Regardless of party, all MPs should set an example to the country in their words and deeds. This is particularly important for our young people, as they need to see that there are consequences for lawbreaking for everybody.",
        "background": "Where investigations prove lawbreaking or bullying, in line with others in positions of responsibility such as headteachers, this must result in immediate dismissal. Currently the PM can simply disagree with the findings, and the person continues in their role with impunity, which is unacceptable.",
