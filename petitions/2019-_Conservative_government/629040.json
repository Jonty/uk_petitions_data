        "action": "Establish an independent energy policy including onshore gas extraction.",
        "additional_details": "Europe including the UK face an existential threat from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Mr Putin is threatening to cut all of the remaining Russian gas supplies to Europe. Russia has the capability of severing undersea gas pipelines from Norway to the UK and Europe, whilst denying that he has already carried out such action. \r\nThe Eastern European War will in all probability be a very long and drawn out conflict lasting years if not decades. \r\nWe must be prepared for such an eventuality.",
        "background": "To maintain a viable economy and lessen the threats from Russia and unreliable autocracies the United Kingdom should establish a safe, environmentally friendly, commercial viable and independent onshore gas extraction industry. Such an industry won\u2019t delay Net Zero but help defend us strategically.",
