        "action": "Update KCSIE to protect children from peer on peer abuse to an absolute decree.",
        "additional_details": "If a child has been a victim of peer on peer abuse (online, physical, sexual, or any other harm - perceived or real) there\u2019s many things a school should do, but nothing they must do. Schools must be made to allow a child to make their own choices in regards to what happens after a report of violence (moving class, separated from the perpetrator). Those who uphold a sustained pattern of abuse should be looked at as candidates for expulsion (especially where they could harm other children)",
        "background": "I think that KCSIE Must be updated in a way that ensures children are protected to a higher degree. Many more parts of KCSIE guidance must be changed so that schools cannot avoid taking steps within a child\u2019s best personal interest (including DSLs, headteachers, SLT etc), unless it would cause harm.",
