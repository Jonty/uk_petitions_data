        "action": "Increase support for the nightlife economy sector during the pandemic.",
        "additional_details": "The UK's nightlife sector is worth \u00a366 billion. It is the 5th biggest industry in the UK making 8% of all employment opportunities. \r\nSince we went into Lockdown, nightclubs and events have been unable to reopen in any form of capacity.  Whilst pubs and bars have been limited due to restrictions making it harder for them to compete with supermarkets. The 10pm curfew has now shackled the industry further and without appropriate support now, there will be no more industry post pandemic.",
        "background": "Provide a robust support package for buisnesses that fall within the late-night sector and therefore are most affected by current restrictions.  In addition, ensure that any further restrictions have sufficient scientific backing prior to public announcement.",
