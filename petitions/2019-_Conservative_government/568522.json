        "additional_details": "A typical child with no SEN needs who meets the criteria can access the 30 hours of free childcare funding. \r\nA child with SEN needs who meets the criteria is entitled to the same 30 hours of free childcare but it often cannot be accessed due to a 15 hour cap in SEN inclusion funding.  \r\nThis is not treating all children as equals. \r\nRaising the SEN inclusion fund to 30 hours a week to equal the 30 hour free childcare will enable children who are already at a disadvantage reach there full potential.",

The limit of funding is capped at 15 hours leaving a short fall of 15 hours with out 1:1 support. SEN early years children cannot access the 30 hours free childcare element as the SEN inclusion fund doesn\u2019t match this.",
