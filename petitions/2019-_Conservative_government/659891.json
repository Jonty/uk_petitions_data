        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to fund a financial scheme which will cover the debts of cancer patients. Cancer can strike any of us at any age at any time, we may be in a good financial position at the time, but following diagnosis lives can be turned upside down, and patients don't know what the future holds. Some may be parents of young children. The Government can help to lift the financial burden off them and lift the burden of worry.",
        "background": "Cancer patients have a battle ahead of them, sometimes their biggest worry is finance. Some will have lost their jobs, and can no longer sustain themselves. Save them the pain of their families having to deal with debts. After all they deserve dignity. ",
