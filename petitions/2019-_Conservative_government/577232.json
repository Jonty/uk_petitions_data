        "action": "The Government must implement COVID vaccination passports.",
        "additional_details": "The Government should recognise the freedom of people to not be vaccinated, but equally accept the right and freedom of those willing to be vaccinated, out of respect for the safety of others as a community, to choose who they spend time with as part of normal life based on vaccination. The freedom to not be vaccinated is NOT a freedom to inflict illness and death on others. If they choose to refuse the vaccine, they should accept the impairment on their lives not to impair others.",
        "background": "COVID vaccination passports are essential to allow citizens of the UK the liberty of safely deciding who they spend time with in leisure settings, at work, on transport or in public service on the basis that they will neither contract nor pass on Covid or variants to others who may consequently die.",
