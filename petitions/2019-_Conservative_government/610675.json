        "action": "Revoke plans for Gavin Williamson to receive a knighthood.",
        "additional_details": "Williamson oversaw a new exam system during Covid. A mix of computer algorithm and teacher assessment created obviously unfair marks which Williamson initially defended before it was changed. Unions hold Williamson responsible for the lack of support on home schooling and confused messaging over school return. Williamson refused to extend holiday food vouchers/free meals for poorer children. The decisions were reversed after pressure from Marcus Rashford. He was sacked from cabinet in September.",
        "background": "This petition calls for the Prime Minister to reconsider his approval for Gavin Williamson to receive a knighthood and rescind his decision.\r\n\r\nThis petition should demonstrate anger at plans to award Williamson with a knighthood, subsequently devaluing the honours system.",
