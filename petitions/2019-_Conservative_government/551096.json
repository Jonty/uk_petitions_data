        "action": "legalise cannabis for ages 16+ in the uk",
        "additional_details": "Cannabis has been used recreationally and medicinally for thousands of years, so why is it illegal now?\r\nAnd while the government continues to say that it is harmful to the mind and body, Im willing to bet that there are millions of people who would say otherwise.\r\nI have personally seen ways that it has been used to help people with certain illnesses. I saw a young boy maybe 15/16 with parkinsons shaking and disoriented, he was then given a small dosage of this herb and he was fine shortly after.",
        "background": "We want the uk government to properly review the possible risks of using cannabis, and when they have come to a sensible conclusion, legalise it for ages 16+. \r\nWe also want the cultivation and sales of cannabis to be legalised.",
