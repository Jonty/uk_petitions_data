CAHMS currently accounts for 0.7% of the NHS funding. The support for diagnosis is devastating, people are waiting years to get the diagnosis that they need. Appointments being cancelled... National Lockdowns... This has all lead to a downfall in teenager mental health. CAHMS is worth 6.4% out of 11% in the mental health spending. This still isn't ok!",
        "background": "With COVID-19 pandemic, Teenagers and youngsters have left with either fake news or mixed opinions about what is happening. This leads to the mental drain and lack of concentration when it comes to their online education. Education should also be doing their best to ensure students are well.",
