        "additional_details": "Example, when I get on a bus they driver does not say that will be a \u00a31 please oh and an extra 10p for the oil and to cover tyre replacement, no everything is tied up in a single price and for that I get the trip I need, likewise with the extortionate profits the energy firms make they can upkeep the infrastructure first from profits not using the standing charge as a way to boost profits, then they can pay dividends second third etc. Other business have to show inclusive charges why not them?",
        "background": "I want a law introduced that makes energy firms responsible for the upkeep for the infrastructure not to pass it on by an unfair charge that only benefits them and their shareholders. Ofgem does not seem to have the teeth/ power to make this happen so its time Parliament backed the people for once",
