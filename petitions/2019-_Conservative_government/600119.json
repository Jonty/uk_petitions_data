        "additional_details": "The current process of buying and selling property is essentially flawed & immoral allowing gazimping & multiple surveys done on one property which should be done by a seller once only. It\u2019s a poorly performing process that ultimately benefits neither the buyer, the seller.  The Scottish system offers to buy and sell are legally binding at the point the offer is made and accepted. This ensures trust in the process and speeds up the process of housing transactions, once offers are agreed.",
        "background": "Make house buying the same legal and fair  process in England and Wales as is in Scotland. To stop immoral practices such as gazumping either way, and sellers hiding property faults. Surveys should be done by a seller for all buyers to view to protect the buyer as it\u2019s a big financial purchase.",
