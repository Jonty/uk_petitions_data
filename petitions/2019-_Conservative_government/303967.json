        "additional_details": "Why should the tax payer bail out billionaires with enough money to end poverty in Britain who can easily keep their own businesses afloat when there are small businesses throughout Britain that will go bankrupt and have to lay of staff that are more in need of the financial help during this difficult time.\r\n\r\nPast bail outs to billionaire companies have resulted in their staff still being paid a low wage and their management still receiving astronomical bonuses",
        "background": "We the people want the government to not bail out billionaires and their companies during this episode of economic decline as they have enough money to support their selves and their employees and to instead provide financial support to small businesses",
