Staff are threatened, assaulted, and exposed to horrific self harm, mental health issues. We wear many hats during any single shift, from social worker, advisor, disciplinarian, first responder etc. \r\nWe maintain discipline and keep the public safe by making escape as impossible as we are able. We work hard to rehabilitate offenders and reduce their risk to the public, and improving the quality of their lives if released. I like many of my old colleagues am proud of my service during her majesty\u2019s rein and would like to wear a veteran\u2019s badge as the military veterans are able to. .",
