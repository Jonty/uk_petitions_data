        "additional_details": "The Self Employed/ Freelance workforce are some of the most vulnerable workers at this unique point in History. Self Employed businesses are equally important to any other Small business and often run with very little or no financial buffer zone. It is not alright for the Government to expect those in this sector to loose their jobs and sign on to Universal Credit while support is being given to others Small businesses to save their workforce. We require equality, respect and equal support.",
        "background": "I want The Chancellor of The Exchequer The RT Hon Rishi Sunak Mp and The Government to extend the right of access to the 80% wage retention grant announced 20/03/2020 to The Self Employed and Freelance Workforce and therefore include all Small businesses. I request there be parity for all.",
