        "additional_details": "People deserve the choice between full sugar and diet without having to pay more. This tax has made soft drinks that people once enjoyed, and most people had as a treat, too expensive. The tax has led to more sweetener-based drinks, but many people prefer sugar to artificial sweeteners. Instead of taxing unhealthy food and drinks, we should be teaching people to live a healthy lifestyle.",
        "background": "The Government should scrap the sugar tax on soft drinks that was introduced in April 2018. It was introduced to help tackle obesity, but not everybody needs to lose weight.",
