        "additional_details": "If the Government were to change the laws to fit more modern day cultures, they would see an increase in both a child\u2019s parent playing and active part in their lives. All too often parents are withholding children out of spite and jealousy but are happy to receive maintenance payments, if those payments were to stop if a child was withheld for no justified reason then the resident parent would be more reluctant to stop contact. This would also see a decline in poor mental health in children.",
        "background": "We want the government to stop the compulsory child maintenance payments in cases where the resident parent stops contact for the non-resident (NRP) parent without justifiable reasoning. NRPs should not have to pay for a child they are being withheld from.",
