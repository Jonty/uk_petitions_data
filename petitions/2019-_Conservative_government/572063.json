        "background": "currently if you receive points that expire in 3 years insurance companies demand to inform them for 5 years. \r\nThis is just a way to boost premiums. \r\nPoints valid for 3 years stay on licence for 4 only for court information, a driver should not have to declare them once they reach the expiry date.",
