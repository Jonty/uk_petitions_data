        "additional_details": "While bars and social clubs in most workplaces such as offices, factories, hospitals and police stations have closed, bars in the HoC have remained open. There is no special case for MPs being able to go to bars at wok, especially given the reports of misbehaviour whilst under the influence of alcohol, and the importance of decision making in the HoC. When they drink, individuals are more likely to be impulsive. The area around the HOC has adequate places to drink after the working day if needed.",
