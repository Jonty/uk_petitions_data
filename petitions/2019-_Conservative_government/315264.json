        "additional_details": "A 2018 survey by BMJ found that 37.7% of foundation year doctors immediately took up a specialty post, down from 42.6% in 2017, 50.4% in 2016, and 71.3% in 2011.\r\n\r\nWe're losing medical talent because we're not supporting them. We're compromising our medical capabilities and damaging our NHS by not telling those who put themselves on the frontline of health that we care and we want to support them.",
        "background": "The Coronavirus outbreak has shed light on how invaluable our NHS is - regrettably it's a value that most have only realised at a time of crisis. This proposal is to incentivise more students to become doctors, knowing that they won't be laden with student debt for taking up the noblest profession.",
