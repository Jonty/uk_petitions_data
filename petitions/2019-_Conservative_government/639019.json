        "additional_details": "While it is perfectly acceptable to take a pet with a UK Animal Health Certificate on a private leisure boat to the EU, it is currently only possible for it to return on approved public transport routes, mostly in a car.\r\n\r\nThis is preventing private boat owners the enjoyment of family holidays in France and throughout the EU, with their pets.\r\n\r\nThe EU is welcoming of UK Certified pets and still operates a Pet Passport Scheme which unfortunately, we do not. So amending this restrictive rule is next best.",

Allow pets with UK Animal Health Certificates that have completed the exit procedure (supervised worming administration) to renter the UK in private vessels.",
