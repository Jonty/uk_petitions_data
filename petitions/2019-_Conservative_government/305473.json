        "additional_details": "Covid-19 is a public health crisis that the UK - and the world - has not experienced for over 100 years.\r\n\r\nYet how come celebrities, politicians, and business people have been able to access covid-19 testing ahead of vulnerable and elderly people and emergency service staff? The answer is because these privaledged few have the means to access private healthcare that the majority do not.\r\n\r\nPrivate healthcare must be brought into public management to 'level up' the NHS during this crisis.",
        "background": "We expect the UK government to act in the interest of the general public, not the privaledged few, by bringing private healthcare into public management for the duration of the covid-19 pandemic to help the NHS deal with this national emergency.",
