        "additional_details": "We understand that the veterinarian business is a business. But they are preying on vulnerable people who are willing to pay anything to ensure their loved pet reminds healthy. From research, I\u2019ve seen that the prices they charge for routine blood tests, prescriptions and general examinations are more than what the average UK citizen can afford. Not everyone has pet insurance. Vets aren\u2019t offering payment options or plans for those on a lower income. Please look into this.",
        "background": "Vets state that they do their role for the \u201clove of the animals\u201d. Most of the time this is untrue. They have been charging ridiculous prices for years and have been getting away with it for too long. How are they allowed to charge \u00a355 for some antibiotics when you can buy them online for \u00a310?",
