The Government has also said it will roll-out pilots of \u2018Project Vigilant\u2019 across the country, which is an internationally award winning-approach taken by Thames Valley Police where both uniformed and plain clothes officers identify predatory and suspicious offenders in the night time economy. This can involve officers attending areas around clubs and bars undercover to better ensure women are safe in these locations, and increased patrols as people leave at closing time: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-moves-to-provide-reassurance-to-women-and-girls-15-march-2021\r\n\r\nIf you want the Government to provide funding for local police forces to increase policing at night we could accept a petition requesting this, but you'd need to provide your full name."
