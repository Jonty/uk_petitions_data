        "additional_details": "Our NHS has been underfunded for many years by successive Governments. It has been constantly used as a political football with no slack in the system.\r\nI believe that before these extraordinary times, we as a caring society  would want our health service to be a priority, and would want our NHS workers to be more valued in society, with an income that reflects that.\r\nPost-Coronavirus we want the Government to commit to funding the NHS significantly above the inflation rate indefinitely.",
        "background": "As a caring society, we would like the current Government, to take the politics out of our health system and commit to an irreversible long term financial plan which puts some slack into the system. Even before this crisis the NHS was working at its limits, with staff struggling under the pressure.",
