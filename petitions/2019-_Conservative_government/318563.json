        "additional_details": "In April 2014 the government had said that they are willing to create a Student loan that is compliant with Sharia law. So far, it's been about 6 years and there hasn't been any progress or update whatsoever on what is going to happen. The government should make education available for everyone, any race, religion etc, so that, in this scenario, muslims also get an equal chance at further education",
        "background": "Parliament should ensure that a Sharia Compliant Student loan is available for Muslim students who are unable to use the government's student loan scheme, due to the fact that their religion prevents them from paying interest. It should be implemented as soon as possible.",
