The UK must abandon these old principles and focus on the development and use of Non Animal Methods.\r\n \r\nHaving an independent NAMs specialist committee review applications for Project Licences (PPLs) prior to their approval, so that a licence is only granted if there is no replacement method.\r\n \r\nCommercial breeders of laboratory animals are profit rather than animal-welfare focused.\r\n",
