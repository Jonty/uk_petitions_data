        "additional_details": "High school has become a huge concern to the\r\nParents and Guardians as school grades have\r\ndropped dramatically due to teachers not\r\nproviding the attention\u2026students needs, the\r\nsafeguarding has gone down over the years as\r\nthere has been many complaints of SA being\r\nbrushed under the carpet and instead focused on LGBT, shaming the students who have cried for\r\nhelp and they have done nothing about it. This\r\nbehaviour is unacceptable as i am scared for the\r\nfuture generation who attend these schools.",
        "background": "Due to high demand from all students and parents\r\nat various high schools, we are hoping that you\r\nhave the ability to resolve our problem for the\r\nsafety and Well Being of students who attend\r\nthese High Schools, and make females feel comfortable being able to use bathrooms for their\r\nlady needs.",
