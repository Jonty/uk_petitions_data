This review should be used to drive improvements in patient care.\r\n\r\nMyocarditis is a rare heart condition that, if left undiagnosed, can be fatal. It is difficult to diagnose due to how it presents and its rarity. It can be hard to diagnose as the symptoms can mimic other illnesses like on-going flu-like symptoms, post viral lethargy and even anxiety.",
