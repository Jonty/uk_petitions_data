        "action": "Increase help for those struggling with mental health during COVID-19",
        "additional_details": "Poor mental health will affect more individuals than COVID-19. This is an undeniable fact. Given that the NHS is already seriously overstretched and people have less freedom and liberty in their daily lives, it should be crucial that there is an increase in the available help and advice that is needed. No doubt that this is a dark time we are living in, but it is made all the more darker for people who feel there is no escape from their own mental health. Much more can and should to be done",
        "background": "It is becoming harder and harder for people with mental health problems to seek, access and receive much needed help during the COVID-19 pandemic. More attention needs to be given to this sensitive area to ensure that more people are given the help they may desperately need.",
