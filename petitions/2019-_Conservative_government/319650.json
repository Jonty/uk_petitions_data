It is critically important that significant funds are made available to remedy this injustice.\r\n\r\nThe UN\u2019s target for 'Foreign Aid' for all developed countries is 0.7% of GNP.  Currently for the U.K. this is \u00a314 billion a year.  \r\n\r\nThe Department for International Development (DFID) is charged with allocating the \u00a314.  Since there is no way DFID can allocate this amount of money to U.K. driven projects; 40% (\u00a36 billion) is passed to trilateral bodies (e.g. EU, UN) for them to disburse. \r\n\r\nThis must stop: and with the focus now on our Care Homes, this \u00a36 billion must be allocated to this deprived sector of our society.",
