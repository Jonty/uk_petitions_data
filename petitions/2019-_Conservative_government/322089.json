        "additional_details": "We believe the risk of infection is better managed by offering travellers the alternative of paying for a test upon entry where a negative result exempts any quarantine requirement. A further test a few days later could also be mandatory if that was shown to be necessary to reduce risk to below the current quarantine measures. \r\n\r\nThis combination should both manage the risk of infection better and would vastly increase certainty, enabling business and leisure travel to recover. We crave both safety and freedom and testing offers much the best opportunity to maximise both. ",
