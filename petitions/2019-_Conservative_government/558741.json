The last couple of months before exams are often a time when students improve considerably and exams are the only way that can really accurately portray this.",
        "background": "Coming from a students point of view (A-Level) we have been working hard for a while towards these exams. Cancelling them means that it has all been for nothing. Additionally, our true potential cannot be shown and instead our predicted grades will be used, which are rarely accurate.",
