        "additional_details": "Why can't the universal credit work out the payment on a 13 yearly payment system instead of 12 or instead of it being date to date it should be month by month so as most people don't get paid twice in a single month and therefore wouldn't miss a payment. Something needs to be addressed as its not fair as many people are paid 4 weekly and even weekly.",
        "background": "4 weekly paid employees sometimes get paid twice in a universal credit calendar month so they don't receive any benefit money, this is unfair as the bills don't stop or food costs. We don't have funds to save for those months otherwise we wouldn't need to rely on the government to feed ourselves.",
