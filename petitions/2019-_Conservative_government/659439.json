        "additional_details": "The media regularly report on the push for individuals to take a vaccine to protect themselves or others from harm, yet vaccines can cause side effects. If we are being encouraged to take a vaccine to protect society then surely both society (taxpayer), and pharmaceutical companies who take the profits have a duty to adequately support those who suffer a permanent adverse reaction. We believe the current scheme is not fit for purpose and fails to adequately support those harmed.",
        "background": "Impose a new tax on pharmaceutical companies in order to reduce the burden of funding of the Vaccine Damage Payment on the taxpayer. Abolish the 60% disability criteria and the fixed award of 120k. Replace with a tiered system with the award assessed upon the level of disability caused.\r\n",
