This has been drastically reduced to 6 months time. There are a lot of people out there including myself who have saved for years with only having the chance to put \u00a3200 limit away a month to all of a sudden not having the chance to own a home. This is an unfair decision and something needs to be done about it.",
        "background": "I want the Government to extend the completion of a new build date to be extended. It was announced in June 2022 that the help to buy ISA scheme was ending and that the house had to be completed by 31st December 2022. This only allows 6 months for a house to be built in time.",
