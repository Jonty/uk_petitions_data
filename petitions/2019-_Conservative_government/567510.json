Mental health should be just as much a priority as intellectual ability in schools. Put the people first? Offer them what they need to be people and not just objects in system to circulate money. Prioritise mental health, it should be taught not something a school can choose to discuss.",
        "background": "I am so passionate about the fact there is no where near enough information provided to children in schools about eating disorders. Even the term is so vague because there are so many forms. The disordered thinking, like body dysmorphia, is often a thing many are unaware of and this needs to change.",
