The evidence for medicinal use of cannabis is overwhelming and it is utterly despicable that the current English government can deny anyone in Scotland access to medicine such as cannabis whilst they already acknowledge it\u2019s medicinal properties. Cannabis is the opposite of a gateway drug, alcohol is the problem.",
