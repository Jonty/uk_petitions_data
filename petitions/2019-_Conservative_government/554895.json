        "additional_details": "The Government is artificially inflating Covid-19 deaths by including people who clearly did not die FROM Covid-19 (but only WITH Covid-19, even after they have recovered).  The ONS is also conflating pneumonia and flu deaths with Covid-19 deaths.\r\n\r\nThe Government is not timely reporting excess non-Covid-19 deaths, even though these are REQUIRED for people to obtain a more balanced view of the impact of Covid-19 and to correctly assess the risks from the \"cure\" versus the risks from the disease.",
        "background": "The Government should report Covid-19 deaths correctly.  Only people who die from Covid-19 (with severe Covid-19 symptoms and in an ICU) should be counted.\r\n\r\nThe Government should report excess non-Covid-19 deaths at the same time as Covid-19 deaths - to ensure proper balance in media reporting.",
