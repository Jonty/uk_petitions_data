        "additional_details": "While writing this we are in another lockdown. Our limited broadband means we cannot have a single virtual meeting without it failing due to poor connection never mind multiple users on the internet.  My three children and my partner and I are trying to work from home which is impossible because of our broadband speed. We also have to pay more expensive broadband charges to get worse speeds compared to those in cities and towns.",
        "background": "As promised at the last election, we want the government to provide fast broadband to all UK homes and businesses and not penalise those living and working in rural areas.",
