        "additional_details": "People have no choice but to visit those essential indoor spaces listed above. People will have a choice whether to attend the venues you are opening up with no restrictions such as pubs, cinemas etc. It is unfair to those who will not be protected as too few will wear masks, unless they are mandated, forcing vulnerable people back into isolating instead of carrying out essential tasks safely. Their only choice will be LIFE or DEATH!",

There are many still at risk from the virus such as those who're immune suppressed, unvaccinated or vulnerable in other ways.",
