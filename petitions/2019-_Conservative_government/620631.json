        "additional_details": "I have been living in a building complex with hundreds of residents with false alarms going off almost every 10 days. It has taken more than 2 hours for the local response team to switch off the false alarm. Currently there are no legal requirements for landlords to respond to false alarms, leaving it entirely up to the management company to decide how long the residents are forced out. If a landlord fails to respond to a false alarm within 15 minutes, residents should be entitled to compensation.",
        "background": "Introduce a regulation to fill the current void which people living in rented accommodation can be neglected when a false fire alarm is reported, as the fire department may not respond to false fire alarms, leaving residents at the mercy of the accommodation management.",
