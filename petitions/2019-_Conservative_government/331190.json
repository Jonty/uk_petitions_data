        "additional_details": "The Institute for Economic Research estimates that by licencing Cannabis retail, the UK economy would be boosted by up to \u00a31.25billion in tax revenue and cutting the cost of policing.\r\n\r\nScientific research, including peer cited PMC4311234 (PMCID) concluded that cannabis is over 100 times safer than alcohol and less addictive than Caffeine.\r\n\r\nThe benefits are too vast to restrict to the 500 characters allowed, including but not limited to, the reduction of illegal drug abuse and pain relief.",
        "background": "1. Declassify Cannabis as a class B drug.\r\n2. Allow adults aged 21 years and older to buy, consume and possess Cannabis for personal use (subject to a limit of 28.5 grams).\r\n3. Implement licences for business premises to retail Cannabis and cannabis derived products.",
