We will however prevent many deaths, not to mention ruined lives.\r\n\r\nNext time, lockdown the borders, not the people.",

Chapter 4.18 of the PPS wrongly states that we shouldn\u2019t impose any travel bans during a pandemic. This chapter cited a paper written by Neil Ferguson in July 2006.",

There is no indication that the position regarding travel bans set out in this paper is the Government's policy regarding all novel viruses or pandemics.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling on the Government to ban travel from any foreign region with a novel virus, provided this did not misrepresent current Government policy."
