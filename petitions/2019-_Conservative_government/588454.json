        "additional_details": "I believe that crimes within prison walls would fall as everyone would want to be considered a \u201cwell behaved prisoner\u201d in order to get their visit. As well as this it would help keep the connection to partners outside giving prisoners a better reason to rehabilitate and get out of jail! \r\nThey are allowed in 10/23 European countries and countries that allow it have lower rates or reoffending. \r\nAs well as this it would massively help prisoners mental health as well as their loved ones.",
        "background": "To allow UK prisoners to have an annual conjugal visit with their partners; if their behaviour exceeds the behaviour expected by the prison. \r\nWhen someone is sent to jail it affects not only them but their loved ones. conjugal visits would help keep the bond and therefore help rehabilitate them.",
