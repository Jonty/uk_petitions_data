        "additional_details": "In some states and under certain circumstances, learner drivers in the USA are allowed to take the theory test (written test) at home while people at the test centre record their screen remotely. Taking a theory test at test centres can be stressful and sometimes inconvenient if you're unable to get to the test centre. Having the ability to take your test at home could ease the stress and reduce any backlog the DVLA may have with people wanting to take the test.",
