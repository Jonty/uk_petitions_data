For example, a worker would give 3 days\u2019 notice for 1 day\u2019s leave.\r\n\r\nAn employer can refuse a leave request or cancel leave but they must give as much notice as the amount of leave requested, plus 1 day. For example, an employer would give 11 days\u2019 notice if the worker asked for 10 days\u2019 leave.\r\n\r\nIf the contract says something different about the notice a worker or employer should give, what\u2019s in the contract will apply.\r\n\r\nAlthough employers can refuse to give leave at a certain time, they cannot refuse to let workers take the leave at all.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, we could accept a petition calling on the Government to prevent employers from requiring staff to give more than the general notice period for leave, if that's what you want to happen."
