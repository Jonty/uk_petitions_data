        "action": "Deter police misconduct and criminal damage to domestic abuse victims property",
        "additional_details": "Many victims of domestic abuse have endured criminal damage to their property by their alleged perpetrators or witnessed it having been done to their family members as children or as adults. For the police themselves to permanently damage the property of a victim is abusive and a form of psychological torture - particularly during a time of war, scarcity of resources, inflation and unemployment. I\u2019d like criminal damage to our nations history to result in officers being prosecuted and sacked.",
        "background": "In light of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021. Enforce every Constabularly across England & Wales, to open up historic/current investigations by initial default procedure into alleged police misconduct + covert/criminal damage, even if there is no evidence of which officer/s did it because of gaslighting.",

We understand that you're concerned about police misconduct, but we're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. Your petition refers to an \"initial default procedure\", but we're not sure what you mean by this.\r\n\r\nThere are already procedures for complaining about police officers, and various sanctions and criminal offences - including criminal damage - where there a police officer is guilty of misconduct, but investigating complaints is a matter for individual police forces and the Independent Office for Police Conduct. Decisions about criminal procedures are a matter for the Crown Prosecution Service and the courts.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about making a complain about the police here: https://www.policeconduct.gov.uk/complaints-reviews-and-appeals/make-complaint"
