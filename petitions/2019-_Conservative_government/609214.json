        "additional_details": "Student nurses work incredibly hard and are the next generation of nursing. With staffing shortages and a desperate need to meet the needs of the NHS, our aim is to give back to our healthcare service. But we need help to be able to achieve this. We are taking time away from our studies and children to pay for our childcare and it\u2019s leaving many burning out. This is not maintainable.\r\n\r\nWith the support, we can focus on our roles as parents, being a student and future nurse.",
        "background": "The Government should extend eligibility for the childcare grant to part-time student nurses. Currently, students who study over 37.5h per week are entitled to 85% childcare costs, or a fixed amount, whichever is less. Students inc. student nurses who study over 27h per week are not eligible.",
