        "additional_details": "Half of children at special schools have a sight problem yet over 40% have never received any eye care. My daughter had her sight tests in her day special school through the NHS Special Schools Eye Care Service. The plan to roll this out to all special schools has stalled despite many benefits eg. reducing visits to hospital clinics. The Health & Care Act 2022 and other legislation could be used to secure this service and other eye care improvements needed for people with learning disabilities.",
        "background": "The Government should provide funding to ensure there is a national special schools eye care service in England, so children with high support needs get the NHS sight tests and glasses they need. It should also secure targeted community eye care services for people with learning disabilities.",
