        "additional_details": "After this extremely hard year, pupils have had a worrying amount disruption and coincidently, are behind in their knowledge leaving them without the necessary skills to complete an exam this school year. Schools are forcing pupils to complete full length exam papers like every year before when this is simply not fair on these pupils. Continuous small assessments are how pupils were supposed to be graded this year so this cruel twist is simply not fair and will not be taken lightly.",
        "background": "Stop schools from giving students full exam papers to sit this May with very little notice, no study leave and minimum supported study classes with teachers. It's wrecking our mental wellbeing after a year of damage from the pandemic.",
