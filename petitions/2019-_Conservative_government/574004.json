        "additional_details": "Animal cruelty comes in many forms. What is happening right now is pet shops and private sellers are allowing the sale of small pets to individuals who are uneducated on the proper needs and requirements of these animals. It would be cruel to keep a cat in its travel case, as it is cruel to keep a rabbit in a hutch less than a metres length. They may be small, but animals such as hamsters, guinea pigs and rabbits are still living creatures which deserve a better quality of life under our care.",
        "background": "Small pets deserve the same protection we award to dogs and cats. For example, PDSA states that the minimum requirement for 2 guinea pigs is 4ft by 2ft, and yet guinea pigs are being kept in cages too small for even a hamster.",
