        "additional_details": "It is a waste of PHE efforts, Policing, and Tax payers money, as well as human sacrifices of all the families across the country. Why the government has not provided a national testing plan  pre-winter truce with Covid-19? How can people from different tiers mix? Why private sectors are selling PCR tests for \u00a389-315 per test? Should not the PHE provide a free test for anyone who is planning to travel home for Christmas before simply allowing everyone to move around the country?",
        "background": "After the two strict lockdowns, is it really a time to waste it all away for a 5 day celebration, to then potentially to force the entire country to move into a third national lockdown. Prevent people from travelling between the different tiers for Christmas.",
