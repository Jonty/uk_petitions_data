        "action": "Reform of judicial system to increase punishments and deter crime.",
        "additional_details": "The current system for punishing crime is far too weak and laid back. Criminals do not fear the punishments they may receive and thus have no qualms committing all manner of crimes. This is a widespread issue, affecting all crimes including drugs, violence, sexual crime and vehicle crime.\r\n\r\nPunishment should deter criminals from re-offending and serve as an example to others of what not to do. Being a criminal is too easy with the current judicial system and this needs to change. Protect us.",
        "background": "The government needs to assess the punishment of crimes, and where necessary increase the punishment. We see time and time again criminals receiving little or no punishment for crimes that arguably deserve several years of prison time. Protect the good citizens from those that only want to harm us.",
