        "additional_details": "There is no shortage of Brexit benefits: our MPs were able to set up the VIP PPE lane without scrutiny, our water companies are able to improve profits by dumping sewage in the rivers and the outfall of that reduces the crowding on the beaches.\r\nWe can remove the cap on bankers bonuses, get rid of pay equality, workplace safety & many other tedious rules that limit our opportunities for exploitation, yet they ignore these in favour of the vaccine rollout which we could have done as an EU member.",
        "background": "Detractors of Brexit keep asking for \"Brexit benefits\" and proponents of Brexit keep trotting out the vaccine rollout as an answer.\r\nEverything we did in the vaccine rollout we could have done as an EU member so it is misleading to claim it as a benefit & detracts from all the real Brexit benefits.",
