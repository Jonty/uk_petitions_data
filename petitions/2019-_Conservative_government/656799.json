I have noticed a pattern in which perpetrators tend to make fake (burner) accounts to avoid accountability when saying inflammatory, slanderous and upsetting things to people online. It\u2019s sadly common on the internet and can have adverse effects on people since the internet is now our new medium in daily life and communication. Instead of social media being a place where we are happy to be, it is stained by internet trolls.",
