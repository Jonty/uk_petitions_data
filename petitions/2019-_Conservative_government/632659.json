        "additional_details": "Public transportation must play a crucial role in British society. It helps address the pressing issue of climate change and provides affordable travel options during the current cost of living crisis. The \u00a32 bus fare cap is a step in the right direction, but the expiration date is fast approaching. It is imperative that the Government takes action to maintain low bus fares in the future, reducing the carbon footprint of commuters and easing the financial burden on households throughout the UK.",
        "background": "Recently, the Government implemented a \u00a32 bus fare cap as a measure to assist commuters during the ongoing cost of living crisis. However, this cap is set to end on March 31st. I urge the government to extend this deadline indefinitely and preserve this fare cap for the foreseeable future.",
