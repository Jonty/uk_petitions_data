        "additional_details": "Since gyms reopened there were more than 7.31 million check-ins across, during that same period the rate of transmission was zero.\r\n\r\nStudies show that exercise can treat mild to moderate depression as effectively as antidepressant medication but without the side-effects. It also promotes all kinds of changes in the brain, including neural growth, reduced inflammation, and new activity patterns that promote feelings of calm and well-being.\r\n\r\nWith so many benefits it is essential to keep gyms open!",
        "background": "We are calling on the government to put gyms in essential category during lockdowns as it is a main driver of people\u2019s health and well-being during a health pandemic. While keeping gyms open will help many new PTs who will have no financial support during gym closures.",
