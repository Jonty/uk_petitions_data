        "additional_details": "Rishi Sunak announced a Stamp Duty (SD) holiday for 9 months to stimulate the housing market. Needing an EWS1 left many unfairly excluded from this benefit. HMRC would expect circa \u00a34bn per annum income from SD.  If this tax was collected and placed within the Building Safety Fund to underwrite loans and grants for cladding works the safety of millions of people would be secured. This would also stimulate many industries, a wide range of jobs and increase income to the HMRC and wider economy.",
        "background": "To enable leaseholders to make their homes safe the government should offer a similar \u201cup scaled\u201d loan package as the Covid 19 bounce back loan scheme. Rapid introduction will reduce the risk of another Grenfell tragedy and avoid families being indefinitely financially drained by Waking Watch costs.",
