        "additional_details": "Evidence shows that plastics are not easily reusable or recyclable or biodegradable. A levy is needed to pay for the damage and mess of plastic pollution and incentivise producers to move to more sustainable practices. The amount imposed needs to be enough to mount a demonstrably effective and ongoing clean-up operation, and act as a financial disincentive to continued production.",
        "background": "I want the Government to impose a levy on plastic production to cover the cost of tidying our land and sea of the unsightliness and dangers of plastic pollution. Our bodies, wildlife, waterways, towns and countryside are awash with non-recyclable, non-biodegradable plastic and plastic particles.",
