        "action": "Extend financial support for the events industry",
        "additional_details": "Government guidelines have frequently changed regarding social gatherings, making the planning of events near impossible. Furthermore, the August bank holiday is the busiest day for the wedding / events industry, with an estimated 4,500 weddings cancelled on this one day. The wedding sector is a \u00a314.7bn industry and I speak for many who feel we are being forgotten about. To ensure the events industry is not crippled entirely, the help offered by the Government needs to be extended.",
        "background": "This petition aims for the Government to acknowledge the plight of the events industry during the Covid-19 pandemic and to extend financial support to the events sector. The furlough and self-employed grant scheme are not enough for an industry which is likely to be impacted for many months to come.",
