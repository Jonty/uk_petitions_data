For some, that may have been the last opportunity to see their loved ones at a Christmas. \r\n\r\nOthers who did break the rules were fined and the Home Secretary was urging people at the time to report rule breakers to the Police.\r\n\r\nThese rules should have applied to all and Government should not be exempt from investigation",
        "background": "There are numerous media reports suggesting No 10 Downing Street breached Covid rules by having Christmas parties during lockdown. No 10 state all rules were followed, but if it was a Christmas Party this would have been against the rules.\r\n\r\nA full investigation is needed.",
