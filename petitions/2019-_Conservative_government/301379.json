        "additional_details": "Mental health has become a huge crisis & there is not enough help or support out there for the people suffering, including the family it also effects. There is so much media attention now out there on this subject but depending on where you are in the country, it can be impossible to find any real help & people get lost circling the sytem, being passed from pillar to post, we can see this having a detrimental knock on effect to those around the person in crisis. This needs to be addressed",
        "background": "A lot more money needs to be invested into the mental health system & it needs to be treated as the serious issue that it is. There needs to be a new support system put in place that will work for the people in crisis & their families. This has to be seen as a priority, more needs to be done & fast.",
