        "additional_details": "Student accommodation rent needs to be abolished in this time of confusion, students have been advised to stay at home and self isolate while universities across the UK have now been told to close, however students are still expected to pay rent for accommodation where they will not be staying. The current crisis has resulted in a loss of jobs for many students and their families leaving many with an uncertain future. Universities should be ashamed of putting students under so much pressure, in such unprecedented times. I\u2019m a current student at UWL.",
        "background": "We are currently in a global pandemic, where universities expect students to pay accommodation fees. It is highly distressing and unfair to put students in this predicament considering no one knows when we will be allowed back on campus for our education and to live normally again.",
