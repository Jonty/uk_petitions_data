Why aren't all children treated the same and if the technology is available and will make the parents and child's life that bit easier then it's a no brainer.\r\nThe amount it costs for testing strips, lancets, disposing of sharps boxes and blood testing kits surely this amounts to roughly the same as the machine.\r\nIt's stressful enough when your child is diagnosed so why the extra worry???",
