        "additional_details": "With the findings of the UN Women study, specifically that 97% of women aged 18-24 have experienced sexual harassment, we feel that the Government needs to be doing more preventative work surrounding the issue of sexual harassment and assault, ensuring they are doing everything they can to help people feel safe. Recent events prove that there is not enough being done to ensure the safety of women and girls from violence across the UK.",
        "background": "We want the Government to make catcalling and other forms of street harassment illegal. Following from changes in the legislation surrounding upskirting, we want catcalling and similar offences to be made punishable by law.",
