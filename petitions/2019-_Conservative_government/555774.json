        "additional_details": "More and more people in the U.K. will lose their jobs and in turn, be unable to feed their families. \r\n14% of adults living with children have reported moderate to severe food insecurity in the past 6 months, an increase from 11.5% pre-COVID. Between March and August, 673,000 people in the U.K. became unemployed. This will only get worse as the pandemic continues. We need to make sure this is implemented without hesitation to prevent further food poverty in the U.K. \r\nEND FOOD POVERTY NOW!",
        "background": "Today, the government voted NOT to extend the free school meal plan to help feed the poorest children in the U.K.\r\nFor many children, school meals can be the only meal they get that day. Yet our MP\u2019s have their lunches subsidies by the taxpayer.\r\nCOVID-19 has had a detrimental effect on our lives.",
