        "additional_details": "Regrettably, not everyone is COVID19 cautious.\r\nPick-up & drop-off times have been managed with minimum guidance from schools, with emailed letters frequently ignored. Social distancing is unexistent. Class bubbles are ineffective if all children mix at the school gates. Parents can not keep a safe distance if narrow pavements are two way systems as pre-COVID19. \r\nIf schools had strict rules from the government, schools could then enforce them to parents and social distancing would be possible.",
        "background": "As it stands, the education departments relies on the school's own discretion to implement safety measures to keep everyone safe during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Minimum guidance is not enough and we need strict rules for all primary schools to follow and enforce to keep everyone safe.",
