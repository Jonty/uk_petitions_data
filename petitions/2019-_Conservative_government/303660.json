        "additional_details": "We call upon the government or parliament to make testing for COVID19 compulsory for all those who are displaying symptoms to help stop the spread especially to those more vulnerable and ill, and not just for those in hospitals displaying symptoms as this is not sufficient. More testing needs to be done to know how widespread the infection is. This will also help alleviate a lot of the panic and fear for a lot of people who only hear of the deaths and tests currently done on seriously ill people in hospitals and not the general wider public.",
        "background": "We would like everyone to be tested if displaying symptoms of COVID19 so that infected patients can be quarantined and the spread of the virus slowed.\r\nAnother benefit of testing will allow to build a more accurate picture of the number of cases and how the virus is spreading in the population.",
