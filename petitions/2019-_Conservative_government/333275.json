(These statistics do not include those who die yearly from eating disorders). Calorie counts can be extremely triggering and can cause further deterioration or even relapse. Now There is no solid evidence that \u201cmenu calorie counts\u201d help tackle obesity yet the facts show that they do however put people with or recovering from eating disorders at a high trigger risk.",

Calorie counts should be available online but not on view for those who may be triggered by it. As someone who has dealt with an ED I understand how damaging this legislation will be.",
