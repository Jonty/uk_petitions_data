The grading systems ought to be changed dramatically to reflect this. Nobody is more upset than students that their work does not reflect what they can do, but they cannot change that. If action is not taken, these circumstances are going to reflect poorly on final grades and mental health. Students will leave uni with a degree they feel they did poorly on due unchanging expectations of work in profoundly changed circumstances around their teaching whilst having paid +\u00a39,000 per year for little support.",
