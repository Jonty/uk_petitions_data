        "additional_details": "The Universal Credit system of welfare is underperforming and critically dysfunctional. Claimants in completely different circumstances encounter problems at every turn in the process. These aren't just 'teething issues' - it is fundamentally not achieving its purpose. \r\n\r\nStories of people having to apply more than once, of people staying in abusive relationships because of financial insecurity, and of people using foodbanks while waiting for a decision on their claim are not good enough.",
        "background": "The Universal Credit system needs to be investigated thoroughly by an independent review to help identify flaws across the welfare system. Investigations are needed into discriminatory policies, waiting times and the culture of the DWP. This will show where improvements should be made.",

It's also not clear if you want the review you are requesting to look at just Universal Credit, or all benefits, or the whole of the Department for Work and Pensions.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
