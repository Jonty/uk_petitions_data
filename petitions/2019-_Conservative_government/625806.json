        "additional_details": "In June 2021 the Government said it would keep the issue of euthanasia of animals under review, but we have seen no evidence that this is the case. Thousands of pets are at risk of euthanasia for economic/behaviour/lack of rescue space & health conditions. Mandatory reporting would provide information that could be used to put in place preventative measures to help reduce unnecessary euthanasia.",
        "background": "Each time a healthy/treatable animal is euthanised or presented for euthanasia we request mandatory reporting. Without accurate information vets, rescue organisations, responsible breeders & Government cannot make decisions about how to protect animals from being unnecessarily euthanised in future.",
