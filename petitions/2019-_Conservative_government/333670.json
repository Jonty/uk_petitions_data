        "additional_details": "We know from decades of research globally that outdoor learning & 'garden school' pedgagogies are extremely beneficial for healthy development of children & youth, as well as for lifelong learning & health. We know from climate research that we urgently need to increase urban green space & protect biological diversity in our environment-locally, nationally & globally. Additionally, we know sustainable agricultural practices & food chains increase the resilience of local economies. A win-win.",

Adapt a corner of a playground/sports field/car park to enable development of school curricula & fresh food for local communities.",
