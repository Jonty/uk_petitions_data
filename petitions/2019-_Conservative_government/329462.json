        "additional_details": "Traditionally milk in the UK was produced by cows grazing on pasture for much of the year and only housed indoors during the winter. With the development of more intensive farming many cows are now kept indoors with no seasonal access to pasture. Customers should be able to make a choice about whether they support these farming practices in the same way they can with eggs or other food products. There is as yet no \"free range\" labeling on milk and milk products. This should be mandatory.",
        "background": "Labeling for eggs and other animal products includes information about the housing and welfare of the animals, for example \"free range\". This should be required on milk packaging to inform the customer whether the milk was from cows with seasonal access to pasture or from cows kept indoors all year.",
