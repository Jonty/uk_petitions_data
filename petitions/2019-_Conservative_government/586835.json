        "additional_details": "Only 1 in 65 rape cases lead to court. Victims have been through enough trauma to then be let down by the justice system then not to be able to be safe alone. The current system only allows people who are in relationships and married to the perpetrator to get a non molestation order which is unfair on victims who have been assaulted by stalkers and strangers.",
        "background": "I believe the current system of Non-Molestation orders should be extended to cover a wider group of people. Victims of rape/sexual assault by a stranger or stalker are being let down by the justice system but then also on getting a non molestation order to give them reassurance after the trauma.",
