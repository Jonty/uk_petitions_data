        "additional_details": "For the last couple of decades it has become more commonplace for clubs to run into administration due to financial negligence of those running clubs and fans are expected to pick up the bill through their undying support of their club. Now, the so-called 'big six' insult their fans by going against their wishes and signing up to a European Super League in the hopes of bleeding their fans further, or mining new markets where there is no history with the club. Enough is enough.",
        "background": "For too long, many owners of football clubs in England have ignored the rich history of football in the UK, how the fans wish their clubs to be run and notions of financial prudence. The Government should return power to the supporters that are the lifeblood of football in this country.",
