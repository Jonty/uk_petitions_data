        "additional_details": "Student loans are paid to students to help pay for tuition, other fees, educational needs or living costs. When a student is in receipt of Universal Credit and get a student loan, Universal Credit see these loans as income and reduce the individual's entitlement each month in order to pay back the 'overpayment'. Individuals who are on Universal Credit therefore end up paying Universal Credit the value of the loan and also have to pay it back to Student Finance - therefore paying it twice.",
        "background": "Universal Credit sanction students when they receive loans. They class these loans as overpayments and reduce individual's Universal Credit income. The individual then pays back Universal Credit and has to pay Student finance back, hence paying the loan back twice.",
