        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to ensure GPs' are seeing patients and people can book appointments and not told to call at 08:00 to see if appointments are available.  If GPs' see their patients, it would reduce the problem at A&E. Why are GP allowed to conduct appointments over the phone, we are back to working in our offices.\r\nIt is really not acceptable that tax payers are paying for the lack of service from GPs.  GPs need to be targeted with minimum number of per day and have emergency slots.",
        "background": "Pre Covid, patients were able to book a GP appointment and was offered the next available appointment.  Currently, you have to contact the surgery at 08:00hrs along with everyone hoping to get an appointment.\r\nGPs' used to have emergency slots and you might have to sit an wait.",
