The true customers in a MLM are the people who work for them as their products aren\u2019t easily available for the public without signing up. \r\n\r\nSocial media is used as a marketing tool and creates toxic positivity to lure people in whilst exaggerating the truth. There are more chances of being successful in a pyramid scheme than most MLMs.",
