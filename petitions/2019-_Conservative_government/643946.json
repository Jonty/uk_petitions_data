        "additional_details": "Banning dog breeds to deal with dog attacks doesn't solve what we believe is the root of the problem - dogs being untrained. Any dog breed, big or small, is capable of attacking either human or animal and the best way to tackle this is prevention. Many attacks are from untrained dogs and owners who do not appear to have adequate dog-handling knowledge. By requiring dogs to be certifiably trained, we can help reduce the amount of dogs attacking due to the amount of owners improperly handling and training their dogs.",
