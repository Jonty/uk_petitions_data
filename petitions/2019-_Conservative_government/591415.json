        "additional_details": "I feel people who do not have the Covid jab because they have natural immunity should not be penalised. Natural immunity (proven via anti body tests) is just the same if not better then immunity acquired via the Covid jab.  \r\n\r\nIn the past with vaccines such as TB only those who did not have immunity already were given the vaccine, everyone was tested prior to having the vaccine.",
        "background": "I would like the government to include people with natural immunity proven via anti body tests to the proposed Covid passport and also to holiday isolation requirements so that they have the same recognition as those who have had the Covid jab.",
