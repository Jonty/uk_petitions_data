        "additional_details": "We need to nurture the industry, without support the sector will decrease and will therefore see a further economic contraction moving forward. It is quite clear the industry will not be on its feet until September realistically, the extension will give support to businesses and encourage them to maintain the talent the industry will need, when the epidemic has passed.",
        "background": "The food and drinks industry is going through hardship everyday. In several communities across the UK, people are worried about their jobs after June 30th 2020. We want the government to extend the 80% threshold of furlough to all people involved in the food and drinks industry.",
