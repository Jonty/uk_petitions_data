        "additional_details": "Using objects that have a history of causing injury and thus potentially increasing pressure on our health service is not the way to celebrate them. Added to this is the fact many key workers may be trying to sleep at this time after horrendous shifts and fireworks going off will certainly not help with that. \r\nIf this is unable to be passed into law may we humbly request that the government at least issue a statement discouraging the use of fireworks and floating lanterns. Thank you.",
        "background": "We respectfully request that a temporary ban be brought against the use of domestic fireworks and floating lanterns during the CORVID 19 crisis. While we appreciate the desire to celebrate our hard working NHS staff and others during this challenging time, cheering from your doorstep is sufficient.",
