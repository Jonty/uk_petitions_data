        "additional_details": "We think it is inhumane to force international students to choose between accessing a decent education and being with their families. The mental health impact on these students will be severe. Due to a broken funding system imposed by the Government, our universities are also overly dependent on international students to fund themselves, which this ban will inevitably imperil as international students look elsewhere than the UK to study.",
        "background": "We would like to Government to reverse its decision as announced by Home Secretary Suella Braverman in May to ban international students on taught programmes to bring their spouses and children with them.",
