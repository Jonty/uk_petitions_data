        "additional_details": "In England, we are all now allowed to leave our homes to go to the pub, out for dinner, get a tattoo but partners are being denied the right to attend antenatal appointments and even more importantly - scans! I know this has changed in Scotland and MUST change in England for the well-being of expecting parents. Also there is so much emphasis during pregnancy with appointments and making sure there is no violence at home. Babies are not being seen and abuse maybe being missed. This must change!",
        "background": "Antenatal care needs to return to normal to allow partners to attend appointments and scans. Also aftercare birth has completely stopped. Newborn babies and mothers are getting no face to face care and support, babies are not being weighed and checked up on as they should.",
