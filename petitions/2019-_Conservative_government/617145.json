It is legal to abuse and kill them for their flesh, milk, eggs, honey, skin, or if they are classed as \u201cpests\u201d or \u201cvermin\u201d. It is also legal to kill them for \u201csport\u201d. It is even legal to kill a cat or a dog unnecessarily, if the killing is painless. It is time to change this. It is time to class all sentient animals as nonhuman persons.",
        "background": "With the exception of some species, animals are sentient, thinking and feeling beings. They have families and friends. They can feel emotions and recognise and respond to kindness, or abuse. They also have the physical ability to feel pain, and they respond to this. They are not objects.",
