The UK has a relatively small number of HIV positive people and of that only 53% of that are MSM.(2017)\r\nhttps://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/western-central-europe-north-america/uk",
        "background": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Blood plasma is needed for research.\r\nHowever, men who have sex with men (MSM) are banned from donating blood by a blanket 3 month ban. \r\n\r\nThe ban is based on stigma and outdated information, and stops men from helping research and save lives.",
