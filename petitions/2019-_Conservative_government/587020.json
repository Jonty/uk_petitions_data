        "additional_details": "The government/parliament should do something about this, as it is unfair to quite a large number of pupils in the country who didn't have the advantage of having the papers before hand compared to those who had to go through the stress and hard work of revising their subjects. Being a student myself, I have heard that quite a lot of students have just revised the paper and nothing else and once they sat the exams the schools who used 2020/2019 papers the students who had access to them would have done well.",
        "background": "It would be best for students to just be given their predicted grades, there was an article created by the Guardian on this and it fully explains the situation in it, the link is the following https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/may/12/gcse-a-level-exam-papers-sold-on-social-media",
