        "additional_details": "Much of these soy products are exported to the UK for animal feeds, and some for direct human consumption, where alternatives products are available\r\nThe UK government has a responsibility to reduce environmental impacts. This includes indirect impact via consumption.\r\n \r\nMuch soy in the UK is used for animal feed (~75% by weight), so its environmental damage is not seen by the consumer. The UK government needs to ban imports of soy where it cannot be certified that its production is not negatively impacting the environment, pushing our production markets to use more environmentally friendly sources of soy or alternatives products altogether.",
        "background": "The growing of soy beans in environmentally sensitive regions (e.g. the Amazon Rainforest) is helping to fuel deforestation and climate change.",
