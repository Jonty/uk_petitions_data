        "action": "Open supermarkets early for elderly to shop alone for 2 hours during Coronavirus",
        "additional_details": "With the current global pandemic and people stock piling and panic buying, it is evident that the elderly are struggling to buy necessities in the supermarkets. Photos are circling online and it\u2019s heartbreaking. Allowing the elderly their own window of time, gives them a chance to buy the basics that they need to get though this pandemic, and also keep them away from large numbers of people. We need to work harder in trying to protect our elderly and vulnerable in this scary and uncertain time.",
        "background": "Open the supermarkets an hour or two earlier and only allow the elderly in to shop so they can get their basic necessities to survive. For 24hr stores, allow a 2 hour window, maybe between 6am-8am or after deliveries, in which the stores will be closed to the general public.",
