        "additional_details": "\u201cThe government itself has admitted that young people who identify as LGBT have higher risk of bullying and long-term harm to their education, health and wellbeing, so to be pulling away financial support from those fighting this abuse is especially callous.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe government decided to cut the \u00a34 million funding on anti-bullying week while also announcing \u00a316.5 billion in military spending. If the government wants to support LGBT rights and equality across the country, schools need to be helped.",
        "background": "The Homophobic, Biphobic and Transphobic Challenge Fund allowed teachers, staff and students to receive free workshops and training to effectively tackle anti-LGBT bullying. This funding needs to be reinstated in order to protect students' education, emotional well-being and mental health.",
