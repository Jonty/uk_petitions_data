        "additional_details": "Energy from water is available 24/7 all year round, through driving turbines, but also using water-source heat technologies. It could be playing a major part in our energy mix, but until there is a vision for England & Wales, with support to match, the potential cannot be realised. With many new developments in fresh water and tidal locations (i.e. as pioneered in Scotland), we believe current licensing arrangements are completely out of step, unfit for our times. Please give this matter your urgent attention.",
        "background": "Our island is surrounded by water & peppered with old water mills. We need a Government review of financial arrangements for the hydro industry, so that charges and support for water-based energy generation enable this sector to respond more effectively to the current climate & energy emergencies.",
