        "action": "Abolish all COVID-status certification in the United Kingdom",
        "additional_details": "COVID certification is one of the most contentious issues Britain has faced since Brexit. \r\n\r\nSerious legal & ethical considerations remain if it were to remain domestically & part of our border policy, especially with regard to the Human Rights Act (1998), Equalities Act (2010) & Public Health Act (1984) and International Health Regulations (2005). \r\n\r\nAs cases, hospitalisation, and mortality rates continue to plummet. Covid certification is no longer a necessary or useful tool for public health.",
        "background": "We want the Government to abolish domestic and international COVID-status certification. \r\n\r\nDue to high vaccination & booster uptake, continued relaxation of restrictions, and fast approaching endemicity of coronavirus, it is neither right nor proportionate to continue certification in Britain.",
