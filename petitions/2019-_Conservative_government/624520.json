According to a survey by CFBA 54% (n=380) of the dog population in the survey had been attacked or challenged by another dog. Owners affected by attacks are left to pay bills or claim through their own insurance. For people affected by dog attacks it can lead to loss of earnings. It\u2019s against the law to let a dog be dangerously out of control, but we want to see changes to better protect responsible owners.",
