        "additional_details": "ADHD is a real disability affecting Working Memory / Executive Function (planning / organising). People affected typically acquire charges as they miss the signs and information, then typically forget to respond to PCNs / filling in the forms etc. The process is usually cumbersome making prompt action even less likely. It seems that people with ADHD are being taxed for having the condition, and feels unfair. This is not about avoiding payment, just a little understanding and leeway.",
        "background": "ADHD is a hidden disability. We don\u2019t need a blue badge for physical access, but a cap on fines would be supportive.  We are less likely to notice parking / toll signage, whilst more likely to forget to pay - resulting in rising fees / court action. Many have paid \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3s in this \u2018ADHD Tax\u2019",
