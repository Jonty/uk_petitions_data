        "additional_details": "The current law denies access to state pension funds until individuals reach state pension age (currently 66), regardless of their health condition or life expectancy. This leaves many terminally ill people without the financial support they desperately need during what is already an incredibly difficult time. We urge the government to change this law and allow those diagnosed as terminally ill early access to state pension funds that they've paid into over many years of work.",
        "background": "This is not just about me; there are countless others who find themselves in similar situations - people who have paid into their pensions only to become terminally ill and lose everything they worked so hard for. We believe this is an unjust act by the state that needs immediate rectification.",
