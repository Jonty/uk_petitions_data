        "additional_details": "In the same week that the Government told the nation to rethink, and retrain, they have scrapped the bursary funding for teacher training in the arts, humanities and business disciplines. This means more debt for students, a larger skills gap in the teaching profession and another massive blow for a sector which continues to expect so much, from so many, for so little.",
        "background": "Uphold the bursary commitments made in the previous academic year, for all teachers who are training, so that we can inspire a new generation of teachers who are not discouraged from training due to financial barriers.",
