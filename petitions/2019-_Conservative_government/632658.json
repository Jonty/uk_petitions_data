        "action": "Ban probationary periods of more than three months for UK workers",
        "additional_details": "The probationary period is meant to be a fair assessment of an employee's performance and fit within the company. We believe that three months is sufficient for this, and that companies that set longer probationary periods or extend probationary periods are taking advantage of workers who have already taken on the responsibilities of the role and are contributing to the company's success. This prolonged uncertainty can create an unstable work environment and affects the mental and financial well-being of employees.\r\n \r\nWe call on the UK Government to take action and set a legal limit of three months for all probationary periods in the country. We believe this will better ensure that workers are treated fairly and with dignity, and provide stability and security in the workplace.\r\n",
        "background": "We are concerned about companies that set probationary periods for longer than three months, or extend probationary periods. We believe this practice is unjust and places undue stress and uncertainty on workers during a crucial time in their employment.",
