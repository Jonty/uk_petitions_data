        "additional_details": "A lot of practical and hands-on work has been cancelled for which our tuition fees was a way to pay for. The universities, their support teams, personalised help and interaction with lecturers have been bought to halt. Lastly, there is no access to the valuable resources international students come to The U.K for. All in all, the quality of education and available opportunities are poor and not worth this year's tier 4 visa student.",
