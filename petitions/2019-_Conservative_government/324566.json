        "action": "Ban the use of Palm Oil in UK manufactured chocolate.",
        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to do this as it is not right to kill endangered animal\u2019s habitats. It is possible to manufacture chocolate without Palm Oil as some less popular brands do it. If we loose these animals due to our diets, then we will never get them back. This is our one chance to save endangered animals, and we need to act now. Palm Oil is a product used in food items for taste, and is usually unhealthy food. This is our chance to turn the environment around, and show that we care.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to speak to UK chocolate manufacturers to eventually stop the use of Palm Oil in chocolate. Using Palm Oil threatens species like orangutans, as their habitats and food sources are getting lost due to deforestation. They will soon go extinct.",
