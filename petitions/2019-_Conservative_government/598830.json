        "additional_details": "In London women and girls are unsafe on the streets, especially at night. The decision taken by TfL to keep the night tube closed over the winter of 2021/2022 will have a disproportionate impact on women and low-income groups, with women forced to walk home like Sarah Evard or face harassment and high costs with taxis and rideshare. We need night tube to support the women and working people in our capital.",
        "background": "Provide more funding to TfL to operate the night tube service for the safety and public health of Londoners across the capital. TfL has been starved of funding and consequently has had to cancel night tube for the remainder of the year.",
