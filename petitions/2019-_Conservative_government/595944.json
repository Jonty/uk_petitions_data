        "additional_details": "If you want curious, critical thinkers the solution is not to give them grades. students should be working together. the introduction of grades has introduced the mindset that someone will do whatever it takes to succeed. Nothing we do externally will work,the solution has to come from the inside, this means having intrinsic motivation not extrinsic. students should be given the freedom to decide what they want to get out of their education and not be constrained by the binary system of grades.",
        "background": "I want the government and parliament to think about the current state of the education system. Do we want an education system where people see no inherent value in education except for a grade? I want the way we assess students to be rethought, especially current exams like GCSE and A level.",
