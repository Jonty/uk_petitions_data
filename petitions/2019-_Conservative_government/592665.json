        "action": "Remove the need for people to be double vaccinated to attend nightclubs & events",
        "additional_details": "Requiring people to be fully vaccinated against Covid 19 creates a two-tier society, that segregates those that either cannot recieve the vaccine due to age, medical reasons or personal choice. This requirement to be double vaccinated for activities removes the freedom of personal choice that every human being is entitled to. Furthermore, it could lead to segregation and a new type of hate crime and harassment towards those who aren't vaccinated.",
        "background": "In light of the recent announcement that people in England must be fully vaccinated against Covid 19 to enter a Nightclub or event from the autumn, the government should backtrack on this and not require people in England to be fully vaccinated to attend nightclubs and events.",
