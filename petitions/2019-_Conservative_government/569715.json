        "additional_details": "In June the government said they will ban gay conversion therapy, yet to this day they are yet to do so. Also they never said anything on transgender conversion therapy, as just like people do for their sexuality transgender people get forced to have transgender conversion therapy to try and make them cisgender. when the science shows it doesn\u2019t work and can leave the person with seriously bad mental health and can also lead to suicide. as the scientific evidence shows.",
        "background": "I would like the government to ban all LGBTQIA+ conversion therapy. so that includes transgender conversion therapy. And any other conversion therapy the LGBTQIA+ community may get forced to take",
