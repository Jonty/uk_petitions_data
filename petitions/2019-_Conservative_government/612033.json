        "action": "Change the marriage law in England/Wales from registered buildings to celebrants",
        "additional_details": "Currently in England and Wales couples must choose either a religious service in a church or a wholly secular service in a secular building, where they are not allowed anything even vaguely religious including music. Under the Scottish system, couples may choose any venue in which a celebrant is willing to conduct a marriage service and a religious or civil ceremony. This means that couples can choose a religious ceremony in a greater choice of venues and administration is simpler (and likely to be cheaper) This will also benefit couples who wish to have a more personalised day potentially in a location that is special to the couple and their relationship.",
        "background": "The Scottish system of registered celebrants is much simpler and more suitable to modern-day requirements than the current English/Welsh system of registered buildings, it also offers greater flexibility to couples wanting a more personal and intimate wedding.",
