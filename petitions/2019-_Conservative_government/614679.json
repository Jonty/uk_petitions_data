The subsequent constitutional crisis will overwhelm the Union and the unwritten constitution itself.",
        "background": "Conservative MPs are rallying around their leader, even in the face of his lawbreaking, acting out of a concern for their own ideals, interests, or sense of loyalty. They must act in the national interest, submit letters of no-confidence to the 1922 Committee, or allow a censure motion to pass.",
