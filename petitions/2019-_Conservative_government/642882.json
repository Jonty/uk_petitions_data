        "additional_details": "Customer service in the energy sector is pivotal for operational efficiency, consumer satisfaction, and industry success. It's the frontline interface addressing inquiries, billing, and technical concerns. With energy's evolving landscape, customer service guides clients through renewables, smart tech, and sustainability, enhancing loyalty and reputation. It's the linchpin bridging energy providers and consumers, crucial for transparency and industry advancement. This should be recognised in immigration rules.",
        "background": "We are trying to change rules that prevent customer service agents in the energy industry from working in the UK. This will make it easier for workers within the industry to work in the UK. To do this, the Government needs to make customer service agents in energy eligible for Skilled Worker visas.",
