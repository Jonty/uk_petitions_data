        "additional_details": "I've heard a lot of stories about GP's using their own biased opinions as to why their patients shouldn't get a breast reduction and it's not okay. The patients mental health should also be in consideration as it causes many people with large breasts to develop an eating disorder or body dysmorphia. We deserve to have both our physical pain and mental pain taken seriously.",
        "background": "I believe there should be more funding for people to have breast reduction surgery on the NHS. There are so many people suffering with large breasts being told to just lose weight, not being taken seriously or worse, the request for surgery has been rejected and they have to start the process again.",
