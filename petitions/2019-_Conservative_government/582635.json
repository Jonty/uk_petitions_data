        "additional_details": "A worker who has to spend more than 180 days outside the UK must be protected from an immigration point of view and not penalized by breaking the continuous residence and being unable to convert their pre-settled status into settled status. Such a strict law must absolutely be amended by the Government. Failure to review this could put many workers in the tragic situation of leaving their jobs in order not to compromise their immigration status in the United Kingdom.",
        "background": "To convert pre-settled status to settled status after five years of residence, one must not be absent from the country for more than 180 days in any 12-year period, with limited exceptions. Some workers (pilots, flight attendants or managers of companies) necessarily have long absences.",
