        "additional_details": "Getting married is one of the most special times in a person's life and whether there is a national lockdown or not, this right should never be taken away from someone. By doing so, people's lives are literally being put on hold, such as not being able to start a family. Having loved ones with you on the wedding day is also vital to most couples. Currently, only 6 allowed in Tier3/Tier4. Requesting just a very small rise of 2, but a HUGE difference for the couple with an extra 50% guests.",
        "background": "Give all couples the right to get married during lockdown, not just those with exceptional circumstances. Allow up to 8 people to attend if in Lockdown/Tier 3/Tier 4, giving the chance for more of their loved ones to be with them at this special time.",
