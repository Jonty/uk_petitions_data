        "additional_details": "The government has asked much of the country to stay at home while sending hundreds of students back to school with a more transmissible strain for this age group, how does this make sense? Furthermore, how can students from England be expected to compete with students from Scotland and Wales who have cancelled exams, for the same universities?\r\nExams have been pushed back 3 weeks and now exam students have yet another week of online learning; what will be done to make up for this?",
        "background": "The Government should cancel GCSEs and A-Levels in 2021. Since March, students have missed 6 months of face to face learning; this has had a huge impact on students' learning. Since September, many students have missed even more.",
