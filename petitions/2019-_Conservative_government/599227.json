        "additional_details": "It is outrageous that Asthma patients have to continuously pay prescription charges several times a year, just to receive the medication they need to breathe. This is literally putting a price on breathing, a natural activity everybody needs to survive, and is impacting vulnerable people who may end up in hospital due to not being able to afford these medications. Many triggers like Air Pollution are at no fault of the patients, and until this is sorted asthmatics will continue to suffer.",
        "background": "End all prescription charges for Asthma medications, such as Inhalers and Steroid Tablets, to help prevent hospitalisation of vulnerable asthmatics. Healthcare professionals and campaign groups have encouraged the removal of these charges, yet the Government has not taken action.",
