        "additional_details": "Spitting on the street is vile at the best of times, but at the moment it is utterly disgusting. Coronavirus is spread via droplets from respiratory secretions and hsvinging multiple individuals depositing this onto the street is increasing the risk of the spread of disease",
        "background": "Similarly to how failure to clean up dog mess is an offence, spitting on the street, which at present, poses a far greater risk than dog mess, should be an offence made punishable by imposition of a fine. We are in the midst of a serious public health crisis and must do all we can to stop the spread",
