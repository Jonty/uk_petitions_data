Currently a driver does not legally have to report hitting a cat by car and so many cats are left suffering in pain until they die - only 57% said they would stop according to a survey by Carbuyer\u2019s. This addition would also reinforce the seriousness of Section 4 (unnecessary suffering), subsection (1)(a) of the Animal Welfare Act 2006 if a driver does not act to reduce unnecessary suffering by stopping and seeking veterinary assistance.",
