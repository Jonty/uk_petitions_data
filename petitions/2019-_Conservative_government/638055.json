        "additional_details": "In females in the UK, breast cancer is the most common cancer, with around 55,500 new cases every year (2016-2018).\r\n\r\nAge-specific incidence rates rise steadily from age 25-29, more steeply from age 35-39 in females. Women in this age group are not currently screened and although women can examine themselves, a lump is not always superficial enough to be felt or seen. Research shows screening means survival rates are higher, less invasive treatments and surgery are needed, which is more cost effective.",
