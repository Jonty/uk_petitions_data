        "additional_details": "Decimalisation occured in 1971 where British Currency converted from fractional breakdown of \u00a3sd to instead be decimalised like the USD. \r\n\r\nBefore, a Pound was 240p, a Highly Composite Number, which allowed many avenues for splitting down into lesser amounts; the Pound now is much less flexible. \r\n\r\nEqually, fractional coins bypass the 1/3 problem. When you split 100 between 3 you are left with a remaining 1, creating an unfair share. When fractional, all parties can receive the same, 1/3, amount.",
        "background": "Decimalisation came at the cost of a convenient system for the common citizen. The 240p pound was a Highly Composite Number, which allowed for a multitude of avenues to split it, unlike the 100p.\r\n\r\nReturning to \u00a3sd will allow for greater convenience, easier sharing, and restore British history.",
