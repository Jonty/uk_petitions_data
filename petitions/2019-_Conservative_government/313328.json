        "additional_details": "Parliament should afford the nation time to remember in the same way as military, police and political figures who die in the effort of public duty. The global effort of the pandemic is heavily reliant on the work, not only of NHS staff, but those who are in a care giving roles and the scientific community who contribute to testing procedures and work on vaccines. These professionals give their lives during this global crisis and we should never forget them, their names, or their contribution.",
        "background": "National health, care staff and allied professionals who fall victim to COVID:19 should be recognised and remembered on both a national memorial day and at a specific national place of remembrance. This gives recognition to their specific sacrifice at the hands of the global pandemic: coronavirus.",
