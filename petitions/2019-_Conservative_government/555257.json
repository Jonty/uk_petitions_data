He was not coughing.\r\n \r\nOn the 28th, he could not get out of bed. He could not speak. He was confused and in pain. We learnt then he had Covid-19.\r\n\r\nHe passed in October. The entire time my Grandad was ill, he did not cough. For this reason his GP advised him to get blood tests, as there was no indication of Covid-19.\r\n\r\nThe ZOE Covid app, the WHO and CDC list far more symptoms than the NHS, through which I recognised some of his symptoms after his passing.",
