The standard of education they get isn't as effective due to the fact that teachers are pressured to focus on attaining the highest exam results possible rather than giving their students a well rounded and happy education.",
        "background": "Review the way we approach standardised testing in the UK and in turn make school a less stressful environment where students are encouraged to thrive and be self motivated. With a higher focus on mental health and wellbeing rather than just the pressurised exams.",
