If you have your own flat or house you have to keep up with the payments of that gas/electricity for the month plus food for the month and travel to and from potential employment or to the job centre etc.\r\nIts been 5 years since UC has been increased and with the covid-19 outbreak and UC going up to put it back down it will be catastrophic.",
