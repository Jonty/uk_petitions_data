        "additional_details": "National & local lockdowns restricted Eid celebrations in May and July 2020. Step 3 of the Roadmap will allow groups of up to 30 outdoors, including in private gardens, from just 4 days after Eid-ul-Fitr. Large-scale events are already being trialled. Coronavirus hospitalisations and deaths have fallen in the UK by over 95% from January\u2019s peak. Half of the population has been vaccinated, with over 20% having had two doses. This would be a modest and safe relaxation.",
        "background": "A relaxation of Coronavirus rules on Thursday 13th May 2021, only 4 days ahead of step 3 of England's roadmap out of lockdown, to enable Muslims to celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr outdoors within their families, in groups of up to 12 people or 3 households.",
