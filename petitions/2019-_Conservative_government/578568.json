        "additional_details": "I work for North East Counselling Services.  We provide employment for around 50 counsellors.  We ensure the safety of our clients by vetting the counsellors and providing counselling to commissioners, private clients and companies.  Because we have to charge VAT it makes us more expensive to companies and commissioners and because we are competing with counsellors who do not charge VAT it makes us uncompetitive against individual counsellors.  This is a service which is not a luxury.",
        "background": "If counselling is provided by the NHS or individual private counsellors the payments are not subject to VAT.  Organisations who employ a number of counsellors who provide the service in this way is required to charge VAT making the pricing structure different.",
