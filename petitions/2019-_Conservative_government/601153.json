        "additional_details": "The Government should fund more detailed research on cannabis, then make an informed decision on what the law should be in regards to its production, sale and use.\r\n \r\nCannabis plants produces hemp, and making it easier to grown and sell could bring in a lot of revenue to the country. This could also improve our carbon footprint as hemp could be used to produce paper.\r\n \r\nIf recreational cannabis was legalised and taxed it is estimated that it could bring in around \u00a34bn a year.",
        "background": "We believe there hasn't been enough research in the UK into cannabis to support laws banning the substance in most circumstances. Some experts have said that it isn\u2019t as bad as alcohol. If the Government funded new research, this could inform changes to existing restrictions.",
