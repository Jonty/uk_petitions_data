        "additional_details": "I think the current scheme, limited to buses, restricts the mobility and independence of countless citizens, hindering their ability to fully participate in society. By extending free travel to additional modes of transport, I think we can dismantle barriers and foster a more inclusive, accessible public transport system. This move could significantly enhance quality of life, offering those affected greater freedom and flexibility to engage with their communities, attend appointments, work, and enjoy social activities without the constraints of limited transport options or prohibitive costs.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, call upon the Government to significantly expand the National Concessionary Travel Scheme to include trains, trams, coaches, taxis, and all local public transport (eg. London Underground) in addition to buses.",
