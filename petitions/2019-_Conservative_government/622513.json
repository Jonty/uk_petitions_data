        "additional_details": "because its an issue for females who don't have enough money to buy them such as the homeless, or for example young girls in schools that might be having their first ones so if the school can\u2019t provide them, they could go to a shop and get the products that are needed, and for girls that might be very unfortunate and might not be prepared and have no resources they could go straight to any shop and get what they need and if they are free, ladies can just choose & use without any money or panic.",
        "background": "I would like the government to completely change every price of feminine period products in the Uk to Free (already done in Scotland) because it is a problem for ladies to buy products every month and some woman are unfortunate enough not to be able to afford them due to poverty and homelessness.",
