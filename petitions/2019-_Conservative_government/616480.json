        "action": "Do not pass legislation to allow the gene editing of animals and crops",
        "additional_details": "I want the Government to abandon the Genetic Technology (Precision Breeding) Bill because I believe that relaxing regulations on GE livestock would be a huge step backwards for animal welfare and jeopardise ethical consumer choices.\r\n \r\nFurthermore gene editing could have unpredictable effects and alter the animals in ways we cannot comprehend. We believe the use of GE technologies also threatens to push farmed animals further beyond their biological limits, which could have adverse effects for their health and in turn for consumers.",
        "background": "I want the Government to abandon plans to pass legislation to legalise gene editing of animals and crops. The Government has said technologies such as gene editing have the potential to increase disease resistance in crops, reduce pesticide use, lower costs to farmers and increase food production.",
