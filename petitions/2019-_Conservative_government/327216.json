        "additional_details": "The Government should reconsider their indefinite delay of the Gender Recognition Act (GRA).\r\nStonewall suggests the following reforms to the GRA:\r\n - Require no medical diagnosis or presentation of evidence for trans people to get their identity legally recognised\r\n - Recognises non-binary identities\r\n - Gives all trans people, including 16 \u2013 17-year-olds, the right to self-determination, through a much simpler and more streamlined administrative process",
        "background": "The Conservative Government has refused to listen to trans voices and now have made the decision to indefinitely delay the Gender Recognition Act after 70% of voters backed it. This shows a blatant disregard for the people of Britain in favour of outdated and transphobic values.",
