Consider at very least an e-referendum. What is here proposed is potentially as impactful as the Magna Carta. Why the express provision to allow database-storage outside the UK? Where is the guarantee that processing will be handled exclusively within government? Centralising so much personal data is not justifiable.",
        "background": "The proposal to create a consolidated database containing the information currently held by 18 government agencies (allowing them plus 4 more unlimited access) is not only profoundly risky, but severely infringes personal freedoms. Making identification easier does not justify attendant risks.",
