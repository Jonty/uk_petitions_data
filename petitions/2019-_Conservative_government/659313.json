        "additional_details": "Current UK car insurance doesn\u2019t reflect drivers\u2019 real risk, leading to unfairly high premiums, especially for safe, experienced drivers. A savings-based model would mean premiums create a personal fund for each driver\u2019s claims, making insurance costs fairer and directly linked to individual driving records, encouraging safer driving and giving drivers more control over their insurance expenses.",
