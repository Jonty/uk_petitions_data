        "additional_details": "Restarting sport before COVID-19 is under control is morally wrong for many reasons:\r\n\r\n- sets an extremely dangerous message that COVID-19 is under control before it actually is\r\n- people will gather in houses to watch\r\n- people will gather outside stadia\r\n- puts an extra strain on the NHS/police\r\n- puts sportsmen in danger\r\n- tests should be prioritised to essential workers, people with symptoms and then to the general public, not sportsmen\r\n- shows the public that money is more important than health",
        "background": "As COVID-19 death rates fall, sport is slowly being restarted behind closed doors. Although this would be a morale boost we believe this is a financially driven decision and is morally wrong.\r\n\r\nThe Government needs to step in to ensure this does not happen before COVID-19 is under control.",
