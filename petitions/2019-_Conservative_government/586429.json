His mum begged CPS, Police & Local Authority to provide counselling for her children but was told this would contaminate court evidence. Declan took his own life at 13. His death could have been prevented. \"Declan's Law\" would ensure future CSA victims get the support they deserve when it\u2019s needed.",

This is in gov legislation, but the CPS & Police still advise victims it can affect the trial. This needs to end.",
