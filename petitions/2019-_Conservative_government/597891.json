        "additional_details": "CCTV, police patrols aren\u2019t enough and cannot guarantee women\u2019s safety and we should feel safe and able to live a life without fear this would prevent attacks, deaths and people resorting to carrying illegal weapons. I fully believe this will force a safer community for all. Currently being able to spray a coloured dye (not even clarified to be legal either) is not enough and not being enforced. Unfortunately you can\u2019t see into people\u2019s minds/their intentions but we can control self defence aids.",
        "background": "Women in particular but not exclusively aren\u2019t feeling safe to walk the streets alone. Could be coming home from work/visiting a friend. Coming into darker days of winter making such a thing legal for self defence purposes would be a huge deterrent for anyone willing to attempt any kinds of attacks.",
