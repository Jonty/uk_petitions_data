        "additional_details": "Young people just like everyone in the UK are suffering from the consequences bestowed upon them in recent years. It\u2019s been challenging for all, yet not all people can vote for change. Young people have been directly affected by COVID and the effects of it are still very much present inside the classroom. It is important that everyone has a right to a Government that cares for them, and we believe 16 and 17 year olds should have the right to vote in who governs them.",
        "background": "Lowering the voting age should help increase political engagement among young people and make them more likely to become active, informed citizens. It would also give younger people a say in the issues that affect them directly, such as education, health policies, and climate change",
