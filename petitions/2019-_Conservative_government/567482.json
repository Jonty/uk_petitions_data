        "additional_details": "There have been other petitions in the past which have asked for carb values to be presented on the menus and these have been rejected. I understand the implications this could have on people who suffer from eating disorders. Therefore, I propose that restaurants only have the information readily available for when someone with diabetes requires it.",
        "background": "People with Type 1 diabetes rely on counting carbo values in their food to inject the right amount of insulin. Carb values often aren\u2019t available in restaurants so, we have to guess how much insulin we to take. Around 400,000 people in the UK have type 1 diabetes so I believe it is a necessary step.",
