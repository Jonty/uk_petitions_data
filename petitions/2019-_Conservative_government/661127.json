        "additional_details": "In light of confusion regarding passport validity, which has resulted in families and individuals being turned away at the airport, we propose that a recommended renewal date be printed within the passport. This could help make people more aware of when they should be renewing their passport and not just the expiry date. This change could enhance the understanding of passport validity requirements, reducing the risk of travel plans being affected by outdated or soon-to-expire passports.",
