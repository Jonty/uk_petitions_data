        "additional_details": "Many people and businesses will lose their income due to Corona virus which will mean less tax being paid and a bigger burden on the state to try to support these people and at the same time, adequately fund the NHS. When this pandemic is over there will be a huge  backlog of needs for all patients waiting for operations and treatments. Companies like McDonalds and Amazon should pay their fair dues for the huge profits they make in the UK. They should pay up or push off. We do not need them.",
        "background": "This country has been economically hammered due to the impact of Coronavirus. This will hit taxpayers hard for years to come. The NHS is on its knees Companies such as Amazon have made huge profits out of this country but make no real contribution by way of paying fair tax back into the economy.",
