This is a particular concern for people living in the same house as one who has tested positive, and presents a \u2018silent spreading\u2019 risk. My wife recently tested positive & I had no symptoms, but was unable to legitimately secure a test online through the NHS, meaning it was not possible to ascertain if I had been infected. I finally tested positive and had to self-isolate. This should change immediately.",
