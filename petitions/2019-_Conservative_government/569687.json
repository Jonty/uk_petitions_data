        "additional_details": "In most cases COVID-19 tests are only available if one is showing symptoms. This doesn't recognise that many people can be asymptomatic. This is a particular concern for people living in the same house as one who has tested positive, and presents a \u2018silent spreading\u2019 risk. My wife recently tested positive & I had no symptoms, but was unable to legitimately secure a test online through the NHS, meaning it was not possible to ascertain if I had been infected. I finally tested positive and had to self-isolate. This should change immediately.",
        "background": "The Government must immediately provide for an entire household to be tested for COVID-19 in the event that anyone living at the property has tested positive. At present, this is only permitted if a person is showing one of the 3 main symptoms.",
