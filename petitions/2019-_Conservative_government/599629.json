        "additional_details": "With Lockdown restrictions easing, young people have returned to clubs and bars in huge numbers. Unfortunately, so have those who wish to drug unsuspecting young people in such venues in order to sexually assault them and take advantage of them. There have also been reports of injections being administered to unsuspecting people in packed clubs. With Students returning to university, this issue has gotten worse. Essentially, drink spiking has become the epidemic within the pandemic.",
        "background": "We want the Government to impose explicit duty on clubs, pubs and bars across the country in regards to drink spiking. This duty could include, but is not limited to: Offering drink covers; offering testing strips for the most common types of 'date rape' drugs in drinks and thorough searches.",
