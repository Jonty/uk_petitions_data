They are providing 24hr emergency cover and treatment that our pets may require whilst adhering to all current restriction on social interaction.  We are a nation of animal lovers and we cannot let out Veterinary Practises close due to the lack of financial aid that is available to them.",

This has to change and they should get this aid.",
