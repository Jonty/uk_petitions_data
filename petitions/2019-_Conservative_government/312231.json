        "additional_details": "Change the current legislation to provide these means of financial aid to Veterinary Practises.  They face reduced income but their running costs will remain the same.  They are providing 24hr emergency cover and treatment that our pets may require whilst adhering to all current restriction on social interaction.  We are a nation of animal lovers and we cannot let out Veterinary Practises close due to the lack of financial aid that is available to them.",
        "background": "Currently Veterinary Practices are not currently entitled to Business Rates Relief or the Grants that are automatically available to other businesses even though they have been explicitly listed as an exception to the closures by the government.  This has to change and they should get this aid.",
