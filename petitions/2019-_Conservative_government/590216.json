        "additional_details": "Every year, around 3 million animals are used in experiments in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. As well as causing large-scale animal suffering, this outdated practice fails to deliver medical progress. 90 per cent of drugs that pass animal tests go on to fail in human clinical trials. There are many modern alternatives that deliver results that are directly applicable to people, such as the use of artificial intelligence and organ-on-a-chip technology.",
        "background": "The Government must recognise the urgent need to use animal-free science and publish a clear and ambitious action plan with timetables and milestones to drive the phase-out of animal experiments. As well as preventing animal suffering, this will benefit public health and business.",
