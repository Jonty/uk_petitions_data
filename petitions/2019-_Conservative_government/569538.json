However, social media indicates that the opposite might be true: https://bit.ly/2LDN1pe\r\n\r\nHowever, vaccinating as many people as possible as soon as possible is paramount to saving lives, relieving pressure from the NHS, opening up the economy and returning to normalcy. It is shocking that we are not vaccinating around the clock.",
