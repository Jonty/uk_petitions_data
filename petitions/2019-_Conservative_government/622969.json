        "additional_details": "England has a fragmented approach to water infrastructure, capture, storage and supply. Why are reservoirs in North of England full and the South has a water shortage? Pipelines were built during WW2 to transport fuel on an England wide basis and still in use today. Libya built a national pipeline infrastructure to transport its water across the country, so why cant we as a country? England is a world leader in national infrastructure projects and this is seems like a BIG gap in that capability",
        "background": "The evidence is clear that due to global warming, the supply of water in England is becoming more regionalised with some areas having more supply than needed and some areas not having enough. What is needed is a joined up strategy that defines a network of supply capacity and pipelines in England",
