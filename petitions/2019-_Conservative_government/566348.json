        "additional_details": "Short of a total, extended lockdown for many months, the vaccine is now the only hope for a way out of the pandemic. Not sticking to vaccine manufacturer guidelines is a huge experiment, which the participants have not agreed to. This is not only unfair and unethical, but could have catastrophic consequences if the vaccines are rendered useless by inappropriate application. The virus would then have free rein, leaving everyone defenceless.",
        "background": "The manufacturer of the Pfizer covid vaccine has called on the govt to adhere to it's dosage guidelines, ie 2nd vaccination to follow 3-4 weeks, not up to 12, after the 1st. They have not tested the efficacy of the vaccination with a 12-week gap between doses, it could make the jab ineffective",
