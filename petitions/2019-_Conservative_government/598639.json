        "additional_details": "The Arcadia Group pay a lower rate of tax due to the company being registered in his wife Tina Green's name. Under Philip Green's direction, there was a \u00a3571m deficit in the BHS pension fund, and only after public outrage did he agree to pay \u00a3363m into the fund. During their 15 year ownership of BHS the Greens and shareholders made \u00a3580m. Last year Green requested that the taxpayer help pay for Arcadia employees furlough wages.\r\n\r\nIf Green's services are not benefitting the taxpayer and not benefitting his workers, why does he deserve to retain this honour?",
        "background": "In 2006, British businessman Philip Green was made a Knight Bachelor \"for services to the Retail Industry\". He retains this honour despite continuously shielding his companies from paying their fair share of tax and selling out BHS workers during its takeover in 2015.",
