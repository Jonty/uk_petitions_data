        "additional_details": "Sand-based sports are a fantastic way to keep fit/healthy and generally improve wellbeing. As someone with recurring knee and joint injuries in my 20's, sand based sports have given me a new lease of active life and are only growing in popularity since the 2012 Olympic Games.\r\n\r\nFrom experience these sports offer lower impact alternatives to regular sports and are not weather dependent. As a regular player of beach volleyball, I have played from January through to December for the last 3 years.",
