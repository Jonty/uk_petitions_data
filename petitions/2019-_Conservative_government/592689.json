        "action": "Stop mandatory vaccination status to enter venues - protect freedom of choice",
        "additional_details": "In 1933 the German government introduced the Aryan certificate to prove a person was a race, this was first required by public sector workers then over time through legislations comprised laws that segregated the Jews from society & restricted Jewish political, legal and civil rights. We're on a dangerous parallel path that started this year with compulsory vaccinations for those within the care sector. We now plan to discriminate law abiding non vaccinated peoples freedom and access to venues.",
        "background": "The government announced that from Sept  establishments such nightclubs will need to prove double vaccination status. This contravenes articles 8 & 14 of the human rights act that protect integrity, also our right to choose and that secures freedom without discrimination on any ground or opinion",
