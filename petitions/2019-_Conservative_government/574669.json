        "additional_details": "A large amount of people would have passed their theory test less than 6-9 months before going into lockdown and are now having to be concerned that they will inevitably have to pay to sit the exam that they have already paid for and passed within the next few months. The excuse has been that they will not extend passes as hazard perception knowledge needs to be up to date. Okay, that\u2019s understandable. In that case, allow the first resit to be free; if they fail, then they can pay to resit again",
        "background": "The UK have been in lockdown for almost a year now and countless theory tests have expired as a result of this. The government have refused to extend theory passes despite this. Make it so that students who have to resit due to an expired test as a result of COVID scan resit once for free.",
