        "additional_details": "The United Kingdom is the world's largest exporter of legal cannabis. Cannabis alone contains physically safe substances, with 0 overdoses ever recorded. It does not belong on the same level as other class B substances such as Ketamine, Speed, Amphetamines etc. \r\n\r\nIn 2020 alone, over 500 thousand cannabis plants were seized. This wastes valuable police time. UK citizens surveyed in 2018 thought that the drug should be legal, with 68 percent of 18 to 24 year old\u2019s supporting its legalization.",
        "background": "We want the British government to declassify Cannabis as a Class B substance. Wether this be a class C substance or completely decriminalised. Cannabis was once a class C substance in the UK, and the benefits of this ruling need another look.",
