        "additional_details": "Spending time away from work with the people we love is very important for our mental health. We know that long-term work-related stress can lead to burnout, which involves exhaustion, negative thinking and reduces productivity. But we also know that people who take breaks from work can be more productive once they get back. Taking annual leave is also a health and safety measure. Working without proper rest and recovery is linked to injuries and accidents in the workplace.",
        "background": "Increased statutory entitlements to paid annual leave from 5.6 weeks to 7 weeks for all workers, as over 800,000 people in the UK experience work-related stress, depression or anxiety. This would increase the entitlement of someone working a 5-day week from 28 days to 35 days.",
