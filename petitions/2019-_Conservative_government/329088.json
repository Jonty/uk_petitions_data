        "additional_details": "In 2018, beauty service providers contributed to \u00a34.8 billion to the UK economy (Oxford Economics, 2019). Therefore, we are a very significant industry in the UK and it should be in the Government and Parliament's interest to provide support for the industry if we are to sustain our business for when we can re-open.",
        "background": "As beauty salons will not be able to open on 4th July, the grant that was provided in April will no longer sustain our business if we are not to open after this time. We completely appreciate the safety measures and don't want another spike of Covid-19, but we still need the support.",
