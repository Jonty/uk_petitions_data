The cost of construction was paid off in 2002.\r\n \r\nThe Severn Crossing abolished tolls years ago, and the Dartford Crossing should be the same.\r\n \r\nEspecially during the current cost-of-living crisis, we believe the charge is unnecessary and for some families, extortionate.\r\n \r\nThe charge should remain in place for goods vehicles to help cover maintenance.\r\n",
