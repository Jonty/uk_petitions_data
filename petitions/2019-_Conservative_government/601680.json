Approval for 12-15s was in June 2021, but was not rolled out until 3 months later. These delays resulted in unnecessary illness, morbidity & deaths in children and families.\r\n\r\nWe do not yet fully understand the long-term health risks of being infected with Covid-19, but neurological, vascular & organ damage have been identified as possible effects. We ask that the Government take into account these long term health risks, as well as Long Covid-related disability, when considering vaccinations for 5-11 year olds.",
