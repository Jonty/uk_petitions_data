The Government has allowed garages to remain open for emergency repairs, however it is a decision for individual businesses whether to do so. The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme is open to all businesses that choose to furlough their staff, and is not conditional on the business being on the list of those that have to close.\r\n\r\nYou can find more information on support available to businesses here: https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/business-support\r\n\r\nWe have published a petition calling on the Government to require garages to only open for key workers during Covid19, which you might like to sign: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/309077\r\n\r\nIf you want the Government to close all businesses that are not vital, you may wish to sign this petition: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/308122\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about coronavirus and how you can protect yourself and others here:\r\n\r\nwww.gov.uk/coronavirus\r\nhttps://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/\r\n\r\nThe Government has also created an online service to help you out what you can do if you\u2019re struggling because of coronavirus: https://www.gov.uk/find-coronavirus-support\r\n\r\nYou can read NHS tips to help if you are worried about coronavirus here: https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/coronavirus-covid-19-anxiety-tips\r\n\r\nYou can read impartial analysis of the Government response to coronavirus and policy developments here: https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/coronavirus/\r\n\r\nYou may also be interested to know that because of the large number of petitions that have been started in relation to coronavirus, the Petitions Committee has been questioning the Government about its response to the coronavirus outbreak.\r\n \r\nFind out more and watch the Committee put questions suggested by petitioners to Government Ministers and the Deputy Chief Medical Officer: https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/326/petitions-committee/news/145767/committee-question-deputy-chief-medical-officer-and-ministers-on-coronavirus-response/\r\n \r\nRead letters asking further questions of Government Ministers: https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/326/petitions-committee/publications/3/correspondence/"
