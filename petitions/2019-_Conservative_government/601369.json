        "additional_details": "Many disabled and older people need to access public transport for medical appointments, to go to work, or school. Restricting their rights to free bus travel to certain times is not fair, and can mean they cannot travel to work/school/appointments for free at standard times - most work and school places start at 9 - so special arrangements often have to be made, or they get turned down. Make the right to free travel equal, no matter the time of day.",
        "background": "The English National Concessionary Travel Scheme (ENCTS) only gives people over state pension age and people with an eligible disability a right to free travel on bus services from 9.30am-11pm. This should be extended so eligible people can travel for free on buses at any time.",
