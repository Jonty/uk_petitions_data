        "additional_details": "I would love for United Kingdom to recognise the animal cruelty and the scale of cruelty it got to including illegal breading, neglecting, using them to fight against each other for sport...the list is never ending. It's time to considere all domestic animals as \u201cliving beings\u201d instead of mere objects as it is the case now. The new law would include mistreatment of pets, and would also be regarded as a crime as if the owner had abused another person. Let's make a change and protect the innocent.",
