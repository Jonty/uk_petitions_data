For the same period in 2019 there were 182 at all professional levels.\r\n\r\nBoxing will slowly die from the bottom up if the sport does not receive the help it desperately needs. \r\n\r\n'Small Hall' promoters and their shows are often referred to as 'the breeding ground of champions' and with no income from paying fans or broadcasters they face an even bleaker future.",
