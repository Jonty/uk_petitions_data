        "additional_details": "The Supreme Court has openly meddled in political affairs and represents a dangerous and undemocratic means of carrying out political action without any democratic mandate or control. The cases over our efforts to leave the EU made this danger perfectly clear and were a direct challenge to Parliamentary Sovereignty. Article 9 of the 1689 Bill of Rights must be reaffirmed so that no court may arbitrarily take power for itself over any proceedings in Parliament ever again.",
        "background": "Abolish the Supreme Court and return its powers to the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary as it was before the Supreme Courts creation. Also overturn the verdict in the case of R (Miller) v The Prime Minister by passing a Bill declaring that the prorogation process is non justiciable in any court.",
