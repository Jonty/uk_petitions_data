        "additional_details": "According to the 2011 census, there were almost 53,000 pagans in the UK. This may not seem a lot, but even a small amount deserves the chance to wed in a ceremony appropriate to their beliefs and religion. With the 2021 census this may rise, and as a result it may be time we move to change this countrywide, not just Glastonbury and Scotland. England and Wales deserve the chance to wed in a Pagan religious ceremony. I know I'm not the only one who thinks this.",
        "background": "Handfasting has been an ancient form of marriage since before Christianity reached the country. Where it is legal to be handfasted, it is not recognised in England and Wales as a legal form of marriage, such as Christian ceremonies are. In this open and free age it's time to follow Scotland's lead.",
