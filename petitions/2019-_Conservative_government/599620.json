        "additional_details": "The Government is asked to allow construction workers to come work in the UK without a sponsor visa and the current restrictions to ensure the continuous growth of the construction industry, and therefore of our economy.\r\n \r\nTo help our economy recover and grow we need a thriving construction industry and to loosen our immigration rules.\r\n \r\nPlease support the construction industry and the economy by signing this petition today.",
        "background": "In January 2021 it was estimated that the UK construction market has lost a quarter of its EU-born workforce.\r\n \r\nThe Government should ease immigration rules for construction workers, so that migrants with the required skills can move to the UK freely to work.",
