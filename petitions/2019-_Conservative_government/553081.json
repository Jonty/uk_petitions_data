Our year groups have faced more turmoil than any other and yet people seem to think that three weeks will make up for all of this. \r\n\r\nThose students who did take part in online learning should not be punished through the postponing of exams. No students want this. Let us sit the exams in June, or cancel them, and move on with our lives. We deserve a break!",
