        "additional_details": "The government should instruct the BBC & ITV to reshow as live a tournament e.g. the 1998 FIFA world cup. Thus allowing a second national conversation to take place for a large percentage of the population.   \r\n\r\nThis second conversation would provide a useful distraction and stop people ruminating on: the risk the disease will pose to elderly love ones, and other concerns individuals have at this time. Additional it would support social isolation & provide a platform for public health messages.",
        "background": "COVID-19 has resulted in social distancing (people living in isolation) and the suspension of sporting activities. Thus COVID-19 is the sole focus of national conversation. Whilst this is rightly the case, over a prolonged period it possess the risk of having an adverse impact on mental health.",
