        "additional_details": "Employers are already required to provide adequate toilets and toilet paper, so 100% of mens needs are covered. Women still have to provide their own tampons. I have lost wages having to go home because I have been unable to afford a tampon from the shop on shift, and I worked in a GP practice. It would save women embarrassment. It would save poor women from having to choose between food and tampons. At a minimal cost to employers (some of the non applicator boxes are \u00a31).",
        "background": "I would like parliament to change the legal standards for employers to provide employees free tampons and pads on shift. A workplace should be considered insufficient until tampons are provided.",
