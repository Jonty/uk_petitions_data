        "additional_details": "So many people have found comfort in getting outdoors during lockdown and appreciating the natural world. Many of us that live in cities would never get the opportunity to plant a tree. \r\nA tree is something that can outgrow and out live us and bring its joy to future generations. They are symbols of life and, as our climate changes, of hope.",
        "background": "Create a lasting, living memorial to those that have died during the pandemic. \r\nAlthough it may not be over, we could start to build something that literally brings life, habitat and clean air. Something positive and beautiful during this challenging time.",
