        "action": "Cancel Vocational Exams as you did A-Levels and GCSE exams",
        "additional_details": "It can be argued that whilst it\u2019s frustrating that students do all this hard work and spent fine revising, making notes and so, to then not sit the exams at all and it all seems like a waste, it is deemed more unjust and more stressful to see that A-Level and GCSE students don\u2019t have to sit their exams at all, and overall vocational course students have been treated differently, unjustly and assessed differently to A-Level and GCSE students",
        "background": "It\u2019s only fair that vocational exams are cancelled like A-Level & GCSE exams as it causes unnecessary stress on those taking vocational exams, and schools where those are supposed to take place are either confused, struggling to find a way around letting students come in to take the exams or both.",
