        "additional_details": "I believe that this country is in need for people to get back into the workplace and in a lot of cases, providing fully funded training would help those who have been made redundant or those who want a career change. \r\n\r\nFor example, in the construction trade, right now we need skilled workers. I believe that, unfortunately, a lot of people wishing to embark on a new career in construction are faced with a financial constraint. \r\n\r\nThe Government has announced some initiatives to help adults to retrain, such as access to loans, skills bootcamps and 'returnships'. However, these are only freely available to people who meet specific criteria. I think it would be in the interest of the Government to provide more help to people to get people back into the workplace.",
