Parents are being ignored and fobbed off by GP\u2019s, given prescriptions for medications to mask the problems which in turn is doing damage to babies bodies. As adults, we wouldn\u2019t eat something we are allergic to, yet babies keep being refused allergy formulas due to cost and parents are told it\u2019s just \u201ccolic\u201d. This is also extremely difficult on parents mental health and they are left with nowhere to turn.",
        "background": "I\u2019d like more support for babies struggling with allergies and reflux. Too many parents are being ignored when asking for help and are not being given correct prescriptions to deal with the issues due to cost, meanwhile babies are suffering.",
