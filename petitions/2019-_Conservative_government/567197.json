        "action": "Extend the deadline for Electrical Installation Condition Reports",
        "additional_details": "As a letting agent it's difficult to have all these electrical certificates completed in 9 months (July 2020 was the start date) especially when lockdowns keep stopping electricians from working. With staff on furlough for most letting agents it's difficult to even manage the work load never mind upcoming deadlines. Landlords already have pressure on them due to the rental shortage and the 6 month notice period. Please extend the deadline for Electrical Reports to April 2022 or December 31 2021.",
        "background": "The current deadline for Electrical Installation Condition Reports is April 2021. With the lockdown and tenants working from home or shielding, it's harder for contractors to physically enter the houses. The deadline therefore needs changing by 12 months or AT LEAST the end of 2021.",
