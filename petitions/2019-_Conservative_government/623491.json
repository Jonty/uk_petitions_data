        "additional_details": "Before the NHS, basic knowledge of health care and home remedies were common knowledge throughout the country, often lack of funds available to pay for doctors. Since the NHS, the general public have become dependant on diagnoses from nurses and GPs even for very superficial ailments resulting in serious cases being misdiagnosed or missed altogether. \r\nWe need to be retaught how to care for ourselves and keep our wonderful NHS strong enough for serious cases. Education is everything",
        "background": "Add basic health care to school curriculum. This will not only help in the general knowledge of the population but will also aid in taking some of the strain off the NHS and our overworked health care workers. Hopefully encouraging a healthier nation for the next generation.",

If you'd like something else, you could start a new petition clearly explaining what it is.\r\n\r\nThe Government's new Relationships Education, Relationships and Sex Education (RSE) and Health Education curriculum requires that all students be taught first aid in primary and secondary schools. For secondary school students, the curriculum states that students should know:\r\n\r\n\u2022 basic treatment for common injuries.\r\n\u2022 life-saving skills, including how to administer CPR.\r\n\u2022 the purpose of defibrillators and when one might be needed.\r\n\r\nYou can read the full Relationships Education, Relationships and\r\nSex Education (RSE) and Health Education curriculum here: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/908013/Relationships_Education__Relationships_and_Sex_Education__RSE__and_Health_Education.pdf\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for the Government to add to the list of things schools should teach students about as part of teaching them first aid, but it would need to be clear what new content you wanted to be added."
