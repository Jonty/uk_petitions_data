However, councils and banks are not releasing the money quick enough and the process is too slow. \r\nAccountants are under serious strain to support with the build of cashflows and many SME's do not understand the requirements needed to access the support available. \r\nPlease urgently review the process and make changes to save many companies from going under.",

The process is no different to a standard commercial facility and people in certain businesses do not understand the requirements to gain this funding.\r\n\r\nI recommend the process is changed to make money more accessible.",
