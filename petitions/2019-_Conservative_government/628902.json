        "additional_details": "There is minimal benefits for working parents when it comes to childcare. With the constant increase in day to day bills it is extremely difficult for us hardworking class families to pay for childcare. Extending free childcare would benefit working parents and help work output for the UK (more Tax). We are not asking for childcare from 1 year old. We are asking for a little help and bring it in line with people on benefits. The working class\r\npeople drive this country we are asking for help.",

It is crippling for families to fund childcare along side everyday bills and forces many people onto Universal Credits. We ask the government to help us.",
