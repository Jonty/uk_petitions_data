The Ukrainian armed forces have proved themselves strategically brilliant, given the right equipment hopefully they will be able to drive the Russian forces out and regain what is rightly and legally theirs.",
        "background": "Ukraine is fighting valiantly against an invading military force - Russia. With the recent 'annexation' of 4 regions in Ukraine, Putin has raised the stakes, he needs to be stopped NOW. The West needs to give Ukraine exactly what they are asking for, despite the cost, and the UK should lead on this.",
