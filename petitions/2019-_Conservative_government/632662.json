The downside is a likely strong chilling effect on what petitions are opened -- likely much stronger than the requirement of submitting real details.\r\nI was in fact planning to open another petition, one where I wouldn't mind the government etc. knowing who I am. The broader public is another matter though, so I've changed my mind.",
