The use of the A4 is unavoidable and thus makes this a money generating exercise and not about reducing pollution in the populated areas covered by the Clean Air Zone.",
        "background": "The A4 is a route that is unavoidable for most travel on the west of Bristol. The proposed Clean Air Zone should not cover this route. I propose that the Clean Air Zone go ahead without the A4 being included.",
