In Plymouth and South West of England majority of Dental Practices have gone private, leaving a multitude of people without a dentist.  Our children will grow up with bad or no teeth which could lead to oral cancer. I recently saw a local private dentist advertising for an associate dentist offering a salary of \u00a3100,000.\r\nPlease do something for the working class people  and their children, of our cities.",
