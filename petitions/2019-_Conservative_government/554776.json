They work with children to tackle issues of bullying, improving discipline and building resilience, they help people of all ages improve their mental health and help manage stress, and they build strong supportive communities. We have become a forgotten sector and the livelihoods and well being of many people is being threatened. We are asking for our plan to be signed off, as has been done already for many other sports.",
        "background": "On the 31st July a plan for a return to training was submitted to DCMS by a consortium of contact sports associations working in collaboration with Sport England. This plan was supposed to be reviewed by Downing Street but the meeting was cancelled. We ask for the plan to be reviewed and signed off.",
