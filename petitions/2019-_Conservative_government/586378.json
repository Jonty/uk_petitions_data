        "additional_details": "Over 10% of freshwater species are threatened with extinction and two thirds are in decline, including salmon. Only 14% of rivers are at good ecological status. 26% of groundwater bodies are at poor status. 40% of rivers suffer pollution from rural areas. Pollution incidents, caused by agriculture and water companies, occur routinely with almost no response from the Agency. Too little monitoring, inspection, enforcement and prosecution of existing pollution law.",
        "background": "The Government must reverse years of cuts to Agency budgets, increase charges for polluters, and give the Agency freedom from overly business-friendly Government codes and guidance, so it can pursue and achieve its principle statutory objective to protect and enhance English rivers",
