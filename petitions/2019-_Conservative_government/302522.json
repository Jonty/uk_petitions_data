        "additional_details": "They have been taken up in many cities around the world.\r\n\r\nBecause they are electric, they will help the UK achieve its goal of lower emissions.\r\n\r\nRestrictions can be imposed as they are currently are for pedalecs. \r\n\r\nElectric scooters are light enough to be lifted upstairs, they can be carried into lifts. They are so convenient. Not everyone has the space for a bicycle.\r\n\r\nThe website https://rideables.org/policy-recommendations/ contains some well thought out and fair reccomendations.",
        "background": "Electric scooters and other PLEVs (personal light electric vehicles) are currently illegal to ride on public roads.\r\n\r\nThe law needs to be changed so that these are considered the same as bicycles. So that they can be ridden in the road and on cycle lanes.",
