This is a huge part of the hospitality sector, yet caterers were left in the dark, with only the self-employment grant to tide them over and pay furloughed workers.

        "background": "Many caterers have felt totally excluded from the \"Help Out To Eat Out\" scheme, rates relief, grants, and further assistance from the government, as they do not have a physical premises, yet still have to furlough their workers in a time where business has dramatically dropped.",
