A clear distinction must be made between restaurants of different cultures and different nations and this is a breach of trust for consumers, fraudulent misrepresentation of a business and an infringement on the many decades of goodwill developed by genuine Indian restaurants.",
        "background": "The Government must enforce marketing and trade laws to ensure that restaurants serving Pakistani, Bangladeshi cuisine are not fraudulently claiming to be Indian restaurants. This is a misrepresentation and fraudulent use of a national identity and profiteering using illegitimate trading names.",
