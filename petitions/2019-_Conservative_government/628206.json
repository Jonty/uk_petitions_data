        "additional_details": "The climate crisis cannot be tackled while recyclable waste keeps going to landfill.\r\n \r\nWithout this funding and guidance, local councils will struggle to move ahead and many will simply maintain inadequate recycling systems. Without this funding, too many local councils are unwilling to invest in recycling services for fear of losing money. Without this funding, too many councils cannot afford to make necessary improvements.\r\n \r\nGuidance and funding are vital for tackling waste in the context of the climate emergency. We need urgent Government action on all aspects of the environment, and this is one key step towards that.",
        "background": "Alongside the Environment Act 2021, the Government pledged to provide funding and guidance to local councils to improve recycling. This has not materialised. We want the Government to provide the promised guidance and funding immediately.",
