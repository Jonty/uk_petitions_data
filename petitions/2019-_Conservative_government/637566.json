        "additional_details": " A report by the European Campaigning group Transport and Environment found private jets are 10 times more carbon intensive than airliners on average.\r\n\r\nThe campaigning group also reported that private jets departing the UK and France are the biggest source of pollution, representing over a third (36%) of private flight emissions in Europe between them. Its Policy Manager said: \u201cA private jet is the most polluting form of transport you can take. The average private jet emits two tonnes of carbon an hour. The average European is responsible for [emitting] eight tonnes of carbon a year. You fly to the south of France and back, that\u2019s half a year in one trip.\"",
        "background": "If the Government is serious about net zero then banning private jets is absolutely critical. Private jets generally produce significantly more emissions per passenger than commercial flights.",
