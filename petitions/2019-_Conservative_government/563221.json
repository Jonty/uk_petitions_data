        "additional_details": "I would like this changed as I myself am in this position I have a small 2 bed house and have a child off to high school in September I have no space for her to have a computer or study away from her sister. I have tried to swap on many occasions to no avail. the last lady who looked like she might swap with us was living alone in a 4 bed property. This just seems crazy to me why are they not forced to move. They only need 1 spare bedroom maximum for guests or hobbies etc.",
        "background": "When a council or housing association tenant has more than one spare room they should be forced to downsize. There are many families who are waiting for bigger homes. There's a problem with older people living in 3/4 bed properties just one person or one couple.",
