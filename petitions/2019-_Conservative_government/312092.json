The main list always achieves headlines due to which celebrities have been included on it. By having a separate NHS, Carers and Key Workers List, we can single out the individuals who most need our attention and gratitude this year. \r\n\r\nThis is not about the politics of honours. We're focused on praising brave NHS staff & key workers.",

We ask the Government create a separate list for them in The Queen\u2019s Birthday Honours 2020. This list would be devoted solely to honouring NHS staff and other key workers.",
