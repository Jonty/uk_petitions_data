        "additional_details": "We want each stage of a new home build, such as foundations, drainage, and plumbing to be signed off by an independent Government body that can be held accountable along with the builder. We believe current checks and measures are failing home buyers.\r\n \r\nThe Government should also make it easier for buyers to hold new home builders to account, without spending tens of thousands on legal fees. This could be achieved by creating an independent body to consider complaints about new build homes. There should also be serious financial penalties for developers if a new build home does not meet the required specifications and regulations.\r\n",
        "background": "We believe current legislation does not sufficiently protect buyers of new homes, or make new home builders sufficiently accountable. Some new home builders are cutting corners, putting profits ahead of standards and regulations, and leaving the buyer to pick up the pieces.",
