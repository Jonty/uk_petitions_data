        "additional_details": "He claims that he did not know Kamala Harris\u2019s name in order to refer to her so instead referred to her as \u2018The Indian\u2019. This is the first coloured female VP and his ignorance is unforgivable. This is not the first time he has made comments which are offensive to those with Indian heritage. In 2018, Lord Kilclooney made headlines when he called then Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who has an Indian father, a \u201ctypical Indian\u201d. People who make these comments are not who we want in the House of Lords",
        "background": "Government should look to the equality act 2010 and make a decision based on John Kilclooney\u2019s remarks online whether he is fit for his current role within the House of Lords. As a British Indian I find his comments absolutely disgusting and offensive.",
