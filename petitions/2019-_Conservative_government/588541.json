        "additional_details": "In the USA there are different laws regarding abandonment and there are \u2018Safe Haven\u2019 baby boxes that are available for mums/parents to use if they feel that this is their only option. These boxes are attached to numerous places (normally hospitals or fire stations) and when they are used it activates a 911 call allowing these vulnerable little ones to be found within minutes of being abandoned. The UK does not at the present time offer this service.",
        "background": "In the UK up to 50 babies are abandoned every year, these little ones are left in numerous different places and sadly for some they succumb to the cold/exposure before they are discovered. As a Midwife this is a subject that is extremely close to my heart, and I want there to be a safer option.",
