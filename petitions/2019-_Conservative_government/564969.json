        "additional_details": "The Government must act now to move schools online. The rate of cases of the new strain of Covid is a warning that we will see the rate of death climb exponentially if we do not close schools and move universities online. The risk of transmission between school children and adults has risen exponentially. More cases translate to more needless deaths\r\n\r\nExposing to school children who would be mixing with 100's of other children and their parents is a breach of the duty of care by the Government.",
        "background": "The new covid strain in the UK is 70% more contagious and infects more school age children. An alarming rate of cases and deaths has been seen already despite harsh tiering system. Time after time we have been too late to act chasing the data that is days if not weeks behind. Act now to save lives.",
