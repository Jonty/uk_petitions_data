        "action": "Give emergency services workers, NHS staff & carers a day to celebrate Christmas",
        "additional_details": "The mental health of NHS workers is deteriorating rapidly. Other keyworkers who are helping the nation to stay as safe as possible during this pandemic are also suffering and the lives of these hardworking people should not be further impacted in such a negative way for the fact their shifts happen to fall on Christmas Day. \r\nWe believe emergency service workers, NHS workers and other carers, should be granted an alternative day in which to celebrate Christmas (in a COVID-safe manner, of course).",
        "background": "It is depressing enough having to work Xmas Day, but when they have worked so hard all year sacrificing so much, some paying the ultimate price, it would be the right thing not to penalise them & allow them an alternative date to celebrate Xmas if they are having to work a long shift on Xmas Day.",
