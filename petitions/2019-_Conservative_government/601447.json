These children are at risk of being  harassed or discriminated against whenever they need to produce their birth certificates e.g. applying for their first passport, attending school,  going to university, getting married or collect their pensions. This reform must include the freedom to register as \u2018parent\u2019 and to be recognised as \u2018mother\u2019 and \u2018father\u2019 according to one\u2019s legal gender.",
        "background": "The government needs to change the law so that LGBTQ+ and surrogate families are recognised accurately and equally on children\u2019s birth certificates. UK law no longer reflects Modern British families and this needs to change.",
