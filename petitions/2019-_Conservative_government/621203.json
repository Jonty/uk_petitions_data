If girls can grow up with an annual celebration of women in sport it will help to encourage them to participate throughout their lives. The extra bank holiday would give girls and women more time to participate in sport, and everyone an opportunity to watch and support women\u2019s sport. It would also be a fitting tribute to the Women\u2019s Euro \u201822 team and their achievements.",
