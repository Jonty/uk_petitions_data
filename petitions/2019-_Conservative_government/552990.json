        "additional_details": "Paying an extra \u00a3325 for vehicles valued over \u00a340k for up to five years, is an unfair tax for vehicle enthusiasts. For example, Tesla (EV) seem exempt on all road tax (for emissions I'm in agreement) but still do use/wear road surfaces etc. Therefore, why are EVs not in the same taxed bracket when above \u00a340k? This additional tax should be uniform & balanced, not just aimed at non-EVs above \u00a340k. Don't forget the electricity supplied for EVs is not always \"green\" & batteries can last just 5-8 years.",
        "background": "Vehicle tax should be judged on emissions and other factors but having to pay an extra \u00a3325 for vehicles valued over \u00a340k (under 5yrs old) unless they are zero emission is baseless & just an added stealth tax for car enthusiasts. This unjust road tax for non-zero emission vehicles should be removed.",
