        "additional_details": "Currently in our UK schools, we teach languages such as; French, Spanish and German. I feel we are seriously neglecting every deaf/hard of hearing person living among us. For some, even leaving the house is a challenge because they are confronted with people who don\u2019t understand them and vice versa. \r\nEven if you do not personally know anybody who is deaf, speak up for those who suffer immensely because we can change the future and deaf people will no longer have to feel so isolated!",
        "background": "Growing up as a CODA (a child of deaf adult/s), I have seen the struggle deaf people go through, on a daily basis. With 11 million deaf people in the UK and only 151,000 BSL users, you can imagine how difficult life can be when trying to communicate with anybody outside of their immediate circle.",
