        "additional_details": "during the first lockdown, i experienced such severe mental health problems, i developed an eating disorder. when the gym opened, i put my complete focus into it and my eating disorder started to go away; as did my mental health, as the gym was my escape. as it is for many others who have mental health problems. by entering another lockdown, without keeping gyms open, i\u2019m concerned many others\u2019 mental health will deteriorate. this can be significantly avoided by permitting gyms to stay open",
        "background": "keep gyms open! there\u2019s enough evidence, as i\u2019ve read, to suggest that gyms don\u2019t need to close. they have such amazing effects on people\u2019s mental health. especially in these uncertain times, people need some escape from these anxieties. gyms are the most hygienic place. this is so crucial",
