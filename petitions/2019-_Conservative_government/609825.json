There is a real potential that we could one day be having to learn how to use machine guns and make Molotov cocktails, to protect our homes and our children. Ukrainian people are fighting alone. Would we also have to fight alone? Would the rest of the world leave us abandoned in our time of need? Would they also take days to debate sanctions as innocent people die in an illegal war?",

Make sure that all the information is shared, the truth about the nuclear threat that Vladimir Putin has given if we send troops in. The consequences of us not sending in troops shared.",
