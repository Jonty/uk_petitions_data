        "additional_details": "Protected trees and grade listed parks should be afforded the same protection as grade listed buildings. There are significant sanctions against persons when the protected status of a tree has been violated. However, local authorities can give permission for trees subject to preservation orders to be cut down, and there are no statutory protections for listed parks.\r\n\r\nThe Government should increase the rights of trees and grade listed parks, to prevent their protection being removed when a local authority so desires. The environment, especially in urban areas is under constant threat because of development. However, nature should be made foremost in all planning decisions in order to protect our environment. Development working in harmony with nature must be the way for future progress.",
