        "additional_details": "I believe personally it should be legalised for more reasons than I can count.\r\n1. Medical benefits\r\n2. Help remove it from the black market\r\n3. It would boost the economy\r\n4. It would also bring in revenue which with \u201cBrexit happening\u201d we could do with it\r\n5. The government allows the sales of tobacco, alcohol which kill many people so why can\u2019t they allow the sales of a \u201cdrug\u201d that\u2019s never killed anyone. \r\n6. I\u2019ve never met anyone who smokes it malicious intent; only ever those who enjoy its effects",
        "background": "I want the UK Government to legalise Cannabis for personal cultivation and for recreational use because it would give great economic growth to the county, open up jobs , help remove it from the black market, it would also help with Brexit through taxed sales",
