        "additional_details": "There are so many children in the UK due to the obvious circumstances of Coronavirus that would have missed out on half a years worth of education. \r\nWhilst all children have been off, not all have been educated or had the same level of access to education. \r\nIf all children are repeating the current academic year it would reinforce subjects already taught as they'd be looked at again as well as giving adequate time to teach the remaining curriculum for the year.",
        "background": "I'd like all children in the UK to recommence their current academic year when schools open in September.  Effectively hold them back a year. It would the bring us in line with European and American education.",
