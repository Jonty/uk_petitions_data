        "additional_details": "I believe the government/local councils need to abolish premiums so young people who want to get on the housing market actually can, this is stopping so many people from being able to buy the affordable way. Premiums are simply for houses in high demand and so the estate agents get more commission and are not in favour or the buyer/seller like fixtures and fittings are. This is very unfair treatment on FTB simply trying to get onto the market as you can\u2019t even add it to your mortgage.",
        "background": "The premiums put on these shared ownership houses are in excess of up to \u00a330,000 making it totally unaffordable for a first time buyer using the shared ownership scheme. You may as well buy outright when the premiums are this high but the whole point of shared ownership is people can\u2019t.",
