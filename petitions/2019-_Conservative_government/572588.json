        "additional_details": "Following the recent video that's surfaced of the police taking away a perfectly safe dog from its owner, causing it unnecessary stress and suffering, you should be dealing with dogs that are actually a danger, not descrimating because of its breed. You wouldn't descrimate against a person because of their colour or background. We as the UK are meant to be a nation of animal lovers yet this act is a load of rubbish, it's ineffective, old-fashioned and unethical.",
