        "additional_details": "Making the event industry switch over to using white diesel (full duty) rather than red could cause rising costs, loss of revenue and event-based companies going out of business. We believe it could also increase the risk of theft, and associated environmental hazards, and even lead to forecourt fuel shortages.\r\n \r\nIndustries that are still allowed to use red diesel in generators & plant machinery include fairgrounds & circuses. Why are they allowed to use it when we are all in the same industry?",
