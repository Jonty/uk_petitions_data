        "additional_details": "There are 15,000 in the UK that suffer from a disease called sickle cell. The majority of whom are of Afro-Caribbean decent. Previously this request was rejected, and we believe the Government must now reconsider. Most people need to take a daily dose of antibiotics, often for the rest of their life, yet sickle cell sufferers have to pay for their prescriptions. We believe this is a medical injustice, and unfairly discriminates on the basis of race! No one should have to pay to stay alive, no one should have to pay for necessary medication.",
        "background": "I am calling for the Government to include Sickle Cell Anemia as a listed illness eligible for a Medical Exemption Card. This request has previously been rejected, yet in light of the cost of living crises, this action is far too little and far too late.",
