This decision will directly affect hundreds of older and vulnerable people who use this service. This service cut may mean that people can no longer stay at home and will need to move into care, putting extra strain on the NHS and stretched care services, and potentially lead to ill health or death.",

I want the Government to require local authorities to offer a service providing hot food to the oldest and most vulnerable people at home.",
