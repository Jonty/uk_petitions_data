Prime minister announced scrapping of IHS for NHS and social care workers on 21 May and later he announced a refund for the same.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately many of the migrant health workers excluded from this refund as government included only those who applied for their visa after March 31. I urge the government to give a full or partial refund for health workers who fought for the UK during COVID-19",
