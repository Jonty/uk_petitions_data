        "additional_details": "Following 40 years of conflict in Northern Ireland the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) were awarded the George Cross (GC) Medal.  Similarly the island of Malta was honoured with the GC following their heroism in WW2. I urge the UK Government to honour our NHS for its outstanding service during the virus crisis.  They should be known forever as National Health Service GC. This will mark for future generations our appreciation of the heroism of our frontline Doctors, Nurses, Paramedics, Porters , Drivers, Ambulance Crews and Volunteers. This is not intended to replace a well deserved pay rise but as a marker in history. When we defeat this virus it will be due to the NHS and in spite of rather than because of politicians.",
        "background": "As a mark of respect and gratitude the NHS should be awarded the George Cross as a measure of the service they have given the nation at considerable risk to themselves.",
