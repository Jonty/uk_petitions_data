Due to the pandemic, this has not been possible. It is felt the tuition fee cannot no longer be justified.\r\n\r\nThe toll the pandemic has take on mental health is undeniable, but very little has been done to help; universities have not provided adequate support, and some are also struggling financially. Mental health is at an all time low amongst students.",
