        "additional_details": "The current nasopharyngeal swabs are too invasive, traumatic and damaging (e.g. leading to nosebleeds or ongoing psychological trauma) for young children. \r\n\r\nThe saliva test is currently being used by Southampton City Council for school children and university staff and students. It is said to be as accurate in picking up the virus as the nasal and throat swab: https://www.southampton.gov.uk/coronavirus-covid19/covid-testing/testing-programme/about-the-saliva-test.aspx",
        "background": "Many parents avoid testing their children for Covid-19 because the current test is so invasive for young people. This leads to an increased risk of Covid-19 transmission in the community. It is in everyone\u2019s interest to use a safer, less invasive test for children.",
