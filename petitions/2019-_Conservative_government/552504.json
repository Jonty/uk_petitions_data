Consistently damaged Scotland\u2019s image as a safe place to invest and do business by continually creating uncertainty about Scotland\u2019s future political and currency model. \r\n3. Lacked ambition and failed to deliver what was intended with education, transport and capital projects eg. \u201crest and be thankful\u201d tunnel.",
        "background": "The Scottish people never envisaged an failing intolerant one party state when they voted for devolution in 1997. Devolution has failed. The cost of the devolved administration is not justified. Westminster must set a question and offer the opportunity to reverse that decision.",
