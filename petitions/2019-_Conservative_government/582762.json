        "additional_details": "I am asking the government to consider a legal, formal, straight forward route for a young, unskilled person via an Au Pair Visa to enter the UK for a limited period of time to stay in a host family legally in exchange for childcare. \r\n\r\nAu Paring is allowed in anywhere in Europe, in any civilised Western Democracy including the US, Australia, New Zealand etc.",
        "background": "The new Brexit climate kills the dreams of thousands of young people to spend some time abroad as part of their gap year after school or during university. It's a way to live in a save place in a foreign country for a limited period of time by helping a family in their day to day tasks.",
