University students many of whom have worked extremely hard for the majority of their life to get to this point. We have received no government support over the whole of the pandemic and with the virus only getting worse we need security. We need to be backed up by predicted grades to ensure we do not fall below what we are truly capable of. We need security during these unprecedented times.",

There is so much uncertainty and the stresses and strains we are experiencing are detrimental to our wellbeing. We need security at times like this.",
