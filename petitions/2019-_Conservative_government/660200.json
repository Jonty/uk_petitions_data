        "additional_details": "Managing severe mental health conditions can require daily medication to control symptoms triggered by stress. The financial burden of multiple medications can add stress. Skipping meds due to cost could lead to costly hospitalizations that outweigh the cost of free prescriptions. Staying medicated can be vital to stability, preventing further healthcare costs. If people stop taking their meds, it can be very dangerous to themselves and to others so it is vital that they can continue to do so.",
