        "additional_details": "Reducing barriers to work for disabled people should improve their personal wellbeing and could boost GDP. A 2017 Government white paper stated that finding work for an additional 1% of disabled workers would save the Exchequer \u00a3240 million, and provide a boost to the economy of \u00a3260 million. \r\n\r\nBy making it a legal right for non-GOR roles to choose to work from home it is hoped that economic inactivity for 3.6 million disabled people can be reduced, in the spirit of the Equality Act.",
        "background": "The Government should give disabled employees the legal right to work from home for office-based job roles and/or where no genuine occupational requirement (GOR) is in place to require an employee to be on site.",
