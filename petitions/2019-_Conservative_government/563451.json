        "action": "Add dyed hair, tattoos, piercings and other alt style to discrimination act",
        "additional_details": "In these unprecedented times, with unemployment rates sky rocketing, the last thing stopping an otherwise very employable worker getting a job should be their individual choice of style. \r\nI, and many others like me, have been treated differently by our employers, even when it seems irrelevant to the role. Eg, customer service at a bowling alley. \r\nAdd choice of style (like choice of religion, gender etc) to the discrimination act so we are protected.",
        "background": "Amend the discrimination act to include tattoos, dyed hair, piercings, etc as these do not affect a person's ability to work. \r\nFor a business to reprimand, fire or not hire an employee based on their alternative style is outdated, and places their appearance above their professional worth.",
