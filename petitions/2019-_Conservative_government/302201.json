        "additional_details": "I would like to see claiming for child benefit and penalty for high income child benefit charge be restructured to make it fairer to families who have one main income from one parent/guardian that may supersede the \u00a350,000 by a small margin but where the other parent/guardian income falls below the taxable earnings limit, How is it fair that a family where both parent/guardians earn \u00a349,999 each in a financial year totalling \u00a399,998 do not get charged for the high income child benefit charge?",
        "background": "In the recent few financial years I have earned between \u00a350,000-\u00a357,000 and my partner barely \u00a37,000 a year and have been hit with the high income child benefit charge, yet a family with two incomes earning \u00a349,999 each in a financial year do not get hit by such a penalty charge how is this fair?",
