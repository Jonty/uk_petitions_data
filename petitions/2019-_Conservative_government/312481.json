        "additional_details": "Whilst it is understandable that there should be a date restriction (to avoid abuse from employers), it is my belief this is unfair on those who started new jobs after 28 February 2020.\r\n\r\nThese individuals now face possible loss of income and/or redundancy in such an uncertain time.\r\n\r\nThe date requirement should be changed to anyone employed up to 20 March 2020, and to allow employees who have been made redundant due to this, to be eligible for rehire and  backdated Furloughed status.",
        "background": "On 20 March 2020 the Government announced its Job Retention Scheme.\r\n\r\nOne requirement for being eligible for Furloughed status, is that employees must have been on PAYE payroll on 28 February 2020.\r\n\r\nThis should be changed to allow anyone employed up to the date of the announcement to be eligible.",
