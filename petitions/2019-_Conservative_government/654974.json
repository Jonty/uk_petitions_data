        "additional_details": "They need to relook at the Care Allowance. Not one size fits all. Sole Carers are hit the hardest in their role \r\nFinancially, Physically, Mentally. They need help in their Role.Help with getting restbite for themselves weekly. Help with providing the one to take care of with a full life. That is impossible with that Care Allowance. A lump Sum or increase should be prepared yearly for the Sole Carer to use as an Aid in getting help with Care breaks, assisting in Daily costs from day to day & more",
        "background": "Firstly there isn't enough space here to explore what my petition is for. And the families affected by Disability as a Carer to that person. As it stands the care Allowance of 70pence a hr is not only a joke but isn't a provision to provide the help Carers need. SOLE Carer are crying out for  help!",
