        "action": "To remove the Standing Charge from all utility bills.",
        "additional_details": "Standing Charges were implemented to cover the cost of meters and infrastructure repair. This is now a redundant. Both energy and water companies profit from above inflation rises in the Standing Charges and have done for a number of years. Meters are reliable. Utility companies have breached contract by failing to upkeep the infrastructure, resulting in fines which are not returned back to the customers. The customer still continues to pay for this level of greed and incompetence.",
        "background": "Remove the Standing Charge imposed by energy and water companies as this is little more than indirect taxation and a means of profiteering from the UK public. The customer should only pay for the service they use and the infrastructure of the service, which was already paid for by the UK population.",
