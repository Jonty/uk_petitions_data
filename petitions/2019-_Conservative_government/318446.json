        "action": "Make travel companies give cash refunds to customers for COVID-19 cancellations",
        "additional_details": "A lot of companies in the travel industry have changed their terms and conditions and applied retrospectively during COVID-19 so that consumers no longer get a cash refund in the event of cancellation but a future travel credit note.  They have made as difficult as possible for consumers to get refunds. Some have promised refunds only to give credit notes 30 days later and claim 'force-majeure' means they don't have to provide any sort of refund whatsoever. Majority do already do right thing.",
        "background": "The government should specifically legislate that in the event of any cancellation not made by the consumer the travel company must provide an immediate cash refund to the consumer within 14 days. The government should provide sanctions where the company does not comply with this.",
