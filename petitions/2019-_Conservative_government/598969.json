        "additional_details": "Due to lockdowns this year and last year, the current Year 11\u2019s do not have a lot of time to educate themselves to prepare for the summer exam. This is stressful for the students because they have a maximum time period to revise and learn in school and outside of school, before they sit the summer 2022 exams. This could harm their mental health, because they are worried about failing.",
        "background": "Students would like the government and the department for education to report grade 3 as a standard pass on all subjects. This would ensure students are less stressed and worrying about failing their 2022 summer exam.",
