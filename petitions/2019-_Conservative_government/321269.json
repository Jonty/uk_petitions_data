        "additional_details": "Many people have reached the age where they were due to retire but, due to a change in the pensionable age, they now have to wait  to receive their state pensions. It would be a small financial price to allow those within that age group, to retire and receive their pension, or percentage of their pension and to be replaced in the employment market by people otherwise unemployed and receiving benefits, because of the Corona virus crisis. A compassionate and practical response to the crisis.",
        "background": "By allowing a proportion of the aging workforce to retire would be a practical way to provide some openings in the employment market. It would also be a practical response to the ensuing employment problems.",
