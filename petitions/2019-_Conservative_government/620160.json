        "action": "Introduce and add more plant life to schools",
        "additional_details": "Plant life being added to schools can have an affect on people with allergies so the types of plants added will still have to be suitable for a place of education. With the correct plants introduced, students can focus a lot more without the worry of stress. I hope for this to reach the right audience and possibly even be considered. I'm sure that there a many people who may agree with this petition. Thank you",
        "background": "Many schools (most of them) do not contain much plant life. Although it isn't extremely education relevant, plants can give off many useful side effects which a hard working student could need. Examples of these effects: people's mental well being, reduction in stress and positive emotions.",
