This is preventing an honest and open discussion about white privilege and the oppression and exploitation of BAME communities and how this still shapes our society today.\r\n\r\nI ask this government to provide an uncensored picture of our nation's history to develop a more aware, educated and compassionate generation of young people and build the foundation for a better future.",
