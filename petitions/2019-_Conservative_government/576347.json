        "additional_details": "The government should have learnt from previous lockdown measures that opening up schools whilst in a lockdown is a mistake. I understand that opening up schools is important however every time the U.K. opens up schools, there\u2019s a spike in cases and then the younger generations are always blamed. I feel like schools should be closed until ideally May or April earliest ,however the option to return to school on selected days should be open to vulnerable students or students suffering with mental health.",
