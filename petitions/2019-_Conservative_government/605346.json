        "additional_details": "I switched to vaping with a few friends after smoking 60 a day for over 40 years. The tank being so small means not only do I need to fill it more often but I also need to carry multiple refill bottles with me when I go out. If you are a heavy user like me switching to vaping after smoking so much I need a few refill bottles daily and dread running out when the shops are closed. My friends are all back on cigs as they just could not be bothered with all the hassle. I am trying to stay strong.",
        "background": "The vape tank and eliquid refill bottle volume limits should be removed from the TRPR. They achieve nothing but the frustration of vapers and people who are trying to switch from smoking to vaping, push up costs for consumers and increase the number of plastic bottles and packaging thrown away.",
