        "additional_details": "This means that a large proportion of their subject knowledge is missing and it would be unfair to place them under pressure to perform in 2021 exams and compare their results to previous years. GCSE and A-level grades greatly influence a person\u2019s future, by deciding what university they attend or if they are successful in a job application, and those taking part in 2021 exams are already greatly disadvantaged and will be disadvantaged for the rest of their lives if exams are not cancelled.",
        "background": "Cancel 2021 exams and award predicted grades. Students in years 10 & 12 have already missed around 10 weeks of school due to the coronavirus pandemic and it\u2018s highly unlikely that they will receive any physical lessons until at least September, which results in a loss of almost 4 months of teaching.",
