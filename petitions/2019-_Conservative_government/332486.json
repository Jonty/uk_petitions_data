        "action": "Extend the time frame for driving on an international license in UK",
        "additional_details": "Current regulations do not allow to apply for a provisional license before 185 days of residency. This clause has been harsh for those residents completing their 185 days february 2020 onwards  as the lockdown happened due to COVID-19, which further resulted in suspension of theory and driving tests. The driving tests have been restarted only for classified workers or for those who had their tests booked pre-lockdown. There is no intimation whatsoever on the date for new test bookings.",
        "background": "Request to increase the current time frame of 12 months under which we can drive on an international license in UK. Currently no new practical tests are being booked, except for the ones scheduled prior to lockdown. This is huge concern if this time frame of 12 months is getting expired/has expired.",
