        "additional_details": "This would help reduce stress for students and could mean the award of fairer grades that students have already worked for. This boundary results in previous hard work being rewarded. The disruption caused by the pandemic has caused huge changes in grade for Year 13 students. Grading solely off this year is unfair.\r\n \r\nWith the increasing concern of young people's mental health, decreased exam pressures will ensure students are confident in their future plans and can 100% focus on current work.",
