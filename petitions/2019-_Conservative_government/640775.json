        "additional_details": "Studies have found that children are eight times more likely to be killed, and adults more than twice as likely to be killed, in a collision involving an SUV, than one involving a standard car.\r\n \r\nIncreased carbon emissions from passenger cars between 2016 and 2019, which have cancelled out reductions in emissions from electric car sales, have also been attributed in part to a rise in the sale of SUVs.\r\n \r\nA ban on adverts for SUVs could help improve road safety and reduce carbon emissions.\r\n",
        "background": "In 1965 the UK banned TV adverts for cigarettes, because of the widely accepted risk that smoking tobacco poses. We believe the rise of \"sports utility vehicles\" (SUVs) poses a similar risk, and that adverts for these vehicles should be banned.",
