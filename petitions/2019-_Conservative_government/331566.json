        "additional_details": "The Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) published an article on the 7th July, condemning the move to resume arms trading with Saudi Arabia. Andrew Smith of the CAAT said: 'This is a disgraceful and morally bankrupt decision. The Saudi-led bombardment of Yemen has created the world's worst humanitarian crisis, and the government itself admits that UK-made arms have played a central role on the bombing.' By resuming grants, the UK will not be simply complicit, but actively fueling the Yemen crisis.",
        "background": "On the 7th July, it was announced that the Government will resume the granting of new licenses for arms sales to Saudi Arabia, and regions that are part of the coalition currently bombing Yemen. The Government must stop granting these licenses with immediate effect.",
