Business Rates is neither. Falling behind with employee wages or payment to supply chain creditors brings the economy and operations to a stop, businesses will close, unemployment will rise. All businesses are in the same boat. The economy will recover quicker the more people are employed & paying taxes. What benefits the economy. Rates or Taxes.",
