We all worked to the very end of term, mixing with 30 ish children & consequently their \r\nfamilies,  only then to be told that we are in another lockdown & can't see our own families! To then go back on the 4th January,  just a week away, I feel would be throwing us all into the lions den! Our upmost concern is for our children, their families and us.",
