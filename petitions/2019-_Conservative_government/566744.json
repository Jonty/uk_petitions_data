        "action": "Include Early Years education/childcare in the national lockdown",
        "additional_details": "The Government needs to consider closing nurseries until at least Feb half term. Nursery workers are not considered key workers so are not a priority to receive vaccination, and these workers are taking care of an age group that can't maintain social distancing effectively. As Boris mentioned, schools are vectors for the virus - meaning that pre-schools are vectors as well. While Early Years socialisation is important the health and safety of staff, children and family memebers is paramount.",
        "background": "With the announcement on 4th January 2021 that the Government will close primary schools, secondary schools, colleges, and universities to stop the spread of the virus, the Government should be closing Early Years education as part of this lockdown as well.",
