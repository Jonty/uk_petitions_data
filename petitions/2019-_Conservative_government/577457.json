Combined these actions have lead to more unnecessary suffering and deaths. Lockdowns have been prolonged and the economy has been damaged more than necessary.  The people spreading the baseless false information to created fear, doubt and uncertainty must be held to account. Making it a criminal offence should deter them.",
