        "action": "Introduce a law which makes it legally binding to put an offer on buying a house",
        "additional_details": "By introducing this law it could make buying and selling less stressful. Stop people easily breaking chains causing stress for multiple people. And allow sellers to have the peace of mind that if a buyer pulled out they will not have to pay out for already completed work.\r\nThis could help the housing market by freeing up houses much quicker as chains are not constantly being broken.",
        "background": "Moving house is already stressful enough. But introducing this law we can stop buyers pulling out. And if they do costs can be recovered by the sellers. This will also help stop chains collapsing after people have offered on multiple houses to later decide what house they would like.",
