With the right environments, lives and money could be saved, and autistic people may not need to be kept in hospitals for long periods.\r\n \r\nKeeping Autistic people in an environment which does not meet their needs can be costly and traumatic, and lead to a repeating cycle, as it is not preventative.\r\n",
