We\u2019ve been left in a huge loophole. According to the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, employees need to have been set up on PAYE by the 28th Feb 2020, to be eligible to the scheme of receiving 80% of their pay. I cannot work due to the virus but am not eligible for the scheme nor universal credit, as I am still employed. Please help!",
