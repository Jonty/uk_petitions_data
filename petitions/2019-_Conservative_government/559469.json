        "additional_details": "A medal is given for a campaign and even though patrols were common place and the risk to life high, no government so far has seen it worthy to recognise the role that our armed forces played during this time. This demeans the soldiers and service personnel who maintained the border and more importantly kept the peace. By creating a medal, this can give the thanks  to those that served to protect this country, that they most definitely deserve.",
        "background": "Between 1945 and 1991, thousands upon thousands of British soldiers risked their lives to protect what they believed in. Some were given a life expectancy of hours if war broke out yet these men and women have no recognition of how they served our country. Put simply - this needs to change.",
