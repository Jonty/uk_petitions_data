        "additional_details": "People often work long weeks doing overtime as they need to support their families and are often trying to better themselves ie. buy a house, clear debt or help their family members, but overtime is subject to income tax and NI, and if someone does overtime regularly can put them into a higher tax bracket. I believe overtime should be exempt from income tax and national insurance contributions, or at least that lower rates should be applied.",
        "background": "I would like overtime pay to be untaxed or taxed at a lesser rate. Many people, especially those on low incomes, try to better their situation by working overtime, but this involves giving up their free time, and as such pay from overtime should not be taxed, or should be taxed at a lower rate.",
