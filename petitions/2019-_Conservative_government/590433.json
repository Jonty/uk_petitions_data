As a working mum, I would love to avoid this and keep him home for 10 days but that\u2019s not possible. After the trauma of our 4th test I\u2019ve decided it\u2019s time someone gives our toddlers a voice. I\u2019m calling on the UK government to stop Covid tests on toddlers unless they have 2 or more symptoms and to start using a less intrusive test.",
        "background": "I recently took my 20 month old son for his 4th Covid test. He started nursery in November and has picked up various bugs which have given him a temperature. Bugs are good for children\u2019s immune systems but the net effect is that parents are having to take them for repeated Covid tests",
