        "additional_details": "The cost of living crisis has taken a toll for many teachers resulting in one and six teachers leaving their profession. The workload is intense and many have to work overtime. We simply do not have enough teachers to teach maths. Many careers does not require post 16 maths, just a pass in English and Maths GCSE. Post 16 individuals are excited about a new chapter. We don't want to dampen their enthusiasm. What relevance will two additional years of maths give to future generations?",
        "background": "The government should not go forth on the plan of compulsory maths until 18 and rather look at more maths lessons and how we make maths relevant and interesting to young people ensuring the topic covers personal finance and money skills. GCSE Maths should already cover financial skills.",
