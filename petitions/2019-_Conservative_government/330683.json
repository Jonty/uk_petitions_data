        "additional_details": "The government should pass a bill which allows for business owners to sell cannabis under a government regulation similar to alcohol and tobacco. The UK happily helps the economy by exporting cannabis elsewhere and with us owning the largest farm in Europe, I feel we should free the restrictions on our own citizens.\r\n\r\nThis will boost tax revenue and increase tourism!\r\n\r\nIf also possible, credit Dean West AKA Ital Samson in the bill. Dean was an amazing man and cannabis atavist who recently passed.",
        "background": "Pass a bill so that Cannabis can be regulated the same way alcohol and tobacco is. By doing this, we help build the economy, regulate the types of cannabis on the streets (No sale of skunk/chemically enhanced strains) and allow for coffee shops similar to Amsterdam to open up.",
