Passing this law should help make the job market fairer and more efficient.\r\n\r\nThe UK's gender pay gap topped 14% in 2022. Including salary ranges in job ads would mean employers have to be transparent about pay.\r\n\r\nWhile pay can be experience dependent, most companies work to budgets and industry benchmarks. They should provide an intended salary or salary range on all job ads to improve the process.",
