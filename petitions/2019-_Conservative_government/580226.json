        "additional_details": "The current system for Mayoral elections uses the \u2018supplementary vote\u2019, a crude but workable form of proportional representation. It broadly functions well and there appears to be little need to change it, especially not to the archaic and dysfunctional FPTP.\r\nFPTP routinely gives victory to candidates who gain only a minority of the total votes cast, leaving the majority of voters disgruntled and feeling disenfranchised.",
        "background": "The Government has stated that it intends to change the voting system for these important elections to First Past The Post, the system in use for General elections.\r\n\r\nFPTP is widely thought to be anti-democratic in modern multi-Party democracies and this would be a very retrograde step.",
