        "additional_details": "Selling these items in family day to day shops is helping to desensitise children from sex and forcing imagery of adult genitals and masturbation into our children\u2019s minds. Adult genitals should not be shown to children- real or pretend. There is a reason that sex toys are not left on the kitchen table or on a shelf in the living room. They are not for children to see.",
        "background": "Make it mandatory that x-rated vaginal, anal and oral sex toys; in the obvious shape of penis\u2019, vagina\u2019s and other intimate body parts; are only to be sold in listed sex shops out of the sight and reach of children.",
