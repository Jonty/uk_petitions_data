        "action": "Extend the expiry date on Driving Theory tests by 6 months",
        "additional_details": "Due to the ongoing situation with Covid-19, those who have passed their theory test and are currently in preparation for their practical test will lose hours of valuable lesson time. In addition to this, much of the progress they have already made will be reversed to an extent, due to not being able to practice with an instructor for a significant length of time. Therefore it is unfair to expect people in this situation to pay to take another theory test, even long after lockdown is lifted.",
        "background": "Allow those who have passed the DVLA Driving Theory Test within the last 2 years to have the expiry date of their test extended by a further 6 months, to account for lesson time and progress lost due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.",
