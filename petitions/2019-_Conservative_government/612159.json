        "additional_details": "We are at a pivotal point in history where the west must show that war crime activities, such as indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas, cannot be tolerated. Telling the Ukrainians they are heroic is all well and good, but future history will condemn those who sat on their hands and watched all this destruction without supporting the Ukranians in every way possible. History from the last century tells us that weakness emboldens despots and leads us on an inevitable path to future conflict.",
