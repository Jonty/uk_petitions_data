Having longer days in school is being unproductive and unhealthy for the adults and kids. Schools should operate the way it has been before the virus (the hours) and find more suitable and easier ways to catch up with school work such as now allowing homework!",

To also not have longer school days as that will not be healthy for the adults or kids especially around this virus time. Things should be as normal as possible without major change",
