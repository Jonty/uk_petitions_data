        "additional_details": "This is vitally important for every single student across the country to be given a chance in the future and access to their dreams and ambitions with a fair marking system which will allow all individuals who are meant to be doing exams a safe alternative as they have missed months of online learning which cannot be catched up in months, or by delaying exams to a later period. This will also give more clarity to all students as well as peace of mind in these already difficult times.",
        "background": "Since March 2020, all students have been stuck at home having to learn 'remotely' on a laptop or over the Internet. We ask the government to scrap these exams and instead give the teachers the ability to use predicted grades in order to mark students fairly all across the UK.",
