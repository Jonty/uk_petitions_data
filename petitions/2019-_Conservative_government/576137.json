        "additional_details": "The loud booms that fireworks cause impact hundreds of thousands of individuals & animals around the UK. survivors of trauma who share common issues with hypervigilance can become psychologically impacted during the weeks leading up to and following Nov 5th. This not only denotes to war veterens but all survivors of trauma who have difficulty with regulation and hypervigilance. Introducing such measures would allow the general public to enjoy home display which would benefit covid restrictions.",
        "background": "To follow in the footsteps of Collecchio, Italy - who made a law that fireworks in their town must be silent. It's a way of reducing the stress that the loud noises cause to people and animals. This would mean we would not have to rely on organised firework displays to keep noise to a minimum.",
