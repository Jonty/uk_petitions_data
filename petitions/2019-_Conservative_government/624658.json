        "additional_details": "We have seen many prime minsters take up position without an electoral mandate.\r\n\r\nWe have seen this last 10 days an example of how party policy has been railroaded and changed, when it was allegedly a character flaw that nescessitated the removal of the previous prime minister - not his polices. His replacement should surely be of improved character, but follow the same polices the elected party won their election on.\r\n\r\nA public vote should be the final say on their intentions.",
        "background": "Change the law so that new leaders of governing political parties do not automatically become Prime Minister, where they potentially can introduce new polices that are significantly different from the manifesto mandate that their party was successfully elected on.",
