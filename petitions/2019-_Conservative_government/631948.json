However there is widespread evidence of harmful effects of this neonicotinoid on bees and other pollinators, and its use in the European Union is banned for this reason. Bees and other pollinators are vitally important for the UK\u2019s ecosystem, and they are already in decline. The decision needs to be reversed.",
