        "additional_details": "Making deforestation illegal would save more than just the animals and plants that live there, it would save our planet. Rainforests are decreasing rapidly; once covering 14% of the worlds land surface- now only 6%. Experts estimate that rainforest deforestation is causing 137 plant, animal and insect species to die each day. Right now, 121 prescription drugs are coming from plant derived sources. The rainforests are home home to over half of the worlds animals.",
        "background": "Deforestation is becoming more devastating. We are losing the rainforests rapidly, and simultaneously medicine for life threatening diseases. The Amazon alone absorbs 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide a year, and we just can't afford to lose that.",
