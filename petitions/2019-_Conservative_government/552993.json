        "action": "Ban the burning of peatlands in the fight against climate change.",
        "additional_details": "By banning the burning of peatlands not only is CO2 not being released into the atmosphere from fires but the habitat is able to recover and become a more powerful, natural carbon sink. Peatlands also support a range of native species so their protection increases biodiversity.",
        "background": "The UK\u2019s peatlands store more than 3000 million tons of carbon. Burning peatlands for grouse shooting releases CO2 into the atmosphere adding to the climate crisis and further degrading this important habitat making it less capable of further carbon capture.",
