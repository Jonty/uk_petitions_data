This needs to change. We need to be listened to and understood and not left sitting on hard metal chairs when we are in excruciating pain and need help or begging for a GP appointment. Improved training could help staff triage a patient who is suffering from Endometriosis more effectively, as seeking medical advice is usually the very last step we will take.",
