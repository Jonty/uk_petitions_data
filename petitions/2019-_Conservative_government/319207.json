It is most prominent at the BBC\r\nGovernment and Parliament should set up a truly independent review so that the media can be regulated and accountable in an independent, transparent and efficient manner that simply does not apply today\r\nThe public need to be able to hold the media to account much more effectively. BBC Complaints is an exercise in self-assessment and OFCOM complaints are akin to diving into a black hole",
        "background": "At a time of National crisis, the public most need a free and impartial media to hold the Government to account. With few exceptions, the mainstream media has failed to do this. The public cannot hold the media to account as OFCOM and BBC Complaints are not fit for purpose and need reform.",
