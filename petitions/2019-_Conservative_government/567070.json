        "additional_details": "The Government has cancelled exams for the second time in 2 years. Many students are taking a gap year and resitting their exams externally, if students are given no CAG's, then they will lose their university or college places and will not be able to study their course. This could affect students' mental health as they will have to take another year out. Medical, dental and veterinary students will lose their places and could become depressed. So the government should require the use of predicted grades.",
