        "additional_details": "Because of COVID-19, my year group has missed out on some of the most important months of our education. Pushing the exams back won\u2019t regain these months. Instead, myself and many other A-Level students believe that the best course of action is to reduce the content tested on our exams. This gives us a fair chance to demonstrate what we have learnt/taught ourselves, without infringing on our time next summer to prepare for university and apprenticeships.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to consider reducing the content covered on A-Level 2021 papers because I believe that it is the only way for my year group to get a fair chance in the upcoming exams. We have missed too much teaching to sit the full exams, and pushing them back won\u2019t change that.",
