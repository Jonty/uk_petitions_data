        "action": "Make the prorogation of Parliament non justiciable by any court in the land.",
        "additional_details": "Last year the Supreme Court ruled that article IX of the 1689 Bill of Rights did not apply to prorogation and as such it has become a justiciable process. By this act the Supreme Court overturned 300 years of precedent and convention with no democratic mandate to do so. A new law needs passing to make it explicitly clear that no court may ever interfere with the prorogation process again and prevent the courts from prolonging the sitting of a zombie Parliament in defiance of the government.",
        "background": "Pass a Bill which makes the entire process of prorogation to be completely non justiciable so that any court interference with it is illegal and invalid. Prorogation should become a power of the Royal Prerogative to be used exclusively at the Queens discretion on the advice of the Prime Minister.",
