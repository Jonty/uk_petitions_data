        "additional_details": "MPs have a basic duty of care to their electorate. When there is an unexplained set of circumstances which are presumably lending themselves to the most athletic of the population to suddenly start collapsing, it is imperative that the antecedents of these incidents are investigated and the various sporting bodies (and not least the general public) are made aware of the causes of such events. Anything less than a full investigation would be a serious dereliction of public duty.",
        "background": "Following an incredible increase in the number of super fit young men and women having episodes which are leaving them severely debilitated or indeed dead while participating in elite level sports, MPs should be launching an urgent investigation as to the background circumstances of these events.",
