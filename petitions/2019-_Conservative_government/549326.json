This isn\u2019t fair on themselves and their families who have to suffer as a result of this inequality. \r\nThe majority of wheelchair users rely on them due to injury or illness, their lives are then made harder because of the lack of access in the UK. \r\nLack of accessible transport, lack of dropped curbs, lack of picnic tables and a lack of parking spaces all create an inequality within our country.",
