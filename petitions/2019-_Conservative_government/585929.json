        "additional_details": "Girls and women may feel embarrassed that they can't afford sanitary products. They may resort to using other items each month such as cut up rags. If each girl had a free pack of washable pads then it would reduce waste caused by sanitary products. It would stop embarrassment for girls and women as they would always have them and could reuse then. It would be much cheaper in the long run and research shows washable pads are better for women than disposable ones.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to offer each girl from school age onwards a pack of free washable sanitary pads. Period poverty is still a real problem and the disposable sanitary pads are bad for the environment. This would reduce waste , be better for the environment and would be less expensive.",
