        "additional_details": "There are no restrictions on alcohol sales from shops, pubs can continue offering food to take away, however businesses such as small \u2018wet-led\u2019 pubs and micro breweries have no options at all. This makes no sense, takeaway worked during the first lockdown, and allowed many businesses to survive. Please reverse this decision immediately, 1000s of small businesses depend on it.",
        "background": "During the first lockdown, the ability to sell alcohol to takeaway was an essential lifeline for several businesses. Pubs that sell food have the ability to continue offering takeaways, however the government have decided to block takeaway alcohol sales. This will destroy many pubs and breweries.",
