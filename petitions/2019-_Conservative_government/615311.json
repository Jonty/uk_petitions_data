        "additional_details": "I was recently denied seeing The Batman at the cinema because I wasn\u2019t of age. I have now watched it at home on a digital version and don\u2019t understand why it has been giving the rating of a 15 by the BBFC. You could say the violence is a bit brutal but I think it would be completely fine for e.g a 12 year old to see it as most of it is off screen. This is why I would like to add a 15A rating. This would mean that the film is a 15 rating because of the contents but someone underage could see it.",
