        "additional_details": "The education secretary has made the decision about GCSE and A level students saying it wouldn't be fair for them to sit their exams due to the disruption and lack of learning they've had, Btec students have had the same disruption if not more. They have been working hard for the last 4 months on their coursework only to be told in December that coursework will now not count towards their final grade it will be an exam. These students deserve to have teacher assessed grades like all others",
        "background": "Cancel Btec exams this summer like GCSE and A level exams have been cancelled. Btec students have had the same disruption as all other students and have worked just as hard as GCSE and A level students yet they are being put at the bottom of the pile again. Treat all students the same and fairly",
