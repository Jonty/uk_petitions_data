        "additional_details": "People need to travel whether it is in the form of driving around, or any other form of transport as this is what makes life fun. Without travel, the economy could really suffer, and people may possibly develop serious mental health problems. Legal action should be taken against any unauthorised  road block or any other demonstration blocking any  mode of transport e.g \"trains\" and others. People like me like  driving around in the loud sports cars as it makes people like me very happy.",
        "background": "I am calling for the government  to introduce a law that makes all protests disrupting everyday travel illegal. This is because I really like going out for road trips and it is one of those freedoms which make life very worthwhile and would be devastating if people blocked everyday travel.",
