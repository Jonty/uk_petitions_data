        "additional_details": "Whether suffering from lack of access to online resources, mental health issues, attention disorders, or overall lack of motivation, pre u students are at the same disadvantage as A Level students yet still face the impossible challenge of exams going ahead. This means that thousands of students across the UK will be tested unfairly while A-Level students have been given a fair alternative to exams, putting Pre-U students at a huge disadvantage that will affect all opportunities in their lives.",
        "background": "Year 13 students taking Pre-U exams have missed 4 months of vital learning last year and are now missing at least another 2 months this year, putting them at the same disadvantage as A Level students. Due to serious gaps in our learning, we ask that the government cancels the Pre-U June 2021 exams.",
