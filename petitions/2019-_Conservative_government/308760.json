        "action": "Fund 80% of self-employed income based on historic tax returns (COVID19pandemic)",
        "additional_details": "Current proposals create massive inequality between those who have their income secured and the UK's five million self-employed and freelancers. Measures suggested fall far short of the support available to workers elsewhere in the economy. Stating that it is operationally difficult to protect self-employed incomes is unacceptable. This petition is for those who have provided billions in revenue for the UK but who are not being protected now, in their hour of need.",
        "background": "The Government has failed to stand by freelance and self-employed workers. The support offered is insufficient and moreover unfair. The government should treat the self-employed the same as employed workers and guarantee 80% of their income up to \u00a32,500 per month, based on historic tax returns.",
