        "additional_details": "A tiered university fee cap structure for international students could ensure fairness, align fees with educational value and aid transparency. It could also help students to make informed choices based on clear fee distinctions tied to university rankings, programme costs and local living costs. We think this could also promote equity in education, effective management of university resources, and enhance England\u2019s attractiveness as a top destination for global education.",
