        "additional_details": "fullfact.org estimated that this equates to over \u00a3800,000 per year. This money could go towards providing meals/packed lunches or some kind of meal for children during holidays. Many parents work long hours and can barely afford rent and go hungry to try and provide food for their children. Why should families who work their fingers to the bone scrape by when MP's have the means to afford food yet they get to benefit from tax payers money.",
        "background": "MPs can claim this allowance for food if they stay overnight outside their constituency or London for parliamentary work up to \u00a325 a day. Any worker who isn't an MP not only have to pay for travel expense out of their wages but food too so why should MP's get this priviledge",
