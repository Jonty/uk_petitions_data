        "additional_details": "Cat fouling on private property is frowned upon, but not explicitly illegal in the UK, whereas dogs, for example, if caught fouling in public places, would have their owner fined, if caught.\r\n\r\nCat poo has toxins in it, and in some cases can be as dangerous as dog poo. There are obvious health risks associated with this, especially to young children.\r\n\r\nThis petition stands for fines to be placed on a cat's owner if there is evidence (photographic or video) that the cat had fouled on the property.",
        "background": "Cat fouling on private property is not treated with the same seriousness as dogs. There has been a huge cultural shift with personal ownership of dog fouling and I feel this should now be extended to cats.",
