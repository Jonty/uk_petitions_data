Absolutely disgusting to even consider a pay rise for MP's. Stop this madness. If any MP's have a shred of decency, they will reject this pay rise.",
        "background": "The government need to stop this pay rise for MP's. NHS and key workers are much more deserving of a pay rise. Instead of patting themselves on the back, they MUST do something about the thousands of jobs lost due to Coronavirus. Absurd to think about a pay rise for MP's.",
