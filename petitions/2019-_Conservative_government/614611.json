        "additional_details": "The government admit that it would take years for shale gas to become an important enough part of our energy mix so fracking won't solve the current energy crisis. Also, we believe extracting shale gas would be a retrograde step when we need to move away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy. The government should never impose fracking on communities against their will.",
        "background": "We would like the government to maintain the ban on fracking. We believe fracking is unsafe for the local communities that live near fracking wells, it will be bad for the environment, it\u2019s not a short-term solution to the energy crisis, and it is opposed by much of rural England.",
