        "action": "Decolonise the British Curriculum and Make Black History Compulsory",
        "additional_details": "The UK history curriculum glorifies colonisation and lionises these pioneers. The true ramifications of British colonialism are withheld from the curriculum, so many students are unaware of the terrible impacts it has had that are still prevalent today. It is also important to stress racial bias upheld by institutionalised racism, so teaching students about white privilege is imperative for change in this country. Students must be taught these topics earlier for instances of racism to diminish.",
        "background": "We insist that Rt Hon Gavin Williamson make Black History compulsory  by making it a History module within the KS3 National curriculum. Racism is still a very prevalent issue in the UK, however because it is supposedly covert introducing it to the education system will help to dismantle this belief.",
