        "background": "It has come to light that the UKIPO have over the years erroneously allowed registrations of names of ethnic groups, geographical locations, languages and cultures in its singular form. The recent uproar surrounding a British retailer trademarking \u2018Yoruba\u2019 has brought this to the forefront.",

For example, we could accept a petition calling on the Government to review rules for the registration of trademarks, and reform these to protect the names of ethnic groups, geographical locations, languages and cultures."
