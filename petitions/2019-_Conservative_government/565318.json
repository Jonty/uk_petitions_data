        "additional_details": "The closure of gyms is not in the public interest and only serves to adversely affect the health and well-being of so many people. Gyms should be considered essential and put into the same category as supermarkets. Social distancing and sanitisation measures can be used much more effectively in gyms than they can in supermarkets and people rely on them just as much, so they should remain open at all times.",
        "background": "Gyms have once again been closed under new tier 4 regulations in the UK. Gyms are a vital component in maintaining the mental and physical health of so many people who rely on them enable their health and fitness routine.",
