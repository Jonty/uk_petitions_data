Americans can travel to the UK, but UK citizens cannot visit the USA unless they fit into a very specific category of exemptions (which most people do not). \r\n\r\nThe UK's COVID rates have fallen dramatically and our vaccine numbers are higher than the USA, with over 40% of people fully vaccinated, and over 70% of people having had 1 dose.\r\n\r\nFamilies are separated and people with legitimate jobs cannot get visas. This needs to change!",
