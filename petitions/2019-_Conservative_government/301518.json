        "additional_details": "These days, the COVID-19 spread quickly around UK, which makes a lot of people very panic, including students in universities. A good way to solve this problem is to use online-teaching technology in universities. Universities don't need to shut down, which may bring them immeasurable financial losses and scientific research losses. At the same time, students can still have classes at home and complete their diplomas without delay.",
        "background": "We would like the government to force universities to teach online instead of face-to-face as soon as possible, which can help prevent further spread of COVID-19 in universities.",
