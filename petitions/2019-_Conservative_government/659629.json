        "action": "Stop misuse of parent-child parking! \r\nDesignated spaces & penalties needed.",
        "additional_details": "Parents with young children are often forced to park in less safe areas of car parks due to misused or limited parent-child spaces. This creates hazards when unloading prams, car seats, and small children near moving traffic. Improving parking availability and flow also benefits other users, such as the elderly or those with limited mobility who also struggle to find close parking. Enforcement similar to the well established Blue Badge system ensures fairness and equality for all.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to establish a simple permit system linked to birth records to ensure fair usage of parent-child parking spaces. This system must include regular monitoring and meaningful fines for those who violate the designated spaces.",
