        "additional_details": "Currently, victims are spiked, hospital staff say to inform the police, but if the police argue there isn\u2019t enough evidence (despite potential evidence including lists of attendees, CCTV footage, and witnesses), then no action is taken. \r\n \r\nThis also means potential medical evidence can be missed. As a victim of spiking, medical staff told me they couldn\u2019t do a toxicology report without the police\u2019s involvement. However, the police closed my case and I didn't have my blood tested. Cooperation between medical staff and the police must therefore also be reviewed, so improvement can be made.",
        "background": "With cases of drink spiking reaching new highs every year, a review into how the police handle allegations of spiking by victims, including gathering and assessing evidence, is vital. We are concerned police do not place enough priority on properly looking at the evidence and making arrests.",
