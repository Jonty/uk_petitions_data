        "additional_details": "Many things that most people take for granted can be absolute hell for transgender people - bathing, clothes shopping and going to the toilet, to name but a few. The fact that thousands of people are being denied the support they need - which is resulting in severe depression and even sometimes suicide among a large portion of those with undiagnosed dysphoria - simply isn't acceptable, and the alternative (going private) is simply not affordable for a large number of people. We need this change.",
        "background": "There are currently 7 clinics in the UK for adults to seek help for their gender dysphoria, and only 2 for minors. The waiting times to be seen by one of these clinics can be up to three years, which is simply not enough. We need these to be better-funded, so that the waiting times can be decreased.",
