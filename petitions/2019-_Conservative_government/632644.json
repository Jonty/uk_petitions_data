        "action": "Recognise reptile welfare under the Animal Welfare Act and have more enforcement",
        "additional_details": "Most of the misinformation seems to stem from the pet trade- pet shops, breeders, reptile shops, which only require a license certificate to operate. Enforcement of this comes down to local councils who are probably strapped for funds meaning regular checks aren't on their priority list. Reptiles have more specific care requirements than any of the species mentioned within the welfare act. We need more enforcement and more regulation. Please help stop the suffering in any way you can.",
        "background": "In the UK reptile care standards are shocking and seemingly not enforced or regulated very well. Every year thousands die unnecessarily or suffer from preventable disease due to incorrect husbandry. The specific care of reptiles is overlooked under current animal welfare legislation.",

We understand that you are concerned about the welfare of reptiles, but we're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nThe Animal Welfare Act applies to all vertebrates, including reptiles. Under this legislation owners and keepers have a duty of care to their animals and must make sure they meet their needs:\r\n\r\n- for a suitable environment and place to live\r\n- for a suitable diet\r\n- to exhibit normal behaviour patterns\r\n- to be housed with, or apart from, other animals (if applicable)\r\n- to be protected from pain, injury, suffering and disease\r\n\r\nEnforcement of this legislation is a matter for the relevant local authority and police, not the Government or Parliament.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for changes to the Animal Welfare Act, but it would need to be clear what changes you want."
