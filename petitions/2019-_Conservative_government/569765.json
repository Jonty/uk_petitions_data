        "additional_details": "I would like for Parliament to investigate, debate and then redress the balance for the many vulnerable children who depend on free school meals for their nutrition, growth and development.\r\n\r\nMany people have tweeted or discussed how little food is in the parcels they have received, and nationally, our children are in a period of scarcity with regards to social and educational development.  They should not be forced to suffer these deprivations as well as hunger.",
        "background": "There are more than 1.4 million children who receive Free School Meals in England, and this critical pandemic provision is essential for their nutrition and growth. Nationally, the provision of food parcels to children in lockdown has been patchy and often inadequate to feed growing children.",
