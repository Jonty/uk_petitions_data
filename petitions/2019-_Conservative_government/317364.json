        "action": "Extend the driving theory test expiration date amid the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "additional_details": "Several measures have been put in place to accommodate those who have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Why should this be any different? Acquiring the ability to drive is deemed by many a right of passage. It is however, incredibly time-consuming and expensive. An unprecedented epidemic calls for unprecedented changes to be made. This is a real issue which should not just be overlooked, the theory test needs to be extended for those who were expecting to take their test this summer.",
        "background": "The expiration date should be extended for those facing test cancellations due to COVID-19. I was scheduled to take my test this month, my theory expires in July. As a student, I believe the expectation to revise and pay for another test on top of other financial and educational burdens is unjust.",
