        "additional_details": "Millions of fish are caught by anglers and others who fish as a hobby. In 2022, there are many ways for people to get out and relax and enjoy themselves in nature, including by the sea, without hooking innocent animals, tearing their lips, causing them distress, causing their swim bladders to expand and then either throwing the poor creatures back or killing them.",
        "background": "Fishing is not a gentle hobby. We believe it is animal cruelty. Fishing for leisure is as bad as hunting. It is hunting, albeit aquatic hunting. Even if the person fishing puts them back, they may still have hurt the fish or caused it distress. Many fish die after being caught.",
