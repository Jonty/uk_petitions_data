        "additional_details": "In the UK there is no legal requirement to hold a licence when using a radio for domestic purposes. Severely sight impaired or Blind individuals have little or no vision and use a TV as a listening device only. Therefore, the same rule needs to apply to these individuals when using a TV as another listening device; they should be free free.\r\n\r\nThere are 2,250,000 blind and severely sighted people in the UK, and 390,000 deaf- blind people and it is simply unreasonable that these people, already having to manage with disability, are required to pay 50% of the licence fee, for something they can't fully access. With almost 26 million TV licences issued last year, granting 2.5 million, challenged citizens a free licence is a reasonable, fair and humane thing to do.",
