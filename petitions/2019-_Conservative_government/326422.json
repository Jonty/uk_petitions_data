If you have filed trading profits for a whole year\u2019s worth of Self-employment it works well. But as it stands anyone who has filed a tax year which was not a full year is being unfairly penalised. As it brings the average Monthly income down dramatically meaning the grant is no where near 80% the Chancellor\u2019s office states we are entitled to.",
