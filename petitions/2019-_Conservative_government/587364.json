An Annulment should be allowed during the marriage when this information is known and the law changed.",
        "background": "I am petitioning to change the law so that a marriage can be annulled in court if a pregnancy of another woman was not disclosed before your wedding day. As the law stands now in the UK you can make a marriage voidable if your spouse was pregnant by someone else when you married.",
