That is no reason not to make this change. ",
        "background": "It may seem extraordinary, but consuming dog meat is currently not illegal in the UK. Luckily, there is no evidence that dogs are eaten in the UK yet, but due to the vile way in which dogs are reportedly treated in China, Africa and many Dog and Cat Meat Consuming countries. ",
