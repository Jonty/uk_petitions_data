        "additional_details": "Launching in 2024 doesn't benefit the people in trouble now today and by the time its live they get it anyway. Seems to be like a campaign trying to win general election votes as oppose to a campaign to help struggling working families. I appreciate there may not be enough practitioners or schools yet by having demand and waiting lists this only gives nurseries more structure and potential revenue for growth to then expand towards the 'huge' transformation that Mr Hunt highlighted.",
        "background": "The childcare should be immediately. This would help paying working families. This would add huge growth to the economy by working parents having money that isn't absorbed by cost of living and childcare.",
