This means drivers with children have to park further away and have less space to open doors to get the children out safely, without knocking into other cars. It is also less safe to have to take one or more small children on a road rather than on a path nearby the allocated parking.",

This should create the same or similar rights and restrictions as Blue Badges, including it being an offence to park in designated space without displaying a permit.",
