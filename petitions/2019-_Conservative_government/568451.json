        "additional_details": "Currently to be eligible for furlough by your current employer you must have been employed by Oct 10th 2020 and had an RTI payment made, meaning some must have been employed by the Sept 23rd 2020. Anyone employed since then who has changed career or got a new job and contributed to tax and NI isn't eligible for furlough, yet furlough was extended Dec 17th 2020. These people have been left behind by the government and may end up unemployed claiming universal credit despite the jobs being viable.",
        "background": "Change the date to be eligible for furlough to atleast 16th Dec 2020 to reflect the extension of furlough, giving thousands of left behind employees the furlough payments they rightly deserve.",
