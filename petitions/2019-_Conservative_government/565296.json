        "additional_details": "While keeping within petition standards I call upon the Government to review the law surrounding lone working within the hospitality sector. As a mental health nurse lone working policy depends on thorough risk assessment that I don't believe is present in the hospitality sector, to reduce our risk of harm from others. In absence of those working within the hospitality sector having access to risk information of those staying within the hotel industry I ask for increased security for those lone working nights.",
        "background": "I have increasing concerns as a mental health nurse regarding the number of vulnerable adults that are being temporarily housed in the hotel sector. I am aware of the lack of directive law surrounding risk management & protection of those in the hospitality sector lone working at night specifically.",
