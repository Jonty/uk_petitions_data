        "additional_details": "The wild moorlands in the UK provide a wonderful place for people to come and enjoy the dramatic scenery  The moors are also home to many wild animals and at this time ground nesting birds and their chicks. It is therefore heart-breaking to see these areas ablaze knowing the devastation is being cause by just a few inconsiderate or thoughtless people",
        "background": "Every summer, on the news we see our moors on fire and then we are told that the cause was the misuse of a disposable BBQ. It has been shown that telling the public not to use disposable BBQs in such high risk areas does not work The only realistic way of preventing this is to ban their sale.",
