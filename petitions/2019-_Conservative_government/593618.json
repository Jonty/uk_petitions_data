In adult care there is often a lack of training and knowledge of the routine they need or facilities for parents to be with them.\r\n \r\nIf at 18 they have to move facilities this should be tailored to their needs, and provide care and routine they know and are happy with.",

Provision of care for people with special needs who are over 18 should be reviewed, and consideration given to how care matches the needs of this group.",
