        "additional_details": "The theatre industry brings in millions of revenue into society every year. Can we afford to let it go bust, when in fact it is as safe, if not safer as being at home\r\n\r\nPlease, re -open Theatres and let the country get back to some normality, give people back their jobs and let families be entertained again. A theatre is not a business that can just close and open, it takes months, sometimes years to put on a show.....the only Panto on at the moment is the one Parliament, not the Palladium!!!",
        "background": "The fact is work has been done to make Theatres safe is in everybody's interest of safety. Compulsory mask wearing, staggered audience seating, social distanced seats amongst others, in fact the THEATRE is SAFER than shopping in non socially distanced, \"do what you want\" high street shops!!!",
