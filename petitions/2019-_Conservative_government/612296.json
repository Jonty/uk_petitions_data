        "additional_details": "Ayurveda, an alternative medicine system, derived from the Sanskrit words ayur (life) and veda (science or knowledge). Thus, Ayurveda translates to \u2018knowledge of life\u2019.\r\n \r\nThe ancient Indian Ayurveda Medical treatment is presently not available through NHS. We believe this treatment could help improve some patient's quality of life, and has many treatment options available. We believe this treatment should be fully funded through NHS. Currently patients must self-fund, but we want the treatment to be available to all, not just to those who can afford it.\r\n",
