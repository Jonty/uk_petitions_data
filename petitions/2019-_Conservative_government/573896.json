Fathers work cash in hand to get out of paying what they should. Why should these children miss out? The reason for this a lot of the time is financial control. If a partner is claiming benefits properly, mothers should receive an entitlement from the government for a father with minimum wage that the father then has to pay back to the government when they find work again.",
