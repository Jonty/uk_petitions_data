        "additional_details": "There are many pregnant women out there who feel incredibly vulnerable working in roles where they are exposed to hundreds of contacts a day in environments where social distancing is not possible. Vulnerable workers deserve our protection.\r\n \r\nThe risks to pregnant women in their third trimester, and their babies, if they contract Covid-19 are well documented. Currently it is a lottery as to whether your employer offers you paid leave. Please end this ambiguity; protect mothers-to-be.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to make it mandatory for employers to give pregnant women who are in their third trimester and work in public-facing roles 3 months leave on full pay, and not leave it to the discretion of their employers. This would help ensure pregnant women are not at risk at work.",
