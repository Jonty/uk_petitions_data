Part of keeping ourselves and others safe shouldn't be a choice but a right for all people to be able to access.\r\nThe government made this decision without consulting with the public and it's services.  I want my voice and many others to be heard and that is the reason I want the Parliament to deal with it.",
        "background": "The public are already facing higher charges and this is another cost that will add to household bills.  It will put people in a difficult situation as to whether they buy food or a test kit. I want this petition to be heard in Parliament for reconsideration.",
