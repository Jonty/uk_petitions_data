        "additional_details": "the lessons doesn\u2019t contribute on what we as students want to do with our future and what career paths we want to follow. And having a only Saturday as a day off isn\u2019t enough because Friday we go to school and Sunday we do homework, chores, getting ready etc even if we have to go to school on Friday let it be about doing sports or cooking or programmes about different career paths. Reducing school days to 4 days will help with young peoples mental health and attendance giving better grades and engagement giving people more rest to recharge themselves and having the same subjects everyday can be very boring and doesn\u2019t make school a fun place to go to especially since we spend a majority of are youth years there.",
