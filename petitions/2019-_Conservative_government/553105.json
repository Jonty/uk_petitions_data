They have a lot to deal with as it is.\r\n\r\nYoung offenders and their families can suffer from being named and having their case detailed in the media. The Government should amend Section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 to require automatic reporting restrictions on defendants under the age of 21. Prison is meant to be about rehabilitation, but media coverage can make it difficult to change and move on.\r\n \r\nThere could be exemptions for violent crimes where there may be a public interest in naming the defendant.",
