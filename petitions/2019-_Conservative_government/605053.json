        "additional_details": "10's of Billions of single-use items are discarded in the UK every year, you only need to visit one of our once pristine beaches to see how it affects the environment, killing 100's of thousands of marine animals and birds each year. In addition as all plastic is made from oil, the plastics industry is a huge net contributor to global warming. Plastic straws and cutlery have been banned, now is the time to make a REAL difference by banning single-use plastic food and drink containers.",
        "background": "We'd like parliament to ban single-use fruit and vegetable packaging and single-use coffee cups, in the same way that France has announced plans to do the same in 2022. We want the UK government to lead the world into a greener more sustainable way of living.",
