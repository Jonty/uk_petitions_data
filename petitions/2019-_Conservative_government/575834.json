Many months passed and I found it difficult to find suitable treatment within the NHS. I would like the Government to review how doctors check for this condition, especially when a baby has trouble feeding, and the treatment that is offered when it is identified. If the condition was diagnosed and treated early it could have saved us distress and discomfort. Mums & Baby\u2019s need your support!",
