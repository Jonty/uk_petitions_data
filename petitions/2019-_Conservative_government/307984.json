Unless mortality is 500% higher than elsewhere in the world this must be the case. This level of inaccuracy means that many people are unable to understand the gravity of the situation because they are unaware of anything like the accurate infection rates, and change their behaviour accordingly. The WHO have stated that information is critical. Whilst \"self\" certification will not be 100% accurate it will provide a balance to the clearly inadequate official figures and also provide trend data to inform future decisions.",
