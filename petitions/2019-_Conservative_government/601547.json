I currently can\u2019t move in with my partner because he wouldn\u2019t be able to care for me and work enough hours to pay both of our rent and expenses including my medical treatments. We should be able to keep our finances separate and independent. I am now living alone, getting less help than I need, and unable to live with the man that I love.",
