        "additional_details": "In January 2022 I nearly died giving birth to my beautiful little boy and he was critically ill during the first 10 weeks of his life, first from Jaundice and then had Covid-Sepsis. It wasn\u2019t the easiest start and I developed PTSD.\r\n \r\nI didn\u2019t know I had PTSD or that you could get it from giving birth and felt like I was losing my mind with the flashbacks and nightmares of the traumatic events. But PTSD can be treated and symptoms can be reduced if they are recognised and treated correctly.",
        "background": "PTSD after birth trauma is often misdiagnosed as Postpartum Depression or Anxiety. The Government should fund NHS screening for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder at 6 weeks, where there\u2019s one or more of the following: traumatic pregnancy, traumatic birth, ICU stay and/or NICU stay.
