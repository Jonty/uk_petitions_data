        "additional_details": "Celebrating both events annually in UK schools will have a positive impact on young people's lives; ensuring diversity.\r\n\r\nI aim for this plan to be put in place within a year & to be added into the curriculum as compulsory for all primary & secondary schools in the UK. The curriculum (practically they) should teach year groups at least 1 black author, activist, politician, & inventor in current subjects ie. Science, English or PSHE etc.\r\n",
        "background": "Currently, it is not compulsory for primary or secondary school students in the UK to be educated on Black History or  Windrush day.\r\n\r\nWindrush Day and Black History Month both recognize the struggles and the hardship black people went through to contribute to the UK culture, food and music etc",
