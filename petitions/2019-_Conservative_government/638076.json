It can cause all kinds of issues such as Asthma. It's not fair that children and those who choose not to smoke, should be exposed to second hand smoke in public places.\r\n \r\nThere could be allocated areas in town centres that smokers could use, like a smoking shelter. This would mean that non-smokers are not exposed to second hand smoke, and it should help keep the ground clear of cigarettes that many people just toss on the ground.\r\n",
