They need some sort of normality reinstating and by constantly changing the rules for them and moving the goal posts we are causing mental health issues for the future. We need to have strong emotional stable children as without this we will have damaged adults that will be a lot harder to fix. Children\u2019s services need to be consistent. This includes maternity services as children should be aware of both parents being there from the womb.",
