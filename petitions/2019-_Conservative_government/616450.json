These products have been linked to cases of diarrhoea, blurry vision and liver damage, some severe enough to require transplants, and, in recent years, have even caused death.\r\n\r\nBy implementing an age-based restriction on sales, we can draw attention to the risks of these products and reduce use among youth.",
