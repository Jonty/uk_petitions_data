        "additional_details": "Due to the wearing of face masks merely being recommended in public areas such as offices, shopping centres, supermarkets, and city centres, the transmission of COVID-19 is considerably high even with 2 metre social distancing. In several areas there is not available room for this distancing, which without face masks could cause transmission even in the smallest amount of time. Every precaution must be taken for the UK to return to life prior to the pandemic.",
        "background": "It has been proven that face masks CAN reduce transmission of COVID-19 significantly, however these are only enforced on public transport. To help control and eradicate the virus, the government must make the wearing of face masks mandatory in all public areas to reduce any transmission",
