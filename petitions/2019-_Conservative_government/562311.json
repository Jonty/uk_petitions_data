        "additional_details": "People may think that Automation is getting more advanced, which maybe true but that means people are getting more and more knowledgeable about the automation they use so this does not mean they cannot hack it. If human drivers make mistakes on the road they can be caught out as they are on the road, but the hackers may get away with it as they maybe hacking from a far distance and if the driverless car gets into an accident then the person or people in that car may get the blame unfairly.",
        "background": "I want the sales of self driven cars to be scrapped, because if not, then there could be more accidents on the road due to computer error. Also these technologies can easily be hacked. If these cars are hacked and there are so many of them on the road then it may cause more deaths than human drivers",
