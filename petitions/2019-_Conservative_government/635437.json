        "additional_details": "There is no reason for the government or the state to endanger the safety of decent citizens in terms of children, animals, women, and the war will become more and more serious and spread to more countries if we continue to provide armed aid, but peace negotiations or rather their acceptance must be done. If the state asked for the enlistment of men after that, it would not be fair, since we were not involved in the conflict until now, but the state deliberately entered this war, which the British express with this petition that they did not ask.",
        "background": "Don't make the war worse.\r\nIf we want to support Ukraine, let's send ambassadors and let them participate in the peace talks, don't incite them to war at the expense of honest British citizens because it affects them too, but listen to the people and end the conflict between nations peacefully.",
