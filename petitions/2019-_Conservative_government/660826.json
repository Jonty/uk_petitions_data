By ensuring all students can pray freely, we could create a more inclusive environment. We think that schools who do not allow prayer create gaps in students' religious rights. Clear legislation could provide schools with a framework to accommodate prayer practices while respecting everyone's rights. Parliament must act for inclusive schools and protect students' rights.",
