The government were responsible for the algorithm or calculations for this upsetting downhill of grades so it\u2019s their job to make anmends.",
        "background": "With nearly 40% of grades being lower than predicted, many people believe it is in-just for the government to have any say in evaluating people\u2019s grades, especially those in poor socio-economic areas. This is why I believe that it must be and should\u2019ve been each school\u2019s job to calculate its grades.",
