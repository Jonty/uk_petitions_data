        "additional_details": "I personally know the devastating impact it causes. As we move forward, increasing the minimum sentencing would send a strong message to future offenders that it's not worth destroying their own life and somebody else's.\r\n \r\nToo many families have lost loved ones to this senseless crime. We must change the sentencing to help our future generations.",
        "background": "Since 2015, people aged 16 to 17 years old caught in possession of a knife face a minimum of 4 month detention and training order and adults from 18 years up will face a minimum 6 month custodial sentence. It appears that hasn't been able to deter people from carrying a knife.",
