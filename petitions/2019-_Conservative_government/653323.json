        "additional_details": "The TV Licence was introduced by Government and was to fund a Public Broadcasting Service, which is now a commercial organisation and should be treated as such.\r\n\r\nWhich other Broadcaster is not only receiving public funds, but is also allowed to set the pricing level, for these funds. This is unacceptable and should be removed, by Parliament immediately, all other commercial broadcasters are a at a commercial disadvantage and it is time to correct this disgrace!",
        "background": "The BBC has a commercial streaming service (BritBox) a collaboration with another Commercial Broadcaster (ITV).\r\n\r\nFurthermore BBC has moved a huge amount of their back catalogue to this new streaming service, so programmes that were made with public funds, I now have to pay to watch",
