To an untrained eye, these ingredients may look innocent. However for many of us with specific food allergies and other dietary restrictions, we need to know everything that\u2019s in our food. Otherwise, we can end up in painful and even life-threatening situations.",

Although the list of 14 allergens and ingredient quantities are required to be declared, we believe this isn't enough for people with specific food allergies and other dietary restrictions.",
