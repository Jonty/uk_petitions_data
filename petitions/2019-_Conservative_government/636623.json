        "additional_details": "In the cost of living crisis many private tenants have seen their rents rise at a massive rate, meaning the LHA doesn't cover their rent costs and leaving many households in financial hardship.\r\n \r\nMany landlords have had to increase rents to cover the increases in their mortgages, causing instability for both the tenants and landlord.\r\n \r\nMost benefits have increased by 10.1% and is vital that LHA rates are increased in the same way, to prevent people being evicted because they can't afford their rent.\r\n",
