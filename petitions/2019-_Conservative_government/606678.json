        "action": "Add Covid vaccine status as a protected characteristic to the Equality Act 2010",
        "additional_details": "I would like the government and parliament to do this because I have seen a lot of employers treating their staff differently. There are many main stream media articles mentioning major corporations such as Morrisons and other businesses treating unvaccinated staff unfairly. This is alarming and it should be addressed urgently, people should be treated the as some people have major side effects from the vaccines. Religious beliefs can also cause genuine, hard working people to not vaccinate.",
        "background": "I want the government and parliament to look into this, and add the covid-19 vaccine status as a protected characteristic under the equality act 2010, so no body is treated differently due to their vaccine status. Unvaccinated and vaccinated people should be treated fairly.",
