        "additional_details": "I do not believe ABTA are helping the situation by asking Government to sanction a 4 month period for the refund to occur.\r\nMany people are unemployed due to the Epidemic and need their cash refunds now.\r\nHoliday companies are trying to get customers to accept Credit Notes for future use over the next 4 months and promoting that these are ATOL protected. \r\nThis does not help people that need their cash badly now. There is unlikely to be a large recovery in the holiday industry over the next months. A lot of holiday companies are bound to go bust during this time and people want their money back now for this reason.",
        "background": "Many holiday companies are not refunding holiday cancellations with a full cash refund as they are bound to by law. Mainly they are offering Credit Notes. I would like to see Government directly instruct the holiday companies to provide full cash refunds.",
