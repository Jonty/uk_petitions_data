        "additional_details": "Disbudding is a painful procedure that inflicts suffering on goats. This procedure is often performed without anaesthesia and can cause significant pain and distress. Disbudding can also lead to complications such as infection, and tissue damage - leading to long-term discomfort.\r\n \r\nAs responsible owners, it's our duty to ensure well-being by providing a suitable environment. As goats become more popular as pets, we think removing horns just to make them more marketable goes against owners' duty.",
        "background": "Disbudding is the process of removing the horns or horn buds of young goats. As caring individuals dedicated to the well-being of animals, we ask the Government to outlaw the practice of disbudding goats.",
