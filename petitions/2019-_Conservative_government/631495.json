The time for change is now, let's just hope more than 14 members of parliament turn up to debate this.",

The average nurse salary in this country is \u00a330,000 and they have lost their right to completely strike courtesy of parliament. Cutting their salary by \u00a354,000 a year will save the country around \u00a335 million a year.",
