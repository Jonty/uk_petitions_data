The Sutton Trust have found that there is a very real gap between the opportunities and future employment prospects between middle and lower classes, and interning is a key factor of this. If this Government really is levelling up then they must tackle this problem with some urgency to prevent generation after generation being exploited.",

Employers have exploited this demand for experience by offering unpaid opportunities. This can benefit privileged graduates while leaving behind the less fortunate to fend for themselves.",
