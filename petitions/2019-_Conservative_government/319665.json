        "additional_details": "Simply because it would be a great gesture that would honour the hard work and dedication shown by our NHS and emergency service staff who have given so much. \r\nMuch has rightfully been done for the economy, so this small gesture could relatively easily be done for NHS and emergency services staff, with little cost to the taxpayer and without significant effect of the running of essential services.",
        "background": "NHS and emergency services have worked over the April and May bank holidays in difficult and challenging times.\r\nIt would be fitting for them to be given back 3 annual leave days to for the year 2020-2021 to use at their convenience. This gesture would not cost the taxpayer nor be difficult to do.",
