        "action": "The UK should recognize vaccination certificates from the Middle East",
        "additional_details": "We raised a petition on this matter that was rejected. Petition 592505 to which this was compared only deals with UK residents who have a UK GP and one of their vaccinations in the UK. People working in the Gulf region neither have a UK GP or any UK administered vaccinations. The UK now accepts both European & US vaccination certificates, but not those from anywhere else in the World. We request the UK government to accept vaccination certificates from the Middle East.",
        "background": "We have had co-vid vaccinations administered outside the UK. As we have left to work overseas we do not have a UK GP. Therefore we are unable to get a UK vaccine passport. To allow us to travel to the UK without quarantine we ask the UK Government to accept Middle Eastern vaccination certificates",
