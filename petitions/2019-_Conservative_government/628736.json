        "additional_details": "The government made a commitment that EVERY household would start receiving \u00a366 and then \u00a367 from October 2022. Prepayment meter customers are often those on the lowest incomes, who are also paying the highest tariffs. It is completely inexcusable that there is any delay to these credits, and that energy companies, in my case British Gas, seem unable to get those missing vouchers to customers. The voucher could instead be applied directly to the key, when topping up. Change the delivery method.",
        "background": "A significant percentage of prepayment meter customers still haven't received even their first EBSS voucher for October, and now are also facing delays to the November one. The advice is to contact the supplier, but most are finding that to be of no use. Change the way the credit is given.",
