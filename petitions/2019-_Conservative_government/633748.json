        "additional_details": "As primary care is largely the first point of contact for patients, it is imperative that Practice Nurses have the knowledge and skills to support women through menopause. Menopause awareness training will allow nurses to provide women with safe and reliable information and treatment options. Furthermore, training will lessen the burden on the NHS, by reducing misdiagnosis and the risk of menopause-related long-term conditions.",
        "background": "Although a natural event in a woman\u2019s life, many women struggle during menopause. 75% of women experience menopausal symptoms, which can last up to 7 years. They can be debilitating and impact on relationships, work and wellbeing. Symptoms are often attributed to other causes and remain untreated.",
