        "additional_details": "Pakistan was unfairly put on the red list despite having lower infection rates than other countries such as India, France and Germany. The decision was made abruptly, not giving people a chance to plan ahead and now many citizens are stranded abroad as they cannot afford to come back. This is clearly discriminatory as we have to pay unreasonable amounts to stay in a hotel in poor conditions during Ramadan. There have been incidents where we did not get hot or correct meals for our fasts on time.",
