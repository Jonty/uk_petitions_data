        "additional_details": "This issue is not unique to me; it's a widespread problem affecting teachers across the country.\r\n \r\nBy providing teachers with dedicated funding for classroom resources, the Government can help enhance the quality of education and create a more conducive learning environment for our children. Teachers play an integral role in shaping our future generations.\r\n \r\nPlease sign this petition if you believe that every teacher should have access to sufficient funds for class resources!\r\n",
