        "additional_details": "With parking restrictions in place this will allow residents to live peacefully and be able to leave and access their homes still allowing for people to enjoy our beaches.  All of the avenues that are close to the seafront really need some kind of parking restrictions or regulations in place.",
        "background": "Frinton on Sea has hundreds of people flock to its beaches, they park their cars down all of the residential avenues leaving them for hours, making it very hard for the residents to even leave their driveways.  We want parking restrictions applied so people can not park cars and obstruct driveways.",
