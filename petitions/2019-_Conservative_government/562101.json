        "additional_details": "Non league clubs are the heart of their community. Coronavirus has been threatening non league clubs since the first lockdown. With prize money reduced and fans capped the money non league teams make has been greatly reduced while costs are increased, having to provide safety equipment to help stop the spread of the virus. If non league football teams go out of business the local community will suffer in a time that has been hard enough on us all.",
        "background": "Non league clubs rely on money flowing over the bar. If clubs have to operate without a large chunk of their match day intake they will not be able to financially support themselves.",
