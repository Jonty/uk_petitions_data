Due to the extended periods of time spent on social media, we as consumers face repeated exposure to these advertisements. \r\n\r\nMany younger people are signing up to social media and are particularly vulnerable to this repeated exposure, as are those who may be trying to self exclude themselves from gambling services, sites and venues. There are also those that are quite content with their current financial situation.",
