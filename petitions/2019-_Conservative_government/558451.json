        "additional_details": "With what has been a difficult year for many the farriers council has increased retention fees by 38% and has increased the fees by over double over the last 4 years this equates this year to a net income from farriers of over \u00a31.3 million. They fail to justify the increase and also their expenditure and many farriers believe they are no longer upholding the act in the way intended. There is evidence to back this and this can be provided.",
