        "additional_details": "Quite simply the Government should not put children back into an untested environment and should lead by example and reconvene Parliament. This will enable the populace to see that MPs are representing their electorate and are confident in the scientific and medical advice being given on easing lockdown by Boris Johnson and the Government. Any MP, that does not attend Parliament should have to give a full explanation, to both the House of Commons and to their constituency electorate.",
        "background": "The Govt intends to reopen Schools subsequent to the Covid-19 lockdown. Children should not be allowed back into an untested environment until scientific and medical advice and testing supports this. Parliament should reopen before any school and MPs must be on a three line whip to attend.",
