Pets give a sense of stability and to take this away can have damaging affects.\r\nSome tenants live in properties what are unsuitable for their needs because they don't want to move because they are unable to take their pets with them.\r\nMany animals are abandoned due to tenants not being able to take their pets to their new house, all because landlords refuse to have pets.",
        "background": "The landlord should not discriminate against people with animals and should allow pets in the property. \r\nThe tenant should pay for any damage done by the animals or a small deposit could be given at the start of the tenancy to ensure that any damage caused can be fixed.",
