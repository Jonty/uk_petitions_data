Especially with getting up for school and learning.  And if the child suffers with any other medical issues (such as ADHD), a bad sleep pattern can be very disruptive.\r\n\r\nAlso amateur astronomers are really struggling with the night light intrusion. Bright LEDs affect observing and astrophotography.",
