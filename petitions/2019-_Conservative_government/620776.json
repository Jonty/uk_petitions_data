        "additional_details": "A plant is a \"living thing that grows in earth, in water, or on other plants, usually has a stem, leaves, roots, and flowers, and produces seeds\". Grass is a \"a low, green plant that grows naturally.\" A tree is \"a tall plant that has a wooden trunk and branches that grow from its upper part\". We believe using these nouns implies plastic products are natural, and is misinformation and misleadingly entices buying. Plastic has no proven natural benefits to the earth system.",
        "background": "Ban the use of nouns of \"plant\", \"grass\" and \"tree\" in advertising & selling plastic substitutes. We believe using these words is misleading, confusing and false.  EU's Court of Justice ruled in 2017 that plant-based products could not use the words \u2018milk\u2019, \u2018cream\u2019, etc. The same should apply here.",
