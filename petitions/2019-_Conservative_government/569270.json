        "additional_details": "In 2018 Michael Gove, then the environment secretary, said: \u201cThe weight of evidence now shows the risks neonicotinoids pose to our environment, particularly to the bees and other pollinators which play such a key part in our \u00a3100bn food industry, is greater than previously understood\u2026 We cannot afford to put our pollinator populations at risk.\u201d\r\nHe also wrote in the Guardian: \u201cUnless the evidence base changes again, the government will keep these restrictions in place after we have left the EU.\u201d",
        "background": "We ask the government to maintain the ban on on all outdoor uses of the neonicotinoid Thiamethoxam. This is proven to be harmful to bees and other wildlife.  We need safeguards to prevent the pollution of run off water containing the chemical at a time when British insects are in serious decline.",
