        "additional_details": "Water butts can play a crucial role in reducing our use of water. By collecting rainwater, we can reduce our draw upon reservoir water and contribute to water conservation efforts. In addition, they can help reduce the amount of surface water runoff and thus reduce the large number of Combined Sewer Overflow spills of late. If the 22 million homes in the UK with a garden had a 100L water butt, nearly 2.2 billion litres could be stored and used when needed.",
        "background": "I would like to raise greater awareness of waters butts as a sustainable solution. The Government needs to provide funding and work with charities, councils and water companies to support easier access to free or heavily subsidised water butts.",
