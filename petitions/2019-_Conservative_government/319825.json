        "additional_details": "I as many of us have been noticing more and more over recent decades how the weather,climate the seasons even, are all undeniably colder,hotter,more unpredictable than I remember. I have noticed over the last month and a half how how the sky is as blue as it used to be, the birds are more numerous and vociferous, even columns of insects are rising in the evenings seem larger. It is obvious even to my 7 and 9 year old children that nature comes back strong when given even a slight free hand.",
        "background": "We want our government to publicly research and clearly document the environmental changes that have occurred in and around the uk since global lockdown has been instigated. Then if benefits are proven to be so, act DECISIVELY on its findings to continue the environmental improvements.",
