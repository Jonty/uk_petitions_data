This only needs to be in place whilst isolation policies are running. A few months.\r\n\r\nThis will prevent mass repossession of property, a crash in property prices (as sold by banks), and a spending crisis which would damage our economy for years.",

We need the banks to allow debt repayments to be frozen.\r\n\r\nWe also need landlords to freeze rent; enabled by the relief from frozen mortgage repayments.",
