        "additional_details": "The road closures are causing more congestion in all the London borough's where there were previously no issues. There was no proper consultation and residents now have reduced entry and exit access along with the Emergency Services, Carers, Doctors etc which forces drivers to take longer routes, increasing fuel consumption, emmisons and congestion on surrounding roads. This also puts vulnerable people and those in need of care at risk by increasing response times.",
