        "additional_details": "The Corona Virus is spreading rapidly. Many workplaces are working on reduced staffing, so the government's proposed response to urge an increase in UK production is unlikely to be fast enough to deal properly with the rapid increase in need.\r\n\r\nIt is vitally important to saving the lives of infected UK citizens to make use of all the options we have available before things become critical. We ask that the government use the EU scheme.",
        "background": "The EU has permitted the UK permission to join the scheme to buy medical equipment and ventilators, yet the government are currently refusing to make use of this provision. \r\n\r\nAs time is critical to save lives, we urge the government to use this scheme to aid the NHS immediately.",
