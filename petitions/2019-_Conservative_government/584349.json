        "additional_details": "SAFs are made from CO2 & water. They cost more than fossil fuels, so demand & production are low. To make flying less harmful, we must start replacing fossil fuel:\r\n\r\nThe public sector should pay for SAFs when booking flights, e.g. using Compensaid\r\n\r\nAircraft operators should have to buy growing percentages of SAFs, at first covering the 1st class\u2019 share of fuel, then business, eventually applying to all fares (and cargo / charters). \r\n\r\nFossil fuel should be taxed until it becomes the pricier option",
        "background": "Please accelerate the journey towards sustainable aviation by rapidly and immediately increasing the amount of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) used in the aviation sector. Specifically, SAFs which don't compete with food production or cause deforestation, and which are not sourced from animals.",

For example, we could accept a petition calling for taxes on non-sustainable aviation fuel, or reduced Air Passenger Duty for flights where sustainable aviation fuel is used."
