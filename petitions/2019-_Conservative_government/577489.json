        "additional_details": "The decision to not allow opening of galleries until 17 May 2021 makes little sense in terms of public health. If libraries, community centres and department stores can open, so should museums and galleries. It feels like ministers are not making the case for culture. Galleries and museums provide much needed aid in maintaining the nation's mental health, its education and in supporting family cohesion. Single parents, families and individuals can reconnect with culture in these safe places.",
