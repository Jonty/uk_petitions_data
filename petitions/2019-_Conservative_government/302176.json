        "additional_details": "Because the current approach to tackling Covid19 i.e. Infecting 60% of the population to achieve herd immunity is ludicrous given there isn't even a vaccine yet. People still catch the flu each year and so immunity is not the silver bullet they are espousing it to be. Sadly millions of lives will be lost following this approach and they think that public ought to tolerate it. The tories need a new leader or the country needs a new party in power that intends to protect the lives of ALL citizens.",
        "background": "Hold a vote of no confidence in the current governments ability to govern and protect all British citizens. This is in response to their Covid19 response which has run counter to the rest of Europe. In turn putting millions of innocent lives at risk. A general election should be held after.",
