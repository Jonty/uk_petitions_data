        "additional_details": "The Government has taken many wrong decisions and was slow in its actions against the covid 19 pandemic. They weren\u2019t prepared and guidelines were issued according to the supply of PPE. The government advisors clearly didn\u2019t have a clue what they were dealing with and there have been many areas of negligence. Hence we have lost trust in the government and we would like them to lead by example, risking themselves before the general public. Hence the schools should remain closed for now.",
        "background": "The Government should not rush into opening schools. If anything, the Parliament should be opened as normal to show that covid 19 is under control and government is fully prepared to deal with a second surge in infections before the schools are opened, as our children are not Guinea pigs.",
