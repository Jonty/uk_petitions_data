        "additional_details": "Being open only for emergency use would help us apply for more financial packages available. If a pub can get paid to be closed but still do takeaways, why do we have to stay open and earn nothing, get little financial help, and possibly lose our businesses.\r\nMake it fair on the boarding facilities, help and support us as we are a sector running alongside travel and tourism. Make it a closed unless there is need to open, so that our businesses have a chance to survive.",
        "background": "Boarding facilities are struggling financially, both due to the fact that nobody is allowed to go anywhere, but also because there is very little financial help that we can apply for. We are asking that we are changed to being required to stay open, to closed - only open for emergency use.",
