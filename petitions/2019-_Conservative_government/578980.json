This tool to hold government to account is precious and only a police state restricts right to non violent protest. \r\nThe UK offers Hong Kong demonstrators sanctuary and now wants to bring in measures against their own population. Venting dissent peacefully serves as a means of expression and restrictions might cause civil unrest.",
