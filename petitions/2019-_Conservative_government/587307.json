Described as \"abysmal\",\"waste of time\",\"total mess\",\"zero stars\" \"waiting 28 weeks\",\"600 phone calls\",\"appalling\",\"utter disgrace\"... the list goes on. No private UK Company could possibly run like this department and the government are paying their salaries to treat the UK population like this and \"talk to you like you are something on the bottom of their shoe\". When will this be addressed?",
        "background": "This is a government department and should therefore be helpful to the UK population but there is no way to contact them to speak to, nor email, nor web-chat, absolutely no way to get in touch. Their phone line is of no use, either busy or not able to take messages or direct calls.",
