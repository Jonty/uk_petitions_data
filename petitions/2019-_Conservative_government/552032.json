        "additional_details": "As a current year 13, I believe it will be beneficial for us to feel the Government is seeking our views to inform how next year\u2019s exams are run. As a result of the pandemic, we missed months of education during a 2-year course. Consulting year 13s and ensuring arrangements for next year\u2019s exams are adapted to reflect the realities of education during the pandemic should help reassure students and reduce stress that could be caused by the coming exams.",
        "background": "The Government should conduct some consultation, such as a survey, with year 13s who are set to sit exams next year, to explore how confident they are to sit them and how the current outbreak has affected their health/mental health, to inform how these exams are run.",
