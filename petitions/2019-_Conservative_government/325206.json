        "additional_details": "With the existing system, EU citizen with Settlement status, are only able to prove their right to remain in the UK online. When abroad, this method complicates the re-entry into the UK as some immigrations require visa documents. \r\n\r\nAn ID card will also facilitate instant proof of ID to law enforcement officers without having to carry a passport, which when lost provides no alternative proof of physical ID. Also, applying for a job, opening a bank account or renting a property is simplified.",
        "background": "This is a request for parliament to consider the issuing of physical ID cards to its EU citizens who have successfully received Settlement status. This will provide physical proof to law enforcement officers, immigration, opening a bank account, renting a property and applying for open vacancies.",
