        "additional_details": "People are buying up stocks of essential items like baby formula, toilet rolls, paracetemol, hand sanitiser and anti-bacterial hand wash and wipes. They then charge criminally high prices for them in an effort to exploit people's needs and fears. I have seen a pack of 24 toilet rolls for sale at \u00a3690.00 plus \u00a39.99 p&p, a can of baby formula for \u00a384.95 plus \u00a33.50 p&p. Chemists are selling  a 16 tablet box of paracetemol for \u00a319.95 when at Wilko's it would be 59 pence.",
        "background": "The government should criminalise the act of profiteering during this time of crisis. It is fundamentally wrong to profit from people's fears and needs at a time like this. People are so desperate they will pay any amount of money to get what they need.",
