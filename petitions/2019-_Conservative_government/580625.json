Who informed me there is no way of tracing the gift card balance and how its spent. \r\nI spoke to 2 well known supermarkets. It was interesting that they are aware of scams happening using I tunes. 1 has stopped several people being scammed. But they both have different limits on how many cards and amount put on cards. 1 supermarket the till locks the amount. The other a manager is meant to be called to the till for authorisation which did not happen with me.",
