        "additional_details": "It's been known for years that neonicotinoid pesticides interfere with the brain behaviour of bees. Bees are already under threat from other forms of colony collapse disorder yet they are a vital asset to the economy as they provide a free but critical service to our agriculture industry. Without them our food and agriculture system would be brought to it's knees putting dependant ecosystems at risk of collapse.",
        "background": "The Health and Safety Executive have granted an application from NFU Sugar and British Sugar seeking emergency authorisation for the use of a neonicotinoid product as a seed treatment on sugar beet. These chemicals reduce bee colony viability. The Government should ban their use in line with EU laws",
