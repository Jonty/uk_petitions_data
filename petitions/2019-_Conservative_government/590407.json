I have just re-applied for my badge, which was issued for 18 months due to being transferred to PIP from DLA. My award has been extended, due to COVID, for another 11 months, which means I will be applying for 3 badges in 3 years. People not on PIP\\DLA are awarded a badge for 3 years., so it doesn\u2019t seem a fair system. This would also save the Councils an awful lot of paperwork and time.",
