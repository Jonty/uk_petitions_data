These \u201csilent shedders\u201d can be critical drivers of the spread of Covid19. Requiring schools to allow to staff to wear face coverings whilst at work should help reduce the spread of Covid-19 within schools.",
        "background": "Due to the current government recommendation many schools do not allow staff to wear face masks, such as during play/lunch times. This will not help reduce spread of virus if individuals are asymptomatic, as maintaining 2m distance is not possible with children in such areas.",
