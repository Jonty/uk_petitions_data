        "action": "Diversify the school English curriculum to include more female and BAME writers",
        "additional_details": "Throughout my five years of secondary school, 68% of the literature i studied was written by white men. However, white males make up just 42% of the UK population. The current curriculum does not accurately represent all groups, and this complete lack of visibility not only leaves students feeling alienated and ignored, it also completely overlooks the ideas, perspectives and experiences these communities have to offer. The books we read shape us as people and can help build a fairer society.",
        "background": "The current secondary school English curriculum does not put enough emphasis on the works of women and people of colour. I want the government to diversify the range of required reading by students to include an equal amount of male and female writers, as well as including more books by BAME writers",
