        "additional_details": "At present, deaf children and their parents have no way of learning British sign language unless they approach a charity and are lucky enough to find availability on courses. Or the families can pay hefty price tags to learn British sign language with level 1 of 8 Courses costing up to \u00a3350, with a price increase per level. \r\n\r\nParents of deaf children can struggle on a daily basis to communicate effectively with their children. \r\n\r\nFrankly, we cant believe this isn't already in place.",
