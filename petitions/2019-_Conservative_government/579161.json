        "additional_details": "Although we are taught many valuable lessons in school, the curriculum lacks education on real life skills. A class such as this could help prepare young people for life after school. Practical skills such as changing a lightbulb safely, checking tyre pressure on your car, managing your finances, what a mortgage is and how it works etc. The course could be varied to cover a wide range of skills, including self-defence, not just physical but also ways to stay safe online and in person. This could also importantly cover social and cultural education, giving young people a platform to discuss current news and topics such as women\u2019s safety and men\u2019s awareness.",
        "background": "To introduce a new class in schools to help educate young people on critical skills to prepare them for the real world. This would include topics such as self-defence/personal safety, social and cultural education, managing finances, mental health, DIY, etc.",
