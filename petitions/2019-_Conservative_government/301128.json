        "additional_details": "There are insurances available but many people take on unwanted animals, and more than one, so it is very difficult to afford insurances and with most you have to pay a large excess before you can claim. Having VAT removed would make the treatment of animals much more affordable and would save many animals lives. as I am involved in animal rescue I know how important this is",
        "background": "Veterinary bills can be huge and the VAT just makes it more difficult for owners of animals to be able to afford to get their pets medical treatment. Vet bills and medication need to be exempt so they are affordable.",
