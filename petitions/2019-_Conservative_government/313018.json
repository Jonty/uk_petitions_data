The current government has adopted a highly questionable strategy from the outset. \r\n\r\nWith each day that passes the current government strategy seems to be even more questionable. Dissolve the current government and form a cross party government to tackle this crisis and launch an immediate public inquiry into the actions undertaken by this government to tackle Coronavirus in the UK.",

The UK public deserves a coherent and united parliamentary response to Coronavirus. \r\n\r\nThe evolution of Coronavirus in the UK is a public health emergency.
