        "additional_details": "Some experts believe that Coronavirus could mark the end of the EU \" European Project\". Many of us are frighted that if the UK government doesn't end Brexit transition period right NOW, there is a great chance that we will be impacted by a very strong economic recession, alongside the remaining 27 EU countries.\r\n\r\nThe future of the British people must be the UK's top priority. Britain must stop funding the EU, and instead should spend this money on the NHS as well as other public services.",
        "background": "The UK has departed the EU. We are now in the Transition period until the end of 2020. We believe that due to extraordinary circumstances with regards to Covid-19 Outbreak, the UK government must quit the transition period now, without a deal, before it's too late.",
