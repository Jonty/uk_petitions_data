        "additional_details": "This is an unfair system as it does not take into account why an employee maybe taking sick leave. An employee could have a chronic illness and receive a doctors note and will still gain points, once a certain amount of points are gained that person can be dismissed from their job. Therefore being penalised for having an illness that is out of their control. I would like Parliament to make being dismissed due to bradford factor points illegal.",
        "background": "Bradford factor points are a mathematical formula to monitor employee sickness. It does not take into account the reason for an absence. If an employee gains enough points they can be legally dismissed. \r\nIt is an unfair system for people who are genuinely sick.",
