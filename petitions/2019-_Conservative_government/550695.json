        "additional_details": "The new season is due to start for clubs at step 1 and step 2 on Saturday 3rd October. Despite the \u201celite\u201d tag that comes with it, these clubs do not run more like those at steps 3-6 instead of those in the Premier League and EFL, little to no TV coverage, smaller community based stadia. These clubs quite simply cannot survive without their fans in attendance, some of which are subject to smaller attendances than some counterparts at step 3 and below. Allow fans to return to these grounds.",
        "background": "Make steps 1 (National League) and 2 (National League North & South) exempt from the current guidelines on spectators at \u201celite sport\u201d. The same treatment as steps 3 downwards (capacity limits based on minimum requirement for the level) would help many stay in business.",
