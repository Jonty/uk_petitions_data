Supporters drink before and after game anyway so it will be more civilised if you can drink watching a live football game in stadiums. \r\n\r\nAlso during and after a Pandemic where grounds may have attendances capped, supporters can get to the stadium in a more civilised way and drink if they wish watching the game from within the stadium and more importantly clubs will be able to raise further much needed income! \r\n\r\nThis is common sense especially in 21st century and will catch up with other sports such as Rugby and Cricket.",
