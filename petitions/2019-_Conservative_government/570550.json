        "additional_details": "I strongly believe the stress of exams is a large part of teen life. Those who don\u2019t struggle with anxiety may come to face it when put in an exam situation. The numbers of teens facing mental health issues is growing and exams aren\u2019t helping this. By having no final exam and continuous grades work and a final grade based off effort and your work this will provide students with a change for greatness in the future and reduced stress leaving them to feel more confident with life choices.",
        "background": "The Government needs to bring in new rules for our GCSE and A-Level etc. exams. Why should our grades be based of final exams reliant on memory where great stress is a factor instead of short tests and graded work throughout the courses. Change needs to be made soon. We are the future",
