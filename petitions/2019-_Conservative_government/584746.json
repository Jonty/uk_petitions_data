        "background": "Eid is approaching and case rates are dropping I would like the easing of lockdown to be brought forward a few days. The reason for this is so that Muslims are able to celebrate Eid al fitr as we were unable to celebrate last year with the lockdown which at that time was totally understandable then.",
