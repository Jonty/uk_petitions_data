        "additional_details": "According to the RVC the animal health certificate now required for dogs, cats and ferrets leaving the UK and travelling to the UK will cost \u00a3106.50 per animal and will be required each time you travel. This is simply unacceptable when the UK still recognises the EU pet passport for animals entering the UK, leaving the EU unaffected by the changes and the British people with empty pockets when trying to take their pets on holiday with them to Europe.",

For so many families the costs involved as well as the administration is not feasible. Vets have also expressed how complicated the current AHC paperwork is.",
