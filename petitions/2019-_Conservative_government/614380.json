        "action": "Stop the Privatisation of Channel 4 and keep the channel in public ownership.",
        "additional_details": "Channel 4 is a unique institution in that it is publicly owned, but does not require public funds to run it. It relies on advertising to fund and has done this successfully for years.  It was set up by Margaret Thatcher to benefit regional TV producers and privatising it threatens this approach. With Channel 4 moving part of its operations to Leeds, a renaissance has occurred with regional TV productions; privatisation threatens this.  Privatisation will also threaten competition with the BBC.",
        "background": "I want the government to halt its plans to privatise Channel 4 and keep the channel in public hands to benefit the public, regional independent television producers and ensure competition with the BBC.",
