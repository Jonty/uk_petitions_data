This also prompts a lot of companies to make their contractual maternity pay available only to those eligible for SMP\r\n \r\nWomen are being penalised (prior to even being aware they are pregnant) and are being forced to live on significantly reduced wages. \r\n \r\nSMP eligibility should fall in line with the current legal time in which you are required to inform you employer of pregnancy (the 15th week before the expected week of childbirth), and should also be paid at 90% of salary for a minimum of 3 months.\r\n \r\nThe Government covered wages for those furloughed during Covid because they couldn\u2019t work, well a new mum also cannot work so why could one be covered & not the other?",
        "background": "We want the period a woman has to be employed for before being eligible to SMP to be reduced from 41 weeks to 15 weeks, and for the amount women receive to be increased to 90% of pay for a minimum of three months.",
