        "additional_details": "With greater support, those at risk of homelessness, or have recently be made homeless, can be identified, and support offered.\r\n \r\nThe impact of the pandemic and the lockdown, both on the nation's economy and mental health, means the potential for widespread homelessness in the future is likely. The Government must take preventative action to avoid such a disaster and greater funding for those experiencing mental health issues, who are at risk of homelessness, can be key to these efforts.",
        "background": "The link between homelessness and mental illness is clear for all to see. Indeed, many view homelessness as a symptom of wider issues including poor mental health. While economic support is important, greater funding for mental health support is key to the prevention of homelessness.",
