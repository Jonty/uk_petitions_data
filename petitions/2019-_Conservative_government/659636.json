        "additional_details": "I think there was a lack of support for Autistic people and a Public Inquiry into the impact of the pandemic on Autistic people is essential. I believe Autistic people struggled even more than the non-Autistic population in the pandemic. I don't think there was autism-friendly information about changing regulations available, which may have been confusing for autistic people. I think autistic people were left to get on with it, without proper assistance. This must never happen again in a future health crisis.",

I don't think that people with Autism were considered and supported correctly by the Government throughout the Covid-19 pandemic so lessons need to be learnt.\r\n \r\n",
