        "additional_details": "These restrictions result in spending days in hospital during an induction alone, or time after recovering from labour alone, negatively impacting their mental health. It also affects the partners bond with the baby, particularly where a donor has been used or a same sex couple, as the partner feels pushed out of the pregnancy experience. There will be a price paid as we no doubt see a rise in post natal depression for both mums and partners if steps aren\u2019t taken to allow partners back in.",
        "background": "Risk management has been put in place for COVID-19 which stipulates pregnant women must attend all scans and appointments alone, and cannot have visitors to ante/post natal wards. Partners have a key supportive role in these times and should be allowed to attend, using PPE if necessary.",
