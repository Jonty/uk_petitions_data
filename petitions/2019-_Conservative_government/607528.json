Platforms like Facebook and Twitter eclipse other networks by sheer number of users, minimising competition.\r\n\r\nGovernment should require all platforms to have fair processes for removal of users or their content. British values should not be in the hands of unelected company executives.\r\n\r\nFreedom of speech is a human right. It should apply equally in the digital space - everyone deserves a voice.",
        "background": "Currently, tech companies aren't answerable to anyone and may remove users or their content at whim.\r\n\r\nThis gives them inappropriate leverage on what can be said online.\r\n\r\nThe Government should legislate to ban companies from removing content users have posted unless it\u2019s illegal or bot generated.",
