The public can hear what is being said and there is no risk of important matters being drowned out by schoolboy tactics.\r\nNo office in the country would operate under such ridiculous conditions. Ban the baying crowds now and start acting like grown ups.",
        "background": "Ban all noise interference from MPs when questions are being asked and answers are being given. Eradicate the childish jeering, braying, booing and attempts to obfuscate in what should be a clear and professional atmosphere.",
