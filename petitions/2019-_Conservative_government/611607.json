        "additional_details": "War in Ukraine denial negates the established facts of the current war of Russia against Ukraine. These views can perpetuate hateful beliefs that help the continuation of this war. The denial of this war undermines the truth, it's an important tool for the Putin regime and his propaganda. This lie is especially painful for the millions of Ukrainian people who are now refugees, who lost their livelihoods and whose families are being killed in this war.",
        "background": "We believe denying the Ukraine war is rooted in the same place as Holocaust denial and should be made a criminal offence in the UK, where people have easy access to independent media. Regretfully there are people outside Russia who still deny this war. This can\u2019t be acceptable and tolerated.",
