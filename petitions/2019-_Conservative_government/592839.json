        "action": "Extend the DVSA Theory Test expiration by 3 months",
        "additional_details": "Some argue that extending the expiration is unsafe as learners now have forgotten their driving theory knowledge. I disagree as I'm only asking for a 3 month extension and the theory knowledge is still retained. Not to mention the \u00a323 fee which now all people in the same position as me have to pay again AND the backlog that is occurring with people having to try and rebook.",
        "background": "For people like me who just got ready to take a practical driving test around March 2020 when lockdown begun, it means that around now my theory test pass is about to expire. If the expiration was extended by just 3 months, it would backlog and be fairer to leaners.",
