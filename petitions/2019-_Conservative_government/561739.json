        "additional_details": "The NHS and The Lullaby Trust state that studies have shown them to be dangerous, yet they are still available for parents to buy without stating the dangers, the packaging says \u2018children are not to be left unsupervised\u2019 or \u2018for decoration purposes\u2019 but this is not sufficient. They should not be sold, it used to be that they stopped limbs being injured, if a cot is made to the correct standard the bars are made so that limb entrapment can't happen, so they are completely redundant in 2020.",
        "background": "Abolish the sale of cot bumpers and make the use of them illegal, to save the lives of babies and children as it has been proved that they can be one of the causes of SIDS, suffocation or strangulation. They have no practical uses, are an unnecessary accessory and only pose a threat to the infant.",
