        "background": "under current UK legislation members of the public are not permitted to carry any forms of pepper spray ( pava,CS,etc) \r\n\r\nAs these tools are non lethal and have low risks of complications there is no reason why free citizens with no criminal record should be prohibited from carrying these in public",
