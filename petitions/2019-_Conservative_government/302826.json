        "additional_details": "In the NMC Code, it states to \u201ctake account of your own personal safety\u201d. Going on placement during this period of time will make us worry about our safety and how we are risking our own health when we\u2019re only students, and we don\u2019t get paid. On behalf of the nursing students studying at King\u2019s College London, we would like the government to cancel our placement for the next 2 months until the infection has calmed down so that we have a safer environment to work in where we can actively learn.",
        "background": "Nursing students are worried about going to placement, as this will put us at a higher risk of spreading COVID-19. Many of us will have a family to go home to, which can affect them. Medical students get their placements cancelled while nursing students don\u2019t, and we interact with patients more.",
