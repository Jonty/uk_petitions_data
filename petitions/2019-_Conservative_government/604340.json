        "additional_details": "Cannabis has been legalised in 18 states in America, Canada, Amsterdam, and most recently, Malta. It has not only provided each subsequent government with economic benefits, such as more employment opportunities and increased tax revenue, but reports also state that there was a reduction in crime in places with legalised cannabis. \r\n\r\nStudies also show that cannabis is much less harmful than alcohol, nicotine and tabacco, all products that are readily available for the consumer.",
        "background": "This is a petition for the legalisation of cannabis for medicinal and recreational use. This would allow a person to go into a shop/dispensary, either for medicinal or recreational use, and purchase cannabis.",
