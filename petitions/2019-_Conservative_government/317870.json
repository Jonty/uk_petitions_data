        "additional_details": "The reason is due to the lack of socialisation with friends or family and the lack of motivation, it is understandable that we can not see our friends or family with more than groups of 2, but this is a situation that needs to be thought about and taken seriously, it is a difficult time for everyone of all ages but teenagers (13+) thrive off of face to face interaction and part the reason this age group (between 13-20) needs this socialisation to stop them from Becoming more vulnerable to life changing mental illnesses.",
        "background": "Due to the UK Lockdown measures there has been an increase in under 20\u2019s depression, anxiety and suicide attempts,\u00a0\r\nTo resolve this situation I think covid-19 tests should be issued to age groups between 13-20yrs to get this age groups life back to normal sooner rather than later.",
