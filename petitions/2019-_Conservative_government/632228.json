        "additional_details": "The decision goes directly against the governments pronouncements about protecting the environment and makes a nonsense of other recent policies encouraging environmentally friendly schemes and supporting farmers by subsidies to implement them. The government should be made to explain this decision to protect sugar beet crops by using these banned substances.",
        "background": "Neonicotinoids have been described as the Novichok of bees: a single teaspoon is sufficient to kill more than a billion. The UK Expert committee on pesticides thinks the use of such pesticides to control aphids should be rejected. Many scientists and green activists are appalled at their use.",
