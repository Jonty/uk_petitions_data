        "action": "Overturn the decision to abolish the death penalty in UK for violent crimes",
        "additional_details": "There is no deterrent not to commit murder and very little justice for the hundreds of families of victims who lose their loved ones annually in unprovoked attacks. These are becoming increasingly violent, extreme and horrific. Life sentence can be as little as only 12 years before the perpetrator is released, often with new ID which is protected. The families are never released from their sentence, the injustice adds to their pain and too often they die young. Please sign & share",
        "background": "Overturn the ruling brought by former Home Sec. Jack Straw to reinstate life sentence as a whole life term or administer lethal injection to murderers proven to be guilty beyond all reasonable doubt. More humane than the horrific, increasingly violent 800+ murders which take place in UK annually.",
