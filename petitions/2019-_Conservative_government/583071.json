        "additional_details": "It will benefit the youth that have recently passed alot and save everyone time and money with consent of the named owner of the vehicle that lets other license owners also drive. It can be very useful imagine if you are on a long journey on the way back or there and you want to get to the location immediately but you are tured and other passengers are active ready to be at the location. But instead you take a break and everyone is now moody and the whole trip is ruined.",
        "background": "The insurance is absolutely awful and it would be much more efficient and less stressfull for every one if only the car was insured and not every person that wanted to drive it would save a lot of money aswell.",
