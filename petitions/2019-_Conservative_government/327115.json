        "additional_details": "The United Kingdom officially supports the Saudi-led coalition blockade of Yemen through arms transfers made to the Saudi government. This blockade has been compounded by numerous other issues such as flooding, COVID-19, and an economic crisis to name a few. This has resulted in the world's worst humanitarian crisis with 4/5 of the Yemeni population at risk.",
        "background": "As citizens of the UK we call upon the government to completely suspend arms sales to the Saudi-led coalition which continues to mercilessly bomb Yemen. Despite going to court and shamefully seeking to appeal the decision AGAINST exporting arms to Saudi Arabia and the UAE.",
