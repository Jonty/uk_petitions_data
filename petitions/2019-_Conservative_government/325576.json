        "additional_details": "The country has for many years underfunded and under resourced the NHS compared to the highest funded health providers in Europe. In order to undertake a fundamental review of service provision, the Government needs to match its resourcing and funding levels to the highest funded in Europe on a per head of population basis. This should then be used to ensure future service provision is continuously compared to the best in Europe.",
        "background": "The current pandemic has shown how underprepared the country was. European countries with a higher level of funding per head of population appear to have dealt with the current crisis better. Consequently, there is a need to compare ourselves with the better prepared countries.",
