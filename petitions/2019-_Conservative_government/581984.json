        "additional_details": "Leading public health and equalities experts conclude this report is methodologically flawed and insults the experiences of many Black, Asian and Ethnic Minority people in the UK. Dame Doreen Lawrence warns that it gives a 'green light' to racists and sets back the fight for equality back 20 years. Academics named in the report have revealed they were not properly consulted, and an author is having his name removed. As a result of these and other concerns the report should be withdrawn.",
        "background": "We want Parliament to debate the fundamentally flawed Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities report, for the Commission to withdraw it and the government to apologise for failing to ensure it was a fit and proper document.",
