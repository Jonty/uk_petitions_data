        "additional_details": "A holiday in June abroad costs a family of 4 \u00a33500 the same holiday in August is \u00a35800. The new rules will increase this even more! With the cost of living parents cannot afford this. Denying families holidaying when they can afford it or is best for their work, family situation etc is unfair especially when the money from fines doesn\u2019t even go in to education. Give parents the right to take their children on holiday without extortionate fines and possible prosecution.",
        "background": "Allow parents 7-10 days holiday yearly to take their children during term time, without being fined. \r\nAllowing quality time together going on holiday yearly to improve wellbeing, teach children about different cultures and learn about travel, transport etc. Stop the new fine system!",
