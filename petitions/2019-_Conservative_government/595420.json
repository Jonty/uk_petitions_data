        "action": "Introduce legislation that stipulates all consumer good packaging is recyclable.",
        "additional_details": "The UK currently produces around 26m tonnes of waste each year and only around c.45% of this is recycled each year with other comparable European countries such as Germany and Austria recycling c.60%.\r\n\r\nCurrent packaging materials and technology available can meet all the criteria for sustainable packaging. This will position UK well in working towards closed loop product cycles and a circular economy.",
        "background": "Introduce legislation that stipulates that all consumer goods packaging is either compostable or recyclable by 2030 or sooner.\r\n\r\nThe government should commit to its \u2018Green Industrial Revolution\u2019 and introduce legislation that requires manufacturers to package goods in a sustainable way.",
