        "additional_details": "Hazaras are a minority ethnic group in Afghanistan. We are distressed by recent reports of increased violence and killings targeted against our families. The Select Committee on International Relations and Defence said Hazaras were \"regularly subjected to targeted killings, violence, and discrimination based on their ethnic and religious identity\" (96). The UK government should follow the report recommendation to \"publicly champion the rights of minority communities, such as the Hazaras\" (115).",
        "background": "The Nov/2020 report said \"We are concerned by reports that the UK has turned a blind eye to abuses by the Afghan security forces and militias\". The UK government claims \"zero tolerance to human rights violations or abuses\", but this is not working. The UK approach needs to be urgently re-examined.",
