        "additional_details": "The Government should require that all Key and Essential Workers be lifted out of poverty and paid the Real Living Wage. If the only way to achieve this is to pay all workers the Real Living Wage, then so be it, we are the sixth largest economy in the world and it is shameful that anyone should be forced to work in poverty.\r\n \r\nIt was great to hear the Nation clap and feel appreciated, but even better would be the Government requiring all Key and Essential Workers are given the Real Living Wage.\r\n\r\nPlease sign and pass on this petition to show that you still care.",
        "background": "The Real Living Wage is independently calculated and overseen by the Living Wage Commission and currently stands at \u00a39.50 per hour Nationally and \u00a310.85 per hour for London. The Government\u2019s National Living Wage is only \u00a38.72 per hour.",
