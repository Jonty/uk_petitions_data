        "additional_details": "I left my full time employment in June and my husband left his in September. We both worked while training and building up our business and left our jobs when we felt we could provide our family with a stable income. Unfortunately this has now left us in a 5% minority who don\u2019t fit into a category and will not receive help. We have paid tax through both systems but the paye was greater than the self employed element. Please take into account all tax paid over the last three years to help us all",
        "background": "Many people continue to work and pay tax through the PAYE system while starting a business for security. This is a sensible decision but has worked against us with the self employment grant. Why can\u2019t the chancellor take into account all tax paid over the last three years. It\u2019s all tax either way",
