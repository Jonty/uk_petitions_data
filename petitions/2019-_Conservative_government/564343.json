        "additional_details": "By not allowing families to meet in tier 4, you\u2019re mentally damaging so many people. Christmas is already a make or break for some people mentally without telling them they can\u2019t see their families for this one day, this is something many have looked forward to since March. Please just give us all Christmas Day. Some families haven\u2019t even been able to meet their new grandchildren this year.. this was a saving grace for so many. We don\u2019t need more reasons for people to die this year.",
        "background": "We would like the government to retract their decision yesterday to stop families coming together Christmas Day in Tier 4. This decision has been made at a time when people have made all the preparations and built their hopes up to have this time together after such an awful year.",
