        "action": "Allow tenants to pay commercial rent arrears over 18 months without any interest",
        "additional_details": "The landlords should be reasonable & fair and share the burden with the tenants. While it is their right to not offer any reduction despite the Code of practise and continuous communication with tenants, the least they can do is not charge any interest and collect the rent arrears post covid over a period of 18 months. An urgent government intervention in this regard would be a big relief and motivation for small business to continue to trade and lessen our burden of mounting debts.",
        "background": "Allow the commercial tenants to spread the cost of rent arrears over 18 months post covid 19 without interest when business is back to normal. So many sectors like Retail, hospitality, tourism, events, catering, pubs, bars, casinos, night clubs are struggling & lockdown 2 has worsened the situation.",
