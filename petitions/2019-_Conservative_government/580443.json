        "additional_details": "It would allow all vehicle movements to be recorded so radar traps and speed cameras would not be necessary. Instead of penalizing normally law abiding motorists who briefly exceed the speed limit, the police would be able to target those who drive dangerously and those who cause accidents. Police could investigate any moving vehicle not emitting a tracking signal. Foreign vehicles would have to hire temporary tracking devices when they enter the UK.",
        "background": "Fitting tracking devices to all new and existing motor vehicles could result in a major reduction in crimes such as vehicle theft, fly-tipping, burglaries in rural areas, armed robberies, child abduction, hare coursing, joyriding, hit and run and even murder. It could also make our streets safer.",
