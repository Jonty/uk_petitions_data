        "additional_details": "Years 4 and 5 of medical school can be the most challenging. Students are often on placement 5 days a week whilst studying for written and clinical examinations. Our Government should be ensuring that financial support for these students adequately covers the cost of living. We believe it currently does not. As a result, many students are facing additional pressure on top of placement and studies. In some cases, the NHS bursary and reduced-rate maintenance loan do not even cover rent payments. They deserve better.",
        "background": "Medical students in their 4th and 5th year should be entitled to financial support that adequately covers their cost of living. The NHS bursary scheme should be increased in these years. Additionally, these students should have access to a full SFE maintenance loan, not a reduced rate.",
