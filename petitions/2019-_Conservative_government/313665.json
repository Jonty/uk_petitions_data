There are many non UK resident doctors and nurses whom are also helping the cause. Without them, there is no doubt that the strain on the NHS would have been far greater. \r\n\r\nPunitive Home Office rules affect these non UK resident medical professionals which include high visa fees and the NHS surcharge. They deserve far more respect than this.",

This is an appreciation for their extraordinary efforts.",
