        "action": "Modify Corporation Tax to incentivise smaller wage gaps between staff",
        "additional_details": "The current Corporation Tax system does not take into account the significant pay differences within companies. Research shows that some CEOs of FTSE 100 companies earn more than 200 times the earnings of their employees, which we believe is detrimental to our society and economy. By implementing this proposed tax system, we can encourage corporations to reduce wage gaps and contribute more equitably to our economy. We believe this will make our tax system fairer and promote good internal company dynamics.",
        "background": "This petition asks the Government to change Corporation Tax to a sliding scale, proportional to the relationship between the highest and lowest paid person in a company. The greater the disparity between highest and lowest paid, the greater the tax rate, the smaller the gap, the lower the tax rate.",
