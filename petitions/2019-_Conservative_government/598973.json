        "additional_details": "The fashion industry is one of the most polluting in the world. It contributes 1.2bn tonnes of CO2 per year and the Government does not have adequate plans in place to combat it. \r\n\r\nTwo-thirds of emissions from UK clothing occur overseas. Complex supply chains mean cotton is grown, woven and dyed on different continents then transported many miles to market. \r\n\r\nIf consumers can factor how eco-friendly a garment is into their purchasing decision, this should encourage the fashion industry to prioritise greener manufacturing methods.",
        "background": "We want legislation enacted that will require every UK garment to feature a 'Carbon Checker' label. This will enable shoppers to factor how green a garment is into their purchasing decisions. \r\n\r\nThe 'Carbon Checker' label would show how environmentally friendly a garment is, on a scale of A-E.",
