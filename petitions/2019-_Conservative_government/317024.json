        "additional_details": "NHS workers who are risking their lives are paying student loans whilst they are saving this country during the current coronavirus pandemic. It is unjust and immoral that some NHS workers have paid to train to provide a service that we so desperately need. As a token of gratitude, NHS workers should have student debts cancelled. Like military personnel, no one should pay to serve their country. If you love the NHS sign this petition.",
        "background": "Cancel student debt occurred whilst training to be an NHS worker including nurses, doctors and front line medical personnel. There has been no consistency in government policy. Some have paid for their training and now others are being paid to train. No one should pay to serve their country.",
