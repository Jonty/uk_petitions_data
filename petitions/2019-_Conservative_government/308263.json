        "action": "Allow overseas nurses who has got settled status to practice as nurse in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "The current criteria for overseas nurses to register with the Nursing and Midwifery Council need to be relaxed. The overseas nurses settled in the UK are able to communicate effectively in English. The government can consider asking NMC to do fast-track checks on these applications. The current government  is functioning like a wartime government. Hence decisions like this will be inevitable to protect human lives. The governments in the past have made similar decisions when there were considerable shortages of nurses in the UK. If the government makes a decision to grant permission for overseas nurses settled in the UK to practice as nurses, it will provide at least  40000 - 50000 nurses. This decision will help to deal with the shortage of nurses and save lives.",
        "background": "The UK's healthcare system is struggling with unprecedented number of coronavirus cases. This crisis can be tackled to an extent by allowing overseas nurses who are settled in the UK and have got live registration in their respective countries to register as a nurse in the UK. ",
