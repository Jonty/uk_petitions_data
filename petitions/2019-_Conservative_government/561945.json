        "action": "Stop the unfair treatment of wet led pubs in the COVID restrictions tier system.",
        "additional_details": "The government must recognise the value to the community and local business of wet led pubs and understand that they are as safe as food pubs. Run by responsible licensees adhering to the rules and making their pubs COVID secure. There is no evidence to suggest a wet pub is less safe than a food pub. They should not be made to close in Tier 2 while food pubs and non-essential shops are allowed to open. If this decision is not reversed it will devastate a viable part of the hospitality industry.",
        "background": "The last decade or so has seen a dramatic rise in independent pubs and bars with a focus on quality ale and specialist beer from independent breweries. This sector has thrived up until COVID and will continue to be viable in the future if they are treated fairly through the COVID restrictions.",
