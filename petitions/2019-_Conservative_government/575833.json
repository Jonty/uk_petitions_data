The Online Harms Bill doesn\u2019t go far enough in making online abuse a specific criminal offence and doing what \u2018Harvey\u2019s Law\u2019 intended. To make the law work needs the removal of anonymity to ensure that users cannot cause harm by using online platforms to abuse others.  Where an offence has taken place they ought to be easily identified and reported to the police and punished. We have experienced the worst kind of abuse towards my disabled son and want to make sure that no one can hide behind their crime.",
