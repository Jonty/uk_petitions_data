The first England match in the group is due to be played on Monday the 21st at 1pm. I am petitioning to allow all students at schools in England to watch the match instead of having lessons. All of those people that wish to watch the match can make a donation eg. \u00a31. All of the money raised will go to helping the children in Ukraine who have not been as fortunate as us and who have suffered over this year. Please sign this petition if we get 100,000 signings it could be discussed by the Uk government.\u00a0",
