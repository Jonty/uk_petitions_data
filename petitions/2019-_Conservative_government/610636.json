        "action": "Introduce a minimum legal requirement for hamster cages",
        "additional_details": "Due to there currently being no laws regarding minimum hamster cage sizes, people can get away with keeping hamsters in terrible conditions with no consequences for them, only health problems and massive amounts of stress for the hamster. This is unethical and shocking that it\u2019s not already banned in such a country as the UK.",
        "background": "In the UK, we have animal welfare laws for most animals, but not hamsters. Hamsters need a bare minimum of 4000cm squared (equivalent to 80cmx50cm) of unbroken floor space to keep them healthy and happy. I\u2019d like the government to introduce laws regarding minimum sizes of hamster cages.",
