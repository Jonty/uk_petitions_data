        "action": "Ban establishments from charging a minimum spend on card transactions",
        "additional_details": "Banning minimum card transaction spend in the UK would boost inclusivity, aid small businesses, and align with digital payment trends, creating a more accessible and efficient economy. Some local shops won\u2019t top up gas or electricity with card and will only accept cash. Some food shops have started a minimum \u00a35 spend on card for take away food. This should be banned as it discriminates low earners trying to feed themselves.",
        "background": "The United Kingdom government should consider banning minimum spend requirements on card transactions for several compelling reasons. Such a move would have far-reaching benefits, both for consumers and businesses, fostering a more inclusive and efficient economy.",
