        "action": "Restrict the government to two leaders per term or else trigger an election.",
        "additional_details": "Such a law would enable the general public to have the final say on who their Prime Minister is, instead of being forced into having numerous leaders imposed on them by the will of the members of the governing party. In doing so the law would prevent much of the chaos we have seen of late, by allowing the public to ultimately decide whether they have confidence in the government which can't keep its own leaders or whether they want power to change hands.",
        "background": "Create a law that restricts the governing party to having two leaders per parliamentary term. If the government has a third leader within a term a general election must be triggered following the election of said leader.",
