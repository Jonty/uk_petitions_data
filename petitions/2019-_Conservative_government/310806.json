Some migrants were travelling when the COVID-19 outbreak began and have been unable to come back to the UK or would be putting themselves at high risk due to underlying health conditions. Others have needed to look after relatives abroad. These people may be unable to stay in the UK unless action is taken. Clear guidance is needed now.",

They should not have to choose between their health and their future in the UK. We ask the Home Office to not consider time spent outside of the UK during the COVID-19 outbreak",
