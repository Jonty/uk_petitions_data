        "action": "Re-open indoor socially distanced gym classes.",
        "additional_details": "Fitness is crucial to mental and physical health.  Most people who attend group exercise classes are not comfortable or confident in a pure gym environment.    I use the example of the over 65's who visit a yoga studio who now will simply not exercise. \r\nCoaches, Trainers, instructors are present in class to ensure safety of movement, social distancing and to improve social distancing.  When you remove a coach/instructor - you remove the safety element.",
        "background": "Following Tier 3 announcements today in the South Yorkshire region, it has been explained that gyms may be open, but supervised socially distanced classes are to be closed.\r\nThis is baffling.\r\nWe request that gyms, yoga studios, village halls are allowed to run socially distanced classes.",
