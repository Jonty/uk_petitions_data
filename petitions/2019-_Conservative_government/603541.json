        "additional_details": "The Textile Products Regulations allows some parts, which often contain fossil fuel derived materials, to not be listed on composition labels in clothing and textile products.\r\n \r\nPlastic production from fossil fuels for synthetic fibres is increasing. Fossil fuel extraction is the primary cause of our climate crisis. Recycling is not a solution.\r\n \r\nWe believe incomplete labelling of textile products is a silent contributor to the catastrophe of global warming and plastic and microplastic pollution that\u2019s devastating our ecosystems. Obscuring the full facts denies UK citizens the choice of reducing their plastic footprint.",
