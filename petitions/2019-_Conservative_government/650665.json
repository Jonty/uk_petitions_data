        "additional_details": "Many countries allow small pets in the cabin, recognizing the emotional and physical benefits to both pets and owners. Amending current UK flight regulations to allow this would improve welfare standards and match global best practices, without compromising safety or comfort for passengers. Evidence suggests that such policies can be implemented effectively, as seen in the EU, Ireland and the US. It's time the UK updates its approach to pet travel to reflect the human-animal bond's importance.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to mandate that airlines allow pets under 8kg to accompany their owners in the cabin on flights to and from the UK. This policy would align with pet-friendly travel standards seen internationally.",
