        "additional_details": "Drivers are experiencing staggering rises in fuel costs, suffering escalating cost of living due to inflation, anyone working in the extended ULEZ using a non compliant vehicle faces finding \u00a3300 extra a month.\r\nIt will not affect the rich who can afford to pay and will enjoy less congestion.\r\nIs it about clean air/congestion or just more taxes on the cash cow motorist, an increase to the, already scandalous, \u00a3160 to \u00a3180 for failing to to pay the charge within 24hrs is just daylight robbery.",
        "background": "The proposal states \"most drivers already have compliant vehicles\" so why does he want to extend the zone wasting money installing monitoring cameras.\r\nLeast well off people are those likely to own older cars that don't meet latest emission controls and cannot afford new cars or electric vehicles.",
