        "action": "Get all teachers, childminders and nursery staff vaccinated as priority",
        "additional_details": "Government should make vaccinating teachers, childminders and nursery staff one of their priority groups, to protect them so they are to continue to work and not lose an income.\r\nGive these key workers what they need to feel safe to work and look after our little people without worry. Our children continue to lose out on education from the incompetence of this government not being able to control the situation - let's change this and help get them protected.",
        "background": "Childminders are self employed and without pay if they are closed down. Aslong as they are closed, along with schools and nurseries, parents can not work and many are forced to take unpaid parental leave. It makes no sense to keep them closed when we should be fighting for their protection as well.",
