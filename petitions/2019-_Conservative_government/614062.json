        "additional_details": "Everything that makes Channel 4 so unique and special to work for is in their public ethos, even though they\u2019re funded by ads. C4 is entirely financially solvent as it is, pandemic notwithstanding, and it is the breadwinner of 100\u2019s of small indies, without whom an entire employment eco-system in the regions wouldn\u2019t exist. The TV industry and the public do not want this. This is OUR public service broadcaster and we do not want it to become yet another faceless profit machine.",
        "background": "Leave Channel 4 as a public-service broadcaster owned by the British public and funded by ads, taking into account their already submitted financial proposals and retaining their unique public-service model going forward.",
