Armed Forces, Police Officers, Shop Workers, Lorry Drivers, Funeral Directors, Social Workers, Postal Workers, Bus Drivers, Small Shop Owners, Pharmacy Workers, NHS Volunteers, Teachers.\r\nThey have helped all of us to keep as safe as possible from the invisible enemy. They treated the sick, fed the nation, got key workers to work, transported supplies around the country, and more.",
        "background": "We need to recognise all of these people, not just once, but forever. Dedicating a Bank Holiday to them, everyone will have the chance to remember them in their own way. A Bank Holiday would make it more special and a lot of the heroes would be able to celebrate the day with their own families.",
