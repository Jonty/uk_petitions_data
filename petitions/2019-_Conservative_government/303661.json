        "additional_details": "As a result of not only the Coronavirus, but also the UCU strikes, many students spring semester has seen minimal teaching or support. For final year students, this is an incredibly stressful time to be uncertain of assessment methods. Bearing in mind many students select certain modules due to personal strengths in either exams or coursework, it would be unreasonable to change these. Additionally, postponing exams would not be practical, considering graduate schemes/jobs start from June 2020.",
        "background": "I propose that in light of the current situation regarding the suspension of teaching within many universities, final year students should be given the option to graduate with their current average grade.",
