        "additional_details": "Considering the United Kingdom is experiencing a second wave of COVID 19, with daily cases and deaths rising rapidly, it seems sensible to follow other European countries, and implement the use of face coverings in all public settings. Science has proved that wearing a face covering is effective in protecting others from coronavirus, therefore if we were all to wear them outside, in addition to the present requirement to wear them in confined spaces, the spread of the virus could be reduced.",
        "background": "I want the government to make it mandatory for all people to wear a face covering out in public places, such as on the street or in parks. Of course, this would not apply to those who are exempt from wearing a face covering for health reasons.",
