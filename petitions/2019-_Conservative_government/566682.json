        "additional_details": "Myself and many others that i know who are going through the same situation believe it's unfair that last years students didn't have to sit their exams after only having 2-3 months off of school. We've been homeschooled for nearly 6 months now and been through nearly 3 local and national lockdowns. We're going to be competing for University placements and college placements with students in Wales and Scotland who haven't had exams, which sets us back. It has caused more stress than needed.",
