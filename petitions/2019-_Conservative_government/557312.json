        "action": "Allow places of worship to remain open during lockdown",
        "additional_details": "During such a difficult time, for many people, their ability to attend a place of worship is pivotal to their lives. To have this taken away while schools and universities remain open is absurd and inhumane. I feel a fresh review of this order is appropriate, as to deny people the opportunity to worship during such a time can have very serious repercussions. Personally, my faith in God gives me hope despite what we see currently and my ability to worship God with others is fundamental.",
        "background": "As of Thursday 5th November 2020, places of worship must close (except for private prayer) in an attempt to combat the virus. Places of worship should be prioritised and the Government should reconsider this, allowing people to attend their places of worship in line with Covid regulations.",
