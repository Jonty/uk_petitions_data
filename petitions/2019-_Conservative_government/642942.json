        "additional_details": "Many train journeys are overcrowded. There needs to be a greater incentive for train companies to invest in extra capacity. Requiring train companies to extend schemes for compensation for delays to provide compensation for passengers on train journeys which are overcrowded would give train operators more of an incentive to stop overcrowding. Train companies often make large profits, and many are owned by foreign governments, so should be investing to prevent overcrowding. Requiring compensation should encourage this.",
        "background": "We want the Government to give train passengers rights to compensation if the trains they are travelled on are overcrowded. There are already schemes for claiming compensation for delays. We want similar rights for those impacted by overcrowding.",
