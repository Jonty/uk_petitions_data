        "additional_details": "Our unclassified rural minor roads are facing heavier usage than at anytime in the history of motorised vehicles. Many are totally unsuitable for the volume and speed of the vehicles using them. People living on these roads are in danger every time they step out of their front door, as many have no pavements and are used by horse riders, cyclists, walkers and children going to school. Accidents are commonplace and seem to be accepted as inevitable by the local authorities.",
        "background": "Many accidents are 'minor' causing damage to vehicles, our lanes are littered with wing mirrors and bit of bodywork. These are unreported but cause financial loss at the very least. Horse riders and walkers are in fear, with good reason. Please help us to at least have a tool to help people.",
