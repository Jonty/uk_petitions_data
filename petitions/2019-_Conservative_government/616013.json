        "action": "Remove the Extortionate TV licence in the UK",
        "additional_details": "The TV licence is another large cost to the average household, with excessively increasing living costs. Having to pay out in order to watch and stream live TV is insanely backwards. The BBC should play advertisements on their channels and IPlayer etc should be a subscription service. If an American can watch British broadcasting channels for an addition to a small fee why should the average British household pay an unreasonable fee to hold a TV when reports show decreasing live tv viewers.",
        "background": "Abolish the extortionate TV licence posed on the public in the uk, this has been raised as a pertitiok number plus times, gathering rather large numbers of those in favour. The TV licence is irrelevant in modern day. The BBC is no longer the main information channel and should fund from Adverts",
