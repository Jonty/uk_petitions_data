        "action": "Ban the use of Police horses at protests",
        "additional_details": "The use of police horses during protests and crowd control situations only leads to an increased risk of injury for protestors, police officers and horses alike. Often the horses are used to kettle protestors into smaller areas, increasing the likelihood of retaliation. Horses are often injured or spooked, leading to a fight back from the horses, injuring protestors. This petition would like to see a ban of the use of police horses at protests.",
        "background": "This petition is for the government to ban the use of Police Horses during crowd control and protest situations. It has become increasingly obvious in the recent spate of protests that horses are often spooked or injured during protests.",
