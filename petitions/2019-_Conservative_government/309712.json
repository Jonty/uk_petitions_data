Meaning a lot of empty houses, apartments and student accommodation. Maintenance loan is used to help students survive throughout their time at university. However if it is being spent on empty student accommodation, then it is not helping students survive in these unprecedented times, where jobs have been lost/ suspended. Some landlords are claiming mortgage holidays and demanding rent of us",

My university course has been cancelled and I have had to move back home. The loan helps me to live, with jobs suspended it is my only source of income and I\u2019m being made to use it on rent.",
