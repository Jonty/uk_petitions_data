I am still not in a good place mentally but I had to go back to work as I had no other choice. Whilst I was off work for 2 months I was only receiving statutory sick pay and was in a difficult situation financially.\r\n \r\nThe total number of cohabiting couples has increased from around 1.5 million in 1996 to around 3.5 million in 2020. Support for bereaved partners should reflect this.\r\n",
