Male contraceptive options haven\u2019t been made available because of unwanted side-effects, so why is it ok for women to experience side-effects?\r\n \r\nAction is needed to make contraception safer for everyone who uses it, as well as increase options for people without having to compromise other aspects of their health.",

Current forms of contraception can affect hormone balance which can cause a range of different issues, yet we have little to no options.",
