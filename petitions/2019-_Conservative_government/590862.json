        "additional_details": "Key workers have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic to keep hospitals safe, water on tap and power on demand. Key workers, especially those whose low income is influenced by government regulatory decisions or NHS pay bands (ie nurses) deserve recognition from the government. What better way to do this than to recognise this contribution with a strong statement of how valuable these people are to the stability and success of our great Union. Recognise key workers as special",
        "background": "To be clear, this petition is asking the UK Government or Parliament to give key workers in healthcare and regulated utility industries a specialist tax code which grants an additional \u00a35,000 of tax free allowances as well as protecting key workers from income tax increases for the next 10 years.",
