        "action": "Ban the use of firearms for the public or make the licensing process stricter.",
        "additional_details": "Five innocent people were murdered. Their lives gone in minutes, this could have been prevented had he not slipped through the cracks of our license process/re-issuing system. Hindsight is a wonderful thing but before this devastating event there was plenty of evidence to suggest that this man should not have been given his license back. We have one of the worlds most strictest gun laws but yet our loved ones are gone. This is an unacceptable loss and our laws must be changed.",
        "background": "The government must ensure the safety of the public by making the license process harder or the general public should not be able to own a firearm, especially in residential areas in our cities. No ordinary person should have ownership of a gun. There are cracks in this system which must be fixed.",
