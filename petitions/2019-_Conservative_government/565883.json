The public are desperate to help so let\u2019s do everything we can to vaccinate as many people as soon as possible. Our children are missing their education, students locked away, jobs being cut and mental health suffering. We\u2019re at breaking point, we can\u2019t go on like this. We need to make history, we have to do something extraordinary, otherwise 2021 will be all too similar to 2020.",

You can find out more here: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-people-to-receive-oxford-universityastrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-today-4-january-2021\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling on the Government to provide additional funding to enable the NHS to increase the number of sites at which Covid-19 vaccinations are provided, although in practice the number of sites the NHS can operate will depend on the staff available to administer vaccinations."
