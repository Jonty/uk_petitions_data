        "additional_details": "Any relaxation to allow for limited use will only lead to even laxer laws on the use of this damaging pesticide. This decision is environmentally regressive and will cause severe impacts on the bee population who play an important role as pollinators and lead to other lasting damage to the environment and agriculture industry. The government should re-evaluate its relaxation of this ban and uphold their promise before irreversible damage is done to the environment.",
        "background": "Upon exiting the EU, the government promised to uphold the ban on this pesticide due to its damaging impact on bees and the wider environment. The government has now reneged on this promise to allow for \"limited\" use to ensure slightly cheaper sugar.",
