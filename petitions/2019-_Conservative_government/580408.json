As of present, no such system exists and it is detrimental to the students academic and mental wellbeing. I propose that teachers are allowed to be candid and frontal about the information they are using to grade us and what we are currently working out. It makes little sense to restrict this information and the negatives of revealing this seems neglible.",
        "background": "Currently, students are given the bare minimum information about what grade they are working towards, and what they need to do to achieve the grade they desire. This includes what exams are taken into consideration and what exams henceforth will be taken into consideration.",
