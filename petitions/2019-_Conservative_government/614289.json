        "action": "Stop investing in new nuclear power in the UK",
        "additional_details": "Since new technological developments have improved green power generation, we believe the Government should redirect investment in nuclear energy to wind turbines onshore & off, solar power and tidal powered green energies.\r\n \r\nIt is quicker to produce, still creates jobs if we manufacture in the UK and does not leave a problem for the next generations to dispose of dangerous waste.\r\n \r\nSome members of the public complain about the look and impact of onshore wind farms in their county, but we believe these are preferable to new nuclear power stations.",
        "background": "The waste from nuclear energy is a liability for future generations. An accident or terrorist attack at nuclear sites could be catastrophic. New technology means there are green alternatives which we believe are superior to nuclear power. The Government should stop investing in new nuclear power.",
