In an age of fake news and misinformation, we need our public service broadcasters like never before.\r\n \r\nNews and current affairs programming (especially local) would likely be unprofitable for a commercial broadcaster, so would be the first casualty of privatisation.\r\n \r\nPrivatising these broadcasters would leave the UK with no broadcaster accountable to the public or responsible for covering local affairs.",
        "background": "Sir Christopher Chope MP (Conservative, Christchurch) has tabled a Private Members Bill, the Public Service Broadcasters (Privatisation) Bill, which would provide for the privatisation of the BBC and Channel 4. The Government should block this legislation.",
