        "additional_details": "This process is unpredictable and has ever increasing stakes, financially and emotionally. Timing of appointments are due to the body, as such adequate support is essential from an employer. Not all women can have children and those that require assistance should not be penalised. Without legal protection women have to inform their employers and explain in detail, which can be harrowing and demeaning in some instances. There is a lack of understanding and this can lead to discrimination at work.",

Although employers should treat IVF appointments and any sickness the same as any other medical appointment or sickness often this does not always happen. This can lead to significant difficulties for female employees",
