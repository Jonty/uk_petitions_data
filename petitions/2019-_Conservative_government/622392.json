Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) gives disabled people a right of access to goods, facilities, services and premises.  But with no adequate seating in general areas this is doing exactly that. Seating should be provided every 50 meters for those who have mobility issues.",
        "background": "Make public venues provide adequate seating in general areas for those who are disabled or have mobility issues but to not require a wheelchair. Taking into example the O2 at Greenwich. This venue has no seating provided for those who have mobility issues between the car parking area and entrance.",
