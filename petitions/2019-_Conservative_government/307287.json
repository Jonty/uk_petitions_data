        "additional_details": "The prime minister has described the Coronavirus crisis as a war; and wars need soldiers. It's no secret that our National Health Service has had its knocks over the years, but at times like these, we're all reminded how critically important it is. \r\n\r\nThis award may not be the pay rise and bottle of wine they deserve, but it's something meaningful from a grateful nation.",
        "background": "I believe our long-suffering frontline NHS staff should get long-lasting recognition. In the same way that we award the Victoria Cross and the post-nominal letters 'VC'. I propose that all current frontline staff should be awarded with the use of post-nominal letters such as 'NHS'.",
