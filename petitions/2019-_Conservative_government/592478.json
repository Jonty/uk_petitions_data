        "additional_details": "Of all the breast cancers, metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer (mTNBC) is the hardest to treat with the worst prognosis. The average life expectancy is 12-18 months. Trodelvy can work to shrink cancer in patients who are otherwise resistant to chemotherapy. In the UK every year, around 1650 women die of metastatic TNBC, post co-vid these figures are likely to be double.",
