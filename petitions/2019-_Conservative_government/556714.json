        "additional_details": "Beauty salons and Tattoo Parlours are some of the most sterile and cleanliest environments you could visit, even before a virus outbreak. Using gloves, aprons and face masks, the risk is substantially smaller than that of some other businesses.\r\nIf each individual business is willing to put the necessary COVID precautions in place, and to be inspected, these businesses should be allowed to remain open. \r\n28 days may not seem a lot to some, but for a small business owner, it is a lifetime.",
        "background": "The Government need to review the new Tier 3 Plus COVID restrictions for Nottinghamshire, to allow beauty and tattoo salons to remain open. Nottinghamshire are the only district to have decided they should close for 28 days.",
