With many assignments being cancelled and tutors presenting old prerecorded lectures. \r\n\r\nThis has prevented learning and development, with many students feeling unprepared to go into work. \r\n\r\nFor many it was as if they had the year off studying, but they will still be in \u00a39000 dept lacking skills they deserved to learn. \r\n\r\nIt has put many students in worse off position than their peers who graduated pre pandemic. Not to mention the mental health issues faced.",
