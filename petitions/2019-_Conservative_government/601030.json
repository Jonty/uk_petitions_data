        "action": "Ban all MPs from holding paid second jobs or receiving other income.",
        "additional_details": "Self-regulation has failed in this area and too many MPs have proven themselves incapable of being influenced by outside interests. The only way to guarantee that an MP cannot be bought is if they cannot be paid.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the electorate expects to be properly served at a constituency and national level. Time spent attending to other interests makes this unlikely.\r\n\r\nFinally, MPs are already very generously recompensed and should easily be able to manage without the need for a side-hustle.",
        "background": "Ban MPs from receiving other income, including as employees, directors, board members, company owners, shareholders, consultants or landlords. \r\n\r\nExceptions would apply for ministerial, union and party political posts, forces reserves, 999 services, NHS and state schools, and bank account interest.",
