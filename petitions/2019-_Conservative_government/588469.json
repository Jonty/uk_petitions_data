        "action": "Revert the London Congestion Charge back to 7am-6pm Monday to Friday only.",
        "additional_details": "Because its unfair to the people to have such an expensive fee just to be able to travel in and out of London on weekends. The congestion charge was created to reduce congestion in London's busiest spots, which it does by discouraging individuals from driving into London. However, now with the extension of operating hours and \u00a315.00 charge, it is a serious restriction for Londoners and businesses who require access to London in order to complete their duties.",
        "background": "The current hours of operation are excessive for the purpose of reducing congestion as very few people drive into London on weekends anyway. Also, the current price is just too high for ordinary households, a fair price is \u00a310.00.",
