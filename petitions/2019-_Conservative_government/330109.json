        "additional_details": "Previously, lorry, bus and towing licenses were issued when gaining a car license. The car license shows a person is a safe and competent driver, and so it is time-consuming and financially wasteful to have separate categories.\r\n\r\nHGV/bus training is expensive, and uses many of the same skills shown to the examiner in the car test. This will benefit people who are training to be a lorry or bus driver, as well as others among many industries who must drive for work.",
        "background": "Before 1997, passing a car driving test entitled the license holder to drive HGV\u2019s and Minibuses, as well as tow trailers. The DVLA should issue licenses BE, C1, C1E, D1 and D1E with a car license, as passing a car driving test demonstrates a driver\u2019s capability of safely controlling a vehicle.",
