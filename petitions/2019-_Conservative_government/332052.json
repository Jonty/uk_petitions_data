Animals need space to live and should be given that. We believe animals in some zoos are not cared for adequately, and others are simply unhappy. Animals deserve to live in environments more similar to their natural habitats. We don't like isolation, why would they?",

The Government should ban zoos, and only permit wildlife sanctuaries, with higher animal welfare standards. This should result in more wildlife sanctuaries, with better habitats for animals.",
