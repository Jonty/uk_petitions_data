        "additional_details": "During school hours, it's been known that the only times students are allowed to access the toilet is at break time or lunch. This is an unfair rule that needs to be changed especially for girls in particular who experience their menstrual cycle once a month over a period of days. The fact that it's allowed for them to be refused access to the toilet over something they have no control over, is ridiculous. And the same goes for those who may have illnesses regarding this topic.",
        "background": "I want the Government/Parliament to make it a law that if a student asks to access the toilet during a class at school, college or university, then they should be allowed to go with no argument from the teacher.",
