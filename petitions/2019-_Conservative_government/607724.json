        "additional_details": "Thanet Council have repeatedly ignored the needs of the public along where hospital workers, members of the public, police officers, tourists and dog walkers park. Along this strip is vital parking as Margate is already hugely struggling with parking. \r\nRecently, damage to vehicles, thefts from vehicles and drug dealing has increased in the area as there are no lights and no cameras in the area to deter would-be offenders. \r\nPeople work all day, to return to damaged vehicles and missing items.",
