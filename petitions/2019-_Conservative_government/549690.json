        "additional_details": "It's 2020 and we live in a post Covid-19 world. Now more than ever is it important for all merchants to offer cashless payments.\r\n \r\nCashless payments also make it easier for the Government to ensure that businesses are paying taxes due, and not trying to avoid these obligations. This is particularly important given how much debt Covid-19 is putting on the UK government.\r\n \r\nA website could be set up where you can name businesses that don't comply with the new law so the government can investigate.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to make law for every single merchant that accepts cash to also accept cashless payments.\r\n \r\nI am tired of going to either a restaurant, a takeaway or even a grocery store who say they don't accept card payments and it's cash payment only.",
