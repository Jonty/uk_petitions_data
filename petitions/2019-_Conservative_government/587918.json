        "additional_details": "Scientific evidence suggests that healthy children rarely develop serious illness from Covid-19 and now that the elderly and most vulnerable have been vaccinated, overall transmission is reduced. Long term safety data of the vaccines are unknown and emerging data now shows younger people are more likely to get side effects from Covid-19 vaccines. We as parents and guardians feel that it is unethical to administer these Covid-19 vaccines to healthy children under the age of 12.",
