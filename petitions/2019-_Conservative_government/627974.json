        "additional_details": "I believe Parliament isn't representative enough of people in wider society. For example, in September 2022 55 (or 7.3%) of Members of the House of Lords were from minority ethnic groups. Whereas 13.0% of the UK population aged 16 and over are from a minority ethnic background. This is not representative of the wider population and we believe is unacceptable, as Parliament makes decisions that will affect everyone's future. Adding content on diversity in politics should at least raise awareness of the lack of diversity at present, and could help lead to change.",
        "background": "We want the Government to amend the national curriculum content on the operation of Parliament and role of political parties, so that schools are required to teach about diversity in politics, to help create awareness of the importance of everyone feeling represented in society.",
