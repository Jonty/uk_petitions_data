Scientific evidence shows the negative effects on the environment as well as public health that the meat and dairy industries and products have, whether that be in the form of zoonotic diseases, or the direct negative impact a heavily meat and dairy-based diet can have on an individual\u2019s health, which in turn puts more strain on public health systems.",

In addition, products containing meat, dairy and eggs should be required to display an 'Eat Responsibly' label.",
