        "additional_details": "Thousands of couples have now had their dream day taken away from them. Restrictions on numbers have been updated but is still dependent on your wedding venues capability. Social distancing is still having to be kept, food and drinks to be table service, no dancing. Couples have had to change plans multiple times and some with great expense! Suppliers booked and then cancelled! Test events have been completed at sport events. Why can\u2019t guests provide a negative COVID test the day before?",

Test events have been completed at sport/concert events. Allow guests to provide a negative COVID test the day before.",
