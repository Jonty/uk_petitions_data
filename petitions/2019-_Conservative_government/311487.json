        "additional_details": "These British Nationals are feeling extremely vulnerable right now with very few avenues to turn to, some in countries where the health care systems may put them at more risk. Embassies are overwhelmed, travel agents are not able to cope with current demand of Nationals trying to get back and some airlines are not giving a clear message to their customers. \r\nThe Government needs to step in and organise safe flights the world over to repatriate their Nationals back similar to other countries.",
        "background": "Organise flights/planes back to the UK for any british Nationals who are currently abroad and need help getting back to the UK. This is a time when many British Nationals are abroad and need help getting back to the UK due to issues in the countries they are stuck in.",
