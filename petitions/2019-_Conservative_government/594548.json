        "additional_details": "There are a number of ways this could be achieved, including speed limiters, tracking devices, more speed cameras, reducing the amount of leeway given by existing cameras, more traffic police and educating the public about the relationship of increasing speed to increasing emissions. \r\nChanging the culture so that we view excessive speed as more likely to result in a fine, antisocial, dangerous and damaging to the environment could result in a significant reduction in CO2 emissions very quickly.",
        "background": "At a time when many of us are working hard to reduce our carbon footprints there appears to be a sizeable minority of drivers who think it is acceptable to drive well above the 70mph limit, thereby dramatically increasing the CO2 emissions of their vehicle per mile travelled.",
