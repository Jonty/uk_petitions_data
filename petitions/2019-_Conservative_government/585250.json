        "additional_details": "Last year more than 200,000 learners got new skills through union learning. The government-funding scheme helped to teach people to read, write and use computers: last year 62,000 got basic English, maths and IT skills through union learning. And thousands got their first-ever qualification.\r\n\r\nIndependent reviews have consistently found union learning to be effective and transformational for the workers who take part, their families, and communities.\r\n\r\nWhat the government needs to do is reinstate the ULF.",
        "background": "For over 20 years the ULF supported people to access skills and training at work, through their unions. The training around mental health helped normalise talking about it at work. People who missed out at school learned English and maths in union learning courses, skills they\u2019ll have for life.",
