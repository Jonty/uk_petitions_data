        "additional_details": "A reported \u00a310bn has been allocated for spending on NHS Track and Trace. However, the track & trace app lacks critical functionality, took 7 months to build & is reported to have cost \u00a3350M. Contracts for Track and Trace technology and services have been awarded to companies with dubious records of cost effective success & timely delivery. The reported \u00a310bn allocation on a short term measure is a seismic amount of money that could potentially be better spent on rebuilding society post Covid 19.",
        "background": "Investigate the allocation of contracts and funding for NHS Track and Trace to establish if the best provider vs government resources has been used to deliver the most cost effective result. Improve future procurement process to engage more cost effective, better skilled providers.",
