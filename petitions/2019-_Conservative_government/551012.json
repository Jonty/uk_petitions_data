        "action": "Create a quarantine exemption to facilitate cross border child contact",
        "additional_details": "Where parents of children live in different countries the travel quarantine is interfering with the child\u2019s ability to exercise regular contact with their parents. There are exemptions allowing people to travel for work without needing to quarantine if they are a cross border worker yet the right to family life is not recognised in the same way. If a child travels to a country that is not exempt to see a parent they cannot attend school and the accompanying parent cannot attend work for 2 weeks.",
        "background": "This petition is to ask the Government to introduce an exemption to facilitate contact, similar to the cross border worker exemption. Other countries have this exemption including many in Europe.",
