        "additional_details": "Since 2015, Saudi-led intervention in Yemen has resulted in the most civilian deaths in the country, with their actions breaching international humanitarian law. They have led airstrikes on schools, hospitals, weddings and food infrastructure leading to mass famine. Over 24 million people require humanitarian aid. The UK is complicit by selling \u00a35.3 billion in arms to the coalition, despite it being ruled \u201cunlawful\u201d by the court of appeal in June 2019. The sale of arms must cease.",
        "background": "The UK government intends to continue supplying arms to the Saudi-led coalition despite clear breaches of humanitarian law. UN reports indicate coalition airstrikes have caused over 8,000 civilian deaths since 2015. Our government must cease sale of arms and condemn the conduct of our Saudi allies.",
