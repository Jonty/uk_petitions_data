        "additional_details": "Current Governmental advice to come home immediately when there are simply no commercial flights from many destinations is useless advice. The few flights which seem available from many countries cost thousands of pounds and can be withdrawn in the blink of an eye. Many insurance companies will not pay as they exclude cover during pandemics. At a time of national crisis UK citizens trapped abroad need Government action and support to get home.",
        "background": "Government action is needed to arrange repatriation flights for UK citizens stranded abroad by the Covid-19 Pandemic. Airlines are cancelling flights and many countries are withdrawing transit rights for passenger flights. Solving this will take Government action.",
