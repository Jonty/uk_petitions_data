Schools in debt due to under-funding are now paying taxpayers money, intended to educate children, as interest to... banks.",
        "background": "Cancelling the debt of all maintained schools, similar to cancelling NHS debt, will promote better education and enrichment of our children and a better work environment for the teaching profession. Similar benefits would arise from debt cancellation for early years, further education etc",
