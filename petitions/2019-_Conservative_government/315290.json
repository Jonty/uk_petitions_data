If they feel the crisis has eased and that the Act is no longer required, they can vote for the Act to expire.\r\n\r\nUltimately, most of the Act will stop having effect two years after it passed, meaning March 2022.\r\n\r\nYou could start a petition calling on Parliament to vote to allow the Act to expire at its next review (around September/October 2020) if that is what you wish to happen."
