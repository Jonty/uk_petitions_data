They celebrate the inhumanity of the past, and further, emphasise that many white people think they are better than anyone else based on the colour of their skin.\r\n\r\nEveryone is the same, no matter the colour of their skin. And celebrating the politician traders is saying that inhumanity is ok based on skin colour - it is not, and so remove all of the statues which were built for politician traders.",
