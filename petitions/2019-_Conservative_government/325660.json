        "additional_details": "These statues celebrate the hateful racism, and enslavement of a race. They celebrate the inhumanity of the past, and further, emphasise that many white people think they are better than anyone else based on the colour of their skin.\r\n\r\nEveryone is the same, no matter the colour of their skin. And celebrating the slave traders is saying that inhumanity is ok based on skin colour - it is not, and so remove all of the statues which were built for slave traders.",
        "background": "We want all of the statues of Slave Traders removed. They represent the painful history of Slavery by uplifting the disgusting British Slave Traders that stole people from all over Africa.",
