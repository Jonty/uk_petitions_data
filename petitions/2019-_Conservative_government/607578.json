        "additional_details": "LED lighting on road vehicles is out of date given huge advances in technology since it was written. LED's can output immensely powerful light whilst using very little power (Watts). Watts is the current measurement in law so there is effectively no limit on the light output from vehicles. Excessive light output is very dangerous as it dazzles drivers and significantly reduces a drivers night vision some time after exposure increasing the likelihood of accidents.",
        "background": "LED lighting measurement values for vehicle lighting are inappropriate. Lights on vehicles should be changed to use the Lumens unit as this is a measurementof actual light output. Emergency vehicles need sensors that will dim their emergency lights when it is dark.",
