        "additional_details": "Despite a national lockdown where schools are shut, special educational needs schools are open for vunerable students who all have EHCPs. Many of the children who attend these schools don't understand social distancing or face masks and can also display behaviours such as spitting and biting, all of which will transmit the disease. Support staff are unable to support students on a 1:1 basis from a two metre distance and therefore, they are exposed the risk of COVID.",
        "background": "To protect the special educational needs support staff, teachers and their families, the government needs to prioritise giving the vaccine for Covid-19 to staff of these schools, who are having to work throughout the national lockdown.",
