Examiners and instructors are being pushed to make better drivers as the government wanted to lower accidents. If the drivers that pass are at a higher standard than previous generations, then why are they paying so much for insurance. A cap is needed to stop insurance companies taking advantage of teenagers and young adults and new drivers",
