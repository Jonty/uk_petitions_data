        "additional_details": "We would like the government and parliament to help this because women who have religious beliefs would still feel trapped because the ex-husband would not give religious divorce freely out of spite and the religious council would have to speak to the ex-husband whom may avoid speaking to the religious council to help the women get it sanctioned. This has major effects on the women well-being effecting her mentally as she feels not free due to her beliefs although by UK law was granted divorce.",
        "background": "Would like the government to have a system in place when a UK divorce is granted in court to get the appropriate religious divorce the same time. Reason for this is the ex-husband might not give the women a religious divorce out of spite or the women would need to go through their faiths council",
