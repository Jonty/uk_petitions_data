If students aged 13 and above stayed home, parents/guardians could continue to go to work and the transmission of the virus in schools would decrease.\r\n\r\nSchools would remain open at a reduced capacity, for any child who needs additional support or resources.",
        "background": "Schools should remain open for children in KS1, KS2, Year 7 and Year 8. Students above the age of 13 should stay at home. Schools must continue to provide a full curriculum through online learning. Pupils who need additional support, or don't have access to a computer should continue attending.",
