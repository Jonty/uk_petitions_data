        "additional_details": "The UK has a moral duty to help resolve this dispute which is a legacy of the British Empire. Tensions are high since India abolished Jammu & Kashmir\u2019s special constitutional status without any consultation. There have been reports of human rights violations. India and Pakistan have shown that they cannot resolve it by themselves so the UN must be involved. Over 3 million Britons trace their ancestry to the Indian subcontinent, and conflict in Kashmir risks harming community cohesion in Britain.",
        "background": "UN Security Council has previously recommended a referendum in Kashmir to finalise its future. India has not held it. Wars have occurred and bilateral talks have failed between Pakistan and India. The UK Government should urge the UN and India to carry out the plebiscite recommended by the UN.",
