        "additional_details": "Two years ago, my stepdad was arrested for placing a camera in my room and using it for his sexual gratification. This offence was Voyeurism as the footage obtained was from after my 18th birthday. The fact that he obtained over 350,000 images and videos, has known me since I was 8, and was calculated enough to wait until my \u2018adulthood\u2019 is not reflected in the 22 month sentence he received. Sex offences receive weak sentences that don\u2019t account for the impact on victims. This needs to change.",
        "background": "Parliament should review the maximum sentences for voyeurism and other sex crimes and increase them so that they are more impactful. The sentence against my Stepdad couldn\u2019t be increased regardless of the amount of content he saved and it fails to recognise the impact it had on me completely.",
