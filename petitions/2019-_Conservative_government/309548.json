They are having to provide Barrier insolation nursing for these patients, yet cannot confirm whether or not these are actual cases. They are being cared for in the home, rather than a hospital, but this level of care, clearly has huge implications for their staffing, particularly if they then also need to self-isolate.",

They can then make appropriate provisions, as well as protecting their staff and other residents. They are providing care for patients who would otherwise be dependent on the NHS and they need support to do this.",
