        "additional_details": "Contingency measures had been put in place to ensure they could do exams in 2021 but now with exams being cancelled they are concerned that history will repeat itself.\r\n \r\nWe need the Government to ensure that measures are put in place to safeguard kids who received lower grades than expected last year and are being prevented from doing exams. This could be achieved by:\r\n \r\n*Letting them have their UCAS predicted grades or target grades as a final grade\r\n*Letting them use their AS Grades from 2019.\r\n*Enabling all students to easily appeal their grade",
        "background": "The U-turn over exam grading in 2020 didn't help all students. There were some students who received lower grades as a result of the Government\u2019s decision, through no fault of their own. Many of these kids are still appealing their grade, even almost 8 months later.",
