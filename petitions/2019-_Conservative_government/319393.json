        "additional_details": "Year 10s and Year 12s are a step behind everyone. Almost 2 months without school meant they receive less teaching. Not everyone has the facilities to continue studying at home. Everyone is at a different level. Content for Year 12 that was meant to be finished this academic year will now have to roll onto the following year, and this will rush them, as Year 13 will become very challenging for them and contain a VERY heavy workload, which also brings more stress for the exams.",
        "background": "The Government have suspended all exams this year reasonably, but they've not set out a plan for Year 10s and Year 12s. Exams for them should be suspended or delayed in 2021 or there should be a system in place as an alternative as they haven't received sufficient study content required.",
