        "additional_details": "Our planet's atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are extremely high and measures need to be taken to prevent them from increasing any further to avoid hitting a climatic tipping point that will negatively affect humans and many other species.\r\n\r\nThe value of generating power through burning forest/woodland sourced biomass needs to be assessed against the loss of ecosystems services provided by managing woodlands/forests in such a way so as not to release carbon to the atmosphere. Ecosystem services being lost are climate regulation, biodiversity reduction, construction timber loss, flood mitigation.",
        "background": "Examine in detail how burning forest/woodland timber releases carbon into the atmosphere which cannot be reabsorbed by new tree planting for many decades and so increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations at a point when they need to be reduced. ",
