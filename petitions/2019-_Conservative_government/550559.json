We want clear processes and direction for where to go for tailored support. The system is far too complex and there is hardly any resource available for neurological diverse conditions or speech and language issues. Our children need help now, this will affect future generations unless we act now!!",
        "background": "Future generations are at risk, there is no investment into early intervention with young children! Schools and NHS are not equipped or do not have enough resource to provide support or diagnosis in early years settings and schools. There is little awareness with teachers on neuro disabilities!",
