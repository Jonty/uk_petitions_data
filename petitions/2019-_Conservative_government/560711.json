It has been suggested that the UK Government might bring in a system of road pricing to replace lost revenues from fuel duty as there are more ULEVs, but the details of this policy have not yet been announced and there has been no indication that such a policy would only apply to taxi drivers.\r\n\r\nIf you want the Government to commit to not introducing a system of road pricing, we could accept a petition requesting this."
