        "additional_details": "As cancer can affect any gender or any age, I believe that educating from a young age how to check for signs would be highly beneficial. Knowing how to identify signs of cancer could help in getting an earlier diagnosis. Cancer affects so many people and is still a scary word to hear. But if you aren't aware of what to look for some may leave it too late to get help. By including this in school it has the potential to save more lives.",
