        "additional_details": "This Act should be resigned to the dark ages and abolished immediately! We no longer live in a 9-5 world so our laws should reflect that. We should be able to do our shopping unhindered 7 days a week. This could also aid in reducing the unemployment rate as retailers might take on more staff to cover any increased opening hours.\r\n \r\nWE are calling for the Government to repeal the STA (1994) with immediate effect so the hard working people in this country can more easily do their shopping any day of the week!\r\n",
        "background": "We wish for the Government in the UK to modernise and adapt to the 21st Century. The Sunday trading law restricts large retailers to opening for sales to six hours during a limited window on a Sunday. We believe these rules, that were introduced in 1994, are Draconian and should be abolished.",
