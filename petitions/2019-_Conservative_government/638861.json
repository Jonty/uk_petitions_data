Remove financial barriers in the way of families at a time when important decisions about their loved ones' care are at stake, including residency, contact and capacity.\r\n\r\nFamilies cannot be expected to navigate these complex systems. How is this a level playing field? Please show your support by signing this petition.\r\n\r\n",
