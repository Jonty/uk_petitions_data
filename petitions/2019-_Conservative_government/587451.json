        "additional_details": "The UK has one of the highest number of deaths from Covid in Europe. People with Covid were discharged from hospital and placed in care homes. Dominic Cummings has claimed, to a House of Commons Select Committee, that the chaos and inefficiencies have led to tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths. The awarding of health and PPE contracts has been casual at best. The Health Secretary has shown he is a very ordinary man, occupying a position where ordinary virtues are just not enough. He must go.",
        "background": "The Prime Minister has failed in his duty to sack the Secretary of State for Health, Matt Hancock, and now Parliament must take the helm. He has shown he is far more interested in tomorrow's headlines than the health of the nation. His own colleagues have claimed he is as slippery as a bar of soap.",
