The invasion of Ukraine is illegal under international law and has displaced millions of innocent civilians from their homes. These refugees should therefore be housed within vacant properties owned by the very people responsible for driving them from their homes in the first place.",

Establish transparency of ownership, including a comprehensive register of foreign ownership. Any property which the owners fail to provide such transparency should then be used to provide housing for refugees.",
