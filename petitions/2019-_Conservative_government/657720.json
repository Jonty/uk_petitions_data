        "additional_details": "The UK faces a serious dog bite issue, impacting both people and pets. It's misguided to point fingers at specific breeds, like Staffies or the banned XL Bully, without reliable breed population data. Media narratives are not dependable. A comprehensive dog licensing system, from responsibly bred puppies to rescue dogs, could provide clarity and control, complementing microchipping. It's time for informed, responsible action.",
        "background": "Chipping and kennel club registrations fall short in providing precise data on dog populations and breeds. We need a robust system - a mandatory paid license for all dogs, with strict penalties for non-compliance. This will create a reliable database, essential for welfare and management.",
