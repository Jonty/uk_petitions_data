We should be able to get the same experience as those that have taken their test prior to Covid as we are paying the same fee or it should be reduced as I believe it\u2019s unfair for those that make a serious fault in the first 10 seconds of their test. They do not receive any experience and have to attempt again.",

The test fee should then be reduced because it\u2019s completely unfair if a learner commits a fault at the start they can\u2019t continue. They receive no drive.",
