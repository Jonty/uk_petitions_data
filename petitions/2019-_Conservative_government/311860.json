        "additional_details": "The housing charity Shelter estimated that over 250,000 people in the UK were homeless in 2016. Despite the provisions of the Homelessness Reduction Act 2017 there are clearly still very many homeless people on the streets. Personal experience of speaking to homeless people suggests that some have been homeless for a long time, and places in hostels can be very hard to find. If housing can be found for people during the coronavirus crisis, it should be possible to continue this afterwards.",
        "background": "The government said all rough sleepers should be found housing during the coronavirus crisis. Homeless people lack shelter, warmth and safety. They are likely to have problems accessing food, sanitation, medical help and social contact. So we want the Government to fund housing after the crisis.",
