        "action": "Increase the maximum assisted e-bike speed allowed on UK roads to 20mph",
        "additional_details": "With the current trend of introducing 20mph zones in built up areas this discrepancy places the e-bike user risk. Motorised vehicles will, accelerate to a greater speed or will creep slowly past so as not to exceed the posted speed limit, creating a dangerous situation. With an increase of 5mph e-bikes will be travelling at the same speed of other motorised vehicles creating a safer environment for the e-bike user, vehicle users will be less inclined to try to overtake or force their way past.",
        "background": "We ask Government to consider adjusting the assisted limit of e-bikes to 20mph the small change will allow e-bike cyclists to maintain a safer speed on the road when mixing with other motorised vehicles.",
