        "additional_details": "The rules for exemption should be fair.  Strangers can meet in less socially distanced ways in pubs and cafes.  Organised music making can provide covid secure environments and should be on equal footing with organised sport exemptions.",
        "background": "Organised sports can meet in covid safe ways; amateur music making groups should be allowed to meet also.  Arguably there is less risk involved as chairs can be arranged in socially distanced ways and in a covid secure environment.  To promote wellbeing and mental wellness these groups should run.",
