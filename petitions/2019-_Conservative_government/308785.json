        "additional_details": "Builders merchants have written to the Secretary of State asking if they can stay open to protect the infrastructure of the country. But builders will be self-isolating so no work will be taking place. Please stop builders merchants from attempting to profit from builders stockpiling, send workers home safely to their families and stop the spread. Builders merchants are not front-line staff. Stop builders merchants putting lives unnecessarily in danger. Lives over profit.",
        "background": "Builder merchant staff are NOT front-line staff. Stop builders merchants like Travis Perkins, Jewsons etc, from staying open to profit from the sudden influx of builders stockpiling building materials during COVID-19. Staying open is putting staff (and their families) lives at unnecessary risk.",
