        "additional_details": "As an example, the NHS work long shift patterns anyway, to add an extra hour of unpaid work to their rota is disrespectful and dangerous to the care they are giving to patients.The law is there to protect workers, businesses wouldn't be able to enforce employees to work for free in other cases, and employees wouldn't be punished by working for free if the clocks didn't go back. More tax would be paid also, benefiting the country. Please support this petition to help workers in all industries.",
        "background": "All workers in all sectors, salary or hourly paid should get paid to work the extra hour when the clocks go back in October. It should be law. A worker isn't guaranteed to work a shift In March and in October to even out the pay. The NHS should definitely be paid for the number of hours they work.",
