        "additional_details": "Law Village in South Lanarkshire has recently seen a large increase in population, with two new build estates, the public transport for the area is pretty non-existent, buses are extremely unreliable. If they do run, they don't run very late. A train station in Law would make it easier for people to visit the village & for residents to use public transport to get out, rather than having to rely on taxis/lifts.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to look into re-opening Law Village Train Station, all the trains from Carluke already run through the trainline going through Law so there would be no need for new tracks.",
