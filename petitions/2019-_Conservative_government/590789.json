        "action": "Don't ban students from taking mobile phones into school",
        "additional_details": "Firstly, as mentioned it is important for students to be able to contact their parents/guardians at the end of the day. There isn't enough room for everyone to drive right up the school gates, in fact in reference to my experience, there are yellow lines outside of my school. Many walk home, so need to get in contact even more desperately. In addition to this, in my school this year, mobile phones have been vital for learning as it means no equipment needs to be passed around and spread germs.",
        "background": "The government are currently urging others to put a ban on mobile phones, which is creating a bigger issue. Talks of this ban even happening needs to stop. The main effect that this will have on students is the fact that they won't be able to contact parents/guardians after the school day is over.",
