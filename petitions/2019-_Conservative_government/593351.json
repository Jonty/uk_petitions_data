And seemingly there is no punishment for doing this, meanwhile sen children are suffering, their families are suffering.  Yes there are complaints procedures but when happens when these complaints are not even responded too as is common? How is it that LA\u2019s are repeatedly permitted to do this and flaunt the law so easily?  This has to stop.",
        "background": "Local Authorities across the country are frequently totally ignoring and breaking the laws of the children\u2019s and families act 2014 with apparently no consequences.\r\n\r\nI believe this to be a deliberate in house policy to delay helping sen children and therefore having to fund additional help.",
