We believe a significant number of these tragedies could have been averted if healthcare providers had taken heed of mothers' worries regarding decreased fetal movement, or had paid attention to mothers advocating for their infants.\r\n \r\nA review could identify how to avoid preventable loss. We want hospitals to actively listen to the concerns and fears of pregnant or new mothers.\r\n",
