        "additional_details": "Deportation can inflict severe psychological trauma and increase the risk of harm to people seeking asylum. Deportation holds an even greater risk for LGBTIQ+ people seeking asylum, as such individuals often flee their home countries to escape persecution and violence due to their sexual orientation or gender identity. Deporting them back to these hostile environments can risk condemning them to continued suffering, exile, physical harm, emotional trauma, abuse, isolation, torture and death.",
        "background": "End the harmful practice of deporting or otherwise removing LGBTIQ+ people seeking asylum in the UK, seeking alternative solutions that do not put people at risk of harm. \r\n\r\nNo-one who is an LGBTIQ+ person should be sent to Rwanda or another third country, or deported.",
