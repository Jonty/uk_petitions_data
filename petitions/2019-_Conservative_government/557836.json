        "additional_details": "Previous academic studies suggest that disabled people are far more likely than the wider population to experience underemployment - that is, being in employment that is inadequate with respect to their training, qualifications and economic needs. \r\n\r\nHowever, in the UK we lack enough information on the topic to even begin solving the issue. Government schemes tend to focus only on unemployment rather than underemployment and disabled people are being left behind. This needs to change.",
        "background": "If we want to tackle the disproportionate underemployment faced by disabled people, we need more information on its extent, causes and the impact it has on disabled peoples' social mobility.\r\n\r\nOnly once an inquiry happens can we develop appropriate remedies and solutions based on the findings.",
