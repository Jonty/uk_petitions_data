Some support has been given, but many businesses will still close or be burdened with debts through no fault of their own. Compensating those affected for some of their losses would be a huge cost but it is unfair that this cost should be borne by just these people and not shared by all tax payers.",

These people should be fairly compensated by the Government so the financial cost of COVID-19 can be equally shared by all tax payers and not just an unfortunate few.",
