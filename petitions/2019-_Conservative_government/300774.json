        "additional_details": "For the last several years the amount of Child Benefit has not increased. It has not even gone alongside Inflation rise and cost of living increased significantly. \r\n\r\nReduced support for Councils and overall Austerity Measures after Financial Crisis of 2008 caused hardship for many families in the UK, especially those in low or middle income. The cost of transport to and from schools, uniforms, excursions and lunch meals have been put back on parents shoulders. \r\n\r\nMany parents cannot afford to provide any extra curriculum activities for their children because they have to pay for basics.",
        "background": "The government pledged after election to stop cuts and Austerity Measure policy. Please sign the petition for significant increase of Child Benefit and each year adjustment according to Inflation rise. By significant increase I mean at least to double existing amounts.",
