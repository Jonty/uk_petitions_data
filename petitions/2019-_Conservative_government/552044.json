        "additional_details": "The potential closure of the bank accounts held by UK expats living in the EU is linked to the issue of the \"passporting\" of financial services by UK financial institutions trading in the EU. At the time of writing this petition no agreement on \"passporting\" has been reached. Failure to do so will create serious difficulty for some 1 million expats living in EU countries, many of whom rely on their UK bank accounts for day-to-day financial transactions. If necessary this aspect of retail banking could be resolved as a separate issue from the wider sphere of commercial finance.",
        "background": "The Government should introduce legislation, or other appropriate measure, so that UK citizens living in the EU will have the same banking rights as EU citizens living in the UK after the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020",
