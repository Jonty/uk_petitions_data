        "additional_details": "How about those learners that it took a while to even have the confidence only for it to be knocked down. Theory Test dates for this year and early next year should be extended. This would make it fair and give more time for learners to re-focus and concentrate on their lessons without any time pressure. Please support this petition as it could make all the difference.",
        "background": "Due to the COVID-19 outbreak life has significantly changed in the UK. Driving lessons have stopped. Driving tests either cancelled or re-arrange. What about those who have been working so hard on their driving lessons and were ready to sit a test?",
