        "additional_details": "I would like this to be done because I feel that there is not enough education at the moment about the UKs past in how we were involved in colonisation and salve trading around the world. Many white British people are also still completely unaware about the racial injustices that are faced in this country to this date. Educating all young people about the problem of racism, whether that be systemic, institutional or overt,  is key to helping to end all forms of racism that still occur today.",
        "background": "I would like for the government to consider adding the teaching of racism and black history in the UK to the national curriculum. This can be done by updating the GCSE reading lists to include more books about racism faced by BAME individuals as well as more literature and artwork by POC.",
