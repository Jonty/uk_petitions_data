        "action": "Halt legislation regarding calorie labels to protect those with eating disorders",
        "additional_details": "Calorie counting is an eating disorder behaviour which can become obsessive for fear of weight gain. The legislation creates triggers and prevents those with EDs being able to eat out (contradictory to 'eat out to help out') and will take a toll on the NHS, as EDs have the highest mortality rate of all psychiatric disorders. Balance and health at every size should be promoted over arbitrary weight loss. COVID-19 has led to an increased number of ED sufferers (see BEAT's open letter to the PM).",
        "background": "Do not make calorie labels compulsory for large out-of-home sector businesses, but protect the UK's 1.25-3.4m people with EDs and stem their rising mortality rates. Calorie counting fuels EDs, but labels are shown to be ineffective in reducing overconsumption (https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.l5837).",
