        "additional_details": "I have recently been in the position where I have had to fund private dental care for myself and my children. I called around every dentist in my local area. None of which are currently taking on NHS dental patients. Dentists didn't even have waiting lists to be added on to. However, they were all more than happy for me to pay for private care and be seen within a week. I don't believe that children should be put on waiting lists for NHS dental care. They should be accepted automatically.",
