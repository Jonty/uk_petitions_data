I fell pregnant with my second in early February 2020, at first scan was on the everything was perfect. My next scan was in May and then my third at 34 weeks in September. Only 3 scans in total over 9 months. As it happened I had gone back to Poland and paid for a scan to be done while I was there and found my son had what appeared to be Hydrocephalus.",
