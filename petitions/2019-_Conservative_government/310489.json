        "additional_details": "Prisoners are particularly vulnerable to the effects of the coronavirus, where it is inevitable that such a virus will spread rapidly and eventually spiral out of control. After a risk assessment for prisoners who are on remand, aswell as other prisoners who do not pose a threat to themselves or society, an early release will slow down the spread of this deadly disease. Action must be taken to prevent death in prisons all over the country.",
        "background": "Release some offenders in UK Prisons in order to ease pressures due to the coronavirus pandemic. As many of the prisons are overcrowded, it is an extremely unsafe environment. An emergency virus plan should be enforced immediately, for the safety of prisoners and staff.",
