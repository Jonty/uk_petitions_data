        "action": "Allow people the legally codified right to access effective suicide methods.",
        "additional_details": "Coercive suicide prevention and restricting lethal means effectively forces people to stay alive and keeps them trapped in their circumstances. Many will resign themselves to continuing to live rather than take the risks associated with suicide. This effectively makes the individual a slave to society, as we continue living not because it's in our own interests, but because the government has decided that it's not safe, or needs to protect us from our own judgement.",
        "background": "I want the government to remove any barriers to accessing effective suicide method such as Philip Nitschke's Sarco device, or lethal barbiturates. This is in line with the European Court of Human Rights Article 8 of Respect for Private Life and to protect negative liberty rights.",
