The Government should stick to this plan.\r\n\r\nThe proposed overground station threatens to turn city centre into a building site. An underground station would surely free up the land above, for homes, businesses, open parks and a welcoming public plan and boulevard.\r\n\r\nThe cut price overground station will include a mile-long viaduct of up to 12 meters in height to reach the new surface station.\r\n\r\nIn comparison London\u2019s \u00a315bn Crossrail opened \u00a34bn over budget. London\u2019s \u2018super hub\u2019 is an 850-meter station with 14 platforms, 6 underground high speed ones and eight conventional ones above ground. There will be no unsightly viaducts at this point on the line.",
