        "additional_details": "The Grenfell Tower fire occurred as a result of flammable cladding and inadequate safety measures. Three years on the problem still remains with thousands across the country living in unsafe buildings.\r\n\r\nWe can never again let another tragedy like Grenfell happen. The Government cannot fail its citizens in rented apartment buildings and council housing, disproportionately putting people from lower income backgrounds at risk. The Government not taking action on this issue will cost more lives.",
        "background": "Banning cladding is not enough, we call on the Government to ensure the replacement of all flammable cladding currently in use. This needs to be prioritised and the government must enforce landlords replacing this cladding with a hard deadline and sanctions for non-compliance.",
