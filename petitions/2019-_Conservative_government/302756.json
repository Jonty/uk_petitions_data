It would be totally unacceptable for the elderly or already health compromised not be treated. High cost, public projects such as HS2, the Stonehenge Tunnel and refurbishing Houses of Parliament should be put on hold and the money used to fight C19, save lives and help small businesses.",

The possibility that the NHS is unable to treat all sectors of the population because of insufficient resources is unacceptable.",
