        "additional_details": "These requirements do not factor in the feasibility for businesses to operate in high-cost urban areas, such as London. The law could result in loss of businesses and a reduction in dog welfare.\r\n\r\nIt will become harder for dog day care businesses to operate in urban areas. There has been a huge rise in dog ownership in urban areas during lockdown, and now that people will start going back into the office there needs to be local and reputable dog daycare options available for them to use. These new and unreasonable DEFRA licensing rules will surely force many small caring dog daycare businesses to close, which would make it harder for many dog owners to properly care for their dogs.",
