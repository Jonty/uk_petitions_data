        "additional_details": "In many workplaces, work is carried out on a computer - paper and pen are often not used. Therefore, it makes no sense that A-level students are forced to hand-write their examinations with a pen, when they are about to enter the world of work where typing is the only option in many sectors. Additionally, the vast majority of work this year (and last) has been on a computer, rather than on paper, so students risk losing deserved marks if their handwriting is unintelligible.",
        "background": "All students should be given the choice of whether they want to write or type text-based exams, by default. At the moment, for a student to be able to use a computer to take their exams, the school or college has to apply to the relevant exam board for each student individually. ",
