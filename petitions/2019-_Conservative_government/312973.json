        "additional_details": "The NHS is free, open to everyone regardless of financial situation, yet underfunded and under-appreciated. The 2018 British Social Attitudes Survey showed that public confidence in the NHS had significantly dropped, yet it\u2019s with us from birth to death, and all the scrapes inbetween. If the COVID-19 crisis has shown us anything, it's the strength of NHS workers and their dedication to our wellbeing. They are literal lifesavers, and deserve to be recognised.",
        "background": "Clap for Carers was an historic moment of solidarity that hasn't been seen in 70 years of NHS service. COVID 19 has proven our NHS workers' dedication to the UK. That\u2019s why I want Parliament to declare 15th July as NHS Appreciation Day: a national day of fundraising and celebration of NHS staff.",
