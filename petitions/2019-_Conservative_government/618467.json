        "additional_details": "Homes in rural areas in the UK rely on heating oil for heating and hot water.  Domestic heating oil, unlike electricity and gas, has no price cap and is likely to continue to rise throughout the summer.\r\n\r\nThis needs to be talked about now, before we reach the winter months when millions of older, vulnerable people may simply be unable to heat their homes.\r\n\r\nAs we approach winter, when demand for heating oil will grow much higher, the price is likely to rise further, and much faster.",
        "background": "The price of domestic heating oil continues to go up, recently hitting \u00a3550 for 500 litres.  If something is not done to stop prices moving higher, people in rural areas including some of the UK's oldest and most vulnerable people, are likely to struggle to heat their homes this coming winter.",
