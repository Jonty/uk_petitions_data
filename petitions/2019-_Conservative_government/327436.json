Some students haven\u2019t even received face to face online teaching during this time. They have been out of an educational setting for over 6 months due to COVID-19 and therefore these exams will not give a true reflection of each pupils ability. The content hasn\u2019t been covered in enough depth and therefore the exams should be cancelled.",
        "background": "All GCSE exams and A level exams should be cancelled in 2021 and the grades should be based on previous assessments, coursework/class work and predicted grades.",
