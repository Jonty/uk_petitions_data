        "additional_details": "Regular introspective, quantifiable assessing of knowledge, skills, and attitudes by experts could produce a gap analysis and training plan to develop a professional level of competency in a department\u2019s leadership. If a minister falls short of the standard expected, a timeframe to develop in those areas, should be allowed. Then the Prime Minister would need to decide whether to keep the Minister on.\r\n \r\nThe average score across Government should be published regularly, alongside yearly targets.",

Ministers don\u2019t need to be an expert in the field but need to be able to represent the departments needs with competence and understanding.",
