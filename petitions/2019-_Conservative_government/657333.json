With private housing costs increasing, we are concerned that failure to act risks not only the well-being of the less fortunate, disabled, and those battling addiction but also financial instability. We think swift investment in affordable social housing is crucial to break this cycle, secure vulnerable populations, and prevent a looming economic downturn.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to provide funding for more affordable social housing, to reduce expenditure on benefits for private housing costs. This initiative aims to assist the less fortunate, disabled and those struggling with addiction, and to foster a more sustainable future for all.",
