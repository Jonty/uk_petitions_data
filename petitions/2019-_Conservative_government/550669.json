We can\u2019t solely rely on ourselves this year nor on our previous exams as we\u2019re constantly changing as students. Schools state that by missing even two days our grades can drop drastically ,and we\u2019ve missed 5 months alongside some students enduring extra stress at home due to mental health or mistreatment.",
        "background": "The fact that some students had access to full remote learning and others did not have a single online class will have impacted disadvantaged students the most, therefore adjustments must be made to prevent the education gap from growing, as we\u2019re well aware of the disparity between our schools.",
