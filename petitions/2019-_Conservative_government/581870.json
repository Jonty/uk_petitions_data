        "additional_details": "Higher education is the key to our nation\u2019s future. It is crucial that all 650 MPs representing England, Wales, Northern Ireland & Scotland take this matter seriously, support students in their constituencies and participate in debates as it is a fundamental principle of democracy. Students from all backgrounds & abilities (including college students) need the support of MPs during this time to raise issues of student fees, accommodation costs & reimbursement for on-line tuition due to Covid-19",
        "background": "The government failed to act on university student tuition fees or listen to the few MPs who debated the issues: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5n7QzDAmzck. Students need wider support from all MPs as the \u00a39250 p.a. is too high. Reduce the maximum students pay for university tuition to \u00a33000 p.a.",
