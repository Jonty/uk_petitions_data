Eventual progress to all CDs in line with nurses should also be considered and would allow advanced paramedic prescribing to help their patients without delay and better support other professionals they work with, especially during this crisis.",
        "background": "The law allowing paramedics to become prescribers was changed in April 2018, but a statutory instrument to change the misuse of drugs act and allow controlled drug prescribing has not yet happened. With the covid outbreak, pushing this through could be a great benefit.",
