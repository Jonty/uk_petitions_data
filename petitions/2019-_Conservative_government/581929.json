Fires have already started on a stretch of the Peak District and they will probably continue throughout the year. Another year of loss of valuable wildlife, another year of risk to people.\r\n\r\nThese fires are caused by humans and we need to minimise the damage that they can do by preventing disposable barbecues from being within easy reach of those who are unaware of, or choose to ignore the dangers they present to our wildlife, to civilians, and to our firefighters who have to put their lives at risk every time fires are started.\r\n\r\nLet's all make this the year we have One Less Risk Of Harm to our National Parks, to the walking groups and families that enjoy them, and the wildlife that inhabit them.",
