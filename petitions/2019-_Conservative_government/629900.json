        "additional_details": "I refuse to allow my children to be cold in 2022!!! People are going to die by freezing to death in their own homes, because they cannot afford to heat their homes! \r\nMr Prime minister would you allow your children,  mother, grandmother to sit in their house in the cold? No I didn't think so!? \r\nCapping the energy bills to March 2023 of \u00a32,500 then allowing it to rise to \u00a33000 PER YEAR isn't good enough! \r\nPeople/vulnerable people will die this winter. \r\nEnergy prices need to go back down and fast!!",
        "background": "I want the government to look at the prices of energy. Gas prices are extortionate. I am a single parent of 3 children and my daily gas usage is \u00a314 a DAY. This is not acceptable. \r\nMy electric is around \u00a35-\u00a37 PER DAY!!!",
