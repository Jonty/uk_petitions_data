        "additional_details": "I believe high income tax can encourage people to stay on benefits, and that progressive income tax bands can discourage people from seeking to gain new skills.\r\n \r\nI believe current national insurance and income tax rates are contributing to the loss of skilled workers.\r\n \r\nWe are facing a massive staff shortage we have seen in decades. As a result we are seeing an NHS staff shortage, lorry driver shortage, less food on the shelf, high transport cost etc.\r\n \r\nIf we carry on like this our economy will suffer. We have to make work pay more.",
