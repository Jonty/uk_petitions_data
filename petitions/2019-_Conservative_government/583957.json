Moreover the online classes are not worth towards the fee charged by the universities. The major reasons to get exclusion are, \r\n1. Many international students paid huge fee to the universities\r\n2. International students are contributing to UK's economy.\r\n3. Students are not getting enough exploruture from online learning. \r\nuniversities.\r\nSo exclusion is required immediately.",
