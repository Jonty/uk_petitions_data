        "additional_details": "Racial abuse is an issue in many schools. If teachers felt more confident and equipped to deal with racism maybe we could stop these situations from escalating. With understanding comes more support and less abuse. It should also help uphold the safeguarding measures schools are legally required to make. As a result we could reduce recurring racial bias/harassment in schools as well as hopefully stop/limit racist ideas being carried into adulthood.",
        "background": "We would like for all teachers go through a mandatory training program/course that helps them confidently confront and deal with racism in schools, as part of the initial employment process and a required program for current teachers to take every year or so.",
