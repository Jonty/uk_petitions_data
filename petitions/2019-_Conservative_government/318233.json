        "additional_details": "The coronavirus pandemic is like no other. Not only has it changed the way we live our lives, it has brought untold suffering to thousands of people. Never before has the NHS seen so many people dying so early in their lives from a virus of this kind. It has left families and friends devastated. Many have unable to mourn, as were unable to see their loved ones in hospital before they died. To show appreciation and leave a lasting legacy, it will be a fitting tribute to our dedicated key workers.",
        "background": "As the son of two NHS doctors, I would like there to be a memorial in remembrance of key workers whose lives have been cut short by COVID-19. This will also be a place where people can go to pay their respects and remember those who have died. It will be legacy to those who have left us too soon.",
