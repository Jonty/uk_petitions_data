        "additional_details": "I was contacted today to donate blood. However, I was blocked from donating due to being in a relationship with a man. It is dangerous that gay men are being blocked from giving or donating blood but this concern has become increased, due to the fact we are currently in a global pandemic. It is wrong, and scientifically limited to have these dangerous rules in place. That harms not only the gay community but also, the wider British public.",
        "background": "The government should suspend the rule that blocks gay man from donating blood. We are currently in a pandemic with research that needs to occur, to help create vaccinations or treatments. The government should suspend these rules throughout the pandemic, and inquire about extending the suspension.",
