        "additional_details": "Prior to the current energy crisis the price per kw for electricity was approx. 18p plus a standing charge of 20p per day. Now it's 27p per kw plus 50p standing charge and this is due to increase again by October. Yet the export price under the Smart Export Guarantee has dropped from an average of 6p per kw to 3p. I believe this to be an unfair disparity and request the government step in to regulate to ensure fair prices and to encourage home owners to purchase renewables.",
        "background": "Set minimum export price for energy companies purchasing electricity under the SEG tariff to be at least 25% of the import price for customers",
