Those that don't wish to, can remain at home.",
        "background": "Cancel or shorten the school summer holidays of 2020, to allow for pupils to 'catch up' on the missing weeks of term-time - due to the closure of schools in the pandemic. (This should not be mandatory and children can remain absent. The school should also seek a volunteer staff team if needed)",
