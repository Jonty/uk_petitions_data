We pay to attend and receive an education to which we are charged interest for the privilege doing so. We are currently paying to be victims of strike action depriving us of actually attaining the education we are paying for and paying interest on. Student fees are understandably expensive, expensive fees charged to students being deprived of the actual opportunity to learn is an injustice.",

Mitigation policies should be considered and action should follow to mitigate fees to reflect the actual opportunity the student is provided with.",
