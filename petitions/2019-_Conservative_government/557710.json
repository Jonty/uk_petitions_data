        "action": "Outdoor tennis courts to remain open when lockdown restrictions tighten on 5 Nov",
        "additional_details": "Tennis is extremely beneficial to physical & mental well-being. Played on outdoor courts, it naturally lends itself to social distancing - played in a covid-secure way in the open air. \r\n\r\nThe Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) supports outdoor tennis courts staying open for two individuals from different households. They describe tennis as a \u2018socially distanced sport with the net as the natural barrier\u2019. \r\n\r\nIt would be counterproductive to shut down a sport that can be played safely and responsibly.",
        "background": "We are asking the Government to ensure that outdoor tennis can continue between people from the same household, or between two individuals from different households - for example a tennis coach and player - when the national lockdown measures come into force in England on Thursday 5th November.",
