        "additional_details": "Currently, probate isn't granted until the tax is paid. Unless the person inheriting is rich, probate can be needed to liquidate the estate in order to release funds to pay the tax. After my brother\u2019s death the Inheritance Tax was vastly more than our savings, so it was a struggle for us to pay.  Where would most people find the money? Especially in these Covid times where many people suffer serious financial hardship. Changing the law would avoid causing further misery to people who are already grieving.",
