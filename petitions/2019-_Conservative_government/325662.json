However, the perpetuation of racism and white supremacy in the UK is shown glaringly every day that the perpetrators of the murder and subjugation of BIPOC are celebrated by having their statues remain. Enough is enough.\r\n\r\nWe demand that ALL statues are removed as a commitment to building an anti-racist country. Any council that does not remove statues of this nature should be considered white supremacists. No Justice, No Peace.\u00a0",
