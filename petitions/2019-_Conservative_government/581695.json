We rely upon systems that do not bend to the whim of the latest cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre that can persuade people, even the good intentioned, to ignore rigid safe guarding.  This may well be a campaign that promotes an end to single sex spaces in a school, for example.  Safe guarding policies must be fail safe or they are pointless.",

Ensure they do not misrepresent the Equality Act; and/or ignore the privacy and dignity of girls in their advice to schools and other publicly funded entities; and that safe guarding policies remain in tact without exception.",
