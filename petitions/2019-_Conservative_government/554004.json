        "additional_details": "We have seen at the end of September thousands of pupils and hundreds of teachers having to self isolate due to covid infection in Liverpool and many other towns and cities around the UK. The government must recognise that the disease is transmissible in schools between students and adults. Staff can easily become infected and asymptomatically transfer the illness to vulnerable relatives during the holidays. A test would allow staff to self isolate and protect the NHS from seasonal overloading.",
        "background": "Set aside one covid test for teachers, support staff and temporary staff coming in contact with classes whilst wearing no PPE in classrooms. The test should take place on the last day of school and results should be available before Christmas eve so that they will not infect vulnerable relatives.",
