        "additional_details": "A majority of heritage language speakers in the UK have an opportunity to sit for a GCSE in their language. Unfortunately, Telugu people don\u2019t. A chance to get a grade or a certificate by a worldwide recognised board like GCSE at the end of learning telugu gives a sense of achievement and motivates students to learn and work harder with a clearer goal. British Telugus should have a GCSE in Telugu like majority of the heritage language speakers in the UK so they can learn in a structured way.",
        "background": "Telugu is the 3rd most spoken language in India and ranks 15th in the world. Currently there are over 50,000 Telugu people spread across the UK. In spite of this Telugu is not available as a GCSE subject. We want the government to support the heritage language speakers by introducing GCSE in Telugu.",
