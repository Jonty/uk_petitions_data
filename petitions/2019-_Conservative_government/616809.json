I think that this should be changed, due to the growing number of young cyclists in our country.\r\n \r\nYoung cyclists, and those without a driving licence, should not be required to cycle in the road. They should be allowed to cycle on the pavement, where they are likely to feel safer, and will not be at risk from motor vehicles.",
        "background": "We want the Government to allow those under 16, or who do not have a driving licence, to cycle on any pavement. This should help younger cyclists feel safer, as many will not be experienced cycling on the road, and may not know traffic laws.",
