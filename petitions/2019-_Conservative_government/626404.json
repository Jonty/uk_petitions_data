By adding \u201cNone of the Above\u201d the electorate will have the ability to show our frustration with the candidates and not be limited to protest votes or spoiled ballots. The data that could be gathered from this would be very beneficial to the parties to work out what strategies they need to take to win the electorate.",

I could spoil my vote but this doesn't show intent verse accident. I could just not vote but this could be seen as apathy and not the lack of confidence I have.",
