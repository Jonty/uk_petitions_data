        "additional_details": "Currently gift cards have expiry dates of 12-24 months. If the card isn't used within this time then the company gets to keep the remaining balance. With the current pandemic it has been difficult to use some gift cards due to venue closure and while it is sometimes possible to get expiry dates extended it is not always the case. The purchase of a gift cards should be seen as a cash deposit. If Banks used the same rules for deposits there should be an outcry.",
        "background": "Gift cards are very often used as presents and the current policy of having an exipry date on them, after which the remaining balance is forfeit is iniquitous, therefore the government should legislate for such expiry dates to be removed and that the funds should be ring-fenced.",
