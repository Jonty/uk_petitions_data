        "additional_details": "I am a survivor of CSA. I told 3 people in my life about what happened to me and didn't come forward until I was 29. I am now a 35 year old woman. Speaking about your abuse and telling the police the details of what happened to you and to have to drag that all up and speak your truth is hard enough. For it to go to CPS and to be sent to court is a big thing. I believe that victims of CSA can miss out on justice when cases are decided by a jury.",
        "background": "I want the Government to remove juries for child sexual abuse cases, whether historical or recent. It takes a lot for survivors to come forward to speak about their abuse. This goes through to CPS who decide if that goes to court. We believe justice for survivors shouldn't be decided by juries.",
