        "action": "Stop vaccines being forced on NHS staff, or they risk losing their career.",
        "additional_details": "Some people are risking their health by getting vaccinated others feel there is not enough evidence behind it. Staff have worked hard, gone to university and indebted themselves with the government to achieve their career aspirations to be told they will lose their jobs. As of today 70.3 % of England is vaccinated, yet the number of cases still rise. The vaccine is not stopping transmission. Nor is it safe to lose this amount of NHS staff, it is already so stretched and short staffed.",
        "background": "We are not about anti vaccination but pro choice. This is about choice not the vaccine but human rights. Aslong as staff are taking the precautions required (masks, hand hygiene) they shouldn't have to risk their health, or personal beliefs to be vaccinated when the statistics show it isn't working.",
