        "additional_details": "We believe policing is too important to roll into an election fought on many issues.\r\n \r\nIn Greater London, the West Midlands and Greater Manchester, mayors hold powers over their local police forces. In other parts of the country, these powers are given to Police and Crime Commissioners who are elected in separate elections. We believe powers over policing should always be held by a dedicated Police and Crime Commissioner, and not an elected mayor. We believe this would help restore faith in police forces across the country.\r\n",
        "background": "We want the Government to remove the policing role from mayors, and instead establish elected Police and Crime Commissioners for areas where these powers are currently held by mayors. ",
