        "action": "Require speed readout on the approach face of fixed speed cameras",
        "additional_details": "It is easy to break a speed limit. Speed cameras are therefore not popular with many law-abiding members of public. The problem of momentary inattention resulting in a fine could be alleviated - and public acceptance of cameras increased - by requiring a speed readout on the approach face. Stand-alone readouts can be very effective in attracting attention. Greater public acceptance of speed cameras could help deliver improved road safety.",
        "background": "We believe that requiring a speed readout on fixed speed cameras could enhance the effectiveness of speed cameras and increase public acceptance of the technology. Introducing this measure could reduce concerns that camera technology is there for revenue generation ahead of road safety.",
