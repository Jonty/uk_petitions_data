We didn\u2019t know he had chronic kidney disease stage 4 until a very frightening admission into hospital. The 2 weeks he was in the world his body was shutting down and we didn\u2019t know, if he was treated before this the damage wouldn\u2019t be so severe. Something so simple to include on early screenings could have prevented him needing a life-saving transplant.",
