If the Lords demand is met, it would be totally unfair to the people of the UK that have been furloughed or made to self isolate. Most if not all of the Lords are multi millionaires, they do not need \u00a31600 a week to survive.",
        "background": "The Lords should be furloughed the same as the rest of the country and accept 80% or a maximum of \u00a32500 per month the same as the general public. What right have they to demand \u00a3323 a day for working from home, when in the House they are seen sleeping, so would probably sleep more in their homes.",
