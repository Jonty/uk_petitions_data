        "additional_details": "Physical exercise without spiritual exercise is the bane of any nation. It is important that communal prayer is encouraged. It helps the health of the nation. Government information and advice carries more weight when communicated from the pulpits. It is trite that people of faith have more trust in their Pastors or whoever leads the congregation than they have in the politicians. Keeping the places of Worship shut while all other areas of society are being opened breeds alienation.",
        "background": "During crisis, people of faith always turn to God. Shutting places of Worship deprives them of such. Places of Worship especially Churches are places of healing and building of community relationships. The continued shutdown of Worship places deprives us of the right to freedom of Worship",
