        "additional_details": "Those mentioned above and others have been the trusted faces of many public briefings, lead by science & only the science. The Government has had to balance the risk to life against the risk to the economy and understandably so. The word of the scientists however has always been less clouded by politics. It\u2019s been a beacon of hope and a clear message of caution backed by fact and graphical display so that everyone can understand what is going on and why. Their work should be recognised formally.",
        "background": "Professor Chris Whitty, Sir Patrick Vallance, Jonathan Van Tam MBE amongst others should all be recognised and rewarded for their work in tackling the COVID 19 Pandemic in the UK at OBE or Knighthood level.",
