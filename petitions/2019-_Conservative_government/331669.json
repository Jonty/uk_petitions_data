        "additional_details": "I work for an events company supplying equipment and technical support for corporate events. I am in a consultation period for redundancy because my employer will be forced to close when the government demand contribution. My employer has \u00a30 income due to the government ban on events yet these companies are expected to contribute. The events industry is undoubtedly the hardest hit industry, there is simply not enough support for thousands of jobs and hundreds of companies that will disappear",
