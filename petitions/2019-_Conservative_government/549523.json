        "additional_details": "We need to equip or children and future leaders with a more proactive approach to Mental Health and Emotional Wellbeing.  Teaching them to understand the way that our emotions and beliefs work.  To better flourish in the world we are living in and societal changes.  This is not reactive and identifying mental health, by then it is too late for many.  We need to teach them to work with the natural composition and responses of the brain, to proactively carve positive conscious thought.",
        "background": "Following the government planning for all pupils to be taught about mental wellbeing, ensuring secondary pupils can spot the signs of common mental illnesses in themselves or others is not enough.  This is reactive and needs to be the psychology of the brain and a proactive Emotional Wealth stance.",
