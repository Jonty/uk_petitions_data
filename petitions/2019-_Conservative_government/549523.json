Teaching them to understand the way that our emotions and beliefs work.  To better flourish in the world we are living in and societal changes.  This is not reactive and identifying mental health, by then it is too late for many.  We need to teach them to work with the natural composition and responses of the brain, to proactively carve positive conscious thought.",

This is reactive and needs to be the psychology of the brain and a proactive Emotional Wealth stance.",
