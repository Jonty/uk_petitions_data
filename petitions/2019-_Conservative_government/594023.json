        "action": "Increase maximum sentences for voyeurism crimes involving a minor",
        "additional_details": "Currently, if an individual is found guilty of a voyeurism offence, the maximum custodial sentence is 2 years - regardless of any previous convictions or the age of the victim. This means that convicted child sex offenders, even those currently under and Sexual Harm Prevention Order can only receive a maximum 2 year sentence if committing a voyeurism offence involving a child. Voyeurism offences are hugely impactful and damaging to children yet the sentencing laws do not reflect this.",
        "background": "The law should be changed to allow judges to give a harsher custodial sentence to those guilty of committing a voyeurism crime against a minor, instead of the current 2 year maximum sentence that applies regardless of the victim\u2019s age.",
