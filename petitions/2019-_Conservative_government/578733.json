        "action": "Reform house buying legislation so either party cannot withdraw without penalty",
        "additional_details": "Our house has been off the market for 6 months from accepting the offer, we have appointments and paid solicitors, arrangement with removals companies, we started packing then the day before exchange our buyer pulls out because they changed their minds, no reason. My wife handed gave notice at work and we received the call later that day. We are financially out of pocket, emotionally drained and this will be repeated across the whole chain. There is very little impact for the party that withdraw",
        "background": "Stop people withdrawing from a house purchase / sell just before exchange and/or asking for a price reduction at the last minute as they know you have so much invested in the move. NZ and the USA have a fairer system for example.",
