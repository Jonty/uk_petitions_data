        "additional_details": "This new policy would aim to solve this issue by increasing awareness to children from a young age. Furthermore, it aims to spark conversations and critical thought in young people, which could lead to proactive change and a positive movement towards a greener future. This policy was implemented in schools both in New Zealand and Italy, due to an outcry by the younger demographic to be taught more about the climate crisis. We should follow suit, as a leading country in this fight.",
        "background": "Majority of students in the UK are unaware of the severity of the climate crisis, and the inevitable impact it will have on their future lives. This is due to its minimal coverage of the topic within the school curriculum.",
