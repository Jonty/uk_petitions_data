        "action": "Stop the health secretary from banning transgender women from female wards",
        "additional_details": "This is an outrageous attack on transgender rights in an attempt to distract from other issues in the UK. Discrimination against trans people in recent years has risen, not helped by the UK Government, and it has reached frightening levels. This will cause some trans people not to pursue essential health care, and it will only further hostility towards a minority which is already struggling on account of actions by groups like the Tories as well as members of the right wing media.",
        "background": "On October 3, UK health secretary Steve Barclay announced his plan to ban transgender women from NHS female wards. This is an attack on trans people that distracts from real issues facing womens' healthcare and the NHS generally. It's also been reported that there have been no widespread complaints.",
