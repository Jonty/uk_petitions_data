There were two paramedics but one stayed outside to limit the spread of this infection. How is this acceptable? They are putting their lives at risk with every call they make. I cannot imagine the fear they must feel every day. The very least the government can do is provide more rigorous protective clothing for them. It\u2019s not much to ask!",
