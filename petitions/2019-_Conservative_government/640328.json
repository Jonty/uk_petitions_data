        "additional_details": "With the recent committee findings against Mr Johnson ,establishing he had knowingly lied to parliament, his resignation honours are shown now transparent in their cronyism and self serving favour. Should any minister who was forced to resign due to withdrawal of the confidence of their own party, such as Johnson or Truss, have the opportunity to even submit a list of recommended honours? Given the turnover of PMs in recent years due to controversy should the tradition even continue?",
        "background": "The traditional PM resignation honours list in recent years has been utilised by ministers whose actions have made thier positions untenable. Resignations amidst removal of party support or threat of investigation dismissal should mean any honours they recommend are subject to further review",
