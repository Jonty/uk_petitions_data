        "additional_details": "The Covid and climate change crisis both arise from the economic activity of humankind. The effect of Covid is that there are no economies that are safe enough to underwrite a global recovery, and there has been no recent experience of bringing about a global economic recovery on such a scale. The economic problems will fall harder on smaller economies, at a great risk of social disruption and of warfare. Provincial political responses do not deal with this, and we need a global approach.",
        "background": "Government to request that the UN convenes a conference of the major economies, and as many others as they can, that confronts the challenges presented by Covid and the Climate crisis, and creates a shared response, and spreads the duties and consequences of these more fairly around the world",
