        "additional_details": "The UK is widely regarded as a leader in human rights and an example for others to emulate, however, going ahead with this plan shows support to a  government that has been credited with war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity by the UN Mapping report. This plan would not only stain the UK's human rights record but would also signify a huge blow to the Congolese people's plight for justice",
        "background": "The UK government has led the way in holding Russia accountable for the war crimes committed in Ukraine. The Government's \u00a3120m refugee plan would be an endorsement to the government of Rwanda which is responsible for atrocities in the East of Congo. Therefore, the UK Gov should reconsider its plan.",
