        "additional_details": "The UK lags way behind. \r\nThe EU has called for rear-facing seats to the age of 3 years but no action has been taken. This situation is compounded because the UK retail market does not supply a wide range of affordable rear-facing seats for babies and small children.\r\n\r\nThe Government should strengthen existing legislation to require the use of rear-facing car seats for all children aged 0-4 and encourage the UK retailers to offer a wider range of affordable rear-facing seats",
        "background": "UK legislation only requires a rear-facing car seat for children that weigh up to 9kg \u2013 approx. 9-10 months old. However, evidence has shown that a rear-facing seat can be five times safer and that all children weighing 18kg \u2013 approx. 4 years should remain rear facing to increase car safety.",
