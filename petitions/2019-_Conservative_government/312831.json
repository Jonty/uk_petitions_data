By the time, all the staff may be symptomatic and spread the infection to a wider aspect. The biggest support that we can receive at this moment is the PPE. Requesting to implement WHO guidelines for all staff with immediate effect.If not supplied, the impact will be more detrimental as we may lose more staff or their families, or patients who got the infection from staff.",

Infection is rapidly spreading through staff",
