        "additional_details": "The government is responsible for this underfunding and systemic racism present in the UK. It has become public knowledge, recently, that our taxes have been used to pay off slave owners, and yet nothing given to black communities to level the playing field and to set the historic injustice right.",
        "background": "Up until 2015, British taxes contributed to paying back a loan used to compensate slave owners for the \u201closs of human property\u201d. The full amount should be returned to under-funded black communities and charities. If necessary, the government should take out another loan for this important issue too.",
