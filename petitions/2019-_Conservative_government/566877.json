        "action": "Write-off student debt for students who are enrolled at university during covid.",
        "additional_details": "In September, students were encouraged into returning to uni by being promised a blend of online and face-to-face teaching which has not been delivered. We are paying rent and other costs on halls/houses that are of limited use leading many students to have to get part-time jobs putting themselves at risk. Campuses are shut meaning the facilities that we are also funding are out of use. In any other contractual situation for non-delivery of service reimbursement would be considered normal.",
        "background": "Students who are attending university during the 2020/21 academic year have been faced with inadequate teaching. This has taken a huge toll on their mental health due to lack of support and the burden of debt for a service that has not materialised.",
