        "additional_details": "Vitamin D deficiency is related mainly to people who are not exposed to enough sun and adversely affects people who are BAME, those who are older, housebound and those who cover their skin and these are precisely the people who are dying in this country from COVID-19.  PHE advice to advise supplementation is not helping as people remain deficient and at risk and access to supplements is always going to be harder for those who are also suffering from poverty as many of these groups are.",
        "background": "Vitamin D deficiency is extremely common amongst the population of the UK and reduced levels of vitamin d are associated with a  range of health problems.  There is also growing evidence that people with low vitamin D have worse outcomes with respiratory infections which may lead to more COVID death",
