        "additional_details": "Our closest secondary school is new, prior to this village was entitled to subsidised school bus' now there is no support. The school we have chosen is our other catchment school. \r\nS/Bus will cost \u00a3900pp pa. Cost of living has made this payment unaffordable. There is no support for 'middle earners' to their catchment schools. A household income of \u00a340k in LDN is not enough to live off, when mortgage payments are \u00a30000s, childcare, etc, yet receive no support. Make school transport more inclusive",
        "background": "School transport is unavoidable for most families. Funding for school transport is currently inadequate. Only a very small % of families qualify and only covers their 'closest school' it ignores other catchment schools and has no consideration for the individual pupils needs/wants from their school.",
