        "additional_details": "It is absolutely essential that students return to school; but it is just as essential that this does not pose a risk to teachers, who will then risk not only becoming ill themselves, but also making them potential 'virus spreaders'. This needs to be done urgently before the re-opening on March 8th to avoid a potentially very dangerous setback in the fight against Covid-19. It is essential that schools do not become the cause of a new spread of the virus - this can easily be prevented.",
        "background": "Ask Parliament to immediately put teaching staff Covid-19 vaccinations on priority to make the re-opening of schools safe for teachers, students, families, and the general population. We must stop a new rise in Covid-19 cases caused by opening schools and avoid causing more infections!",
