        "background": "I want the government to ban all free bets and advertising of any type of gambling.\r\nI think it\u2019s clear that gambling\u2019s always going to be around but I believe it\u2019s completely wrong to advertise gambling on so many platforms so often and constantly offer free bets to very vulnerable people.",
