        "additional_details": "We are due to get married on 20th June and our venue is unable to cover the cost of the postponement. As a result asking us to pay twice due to their insurance not covering the cost, it is also unlikely that our insurers will pay as a result of Covid-19 and if there are legislative changes it will make it even harder. Many wedding forums have thousands of couples worried about how their dream day can go ahead and after years of savings they cannot afford to do it again. A change is required during this time to help the millions of couples and their dream day celebrating their love.",
        "background": "Couples/venues faces huge losses as they are unable to cover the cost of weddings that are cancelled/postponed due to Covid-19 inc self isolation or social distancing. I urge the Government to permit insurers/venues to reimburse Couples/venues during Covid19 and save the \u00a310bln wedding industry.",
