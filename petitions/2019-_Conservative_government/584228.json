        "additional_details": "For over 40 years people travelling to North Cyprus have had to put up with disembarking in Turkey and changing planes. North Cyprus has been independent since 1983 and it hasn\u2019t changed. Not flying direct affects people in the UK wishing to travel there. Pressure from countries involved shouldn\u2019t be reasons why we cannot have direct flights to the TRNC. Regarding the Cyprus issue the North has done everything possible to come to a solution however they haven\u2019t been rewarded. Now is the time.",
        "background": "Allow for direct flights to Northern Cyprus from the UK. Ercan Airport (LCEN) currently serves as the primary hub for north Cyprus. Whilst the south benefits from direct flights the north can only offer flights with 1 to 2 stops.",
