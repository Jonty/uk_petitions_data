        "additional_details": "During the pandemic, people have shown remarkable resilience while their lives were turned upside down. While we have rightly celebrated the work our key workers have contributed, there are 66 million individual stories of dealing with the changes to our lives. We all deserve a moment to celebrate.\r\n\r\nThe government should declare a long weekend, loosen licensing restrictions on hospitality and retail for those days, let the people of Britain indulge a bit and catch up on all those lost moments.",
        "background": "Once a sufficient number of people have been vaccinated and new case numbers have dropped to a point for the government to end the last restrictions under the tiered system (\"return to normal\") there should be a weekend of celebration and thanksgiving for the nation to mark this final milestone.",
