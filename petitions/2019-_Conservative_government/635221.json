        "action": "Make Student Finance repayments tax deductible",
        "additional_details": "For example, a recent graduate earns \u00a330k annually with a student loan balance of \u00a350k at 5.4% interest rate. Presently, they must pay \u00a3243 p.a. (9% of income over \u00a327,295). If student finance repayments were tax-deductible, they could deduct \u00a3243 from their taxable income, saving approximately \u00a349 per year (20% basic tax rate).\r\n \r\nOver 30 years, they would save around \u00a31,500, which they could use for living expenses or savings, or to reduce their overall student loan balance.",
        "background": "A tax deduction for Student Finance repayments would ease graduates' financial burden. High-interest rates and long repayment periods make it harder than ever to live. Deducting repayments from taxable income would reduce yearly amounts owed, providing immediate relief and simplifying repayment.",
