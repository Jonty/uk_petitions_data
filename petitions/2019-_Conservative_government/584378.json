An annual season ticket is \u00a34,736, rising to \u00a35,620 if you want to include onward travel within London zones 1-6. However, if you buy a return ticket on the day, it is \u00a351.80, assuming rush-hour travel. Do that twice a week, 46 weeks a year, and the cost will be \u00a34,765 \u2013 even more than the full season ticket. Do it three times a week and it\u2019s a colossal \u00a37,148.\"",
        "background": "As COVID restrictions ease, most people will be wanting to work in the office part-time. This is important for both companies, and for individuals' mental health.\r\nThe current train ticketing schemes are not fair to people who travel to the office 2 or 3 days a week - which will be many of us, soon.",
