        "action": "Do not reduce access to free NHS dental treatment for new and expecting mums",
        "additional_details": "The government already recognises the need to provide additional dental support for pregnant women and those in the first year of motherhood by offering them free NHS dental care. This required support has however now effectively been reduced; dental issues normally routinely addressed in this period will in some cases now remain untreated beyond it. \r\n\r\nWe request that the current level of support is provided to those new and expecting mothers during the pandemic by allowing for an extension of time (corresponding to the period normal dental services have not been available) in which free dental care is available.",
        "background": "Due to policies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, new and expecting mums have had much reduced access to dental treatment, during what is probably one of the most demanding times for their dental health.",
