Currently, pharmacists must adhere to providing the exact brand, however, when there are shortages, this can mean that some people must go without the medicine that they need. Prescribing based on drug and not brand could help to prevent this.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to prevent clinicians from prescribing specific brands of medicine, so that prescriptions are for relevant drugs. This would mean that patients would be able access alternative medications if a brand-specific drug is out of stock.",
