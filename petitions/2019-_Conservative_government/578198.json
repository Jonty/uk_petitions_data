I did notice that at the end of last year the MPs awarded themselves a generous pay rise .I am vey angry that the NHS workers are only getting a 1% pay rise, they have worked to the point where they are exhausted and have been brought to their knees , A lot of NHS staff were off sick with stress,  we have all seen on TV that sadly some have died looking after others, not to forget they saved the PMs life. !!!!",
