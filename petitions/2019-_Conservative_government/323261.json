Pressing charges for domestic violence can be a traumatic and emotional process. As a victim, the prospect of having your name and personal details reported on in court can prove to be a further barrier on the path to seeking justice. Domestic abuse victims deserve a right to privacy, which is currently unsubstantiated under current law.",
