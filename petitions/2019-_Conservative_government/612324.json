        "additional_details": "After a month of war and intolerable suffering in Ukraine, peace talks have stalled. It appears the Russian Federation will not settle for less than Crimea and the Donbas, and that Ukraine will not agree. Indiscriminate bombing of cities may continue, and even increase, with the risk of a wider and even a nuclear war. We believe a ceasefire, followed by referendums to determine the will of the people, is a better way.",
        "background": "The UK is president of the Security Council for April. The people of Ukraine have the right of self-determination under the UN Charter. We want the Government to seek Council support for a ceasefire, to allow referendums throughout Ukraine, including Crimea and Donbas, on the wishes of the people.",
