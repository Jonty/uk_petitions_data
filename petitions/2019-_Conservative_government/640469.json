This could be even higher now, due to the general decline of religion across the UK.\r\n \r\nGiven the increasing proportion of people in the UK who are not religious, we want the Government to repeal all legislation that gives Christianity priority in the UK.\r\n",
        "background": "We want the Government to recognise the declining percentages of people who are religious across the UK, and completely break the links between church and state. This should include the priority given to Christianity in schools, and the placement of Bishops in the House of Lords.",
