Again once in hospital while in the Blue, respiratory area of Rotherham A&E All the staff had limited & certainly not fully protected with the PPE they should yet still unwaveringly treat me despite the risk. I\u2019m sure repeat at hospitals around the country.",
        "background": "Once this COVID-19 crisis is over, the UK Government should award our Ambulance Service & NHS staff with medalic recognition just as the military were award medalic recognition for other medical emergencies overseas in the past. The Government has rightly called this a War footing against COVID-19",
