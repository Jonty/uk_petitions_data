        "additional_details": "Issues such as the rising cost of living and the climbing TFL fares are contributing to a financially difficult academic year for trainee teachers. Yes, this Bursary is meant to be an incentive to go into English teaching however, had we been aware of the country's economic issues that would develop our plans may have changed. We feel that financial support for the English PGCE 2022-23 is a necessity to avoid unreasonable stress being placed on the new wave of English teachers.",
        "background": "The current English PGCE cohort is lacking serious financial support from the Government as they train in these increasingly dire economic conditions. We ask the Government to look at the requirements for the PGCE course and address the clear need for financial support outside of the SLC.",
