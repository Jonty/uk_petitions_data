        "additional_details": "I have a 7 year old brother with autism, he\u2019s not like other children his age, he thinks and acts differently due to being autistic. This has made me want to be able to change the way people learn about disabilities and have them learn from a young age. In secondary school there was a boy in my year with Aspergers and he got bullied nearly everyday of his secondary school life because he was different. If more people are aware of disabilities from a young age, bullying could be prevented. Thank you",
        "background": "I\u2019d like for it to be made mandatory that schools (preferably key stages 1 ,2 and maybe 3) have one hour a week to teach children about different disabilities. This could help broaden their understanding on why some people are different and potentially prevent bullying due to lack of understanding.",
