        "additional_details": "Over the course of the Covid-19 pandemic, schools have faced unprecedented disruption to education, in the form of lockdowns and home-learning. Face coverings can limit communication between students and staff, and we believe have had a negative effect on student's learning up and down the country. As the country moves away from this troubling period, it is now necessary for the government to ban schools from mandating face coverings on site.",
        "background": "Many schools are reintroducing mandatory face coverings. This petition is calling on the government to ban mandatory face coverings in schools in order allow students and teachers to communicate better.",
