        "action": "To go forward with the plans for Transgender Self-Identification in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Trans people are affected deeply by the long waiting lists required for them to medically transition. All trans people would benefit greatly from being able to identify as their preferred gender, this includes those who are Non-Binary and Gender Non-Conforming. \r\n\r\nThe choice to self identify would relieve the stress caused by long waiting lists and therefore decrease the severity of mental health issues and social marginalisation. Allowing to self-identify does not require medical intervention.",
        "background": "It was promised by the Conservative Party to reform the Gender Recognition Act two years ago and there has now been a decision to scrap this. This petition is to encourage the government to rethink this decision and instead allow for the plans of self identification through court to go through.",
