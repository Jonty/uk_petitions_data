        "additional_details": "Many people who entered the UK legally have experienced issues after the Home office curtailed thousands of students visas because of English Language courses.\r\n \r\nLack of support and other available options mean many have overstayed without the opportunity to complete their studies.\r\n \r\nMany of these are skilled people who could fill vacancies in short list occupations.\r\n \r\nMaking them eligible to get a work permit would give them the opportunity to contribute to the UK's economy.\r\n",
        "background": "The Government should make work permits in the short list occupations leading to settlement available to anyone who entered the UK legally and has been residing here from over 10 years. This could be particularly valuable to people who have faced repeated visa curtailment.",
