        "additional_details": "The Winter time would seem to be of a shorter duration if it was not dark so early in the afternoon. \r\nThis will mean the earliest darkness would be aproximately 5.00pm and not 4.00pm. \r\nThe cold and dark winter time would be less miserable during the worst period in early to mid December.  \r\nThe evenings would also get lighter a month earlier. \r\nThe advantage of having an hour extra light in the afternoon during  the Winter period would easily outway the summer evening still being light at 10pm.",
        "background": "I would like the government to change the regulations so that we can keep the time set at British Summer Time (GMT +1) always.  No longer turn the clocks back to Greenwich mean time in October or any time.  Make this change to be a permanent change.",
