        "additional_details": "There have been too many instances where the accused have had their names tarnished, livelihoods ruined and reputations destroyed, even though they have received \u2018Not Guilty\u2019 verdicts. With media outlets reporting names of the accused, a stigma is immediately attached to the defendant which is extremely difficult to eradicate, regardless of the outcome of the verdict. This leads to trauma, depression and life-changing circumstances for those who have been falsely accused.",
        "background": "I put it forward that media outlets should not be able to report the names of the accused in sexual offence cases prior to, or during any sexual offence trials. Names should only be reported in the media if \u2018Guilty\u2019 verdicts are returned.",
