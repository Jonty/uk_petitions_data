        "additional_details": "Government is concerned at the cost of creating new generation systems, but central generators need additional infrastructure to distribute the energyu generated.\r\nIf a large number of homes generated that energy from a distributed PV infrasturucture (i.e. 1,000s of homes), no additional would be needed.\r\nA change to the planning rules would be very cheap to do, but PV on the 1m homes would add 4 million Megawatts anually (more that 10MW a day) ... for (effectively) nothing. It is a NO BRAINER.",
        "background": "We need to generate more renewable electricity and this is a way to do it that will be cheap, quick and done at minimal cost.\r\nIf every new built house had 4KW of Solar PV and an 8KWh battery, this would add only \u00a35,000 to the purchse price of the house which the owner will get back in free energy",
