This ridiculous package announced, is forcing debt on people and actually makes no difference to their gas and electricity bill. I want the Government tool put their heads together and come up with a \"real\" plan. Not one that benefits the oil companies.",

I want them to explain why the public must be punished whilst oil companies make billions in profit.",
