        "additional_details": "In times of war(Covid), if the government decides to not train new recruits(Paramedics) in how to deal with this war due to pressure, resources, and priority; when the army is defeated or a new pandemic arrises and new recruits must join the battle, they'll be ill-equipped and will loose; causing more pressure, fewer resources and ultimately defeat. It's the government's job to think ahead strategically to ensure student paramedics experience this pandemic to learn and prevent future pandemics.",

When a pandemic happens and we're brushed aside, it will mean the next generation will be ill-equipped to handle another pandemic. Training during hard times is the best way to prevent another hard time.",
