This will\u2026\r\n\u25cf Prevent them from continuing to steal the identities of others, including prime targets like the elderly and vulnerable\r\n\u25cf Put a stop to persistent fraud of their existing victims\r\n\u25cf Reduce the chances of financial hardship on victims and the unnecessary impact on their health\r\n\u25cf Rightfully seek proper justice for victims",

It is considered a crime against the company to whom the stolen identity has been given for sourcing credit, and as they rarely report it, this leaves the fraudster free to continue without charge.",
