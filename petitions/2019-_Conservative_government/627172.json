        "additional_details": "Since Covid many Animal Rescues Non-Profit Charities have seen a significant drop in public donations, as many members of the public can no longer afford to donate. Now we are seeing a huge increase in the need for places for sick, injured and abandoned animals as people can no longer care for them and are signing them over to animal rescues. It is hugely expensive to care for sick animals. Many rescues have closed due to lack of funds. Non-Profit Animal Rescues provide an important service. They need help now!",
        "background": "I would like the UK Government to provide financial assistance to Non-Profit Animal Rescue Charities. Currently most charities rely on grants and donations, which they have to apply for and can be difficult to get because so many charities chase these small grants.",
