        "additional_details": "Autism is a spectrum disorder. It is often said that we are all on the spectrum. The spectrum ranges from entirely non-verbal with severe learning difficulties to highly functioning, successful individuals. Many people, particularly women, can go their entire lives without being diagnosed. Therefore it is almost certain that there are people with autism already serving in the forces. In 2016 just 16% of adults with autism were in full-time employment.",
        "background": "Allow people on the autistic spectrum to be given the opportunity to prove that their diagnosis is mild and non-disabling. Many people with autism are perfectly capable and not all exhibit the typical traits associated with autism that may be considered disabling.",
