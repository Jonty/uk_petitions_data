        "additional_details": "The UK Government is the World's biggest producer and exporter of Medicinal Cannabis for medicinal and scientific use. the UK Government has issued licences to private companies to legally grow cannabis in this country, yet GP's can only prescribe to a limited amount of patients with very serious conditions. the legalisation of Medicinal Cannabis in the UK, could be properly regulated and have many health benefits over many manufactured pharmaceutical medications and could be cheaper to supply.",
        "background": "It is now time that Parliament has a serious discussion and review into the use of Medicinal Cannabis as medication and pain relief, so that GP's  can prescribe it legally to those with Neurological, Terminal and Muscular conditions and that GP's, patients and other relevant groups are consulted.",

If you want the Government to conduct a review of arrangements for the prescription of medical cannabis, we couldn't accept your petition if it sought to prejudge the outcome of that review."
