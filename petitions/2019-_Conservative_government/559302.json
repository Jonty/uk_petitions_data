        "additional_details": "The government should re-instate the 'Everyone In' scheme. The threat of becoming seriously unwell is even higher now with homeless people out on the streets in sub zero temperatures. People deserve to be safe. It is a basic human right. Nobody should be put at increased risk of contracting COVID 19. Nobody should become very unwell or die from COVID, just because they do not have a fixed abode.",
        "background": "In the first lockdown, homeless people were provided with accommodation by the government in a scheme \"Everyone In\". This scheme should also be provided during the second lockdown, and in every subsequent lockdown in the future. We must provide accommodation for homeless people!",
