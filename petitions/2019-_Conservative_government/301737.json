Type 2 diabetes \u2013 which people who are obese are at a high risk of developing \u2013 accounts for 1/10 of the annual NHS spend.\r\n \r\nWhilst sugar alone isn\u2019t the only factor, it is a significant factor. Current labels don\u2019t make it easy enough for everyone to understand how much sugar a product contains. By requiring a visual representation of sugar content children and adults should be able to understand far clearer and therefore make better choices. Hopefully this will see a decline in obesity and related health issues including type 2 diabetes and other chronic illnesses.",
