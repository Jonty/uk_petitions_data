        "additional_details": "I understand that there needs to be an age restriction to sell or handle certain items, but 16-17 year olds should not be treated by employment law, or with regards to minimum wages. Employment law and minimum wages should be reformed so that 16-17 year olds are treated the same as 18 year olds.",
        "background": "At 16 years of age you can legally have sex, start a family, leave home and leave school, but current laws mean 16-17 year olds are paid less and restricted in their employment opportunities. I want the employment opportunities for 16-17 year olds to be equalised with those of 18 year olds.",
