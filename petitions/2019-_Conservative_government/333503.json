        "additional_details": "I represent a campaign group of professionals, carers, and ECT patients. There is no agreed consensus supporting its use, and some patients have been misinformed about the risks. \r\n\r\nMonitoring for adverse effects can be ineffective, reliable information on outcomes and follow-up is limited, and some ECT clinics are unaccredited. ECT patients have been denied redress for damage, and rehabilitation for their impairments. \r\n\r\nWe need a review to hear their voices, and give them acknowledgement and justice.",
        "background": "We urgently need an independent Cumberlege-style review into the practice of ECT. ECT causes epileptic seizures, and is given to about 2,500 people a year. Significant numbers are left with irreversible memory loss and brain damage. I am a former paediatrician, unable to work since receiving ECT.",
