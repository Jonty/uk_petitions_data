        "additional_details": "Families working full time on minimum wage are scraping by on household incomes of less than \u00a320,000 a year and yet those very families cannot afford to fund childcare to enable their children access to education in the same way as those on benefits. Thousands of children will not recieve early years education until they turn 3 because parents can't afford it and this is simply unfair. Working parents who contribute to the tax system and economy should be rewarded, not punished.",
        "background": "I would be extremely grateful if the government could consider making funding for 2 year olds available to all working parents who work a minimum of 15 hours per week.",
