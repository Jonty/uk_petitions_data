It is also unclear how it applies to murderers who dismember a body and say the body parts have been put in different sites or in a place they can never be found.\r\n \r\nWe want the Government to prevent murderers from being granted parole or moved to an open prison, where the victim's remains are not found.",

We want a new law - Chantel's law - with mandatory 40 year sentences for murder when a victim's remains are not found, with no parole or possibility of time in an open prison.",
