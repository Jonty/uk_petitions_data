        "additional_details": "Workers in England and Wales get eight bank holidays a year, fewer than any other European Union country and lagging far behind the bloc\u2019s average. Flying Ant Day will be a step closer to equality with our Continental Cousins. Also this will bring people together outdoors getting fresh air and exercise intern helping with people their mental health.\r\n\r\nFlying Ant Day will be decided by the first sighting of a flying ant in this British summer and will take that day going forth.",
        "background": "Every summer a wonderful spectacle of nature takes place from within the patios, driveways and other areas ants have toiled to create their nests. Recognising this magical day as an official Bank Holiday will allow families of hard working Brits to come together and enjoy this special event.",
