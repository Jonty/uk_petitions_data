In 2011, the Government found that black students had the lowest predicted grade accuracy at 39.1% \r\n\r\nBAME students have to prove themselves in their final exam, because of this bias and inequality that appears in the education system. The Government must establish why these racial disparities occur, and implement reforms to ensure that students of all races have equal opportunities for academic success.",
