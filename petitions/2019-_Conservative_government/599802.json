        "additional_details": "It is a sign of ultimate disrespect and callousness that no UK Government since the massacre has had the basic human decency to apologise for the slaughter and accept the viciousness of British Indian rule. The Raj looted India for its riches, and it used its people for its means.",
        "background": "The UK Government is yet to issue a formal heartfelt apology for the Jallianwala Bagh atrocity perpetrated under British Indian rule and the brutal colonialism it signified. Given that there are many Indians who have died for the UK and many who now live and work here, it is a downright afront.",
