        "action": "An urgent review in to funding crisis & impact of Ofsted on staff wellbeing.",
        "additional_details": "Covid/cost of living crisis has had a significant impact on wellbeing of children/staff/families. Schools are seeing more special needs/mental health issues & dealing with increasingly challenging behaviour. Support services cannot cope with level of need & many children are in wrong setting due to lack of available special needs places; challenges are compounded by high stakes accountability, unfunded pay-rises & deficit budgets. Situation is unacceptable to all & retention crisis is imminent.",
        "background": "The Govt needs to be fully aware of hugely significant challenges facing schools at the moment. A review of current funding arrangements & a new plan for the future of education is needed as a matter of urgency. A way of securing accountability, more supportive & effective than Ofsted, is essential.",
