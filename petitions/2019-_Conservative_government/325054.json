        "action": "Add different cultures to the school curriculum for all children to be educated.",
        "additional_details": "For years travellers and gypsies have been abused for their culture and a lot of that could change if children were educated, hate crimes can not be ignored, prejudice can not be ignored just because of  a cultural way of living, same as black people shouldn't for the colour of their skin or how they have their hair. Education is needed to allow future generations to stop the spread of hate , they in turn can educate the older generations at home.",
        "background": "As a descended of romani gypsies and a mum of 2 mixed race children it's our duty to include education of a variety of different race and cultures that gives a true reflection of the people that live in the uk, it would also erase some of the prejudice that comes from lack of education",
