        "additional_details": "The protective clothing requirements have been downgraded by Public Health England. Evidence to support this is limited by the lack of available data. There is a big shortage of PPE equipment, particularly FFP3 masks and visors.\r\n\r\nI, a doctor working in the NHS, am very worried. We want to do all we can to help but if we do not have the correct protective equipment we put ourselves, our families, and crucially other patients that may not yet be infected with COVID-19 at risk.",
        "background": "Hospital staff caring for those with COVID-19 are placing themselves and other patients at risk due to a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE). I would like to encourage Boris to ask UK industry to help by making kit, particularly FFP3 masks, to protect frontline NHS health workers.",
