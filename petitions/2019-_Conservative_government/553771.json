People are losing their jobs, unable to see family, KILLING THEMSELVES. The Uk's response to this pandemic has had a worse effect on people dying from poor mental health than it has saving lives from covid19. We need to move on. We need to return to normal! Students are taking drugs out of boredom and dying. The elderly are dying alone. This is not okay.",
        "background": "Stop rules regarding Covid19. We are sacrificing the mental health of our young people and our economic environment for the people who sadly wouldn't live to see the negative effects anyway.  Respect social distancing in essential areas (e.g supermarkets) for those that are shielding.",
