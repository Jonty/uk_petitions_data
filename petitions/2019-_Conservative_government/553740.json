        "additional_details": "This is imperative in order to allow this to prevent loneliness, people dying alone and the overwhelming mental health and emotional impact. Window visits are not practical for everyone and each person is an individual. Where is person centred care in all of this? Dignity and peoples rights. It is probably safer to visit a care home with PPE than stand in a pub or supermarket at present.",
        "background": "The government has imposed strict visiting guidelines on care homes with some families not having seen/or hugged their loved ones for several months. Measures must be put in place to allow positive risk taking, ie using PPE, booked slots, isolated rooms, deep cleans, temperature checks.",
