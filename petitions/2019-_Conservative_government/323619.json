        "action": "Make Circumcision Illegal For Under 16s",
        "additional_details": "It is barbaric that genital mutilation of under 16s is permitted by law. Though it may be performed for religious or recreational reasons, a child cannot possibly be aware of how circumcision will affect them for their entire lives. The UK Government surely recognises informed consent and bodily autonomy, as abortion is not illegal. The same principle should be applied here, as the informed decision to be circumcised should be made only by the subject, not by the subject's parents.",
        "background": "The government should step in to ensure the bodily autonomy of under 16s by banning circumcision, unless deemed medically necessary. Children and juveniles are not mature enough to make many important decisions, circumcision included.",
