        "additional_details": "The PASS scheme that was introduced to combat age verification issues is not working; a lot of businesses are not recognising that PASS ID cards are a valid form of photo ID.\r\n\r\nRelying on driving licenses and passports for this verification is not a suitable alternative, as some citizens cannot get either (some due to legal restrictions, others due to their cost).\r\n\r\nIt would be beneficial if we could have a Government photo ID card that all businesses must recognise legally, for proof of age.",
        "background": "While we have such things as the PASS scheme, these forms of ID are not generally recognised by businesses, due to the lack of awareness or training.\r\n\r\nI propose the Government introduce a government photo ID card for age verification purposes that has to be recognised by all businesses, by law.",
