        "additional_details": "According to the recent data from the National Crime Agency, Black people were 14 percent of all missing people in England and Wales between 2019 and 2020. With Black Men missing more frequently (14%) than Black Women (10%). This is over 4 times the relative population even though Black/African/Caribbean/Black British groups are 3% of the total population. In London, during 2019 and 2020, Black people accounted for 36 percent of missing people. An investigation needs to be done to learn why.",
        "background": "The government needs to conduct a public inquiry to investigate why missing person cases are disproportionately impacting Black communities, who is responsible for the resource allocation on cases, and what can be done to reduce rates within Black/African/Caribbean/Black British communities.",
