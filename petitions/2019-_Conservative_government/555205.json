We've seen family celebrations at Eid, amongst others, cancelled and it looks likely Christmas will be the same. This proposed bank holiday would help families and friends of all faiths and none to come together to celebrate. We've chosen the longest day of the year as it provides for the most opportunities to be outdoors in a COVID19 safe way",
