        "action": "Make all unwanted online sexual communication a criminal offence",
        "additional_details": "The proposed cyberflashing offence requires an offender to have intended to cause distress or obtain sexual gratification, which may be difficult to prove.\r\n \r\nInstead we want a wider offence to cover all unwanted online sexual messages, including stalking, solicitation of sexual favours & sexting without mutual consent.\r\n \r\nUK laws regarding sexual offences were written in a pre-internet time & the Government has a responsibility to update it for our current time. Many acts are illegal in person, but more needs to be done to protect people online.",
        "background": "The UK Government plan to criminalise cyber flashing. This does not protect other victims who receive unwanted sexual communications online. It is far too common and needs to be met with serious consequences, such as fine, custodial sentences, or being registered as a sex offender.",
