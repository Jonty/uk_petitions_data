        "action": "Change restrictions on schools control on students appearance.",
        "additional_details": "To have a school be able to dictate a childs hair colour or facial appearance is not reasonable or practical for this day and age. It should be a parents job to dictate what the child can do with their appearance, not the school. If changing a childs hair/makeup helps their self confidence, they should be able to do so. To restrict particular colours and allow others is illogical and unfair. Students should be able to express themselves with their looks, providing it doesn't cause a safety risk.",
        "background": "I would like to get the restrictions that schools have over childrens appearances such as hair colour/makeup removed, so a child and their parents can decide what they look like, and not the educational setting. Particuarly in secondary schools.",
