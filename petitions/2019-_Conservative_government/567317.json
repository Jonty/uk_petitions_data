        "additional_details": "A majority of students have not been into university once this academic year, with all lessons being online. Minimal help or support outside of these online lessons has been provided and yet us university students are still expected to produce the same quality of work as the years before and still do exams. \r\nUniversities have always said online learning isn\u2019t as good as actually going in to learn, so why are we expected to do the same exams and assignments without proper education and resources.",
        "background": "Ensure that all universities implement a no detriment policy.\r\n Provide the same help that GCSE students and Alevel students were planned to have, for example not putting as many topics in exams. \r\nProvide more support in terms of education and also mental health.",
