        "additional_details": "Include and fund access to specialist support such as counselling, medical and benefits advice.\r\n \r\nAt 24/4/2023 4,914 claims referencing the C19 vaccines have been made to the VDPS. 561 have waited over 12 months for an outcome. In 2019, 2020 only 1 claim failed the 60% disability criteria when causation was accepted. This has risen to 100 since November 21. The award of 120,00 can fail to take full account of long-term care needs or loss of income. We believe people who are severely disabled as a result of a vaccination also do not receive enough support during or after the process.\r\n \r\nUrgent reform is needed to better support those harmed and to restore confidence in the scheme.\r\n",
        "background": "Ensure claims do not take longer than 8 months to process.\r\n \r\nReplace the 60% disability requirement with a tiered system.\r\n \r\nEnable payments of more than \u00a3120,000.\r\n",
