        "additional_details": "As schools in the uk are shutting on Friday 20th March , year 12 students will be at a an extreme disadvantage and will practically have to self teach themselves for what\u2019s looking like until the start of year 13 in September. The resources that we will be given will be inadequate for our learning, due to how unpredictable this pandemic was, meaning schools have been rushed and are unprepared. Most sixth forms do not all students to sit exams if they miss 20% of the year, we will be missing 25%.",
        "background": "We want the exam spec to be reduced. This can be done by cutting the 3 papers per subject to 2 papers per subject, which will give schools enough time to cover 2 papers worth of content in class as there is virtually no where near enough time to cover 3 papers face to face with students and teachers",
