None of the requests above hinder the ability of the government to fight the virus in the short/medium term.\r\n\r\nThere is however a danger inherent in the open ended, large scale removal of civil liberties, such as restrictions on travel or election postponement. These measures provide oversight and ensure that civil liberty restrictions don't form part of the long term strategy for dealing with Corona Virus.",
