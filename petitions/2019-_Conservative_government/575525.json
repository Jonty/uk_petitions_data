This would put more trust in companies and financial institutions, and give people more choice in a fast moving worls. For example, someone buys a top or computer part and finds that the top does not fit or the part is faulty or wrong. When they take them back and get a refund - they have to wait DAYS. This blocks them from buying another top or PC part.",

When we pay for goods or services this is done INSTANTLY, yet when we ask for a refund from any company, we have to wait days and in some cases WEEKS. This is not on in this day and age.",
