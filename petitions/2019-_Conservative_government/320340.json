        "action": "Permanently move the May Day bank holiday Monday to the first Friday in May.",
        "additional_details": "An unfair balance with BHs on a Mon for business, daily workers etc-a Fri would help to redress this. Lost productivity on Fri- schools & businesses-a Fri BH would alleviate this. More useful time for travel etc before a weekend event eg wedding, than a Mon. A Fri BH seems more indulgent than a Mon which delays the inevitable. A proper 'shut down' day for as many as possible, especially key workers, to enjoy with their f & f would be a special way to remember their contributions made in 2020.",
        "background": "Permanently move the May Day bank holiday Monday to the first Friday in May, as we have done this year for VE day, but for the day to be in honour of all key workers and for as many shops and services as possible to close for people to enjoy a proper day off with their friends and families.",
