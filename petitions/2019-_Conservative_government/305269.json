        "additional_details": "Many of us are on low to no incomes. Claiming benefits is too little too late, too bureaucratic, and will not assist the many self employed and those in zero hour or gig economy work. Covid 19 is now reducing many people's income to zero. Council Tax is high and is a monstrous burden on the poor, of which the numbers are now increasing exponentially as the measures to combat the virus increase.",
        "background": "I want the government to suspend Council Tax demands and the obligation to pay during the Covid 19 crisis by making local councils grant a \"holiday\" on payments. I want government to pay for local authority lost revenue arising from a suspension.",
