        "additional_details": "Students have faced the unfair misfortune of disruption and uncertainty. Students in year 11 and 13 have missed 6 months of their education yet are expected to take exams amongst the turmoil of a pandemic. Students have spread the virus to new heights and the situation since the last debate has changed. Why should 2020 students who missed 2 months of school have the fairness of TAGs yet 2021students who missed 6 months and isolation periods since September don't? Bring fairness across the union!",

Provide guidance and assurance to students in year 11 and 13 (exam year) set to take their GCSEs/A-levels/AS levels. Cancel exams for 2021 and award grades through teacher assessment and predictions based off 2020 guidance - TAGs.",
