        "additional_details": "AI is being used to generate images of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) that can then be distributed. We are concerned this poses a significant threat to the safety and well-being of children. I think new legislation is urgently needed to prevent this exploitation, and that clear laws and penalties for tech companies are essential to hold them accountable. Collaboration with stakeholders may help to develop effective detection and removal systems. Funding research into the impact of AI-generated CSAM could help develop informed policy and intervention strategies.",
        "background": "We want the Government to enact laws on AI image generation to prevent creation of sexually explicit material involving minors. Mandate penalties for non-compliance, in order to incentivise investment in detection systems. We think the Government should also fund impact research.",
