        "additional_details": "Men are usually referred to as Mr. (master is the equivalent of Miss but very rarely used). I am asking the government to align for women and have one title e.g. just \"Ms.\" or have a gender neutral title. It is unfair on women to be denoted through their marital status and this type of practice is not conducive to eradicating sexism and ensuring fair and balanced treatment of all genders. I am therefore asking that women no longer indicate marital status by default in the title.",
        "background": "In this day and age:\r\n- Why do I have the question of \"Is it Miss or Mrs?\". Men don't get this question and I find it intrusive.\r\n- When women are not asked this question and receive correspondences they are referred to as Ms. (which also implies divorced). Again, men do not have this.",
