        "additional_details": "Being inpatient, for mental health reasons, we already feel alienated from society and many of us where holding onto Christmas relaxation of rules, even one day. I myself, being under section 3 can not go against medical advice and have spent the last 4 years in hospital with anorexia and BPD, also those not sectioned could then be sectioned should they try to leave to see a loved one. I for one was holding onto this period to see family and staff also hoped we could see even one person.",

It is integral to recovery, many of us have been in lockdown since March and/or not even left the hospital grounds this year. Why are we different to care home residents",
