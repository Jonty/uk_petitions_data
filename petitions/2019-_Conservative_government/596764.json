I also have realised that other schools in my area do not seem to have this rule in place but for some reason the governors of my school decided they didn\u2019t like that and I obviously don\u2019t agree with them",
        "background": "At my school (Wilmslow high school,Cheshire)  boys are not allowed to wear earrings  but girls are I find this very unfair and could be classed as sexism in this modern age I didn\u2019t think rules like this were still in place until I got my ear pierced over the summer.",
