        "additional_details": "It's not just sites that sex workers use to advertise that could be affected, but also screening sites sex workers use to keep safe, such as National Ugly Mugs. \r\n \r\nEvidence tells us that in the wake of FOSTA-SESTA being enacted in the US in 2018, sex workers faced increased violence, meanwhile trafficking has not been reduced. We fear the same could happen here if sex work offences are included in the list of priority offences in the Online Safety Bill.",
        "background": "If offences relating to adult prostitution are included as 'Priority offences' in the Online Safety Bill, this could create significant new challenges for sex workers who advertise online. This could mean more sex workers enter dangerous and exploitative conditions in brothels or on streets.",
