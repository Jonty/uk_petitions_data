        "additional_details": "International students are one of the most negatively impacted due to this global catastrophe. From UCU strikes to severe disruption in their education, the current batch has been severely impacted, hampering their overall mental, emotional and financial well-being. Graduating students seem unable to secure any form of meaningful job or work experience. Many have lost existing job offers. The grant of this extension would be hugely welcome and most appreciated during this global crisis.",
