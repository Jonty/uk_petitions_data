        "additional_details": "UK voter turnout has not reach 90% our nations history, with voting in the last two decades not reaching even 70%.\r\nAustralia which has had compulsory voting for all eligible citizens since 1984 has seen vast improvement with the 2019 federal elections seeing 92% voter turnout.\r\nWith voter apathy becoming an ever increasing phenomenon, radical steps need to be taken to ensure democracy is upheld and that citizens believe that their government represents them.",
        "background": "We want the government to implement compulsory voting laws in the same vein as are found in Australia. This means that anyone eligible to vote who does not vote without adequate reasoning will be subject to a penalty. Voting is the most important part of democracy and yet more than 30% aren't voting",
