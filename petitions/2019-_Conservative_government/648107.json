        "additional_details": "As a passionate dog lover and advocate for the XL Bully breed, I am deeply concerned about the upcoming ban on these dogs. These animals are often misunderstood and unfairly targeted due to their size and physical characteristics, despite being loyal, loving pets. The proposed ban will not only affect these dogs but also their owners who may struggle with the financial implications of compliance.",
        "background": "To help owners comply with this new law without causing undue financial stress, I propose that all XL Bullies & their 'types' should be eligible for free neutering/spaying and microchipping services nationwide regardless of the owner's income.",
