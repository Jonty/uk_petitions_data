        "additional_details": "Sepsis kills more than breast, bowel and prostate cancer combined. The UK Sepsis Trust has said that that earlier identification and treatment could save thousands of lives per year.\r\n \r\nWe believe the UK\u2019s record in dealing with sepsis is appalling and historically we have been far from one of the best performing countries in Europe when it comes to saving patients with sepsis.\r\n \r\nSome patients are more at risk of contracting sepsis i.e after surgery or medical procedures. My husband and two friends died of sepsis and it is imperative that this horrible condition is diagnosed and treated immediately on its onset in order to reduce unnecessary deaths from this.",
        "background": "We want the Government to review recognition, diagnosis and treatment of sepsis by the NHS. According to the UK Sepsis Trust there are around 48,000 deaths per year from sepsis in the UK and nearly 80,000 people each year who suffer life-changing after effects.",
