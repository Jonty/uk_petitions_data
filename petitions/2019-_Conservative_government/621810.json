        "additional_details": "Euthanasia and assisted dying are legal in other countries that accept the right for people who are terminally ill or living with chronic conditions to choose to end their life. This is humane and kind. This approach should be available to those in this country who feel they don\u2019t want to continue with their life, for whatever reason, including where they are struggling with mental health issues.",
        "background": "The Government should consider legalising euthanasia. A person should have a right to decide on whether or not they continue to live. This is often framed about giving choice to the terminally ill, but this right to choose shouldn't be something only available to people in that situation.",
