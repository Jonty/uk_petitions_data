        "additional_details": "Now that the clapping has stopped, let us raise awareness  of the low levels of pay received by our nurses and care workers.\r\nTo become a nurse in the UK you need a degree in nursing and you must be registered with the NMC. Training usually takes a min of 3 years.\r\nLets recognise the huge sacrifices they make ever day and over the course of this horrible pandemic where they have been literally putting their own lives on the line.\r\n",
        "background": "Give both nurses and carers a substantial pay rise to keep up with the rest of society, these professions have been under valued for far to long. We finally need to recognise the people that care for us when we need them, regardless of the situation or what they may have to face.",
