It is not fair that these people will be penalised just for working for themselves.  Rishi Sunak said he would always do whatever it takes for the people of this country during this crisis and if this scheme is not extended it will be a massive letdown. To not extend the scheme would definitely not be \"doing what it takes\". Do not let the self employed down.",
