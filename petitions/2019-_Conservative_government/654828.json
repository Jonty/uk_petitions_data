We also want it to be made mandatory for any convicted person to inform the courts or police of any change in their address, with random checks to be carried out at any property they reside at.",

Animal abusers exploit, neglect, harm and kill animals and we do not think the laws on this are tough enough. Animal abusers can currently be given suspended sentences, small fines or temporary bans on owning animals.",
