        "action": "Reform the SEND process within UK schools to help more children",
        "additional_details": "Unfortunately the increase in demand for support has caused failings in many counties across the UK to comply with the regulations. SEND children are suffering because of this. Legal deadlines are not being met by local authorities, with no accountability for this, yet parents face immediate rejections if they are 1 day late with paperwork. Educate Council officials and staff properly on SEN and believe families, they know their children best. Support children before it\u2019s too late.",
        "background": "Reform the EHC plan process ensuring children with disabilities are treated fairly and equally, and the end result is AN EDUCATION THEY CAN THRIVE IN. We demand a system that holds both local authorities and the Government accountable should they fail their own standards and criteria.",
