        "additional_details": "As a parent of two children due to go into years 1 and 6 in September 2020 I am very concerned about the effect the extended disruption to their formal education will have on their SATS results. As the 2020 SATS have not gone ahead due to Covid19 and the likely unreliable results the next sets of results will produce now seems the perfect time to review their effectiveness and agree to scrap these unnecessary and stressful primary school tests.",
        "background": "Following the lengthy disruption of schooling for primary children this spring and the likely educational disruption which they will continue to face for some months, it is not fair or appropriate for them to be put through the SATS tests in years 1 and 6",
