        "additional_details": "Plainly advertising the amount of calories in food to promote healthy choices can and will be detrimental to the mental health of many. Some people are battling eating disorders, where they are trying to stop calorie watching, and this easily accessible information will make it harder for them to eat out and combat their struggle. This policy could also spark eating disorders in many, as the constant exposure to calorie counting could make some obsessive.",
        "background": "Recently, the Government have released a Government Policy Paper, detailing what they are going to do to tackle obesity. However, one of the steps in this plan is to add calories next to meals in menus. We are asking that the Government removes this step of the policy, as it can and will be harmful.",
