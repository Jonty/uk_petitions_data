        "additional_details": "Yet so much is forgotten and left out which leads to much of the conscious and subconscious divide seen in recent times.\r\n\r\nOne powerful way to change this is through education. Let us lead by example and highlight Britains historical relationship with common descent, culture, religion, language and race across the world. By reminding ourselves of our identity as a nation we can better explain why Britain is the way it is today and create unity rather than the divide we are seeing in recent times.",

And there\u2019s none more relevant during recent events than race.\r\n\r\nBritain prides itself on its prolific history.",
