        "action": "Change taxation law encouraging UK foreign investment & end the recession",
        "additional_details": "In the week of the mini budget the Bank of England raised interest rates. Chancellor Karteng lowered corporation tax & raised traders bonuses cap. Foreign investors poured billions into the UK getting more interest & paying less tax. A $0.01 rise a week is great. After this sterling grew by $0.01/day! Sadly on 14th Oct 22 the Japanese Yen collapsed & they had to cancel the above or we'd go bust. A further lowering of such taxes would encourage more foreign investment & help end the recession.",
        "background": "Currently corporation tax for foreign investors is 20%. This should be lowered to 10% to encourage investors to invest in the UK. At the lockdown start \u00a31= $1.42. The economy shrunk due to covid and by Sept 22 \u00a31=$1.02.  I am a trader let me explain how this can put an end to our financial woes.",

Since 1 April 2023 the rate of Corporation Tax has been 19% for companies with profits under \u00a350,000, and 25% for companies with profits over \u00a3250,000. The rate of Corporation Tax for companies with profits between \u00a350,000 and \u00a3250,000 is between 19 and 25%.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what changes you would like to be made to Corporation Tax."
