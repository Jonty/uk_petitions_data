        "action": "Give patients free television channels while in hospital",
        "additional_details": "One of the reasons they got free television was because visiting was restricted however some patients don\u2019t have friends and family to visit them and are alone, therefore television is a comfort to them while in hospital. It\u2019s not fair to expect unwell people to pay to watch something simple as tv. Channels 1,2,3,4 should be free and additional channels/movies can be charged for therefore the company (Hospidea) can continue making money",
        "background": "As some may know patients were receiving free television in hospital when Covid-19 was peaking. However now it seems to be that since the cases have reduced patients no longer deserve free television? Patients could get some channels free e.g 1,2,3,4 and if they want more they can pay.",
