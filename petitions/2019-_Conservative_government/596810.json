        "additional_details": "With everyone having more cars on the road, Lynncroft and Barber Street in Eastwood is a nightmare to transverse now as you can only get one car up either road. If someone is coming the otherway and if a car is behind you it becomes a stalemate, most house owners I have spoken to on these roads are fed up of it. A one way system would work much better and it would be easier to get out of Barber street if you knew another car was not going to be entering at the same time.",
