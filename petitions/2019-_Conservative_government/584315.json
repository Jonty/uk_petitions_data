        "additional_details": "Antifreeze poisoning causes numerous deaths in cats every year. It is fatal and hard to detect, symptoms can begin as quickly as 30 minutes after ingestion and be fatal after 2/3 days. It can cause severe kidney failure and often goes undetected as a cause of death. By the time it becomes noticeable, it is often already too late and the damage has been done. Cats often hide under cars and so an antifreeze spillage may go unnoticed. If the chemical was not toxic, harm to cats could be prevented.",
        "background": "The Government should ban Ethylene-glycol antifreeze as it is highly toxic to cats. Less harmful products such as propylene-glycol should be used instead.",
