He fell and ended up with barbed wire all around his neck.\r\n \r\nMy current dog didn't see a barbed wire fence and ran into it.\r\n \r\nThese fences can be hard to see, and are often dirty, unclean, dangerous and completely unnecessary to have adjacent to public footpaths.\r\n \r\nPlease help save lives and prevent injuries.",
