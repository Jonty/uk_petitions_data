        "additional_details": "Students are under a lot of stress at the moment due to missing so much of their course and forcing them to take \u2018mini exams\u2019 to receive their grade will not benefit anyone. It will only lead to unfair grades and more unnecessary stress on students. The fairest way for students to receive their grade this year would be through previous mock exams and assessment results, class work and their teachers personal opinion. If students want to take mini exams however, they should be allowed.",
        "background": "The Government should not force students to take any sort of assessment to receive their grade this summer unless the student wants to. It should be optional as current year 11s and 13s have missed so much of their course and would be under a huge amount of stress.",
