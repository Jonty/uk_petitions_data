Their economy relies on tourists supporting restaurants, bars and local attractions and by putting this measure in place, we are jeopardising the islands chance of economic recovery. The infection rate and R number is lower than the UK meaning that there is no greater risk on travelling there.",

If it is classed as \u201csafe\u201d to travel here then what is the reason behind imposing the 2 week quarantine rule on return the UK?",
