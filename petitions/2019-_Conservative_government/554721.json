        "additional_details": "We believe that, in absence of symptoms, healthcare workers should be free to travel as many of us live abroad and work in the UK, but do not meet the exemption requirement of travelling once a week. We need you to make it easier for us to maintain our lives as they were before Covid-19 in order to be able to support the NHS and continue saving lives. Otherwise many of us will not be able to continue doing so.",
        "background": "Many EU healthcare workers travel regularly to the UK to serve the Country. Very rightfully they were exempted from quarantine. This exemption was lifted and we believe this is wrong and it should be reinstated. We are here to help, cure, nurse and save lives. Please help us to help you.",
