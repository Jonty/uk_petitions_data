        "additional_details": "We care deeply about the prosperity of Israel and the UK and welcome their proposed FTA, but echo a global fear that the Israeli government\u2019s agenda jeopardises core UK FTA tenets. As a world leader and Israeli ally, the UK must use this FTA with Israel to uphold democratic norms so as to help ensure the country's continued stability, preserve chances for peace in the region, and promote the British Values of democracy, the rule of law, respect and tolerance, and individual freedoms.",
        "background": "We believe that constitutional changes in Israel would put the UK\u2019s criteria for trade agreements at risk. We want the UK to include conditions on Labour Standards, Gender Equality, Women's Economic Empowerment, Anti-Corruption and the Protection of Human Rights in any FTA with Israel.",
