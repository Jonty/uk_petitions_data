We should not let Afghans down in their hour of need.",
        "background": "In 2015, we helped Syrian refugees. This government should do the same for Afghan refugees fleeing the Taliban by scrapping its anti-refugee Borders and Nationality Bill, halting deportations of Afghans, resettling people through the UK Resettlement Scheme and offering other safe routes.",
