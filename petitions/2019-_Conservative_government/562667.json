        "additional_details": "As a cyclist who rides as much as I do, I regularly receive comments from other road about being in the way of traffic. Sometimes it happens multiple times on one ride. They tell me I am in the way of traffic but I consider myself to be part of the traffic. We feel an educational campaign about cycle paths and use of the highway by cyclists will reduce the amount of physical and verbal abuse cyclists are subjected to on a regular basis.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to launch a campaign to educate road users on the proper use of cycle paths and sharing the highway with cyclists. More road users need to understand the purpose of cycle paths, and how to share the highways with cyclists.",
