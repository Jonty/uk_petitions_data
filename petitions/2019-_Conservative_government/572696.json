        "additional_details": "For too long Child Maintainence has calculated how much the paying parent should pay the claimant based on the amount of GROSS pay that the paying parent earns. This is before tax, NI, food costs, phone bill (essential for work) and other costs. \r\n\r\nMany people have had to sell possessions, cut their food shopping in half or do illegal things to earn that income to support themselves. \r\n\r\nSome people have become depressed by this and have taken their lives because they can't afford to live it.",
        "background": "The Child Maintainence Service/ Child Support Allowance must consider the costs of living for the paying parent and be realistic in considering what the parent must pay to the claimant.\r\n\r\nThe harsh penalties of not doing so is too extreme for the reckless calculations of the CMS/CSA.",

For example, by increasing the threshold where people start paying more than \u00a37 a week, or reduce the percentage of gross income paying parents are replied to pay in child maintenance, or basing calculations on net income.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petitions, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nExclude overtime and bonuses from income to calculate child maintenance payment: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/560536\r\n\r\nReform child maintenance \u2013 flat rates per child per night: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/560401"
