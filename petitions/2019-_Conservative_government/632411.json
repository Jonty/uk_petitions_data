        "additional_details": "Legislation states that dangerously out of control is considered as \u201ccausing injury to someone\u201d or \u201cmakes someone worried it may injure them\u201d. When dogs are off leads any member of the public may feel worried an unrestrained dog could injure them. This is especially prevalent with children. By changing the law to require all dogs to be on leads in public places this removes this fear and also allows owners to ensure their dog is controlled. Too many people have been injured by unsecured dogs.",
        "background": "Current legislation states it is against the law to let a dog be dangerously out of control in public places. The only way to ensure dogs are not dangerously out of control is to change the law to state that all dogs must be kept on leads in public places.",
