An international vaccine passport system would allow vaccinated individuals to travel, enjoy hospitality and the arts without putting those who have not been vaccinated at risk.",
        "background": "The travel and hospitality industries have been decimated by the necessary COVID 19 lockdowns. Enabling citizens to sign up to a safe and secure vaccine passport system would allow those industries to restart and enable the borders to reopen to those with proven vaccination credentials.",
