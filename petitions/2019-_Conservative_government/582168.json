A simple google search identifies multiple discussions on this topic including posts by distressed parents who\u2019s children are being exposed to cigarette smoke from neighbouring homes. Although smoke drift can be reduced it may not be possible to eliminate it completely. It can be difficult and costly to identify and fix all sources. Restrict smoking to outdoors to improve health.",

Although smoking has been banned in enclosed public places there is no legislation to protect people from potential harms caused by exposure to smoke in their homes",
