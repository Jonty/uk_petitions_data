        "additional_details": "Psychological manipulation, deployed via overt & covert means, can seriously negatively impact individuals at the conscious & subconscious level. Govt covid19 related media campaigns have been excessive in this context. Cumulatively, they have helped create an insecure, demoralised & disorientated collective (the public), psychological effects that mirror those found in 'unhealthy' interpersonal relations. SAGE 'psychology' expertise should be ignored by Govt if the advice creates such outcomes.",

Those SAGE participants advocating the adoption of behaviour modification techniques at the societal level that would be deemed 'toxic/abusive' if evidenced in interpersonal settings, should be ignored.",
