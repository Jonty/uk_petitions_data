        "additional_details": "The UK had pledged \u00a3164 million to help the crisis in Yemen and this money is urgently needed. Yet the UK government is proposing to reduce this aid amount to only \u00a387 million. \r\nThis petition calls for the government to reverse the decision to cut the aid promised to Yemen and to pay at least the full \u00a3164 million promised as soon as possible to combat this crisis.",
        "background": "Yemen is currently suffering what is probably the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Ordinary people are suffering the most, and in particular there is a severe shortage of food. Children are suffering already from malnutrition and are dying of starvation. Without our help, this can only get worse.",
