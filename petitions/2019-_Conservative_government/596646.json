        "additional_details": "Because, right now, getting around York is a pain, especially if you are on the A1237 with a single-carriageway. But if we turn both of York's ring-roads into a single continuous motorway, it should make getting around York significantly faster (thanks to additional carriageways).",
        "background": "I want the Government to turn York's ring-roads (A1237 & A64) into a motorway, with associated enhancements, to make getting around York easier and faster. York's existing ring-roads, both of which are 'A' roads, should be turned into a continuous motorway (e.g. A1237(M), A64(M)).",
