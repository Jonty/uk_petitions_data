But if we turn both of York's ring-roads into a single continuous motorway, it should make getting around York significantly faster (thanks to additional carriageways).",

York's existing ring-roads, both of which are 'A' roads, should be turned into a continuous motorway (e.g. A1237(M), A64(M)).",
