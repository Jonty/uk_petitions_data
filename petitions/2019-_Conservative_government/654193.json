Air Fryer instructions do not always exist alongside Oven Instructions; Changing this, would help make Air Fryers more useable everyday, and in effect, reduce household costs.",
        "background": "I'd like the Government to introduce a bill amending any relevant bills, so that it is a legal requirement for Food Manufacturers selling packaged food (e.g: Branded and Own Brand products) in the UK (regardless of Point of Origin), to provide Air Fryer Instructions alongside Oven Instructions.",
