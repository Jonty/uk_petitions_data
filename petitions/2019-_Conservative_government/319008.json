        "additional_details": "Since 2011, the 65 to 74 years age group has seen the largest increase in recent internet use according to the Office for National Statistics. 99% of all adults aged 16-44 years old in the UK are internet users, with 47% of adults aged 75 and over. Introducing online voting system for elections could see a huge increase in the electorate as it has the potential to make the voting process easier and more accessible for electors. Additionally a greater accessibility for people with disabilities.",
        "background": "Britain on average has only had an average of 64.7% turnout since 2001 (excluding the Brexit referendum vote which had 72.2%) for general elections. We need to update the electoral system to increase the electorate and have more of the population voting in our elections.",
