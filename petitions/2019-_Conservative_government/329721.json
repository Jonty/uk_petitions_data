The original guest list was 500 people but we are hoping to still go ahead with 100 people in the same large venue. I think this will help a lot of other people in similar position and businesses aswell",
        "background": "From August, could the government consider giving a percentage of venue capacity for weddings instead of limiting it to 30 people. There are venues that are able to accommodate 20-40% of their capacity with social distancing rules, hand sanitizers and mandatory wear of masks for guests.",
