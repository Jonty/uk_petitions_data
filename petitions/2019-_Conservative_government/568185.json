        "additional_details": "Hospitals are now once again overwhelmed. Healthcare workers are 3 - 4 times more likely to contract SARS-CoV2, and approximately half of all staff absences currently are due to covid infections. This adds to the already perilous situation of remaining staff being tired, overworked and prone to making errors.\r\n \r\nAvailable evidence now suggests that SARS-CoV2 is most likely contracted by inhalation. Mass vaccination and its impacts will take time to take effect. FFP3 masks for staff are required now.",
        "background": "Ensure access to FFP3 masks for all staff working with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 patients. The Government should also commission a review of guidance on the use of PPE to prevent transmission of Covid-19, to establish if current guidance is adequate.",
