        "additional_details": "Thousands of separated parents (mainly fathers) are being pushed to financial ruin from the CMS and in the worst cases, suicide.\r\nThe current CMS operating procedures are having a severe impact on the paying parents mental health as well as plunging them into debt. Enforcing fictitious arrears on parents and charging interest on those payments with little or no hope of ever getting out of them. The CMS shouldn\u2019t be allowed to profit off of the earnings of paying parents.",
        "background": "I want a review into how the CMS operate. They should work out the payments based on Net pay as opposed to Gross pay. \r\nHousehold incomes on both sides need to be considered.\r\nPlacing non resident parents in fictitious arrears needs to be made illegal",
