I recently paid \u00a3300 for a basic consultation at an out-of-hours clinic, where treatment cost half as much. These inflated prices hinder pet owners, leading to potential neglect and abandonment. This is a welfare issue. Let's unite for fair pricing, ensuring access to essential care for all pets. Sign now for change!",
