        "additional_details": "Irlen Syndrome is more common than either heart disease or asthma, but it\u2019s often overlooked as the possible cause of the learning challenges many children face. This visual processing problem affects up to 46 percent of children with reading and learning difficulties, and approximately 30 percent of people with ADHD, dyslexia, autism, and those who have suffered a head injury. It also affects 12-14 percent of the general population, people who don\u2019t have learning problems, successful professionals, and gifted students. With statistics like this, odds are high you probably know someone who suffers from Irlen Syndrome. ",
        "background": "In Irlen Syndrome, the brain struggles to make sense of the visual information it receives. This causes a variety of symptoms from visual distortions to physical symptoms like headaches, migraines, strain and fatigue, difficulty attending, and problems with depth perception.",
