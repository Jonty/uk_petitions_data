The government needs to help the many, not just the few. A living wage for all would bolster financial confidence and help to keep the UK economy going. Businesses would be able to continue to operate and the self-employed would be able to keep their jobs. When the dust settles the UK will be well-poised to recover quickly.",
        "background": "Currently, the UK Government is taking radical steps to help those affected by the Corona Virus. However, there isn't any real help for the Self Employed and those small businesses who don't fit the criteria for grants and income support.",
