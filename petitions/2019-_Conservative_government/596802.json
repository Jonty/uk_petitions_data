        "additional_details": "The UK had promised to donate a small number of vaccine doses and has yet to do so.  Many poorer countries are unable to vaccinate people at high risk of disease or death due to lack of vaccine fairness. \r\nThe UK holds a vast overstock of CoVid-19 vaccine doses. For every UK superfluous vaccination of an individual deemed to be at very low to no risk of severe disease or death, a life isn\u2019t saved, whilst someone at high risk due to their job or health or age in a poorer country potentially dies.",
        "background": "Humanity Shared, asks the UK Gov to donate immediately all unused CoVid-19 vaccine doses to poorer countries unable to access them via COVAX or afford them.\r\nTo only further vaccinate those at higher risk of severe disease or death plus donate doses of the individual signatories on this petition.",
