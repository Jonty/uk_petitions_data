        "additional_details": "The new security law set out by China means they could act against so-called 'subversion' in Hong Kong, which could include any opposition to Beijing. This is a clear and alarming threat against the autonomy and freedoms claimed by the 'one country, two systems' principle. Therefore, China is in breach of the guarantees they provided in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration. The UK has a responsibility and a duty to express its support for dissent against this illegal and sinister act.",
