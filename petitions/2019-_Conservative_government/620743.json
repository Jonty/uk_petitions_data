        "additional_details": "The Government is the only one with the power to change current policies in regards to student finance for a second degree. Many people who originally studied a degree, but due to circumstances have now had to change careers, are now in low-paid work or claiming Universal Credit to survive. If student finance was available to help them study again they could be able to get better jobs and become more financially independent, which should also reduce their need for Government support such as Universal Credit.",
        "background": "Student finance is not available for most second degrees. A lot of people have had to re-evaluate their careers due to the Pandemic and redundancy. The Government should make student finance available for all second degree, not just a select few, such as teaching and healthcare courses.",
