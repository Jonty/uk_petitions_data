Census forms having a box for most races/ethnicities allows recognition, understanding and in turn opportunity. \r\n \r\nLatinx/Hispanics have a huge population here in the UK, however we always seem to struggle with our identity here, we aren't acknowledged but simply put into the \u2018other\u2019 box. This is not a true reflection of the population. In the USA the Census Bureau lets people identify as Latinx/Hispanic, we want the same here in the UK.",
