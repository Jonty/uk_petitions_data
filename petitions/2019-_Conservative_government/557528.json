Census forms having a box for most races/ethnicities allows recognition, understanding and in turn opportunity. \r\n \r\nLatinx/Hispanics have a huge population here in the UK, however we always seem to struggle with our identity here, we aren't acknowledged but simply put into the \u2018other\u2019 box.
