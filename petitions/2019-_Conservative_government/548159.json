        "additional_details": "No one wants horses on roads.\r\n\r\nNot drivers, not riders, not horses. It\u2019s dangerous, not relaxing and it\u2019s horses and riders who pay the price with their lives.\r\n\r\nThe British Horse Society figures show that Nov 2010 - Mar 2019 there were 3,737 incidents reported. \r\n\r\n315 horses and 43 riders were killed on our roads during this time.\r\n\r\nBut if riders want to ride out there is little choice. There are some fantastic  bridlepaths but the quiet country lanes have become shortcuts for busy commuters and most riders do not have the funds or access to transport to take their horses to forests or private grounds.",
        "background": "I am calling on the Government to fund local councils to improve bridleway routes by upgrading appropriate footpaths to create links, either permanently or through seasonal permissive routes, and ensuring there is safe access to current bridlepaths where access has been lost.",
