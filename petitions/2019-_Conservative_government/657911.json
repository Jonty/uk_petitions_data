        "additional_details": "My rent is going up to be \u00a3236.77 per week. If paying monthly, the Housing Association have said its \u00a31045.73 I need to pay. However, Universal Credit (who are paying direct) will only pay \u00a31026, so only paying for 364 days of the year, when there is at least 365, and in a leap year 366.\r\n \r\nWe want the way the housing element for Universal Credit is calculated to be changed, so that this covers the full rent for the year, not missing a day or two.\r\n",
        "background": "When someone's rent is set per week, including most social housing tenants, the housing element for Universal Credit is calculated by multiplying this by 52, then dividing by 12. However, some Housing Years there are 53 Mondays in the Year, so when this happens people can go into rent arrears.",
