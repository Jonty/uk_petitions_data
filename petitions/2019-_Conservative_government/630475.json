If today's younger generation who do not have access to dentistry now then in the longer terms it could cost the health service a whole lot more. When a persons teeth are no longer asthaetic then it can impact on the mental health of that person. I and my wife feel the need to consult with a dentist but are unable to find one who is willing to take on new patients.",
