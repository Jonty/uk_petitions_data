        "additional_details": "Pre-Covid-19, wholesalers supplied 330,000 food service businesses and 72,000 grocery stores, and local high streets. They supported 1.4 million jobs; more than the next 5 biggest supermarkets. Given their importance for the public sector, and the entire hospitality industry, wholesalers will be intrinsic to Britain\u2019s economic restart.\r\n\r\nGovernment has chosen to exclude them from much support. This must change. Bespoke financial support packages must be offered by Government now.",
        "background": "Food and drink wholesalers are crucial to supplying hospitals, care homes and schools and are a lifeline for vulnerable communities. They are also integral to the post-pandemic economic restart. Despite this, they have been excluded from much Government support and face sector-wide closures.",
