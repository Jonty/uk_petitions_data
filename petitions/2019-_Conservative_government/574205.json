        "action": "Stop making key workers pay back in to the system via higher living costs.",
        "additional_details": "Key workers that have had to work through the pandemic have not been entitled grants, schemes and benefits even when they have had to isolate causing them to struggle on sick pay or use holiday entitlements to ensure some form of wage. Key workers have still had to pay for fuel and other commuting costs to get work yet still suffered from the pressure of the pandemic. KEY workers should not have to help recoup grants, furloughs and benefits given out through corona virus pandemic.",
        "background": "It's unfair that people who have worked through the pandemic whilst not taking anything out of the system and continued to put in to the system have to pay higher living costs. The recuperation via council tax rise should only be inflicted on those that have used schemes to get through the pandemic.",
