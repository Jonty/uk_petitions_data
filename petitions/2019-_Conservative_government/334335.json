        "additional_details": "BBC used offensive language to describe a black skin man on 29/07 (plus they tried to defend it was right until social wrath arose). In addition, we as citizens should pick and chose if we want to pay for a service and not be forced by law. I for one, want to refuse to support BBC in any way, but I can't because of the law. BBC needs to start making money like any other station, by ads. In addition, we have no choice when we pay for Sky to remove BBC channels. In the age of VOD law has to change",
        "background": "Government needs to remove mandatory TV license and any support for BBC. TV license shouldn't exist anymore as it doesn't in many other EU countries or was removed years ago. BBC should be making money on the same standing as any other news/entertainment channel -advertisement. People should chose!",
