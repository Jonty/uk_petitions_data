        "additional_details": "Marijuana has shown clear benefits to people with medical conditions such as anxiety, chronic pain, ptsd, etc. and the legalisation and control over distribution, similar to America, could create a large influx of jobs, money in the economy, and a more stable nation. It would eradicate the need for people to go to prison over marijuana use or possession, which would save the police thousands of pounds, which is necessary, especially in Scotland.",
        "background": "Since cannabis was legalised in California and other countries, there has been an influx in the economy of the country due to legalised marijuana usage, you can help boost the economy, creating jobs and eradicating the stigmatism that has surrounded marijuana for years.",
