        "additional_details": "Due to Covid-19, universities have been cancelled and most students have been advised to go home during these uncertain times. However, private student accommodations companies like CRM Students and their landlords still expect students to pay even though they have left. Many students have part time jobs to pay part of their rent and due to the Coronavirus they are unable to work making this very hard to pay. Some accommodations have already pardoned students but others haven't.",
