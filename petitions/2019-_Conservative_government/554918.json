        "additional_details": "Schools are working hard not only to help pupils catch up with lost learning but also supporting them adjust to the new normal, cope with the effects of lockdown and supporting their mental health. Several are still missing education due to self isolation or families reluctant to send their children to school. The pressure of exams adds to the stress on pupils and schools and for what? Some schools are placing demands on pupils such as 8 hour days along with holidays and Saturdays due to Sats!",
        "background": "Remove the additional pressures on pupils, teachers and schools by cancelling the 2021 SATS. This will ensure schools can focus on a broad and balanced curriculum, help pupils to catch up on lost learning and support their mental health rather than testing and data analysis.",
