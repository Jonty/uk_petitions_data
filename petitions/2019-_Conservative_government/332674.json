            "details": "The Government believes people should be safe and feel safe in their own home. Learning the lessons from the Grenfell Tower tragedy, the Government is committed to bringing about the biggest change in building safety for a generation. \r\n\r\nThe Building Safety Bill, building on the recommendations of Dame Judith Hackitt\u2019s Independent Review of Building Regulations and Fire Safety is an important part of delivering on this commitment. The Bill will create a new Building Safety Regulator and a more stringent regime for high-risk buildings, with better accountability and clear duties for those responsible for the safety of buildings. It also gives residents a stronger voice in the system, ensuring their concerns are never ignored. \r\n\r\nAs part of these reforms the Building Safety Bill will introduce a Building Safety Charge, which will give leaseholders greater transparency around costs incurred in maintaining a safe building, while ensuring any costs are proportionate and fair.  \r\n \r\nWe expect that the charge will pay for a building safety manager, legal fees, safety case production costs, reporting, safety management, resident engagement and complaints processes. The Bill provides powers to enable Government to limit the building safety costs that can be recharged to leaseholders.  The Government may also prescribe costs to be excluded in regulations and leaseholders will have the ability to challenge costs at the first-tier property tribunal. \r\n \r\nThe Government is clear that it is the responsibility of the building owner to ensure the safety of residents and has called on them to protect leaseholders from these costs. In many cases building owners and freeholders can meet these costs by claiming on insurance policies or warranties, taking legal action or from their own resources. \r\n\r\nIn more than half of the cases where there was unsafe Grenfell style Aluminium Composite Material (ACM) cladding on a private sector residential block, the costs have been met in this way. In the remaining cases, the Government has stepped in and provided \u00a3600m in funding to remove this cladding. \r\n\r\nThe Government wants to see buildings remediated at pace. Through engagement with buildings owners 79% of all high-rise buildings with unsafe ACM cladding have either started or completed remediation, rising to 97% in the social housing sector.\u202fGovernment intervention has meant that despite the challenges of the pandemic over 100 buildings have started work on site in 2020\u2013 more than in the whole of 2019.\u202fThe Government has been clear that there are no more excuses for ACM remediation delays.\u202fWhere building owners have still failed to act, despite support and funding, we have been clear that they should expect to face enforcement action.\u202f \r\n \r\nWe are aware that where developers and building owners have chosen not to take responsibility, leaseholders have been faced with excessive costs. The Government announced \u00a31bn of funding to remediate other dangerous types of cladding in high rise blocks in Spring 2020, in order to support the remediation of more buildings at pace. The Government remains determined to protect leaseholders from unaffordable remediation costs and when publishing the bill for pre-legislative scrutiny we made it clear that this is a topic that we are committed to considering further and will update on this work before the Building Safety Bill is introduced to Parliament. \r\n\r\nMinistry of Housing, Communities and Local Government",
