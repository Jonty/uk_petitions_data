        "additional_details": "The food that is on the market that is free from Gluten/Milk/egg is always more expensive than normal. A normal loaf of bread without the \"Free From\" label on is around \u00a31.36 whereas a loaf of bread with the \"Free From\" label on it \u00a33.50 for the same loaf of bread without gluten/Wheat/eggs/nuts or Rye in it. It's not fair it being more expensive for people who have a condition that can't control what they have to eat to make them feel better and stop them getting unwell.",
        "background": "I would like Parliament to lower the price of food that is labelled \"Free From\" for customers in all supermarkets. This is because all food that is \"Free From\" is more expensive than food that is \"normal\". This is unfair as customers with a intolerance do not have a choice.",
