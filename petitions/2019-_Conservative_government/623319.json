        "action": "End Period Poverty and provide free period products to anyone who needs them",
        "additional_details": "With the rising cost of living and energy crisis the UK is currently facing I would like the government to follow Scotland, the first country to provide free period products to anyone who needs them.  Period products are a necessity, a right not a privilege. Period poverty is a real challenge to girls and women which results in them being held back in education and work.  School and work days are being missed due to their periods because of period poverty.\r\nWe need to eliminate period poverty now",
        "background": "The government need to offer free period products to anyone who needs them to end period poverty so girls & women do not have to go without or use unhygienic methods like socks or toilet paper in place of sanitary towels.",
