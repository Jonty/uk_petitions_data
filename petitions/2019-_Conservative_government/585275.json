        "additional_details": "1. Skilled workers have more free time since working from home was introduced. Many of them want to start their own online businesses such as selling their knowledge online, however, this is not allowed under the current visa conditions.\r\n \r\n2. Most skilled workers have multiple skills that could be marketed. Restricting their ability to work only to the sponsoring employer may eventually mean they leave the country as they are not able to exploit the full range of their skills and talents.",

Restrictions could be imposed on the type of businesses allowed, but allowable business could include online coaching and tutoring, or being an online retailer.",
