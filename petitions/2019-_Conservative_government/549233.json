This means that the UK Government could not remove a person's citizenship if they were not a citizen of another country, and the UK Government cannot grant or return citizenship of another country to a person. Your suggestion of removing British citizenship is therefore not something the Government can do under its current legal obligations.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for the Government to increase the requirements for gaining British citizenship, which is one of the things you propose in your petition. We could also accept a petition calling on the Government to change benefit entitlements, which you also suggest in your petition."
