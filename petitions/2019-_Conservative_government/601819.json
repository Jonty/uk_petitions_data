        "additional_details": "The government should ensure that international students are not disproportionately harmed by COVID-19 and worldwide lockdowns. International students that started their course online should have the right to finish their degree online. International students are suffering from lockdowns all over the world - many are going to be forced to unenroll and give up on their hard work if they are forced to stop online learning while their British counterparts can continue to participate online.",
        "background": "The UK Government has recently announced that concessions for international student\u2019s visas will expire on April 6 2022 - meaning that international students who are doing online learning will have their visa cancelled if they continue online leaning for the academic year.",
