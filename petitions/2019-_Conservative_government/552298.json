For years the county has been left on its own to shoulder the responsibility of asylum seekers. Our hospitals are some of the worst performing and underfunded in the country, and many of our communities seem to have been abandoned.\r\n\r\nOur fine county can only return to its former glory as an autonomous region, free from the shackles of Westminster and a government that persistently fails the great people of Kent.",
