        "additional_details": "A lot of businesses weren\u2019t entitled to grants so had to resort to Bounce Back Loans when they were most vulnerable. Businesses could borrow up to \u00a350,000 depending on how big their business was. Issuing grants to enable businesses to replay off loans of up to \u00a38,000 would help so many small businesses out by not having that burden over their shoulders for the next 6 years, especially in the cost of living crisis. Give small businesses a chance to succeed in one of the hardest times ever.\r\n \r\nAny tax increases to fund these grants should only apply to businesses that benefited from these loans, and should be set at a rate that spreads the financial burden over a longer period than the repayment terms for these loans.\r\n",
