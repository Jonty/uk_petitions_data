This is due to the experiential rise in the amount of time it takes for an ambulance arriving to a scene which is 8 plus minutes to respond to a scene where in which we are left not 100% knowing what to do and relying on someone who is not on scene to give us advice on what to do when we could be doing it before they know the full extent of the situation.",
        "background": "I want the Government to make it mandatory that all students from the age of 12-19 learn first aid. This is due to the increase in knife and gun crime within the uk that with the aging population should make it so we can extend the chances of survival.",
