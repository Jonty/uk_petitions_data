        "action": "Stop universities charging rent on accommodation during the COVID-19 pandemic",
        "additional_details": "Most, if not all universities, have closed their doors for the duration of the pandemic, and do not offer any face-to-face teaching. As such, it is pointless for students to remain on campus during the pandemic period. International students have been advised to go home. Many have done so, and are now unable to return. Others, who were unable to return home in time, are stuck on campus with nowhere to go. However, despite all this, rent is still being charged for on-campus student accommodation.",
        "background": "This petition wants the government to intervene on behalf of all students living in on-campus accommodation, in order to prevent universities charging rent during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many students might struggle to afford on-campus rent, thus, it is necessary to stop universities charging it.",
