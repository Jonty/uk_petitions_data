        "additional_details": "I would like there to be a change in the law which prohibits employers enforcing dress codes which discriminate against people with dyed hair. Individuals should have the right to express themselves through their hair and be free from judgement. It should not been seen as unprofessional to have unnatural colours in your hair. Hair colour doesn\u2019t effect an individuals quality of work so employers shouldn\u2019t be able to dictate what an employee can or can\u2019t do with their hair.",
        "background": "Many places of work, especially professional workplaces, have dress codes which do not allow employees to dye their hair bright bold colours. I believe this to be wrong, as the colour of someone\u2019s hair doesn\u2019t affect an employees ability to work.",
