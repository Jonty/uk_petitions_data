People should not feel like they need to be in Hospital, they should feel encouraged to leave the Hospitals, which then frees up space and doesn't put so much pressure on the NHS, which then speeds up waiting times etc.",
        "background": "In order to help bring joy to sick people, help heal the sick people and give sick people hope.\r\nThis could be as simple as playing Positive Praise and Worship songs from a CD or radio.  In addition, local church choirs could come to Hospitals and sing and play music whenever possible.",
