If we was allowed to carry these self defence weapons we could have a leg to stand on. Meaning the thieves would now be more scared to steal meaning less crime. The police don't have enough employment available to protect us anymore. Allow public the right to defend themselves and not face any charges for doing so. This will help lower motorcycle crime alot.",

All we Can do is film them that doesn't stop them anymore we need to be allowed to fight back and have the support of the police force to do this.",
