        "additional_details": "In line with the Governments COVID-19 action plan, all weddings have now had to be cancelled or postponed. For those who have chosen to postpone, many have been left with no option but to reschedule to a new date outside of their 12 month 'give notice' period. \r\n\r\nThis now means many couples who have planned a legal wedding at their choice of venue, may not be able to get legally married as planned. The reason for this being purely because of the restrictive 12 month time frame of the 'giving notice' process.",
        "background": "Currently, you must hold your wedding ceremony within 12 months of \u2018giving notice\u2019.\r\n\r\nDue to these unprecedented times, this period should be extended to take into account the impact COVID-19 has had on time frames.",
