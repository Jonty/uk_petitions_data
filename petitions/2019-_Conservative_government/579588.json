        "additional_details": "This needs to be done as it will infringe the right to peacefully protest, that was given to us in the Human Rights Act 1998. One of the main reasons protests are held is to cause disruption (in terms of masses, not destruction), in order to make leaders to witness and be exposed to the view of the general public. This Bill will threaten that right to protest. For such a large subject, this needs to be something that the House of Commons can debate fully and meaningfully.",
        "background": "I believe that parliament should slow down or stop the current progression of this bill, until there can be a meaningful debate about it.",
