        "additional_details": "We need to be more accepted as a community as I feel the issues behind it have been pushed to the side. Trans women are being killed around the world due to hate crime. Families of children being emotionally and sometimes physically abused for what gender they identify as their families refusing to use their pronouns and names. On top of that the NHS wait is too long and we need more people in that area as it is killing trans people when they cant take the mental damage gender Dysphoria has on them, Lucky ones are able to go privately but for less fortunate people they rely on the NHS with the wait of two and a half years or more. Trans boys wearing Binders crushing their ribs every day. Trans women being called predators when they just want to be accepted for the gender they are.",
        "background": "The UK needs to address issues around Transgender. People need more information about the struggle we go through. We also need transitioning to be less wait as the NHS wait is too long so we need more people specialising in that area as most people cant afford it privately.",
