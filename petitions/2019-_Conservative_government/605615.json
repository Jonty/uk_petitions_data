The SLC uses \"household income\" to assess a students maintaince loan. This is of course unreasonable as many parents will not pay for dorm fees etc. And as a student who wishes to study medicine getting a job is out of the question. Even with bursaries it still isn't possible and also I don't meet the criteria of an estranged student.",

And my parents will not provide financial support for there children as it is no longer there legal duty. However the SLC still uses \"household income\" to assess elgibility for maintenance loans.",
