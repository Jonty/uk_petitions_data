        "additional_details": "Beyond September and during winters there are still going to be risks of outbreak and schools closing again. Without a contingency plan for children to continue learning from home, there will be severe learning gaps for children. \r\n\r\nRunning the school and lessons online will help parents who are able to work from home or where the child or someone in their family are vulnerable.\r\n\r\nSchools will benefit as the classrooms will be less crowded and thereby less exposure for teachers and school staff.",
        "background": "In view of COVID-19, school going children must have an option to take school learning  over the internet. Schools and Academies must both provide this option. \r\nParents can decide if their child is safe and are able to attend lessons and activities either from home or physically goes to school.",
