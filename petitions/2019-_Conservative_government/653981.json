        "additional_details": "Each day brings more devastation. At least one expert has stated that unless something changes, almost a quarter of Gaza\u2019s 2 million population - close to half a million human beings - could potentially die within a year, largely from preventable health causes and the collapse of the medical system. Aid is not reaching those in need due to Israeli blockades and continued bombardments, and medical workers are being forced to evacuate.",
        "background": "As this crisis worsens, experts warn that vast numbers of innocent civilians now face death by starvation and preventable disease. We call on the Government to seek to secure a permanent ceasefire and ensure a proportionate humanitarian response, including urgent delivery of aid and medical care.",
