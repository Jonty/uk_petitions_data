        "additional_details": "The number of people with dementia in the UK is forecast to reach over 1 Million people in 2021, and around 600,000 are estimated to be living at home.\r\n\r\nThe level of care for many such patients is 24/7, immediate and intimate and often undertaken by an elderly spouse.\r\n\r\nHowever, due to current Council Tax Discount rules many people who suffer from dementia do not receive a discount until they have proved that they are entitled to a related benefit.\r\n\r\nThe present system can cause distress and financial hardship during a period of primary care for terminally ill patients and is cruel and unacceptable.\r\n\r\nThe law needs changing to redress this, by removing the requirement for people with a mental impairment to also be entitled to a related benefit.",
        "background": "Local councils should be required to allow all over-65s with a mental impairment to receive a Council Tax Discount at the point of GP certification, and not be required to prove they're entitled to a related benefit. This requirement can cause delays, with households losing between \u00a3200 and \u00a32,600.",
