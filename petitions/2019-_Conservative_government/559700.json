Under the current rating system it will be very difficult to improve a rating from an E to a C in many properties. Applying the legislation to the PRS without addressing the remaining housing stock is unfair and will result in many landlords dumping their inefficient properties into the Private Market, where improvements will be unlikely, thereby failing to achieve the Govt's aim.",
