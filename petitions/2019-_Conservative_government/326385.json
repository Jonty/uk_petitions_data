You can\u2019t change history and we shouldn\u2019t be rewriting it and defiantly not hide it. We are British and we have a duty to protect our history. \r\nYou can\u2019t judge things that happened centuries ago with a modern day view point. Yes the politician trade was a barbaric trade but at the time it was perfectly legal and let\u2019s not forget that it was parliament that outlawed it. All history should be accepted.",
        "background": "I would like the government to stop taking our statues down as it is a part of our history. Statues weren\u2019t put up for the bad things they did they were put up for all the good things eg Robert peel was the founder of the police force, Thomas Guy at guys hospital was the founder of the hospital.",
