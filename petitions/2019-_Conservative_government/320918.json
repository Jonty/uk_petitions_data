        "additional_details": "This should enable safe commuting and exercise for all, and is in line with action by other countries such as the Netherlands. Electric bikes could be able to use this facility up to 30mph, so these paths are useful to those making longer journeys, and enabling people to arrive at work swiftly, safely and not too sweaty. People could use enclosed bikes too for poor weather.",
        "background": "The Government should provide funding for segregated cycle paths alongside all A roads. This should allow for safe cycling alongside the road with a barrier or verge between cars, lorrys etc and cyclists, making cycling safer and a useable means to commute and keep healthy.",
