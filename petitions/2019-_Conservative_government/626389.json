        "additional_details": "I strongly believe that the Government should bring in a new offence so that anyone found guilty of stealing from charity and charity shops. \r\n \r\nCharity shops are there to help the world become a better place. The amount of items stolen from some charity shops is shocking. What people don\u2019t seem to realise is that these thefts reduce the good that charities can do.",

In my opinion the Government is not doing enough and needs to crack down on stealing from charities.",
