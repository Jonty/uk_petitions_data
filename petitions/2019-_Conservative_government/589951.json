        "action": "Trial capping net immigration and then gradually reduce it to tens of thousands",
        "additional_details": "YouGov polls show the public is in favour of reducing net immigration levels. This should help fight the problems of housing shortage, loss of green spaces, road congestion and demand on public services at the core, rather than treating the symptoms. Previous Governments have pledged to lower immigration numbers, but plans to cap immigration have been abandoned. Even though it may entail temporary economic disadvantages, the numbers must be capped urgently accordingly to public demands.",
        "background": "The Government must cap immigration. To do so sensibly a trial period could be brought in and then the cap could be lowered over a few years. It could be done by capping the number of work visas, allowing only top 5% students to stay after studies, and more enforcement to deport overstayers.",
