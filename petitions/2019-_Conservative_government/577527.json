        "additional_details": "Britain has an ethical obligation to a country that was once part of its Empire and who's working population helped rebuild this country following WW2. The proposed cuts to foreign aid are thoroughly unacceptable and puts the lives of millions at risk. Yemen deserves better from Britain, who have done nothing but hinder its development and help its enemies for years.",
        "background": "The British government, after selling arms to Saudi Arabia who continuously wage war in the Yemen, are now proposing the reduction of foreign aid- putting millions of vulnerable children at risk of starvation. Foreign aid should not be reduced at such a time of need particularly in a pandemic.",
