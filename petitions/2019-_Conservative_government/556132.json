To increase mental well-being and to ensure the medical and dental workforce remains stable",
        "background": "Such students often graduate with debts of \u00a3100K+. This can lead to new graduates doing extra hours (often illegally) to pay off debts. Tired staff can put public safety at risk. It also limits career choice. Specialties with no out of hours e.g. urology pay less but still such doctors are needed!",
