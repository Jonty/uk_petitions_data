        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the Government and Parliament to fulfil their responsibility in protecting citizens' privacy, building digital trust, and ensuring that data protection laws align with ethical standards. We believe that this Bill should be withdrawn, and that the Government and Parliament should collaborate to shape alternative legislation that not only addresses current challenges but also establishes a foundation for a secure and privacy-respecting digital future.",
        "background": "We believe the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill threatens privacy with inadequate safeguards, and that in its current form it could jeopardize our right to privacy, and lacks safeguards against abuse and unauthorized access to personal data, eroding public trust in digital governance.",
