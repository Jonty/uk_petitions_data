        "additional_details": "Black history is a massive part of British history and \u201cIf we do not remember history we are condemned to repeat it\u201d. I believe racism is often learnt from parents and so if we can open up the minds of young children and show them the history of what white British people have done and are still doing to black people we have a chance of breaking the cycle and making children more informed on important matters that still affect our country today.",
        "background": "So far the curriculum for history outlines things such as the Bronze Age and the history of railways. At the very least, Black history should become a suggested topic for key stage one and key stage two children.",
