        "additional_details": "The Government's of the UK should immediately stop classifying any death within 28 days of a positive test as a Covid death as this is falsely inflating Covid death data and wrongly influencing Government policy. It is also deeply distressing for relatives of the deceased to have their loved one classed as a Covid death when the true cause of death was something else.Cause of death should only be classified by a medical practitioner at the time of death.",
