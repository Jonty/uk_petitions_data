If someone aged 24 goes into the same shop and buys the same sandwich it still costs \u00a32.50.\r\n \r\nIf I work for minimum wage I earn \u00a36.45 an hour. If a 24-year old does the exact same work they would be payed \u00a38.20.\r\n \r\nIt is illegal to pay someone differently based on their gender or race so how is it acceptable to discriminate based on age.\r\n \r\nYoung people do not need less money to live, and the same work should equal the same wage.",

I work the same hours as many of my colleagues doing the same work but at the end of the month I get paid significantly less than older staff.",
