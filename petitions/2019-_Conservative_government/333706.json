        "additional_details": "Many lives are saved each year by smoke and co alarms. However many homes are still unprotected. If these devices were exempt from vat it would help make them more affordable to all. Essential personal protective clothing is already vat exempt preventing injury and saving lives. The Government are profiting from the laws they have made that make their installation mandatory in public buildings, rented homes and new builds.",
        "background": "These are essential safety devices, so value added tax is just wrong. The detectors have a lifespan and must be replaced after 10 years, so this is an ongoing expense to protect lives, having a working alarm is not a luxury.",
