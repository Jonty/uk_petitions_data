        "additional_details": "With strict guidelines in place, gloves, masks etc, I see no reason why we can't open. 1 client at a time per stylist. No groups of people allowed in. Strict 1 hour appointment times. If you can go to the supermarket or bank and be surrounded by people, I don't see why a barbershop or hair salon cannot open. If a client books in but feels unwell, they reschedule. We have rented properties to support and a grant can only do so much! At this rate, businesses will close and we will be without work.",

Spaced employees and even limited days",
