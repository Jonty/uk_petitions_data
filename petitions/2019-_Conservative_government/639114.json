        "additional_details": "Hundreds and thousands of women in the UK take HRT, and are facing a health crisis that is not been adequately addressed. This topic needs to be investigated urgently, and new measures taken, such as greater investment into healthcare. We also need to know why some of these medicines (like Utrogestan) are commonly available in Europe but not the UK. We believe the current 2-month limit is not a viable long-term solution.",
        "background": "Since 2018, many women in the UK have been suffering, physically and mentally, due to ongoing HRT shortages. This is despite there being no shortage of HRT in the rest of Europe. This shortage needs to be investigated and addressed, to ensure the wellbeing of women.",
