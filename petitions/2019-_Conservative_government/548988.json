        "additional_details": "Looking at the length of time it takes to first go through mediation to try and have an agreement between both parents. If that doesn't work the dad then has to file a C100, and with all the legal costs involved, court processes, if the children have been hijacked by their mom and can't see their dad it has emotional and psychological effect on the children. Not even the experts will be able to diagnose what children go through when there is father absence.",
        "background": "My proposition is for the government to introduce a new law making it illegal for single moms to hijack children, demanding money before they let the father see the children, when the father is already supporting the children through Child Maintenance.",
