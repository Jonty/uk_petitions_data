        "additional_details": "There's ~20,000 legal medical cannabis patients across the UK, prescribed primarily either bud/flower or refined oil extracts.\r\n\r\nMost patients face severe financial difficulty affording their prescriptions, my own average monthly cost currently ~\u00a3500. Many patients are unable to work, and are forced to turn to cheaper illicit sources due to affordability.\r\n\r\n\"Grow Your Own\" is available to cannabis patients in many other countries for this very reason, and must also be considered in the UK.",
        "background": "Patients prescribed 'CBPM' by a medical specialist should be allowed to maintain 3-6 flowering plants (with extra considerations for starting new seedlings.)\r\n\r\nGYO registration database could be maintained via local council, notifying police of local medical grows, similar to Canadian setup.",
