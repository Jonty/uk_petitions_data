To continue to allow companies to destroy green spaces and history using out of date planning, only pausing to complete conditions of discharge, is verging on criminal! \r\nThey should be made to put in actual planning application for each ear marked site and not years in advance.This would allow all residents have their say. Saving more green spaces and history.",

This doesn\u2019t allow new residents in the area to have their say if planning was passed 6 years before they moved in and the work is a 20 year project.",
