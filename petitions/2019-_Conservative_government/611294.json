        "action": "No direct military confrontation with Russia in Ukraine",
        "additional_details": "Any proportional response to escalation by Russia in Ukraine (eg the Russian use of chemical weapons) would risk a nuclear exchange, the start of World War 3 and devastation that goes way beyond anything during the war in Ukraine. The government should seek to minimise any risk of nuclear war with Russia. We note the paranoia of Vladimir Putin, his autocratic leadership, and that the west did not respond militarily to the Soviet invasions of Hungary in 1956 or Czechoslovakia in 1968.",
        "background": "The government must avoid any direct military confrontation with Russia in Ukraine, even if more destructive weapons are used. It should stick to the red line of defending NATO nations. This petition rejects the imposition of any no-fly zone in Ukraine or the sending of NATO troops.",
