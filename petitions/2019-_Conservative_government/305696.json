        "additional_details": "The Magistrates Court Act is now over 40 years old. Evidential requirements on police have changed significantly in that time, as have CPS procedures for bringing prosecutions.The time limit applies to offences like drink-driving, harassment and common assault. There are numerous cases of offenders (including domestic abuse perpetrators) escaping justice for no other reason than the police and CPS are unable to bring a case before a court within 6 months. This law needs urgently updating.",
