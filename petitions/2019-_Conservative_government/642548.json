        "additional_details": "People who have experienced bereavement by suicide can be at higher risk of mental illness and suicidal ideation in the months following, due to the traumatic circumstances involved in their loss. Inquests often require witnesses to discuss the events in detail, whilst the media are free to report on the discussions. This can often feel intrusive, exploitative and allows the media to capitalise on the death of a loved one against the families wishes.",

Hearings can remain open to the public, but media reports on inquests, which can contain personal and sensitive information, should require consent from families.",
