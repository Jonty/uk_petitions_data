        "additional_details": "The UAE has had one of the best vaccination rates and best covid testing programmes in the world. The UAE has also had the best-in-class health and safety infrastructure to protect visitors and residents including rapid-testing, social distancing and sanitisation procedures. Although the UAE is a hub the airports are thoroughly sanitised and so are all flights in and out of the UAE on Emirates and Etihad flights. Finally, the UAE has strict controls to guard against all troubling covid variants.",
        "background": "Remove the UAE from the travel corridor red list and put it on the amber list or green list so that the 150,000 brits living over here are able to see their families this summer. Many Brits living in the UAE are not influencers they are ordinary people that want to visit their family in the U.K.",
