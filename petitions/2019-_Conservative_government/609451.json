        "additional_details": "Firstly, we would like the government to derestrict access through the implementation of public paths to reduce road incidents involving horses and cyclists.\r\n\r\nSecondly, increased off-road access could encourage people to cycle, which may help with the government's fight against the obesity epidemic.\r\n\r\nThirdly, implementing public paths would aid the government's goal of promoting lower carbon transport by increasing the usage of sustainable transport, such as cycling, for commuting and leisure.",
        "background": "Public paths would be accessible to people on foot, with a horse or bicycle. Since 2000, horse ownership and the uptake of cycling have increased dramatically, which has not been matched by infrastructural developments. Increasing off-road access would minimize risk to vulnerable road users.",
