        "additional_details": "Mandatory custodial sentences alongside educational programmes for men who are violent towards girls and womxn are needed to break these cycles of violence & counter our societal normalisation of such violence. Sentencing guidelines must reflect the seriousness of such crimes so that such men can't present a continued danger to girls, womxn and wider society. Police, crown prosecution services & courts must treat girls & womxn with respect and do better too in order for things to change.",
        "background": "Men's violence towards girls & womxn costs the 2-3 womxns lives per week. Violence via coercive control, sexual assaults, rape & other physical violence cause lasting harm to survivors and perpetrators have a high potential of becoming repeat offenders. Sentencing needs to reflect this and protect.",
