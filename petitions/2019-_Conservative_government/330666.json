Why is it fair that they are reopening pubs, restaurants and hair dresses when NONE OF THESE ARE ESSENTIAL but are still denying dad's to their babies scans especially when they are living in the same household as their partner. Dad's have a right to be at the scans just as much as mothers do and I think it's utterly disgusting that they are still being denied to scans. Something needs to be done!!",
