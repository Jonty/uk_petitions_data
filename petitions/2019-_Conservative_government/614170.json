        "additional_details": "We believe the Government is wasting time and money using private companies to conduct face-to-face assessments for renewals. This is also contributing to a huge backlog of renewals. People who no longer require PIP will not be able to provide an up to date medical supporting letter, and renewal of a claim could be declined on that basis.",
        "background": "For those in receipt of Personal Independence Payment (PIP), on renewal no further face-to-face assessments should be required. The renewal form with a recent letter of medical evidence, should be sufficient to make a decision about renewal.",
