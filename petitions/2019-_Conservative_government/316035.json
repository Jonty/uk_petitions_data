The Queen is the wealthiest landowner in the world and is personally worth \u00a3530 million.  Prince Andrew is worth \u00a332 million.  The British taxpayer should not be made to finance this wedding to any amount, and not the security bill.  The British Monarchy are rich enough to pay for this wedding themselves.",
