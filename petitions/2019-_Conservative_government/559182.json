        "additional_details": "If the dates are revised then animal owners will be able to better prepare for popular firework events - Bonfire Night and New Years Eve. The number of nights that fireworks are set off by the public could be massively reduced if they are not as easily accessible. This will help to limit the distress that is caused to so many animals predominantly between the months of October - January. There have been incidents in which have animals have died due to the distress caused by continuous fireworks.",
        "background": "The government should revise the dates that fireworks can be sold to the public. My understanding is registered sellers can sell them between 15th Oct - 10th Nov, 26th - 31st Dec and from licensed shops all year round. Proposed different dates for ALL sellers-\r\n 1st - 6th Nov \r\n28th - 31st Dec",
