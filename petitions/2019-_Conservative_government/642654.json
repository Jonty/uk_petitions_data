        "additional_details": "When senior managers make serious errors in the NHS it can have a severe effect on patients. A lot of times these managers are moved to other high profile and well paid jobs in the NHS. They rarely face disciplinary action or consequences for this. There should be a process where any such serious error of judgement or poor management is referred to an external agency with specific guidelines for investigation and action. The current process is not fit for purpose. There should be an easier way to raise concerns externally and a more robust process of checks.",
        "background": "Make changes in the current weak and rarely used policies to hold hospital management responsible for serious errors of judgement or poor management.",
