To show our appreciation we should celebrate with a bank holiday in their honour. There are no bank holidays between August and December so October 26th would be a good time during school holidays to have bank holiday.\r\n\r\nNot only would this be a time to honour them it would also serve as a reminder of the hard work we all did in pulling together for the collective, greater good.",
