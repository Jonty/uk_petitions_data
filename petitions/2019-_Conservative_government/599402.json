        "additional_details": "Our young have suffered so much over the past 20 months not being able to fully live their lives, been in lockdown, paying high university fees for probably the least quality in teaching ever ... and in order to be able to go out to socialise again have been hoodwinked into getting vaccinated against an illness which presents very little threat to them. Therefore I think these centres need to take responsibility for adverse reactions etc.",

For example, we could accept a petition calling for universities to be liable for vaccine damages where they have made vaccination a condition of enrollment."
