The government has failed to protect these workers who were laid off during this crisis as promised at the beginning of lockdown.",
        "background": "A financial help scheme for those who were made redundant due to Covid19 and their former employer is refusing to re-employ to furlough them. I think all who were made redundant because of this crisis should be entitled to the 80% furlough. This group have been left with nothing.",
