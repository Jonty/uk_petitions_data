        "additional_details": "In essence this would mean that children would be away from school for over 5 months if they were to go back in September. As parents our work load is pushed to maximum trying to keep our children happy, distracted and making sure they aren't suffering from not seeing friends, family and loved ones as well trying to look after ourselves. This being said home learning, unintentionally takes a back seat and children aren't getting the knowledge and learning they need from a school setting",
        "background": "Writing this children, have already been away from school for nearly two and a half months. If the schools are to open, any where from the 1st to the 15th June, children will only have a minimum of a 4 week part time school experience before they break up for the summer holidays.",
