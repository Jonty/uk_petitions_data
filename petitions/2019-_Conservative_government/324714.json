        "additional_details": "The UK government should immediately halt the sale of tear gas, rubber bullets and riot shields to the US. The UK government records show it grants export licences worth millions of pounds for the sale of anti-crowd gas, riot equipment as rubber bullets \u2013 but the government\u2019s own rules say such exports should not go ahead where they are likely to be used for internal repression. Due to the police violence which is widely evidenced across the US, we must cease these exports immediately.",
        "background": "The Government should announce a freeze  in accordance with British law, on the exporting of all policing and security equipment to the United States. As the internal repression escalates in America, we see the US government attacking peaceful protestors, journalists, and activists hourly.",
