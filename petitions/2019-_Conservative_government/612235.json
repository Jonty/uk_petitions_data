        "action": "Adequately fund and reform children and young peoples' mental health services",
        "additional_details": "The scale of the mental health epidemic in the UK is unprecedented. If action is not taken there will be knock-on effects, such as further strain on the NHS and wider economic problems. Year-long waiting lists defeat any attempt at early intervention. The lack of training in CAMHS resulted in a girl who attempted to take her own life by drowning being told to take a bath. I'm making an appeal with hope that action will be taken in response to protect young people with mental health issues.",
        "background": "Create a progressive spending plan that reflects the reality of the situation. Systematic change for services acting negligently towards children. More trained professionals for urgent referrals. Publish CAMHS waiting list data and progress reports. Launch an independent review into CAMHS.",
