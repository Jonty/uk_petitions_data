        "additional_details": "40\u00b0C is not a normal temperature for the UK, yet it happened this July. If we don't act now, climate change will only get worse.\r\n\r\nAn effective way to tackle this it is to transform the way we produce electricity. Scientific advancements have made it possible to phase out non-renewables: renewable energy is cheaper (than non-renewables) and easy to build on a large scale but are less reliable. As nuclear plants are both safe and reliable, a hybrid system of both should help cut down greenhouse emissions.",
        "background": "This petition calls for investment in a hybrid system of renewable energy (solar panels and wind turbines) with nuclear power plants, to be built on a national scale. This will combine the advantages of both to help make a real difference to the climate crisis.",
