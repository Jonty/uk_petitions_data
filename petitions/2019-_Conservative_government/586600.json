        "additional_details": "We want children to have an awareness of DV to be able to understand and identify if they ever find themselves in that or witness that situation. This is critical as experiencing and/or witnessing DV can have a long-lasting impact on a child's development and wellbeing which conflicts with their rights. It also gives children the knowledge to be aware if they are or ever end up in that situation, the help available to them and it could encourage them to be more confident reporting it.",
        "background": "Introduce learning about domestic violence and abuse into the education curriculum across schools to educate children from a young age as this relates to their own immediate health and wellbeing and others around them. It is so important for children to understand the signs of abuse.",
