Parents shouldn\u2019t have to worry about getting negative comments when feeding their child. Staff need to be aware of the laws in order to know how to deal with any customers who may make negative comments, but also to ensure they are not breaking the law themselves by making inappropriate comments and making mothers uncomfortable.",
        "background": "I\u2019ve recently been discriminated against at a local cafe by being told that in order to breastfeed my daughter I would need to \u201ccover up\u201d and to do it \u201cdiscreetly\u201d. All employers should ensure their staff understand the laws regarding breastfeeding so other mothers don\u2019t have a negative experience.",
