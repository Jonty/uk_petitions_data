        "additional_details": "Smaller councils, already struggling with current economic conditions, are unable to accept the level of risk associated with grants. This is distorting the process with more grants to affluent areas increasing inequality.\r\n\r\nWe are pleading with UK government to review these terms & conditions that place all risks of grant awards on Councils. Please remove or confirm that otherwise well managed projects that may be affected by unpredictable market supply conditions will not be further penalised.",
