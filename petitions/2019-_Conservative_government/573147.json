        "additional_details": "The database would allow animal owners to have more control over the welfare of the animal. This is the only way we can stop convicted people from purchasing and possibly neglecting another animal. \r\nMany convicted animal abusers go on to ignore any ban imposed and purchase or sell animals, subjecting them to the same mistreatment they were previously convicted for. \r\nI\u2019ve seen first hand the trauma, pain, suffering, injuries etc that has been inflicted on animals that would bring people to tears.",
        "background": "Bans on keeping animals are hard to enforce as currently no national register exists. This petition argues that a national register on a government website should be created listing all individuals who have been convicted of animal cruelty and have been banned from keeping animals.",
