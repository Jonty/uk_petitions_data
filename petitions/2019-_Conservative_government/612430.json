        "action": "Bring back cosmetic surgery on the NHS with people with breast asymmetry",
        "additional_details": "Due to breast asymmetry surgery being taken away from the NHS unless someone has breast cancer this is causing women to have to turn to the private sector and this can cost up to \u00a35000 or more. Which a lot of people cannot afford. So the NHS offers patients breast moulds to cover this up however it doesn\u2019t help with mental health and causes insecurities as this can still be noticeable and doesn\u2019t solve the problem. Please bring this surgery back to help women with mental health and body image.",
        "background": "Breast surgery for asymmetry was taken away from surgeries that the NHS do unless you have breast cancer a few years ago. I would like to be changed and brought back to people that need the surgery to help with mental health and body image confidence.",
