        "additional_details": "There may be a strong chance that a high number of private rental tenants could fall into or further into debt. Having a supportive plan in place may help alleviate debt and possible implications of mental health. Social housing has far better security and a drastically lower rental fee. \r\n\r\nLong-term a supportive plan may positively impact the economy, homelessness, and mental health along with keeping the private rental sector down.",
        "background": "With the current cost of living crisis having a negative impact on private renter's, implement an effective plan that supports the needs of private renters such as rental caps and the option of a 24 month contract with a rent freeze.",
