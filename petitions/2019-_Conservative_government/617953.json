        "additional_details": "The is is because the cost of acquiring an English certificate from organizations like IELTs can be diverted towards other means and also the delays of IELTs result can cause a defying of admission to the next year when students pass the deadline of submission of an English certificate. Most times caused by the examination board at IELTs for late issuance of certificate",
        "background": "I would appreciate if universities in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland stop asking Nigerians applying to study with them for English qualifications as Nigerians are an English speaking nation. With English being the first language in the country over 99% of Nigerians can speak fluent English",
