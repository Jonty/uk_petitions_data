        "additional_details": "We need to be leading the way on environmental issues such as this. It is not okay for the UK to be exporting plastic. We should be actively looking into sustainable alternatives to plastic use in the UK and also stepping up our own recycling abilities. It is also not okay that we are asking poorer countries to take our waste, for then it to pollute the environment in so many harmful ways. This is a global concern, that we have the utmost responsibility for.",
        "background": "The UK currently is the second largest exporter of plastic to poorer countries. The EU have banned export of plastic from 1 January 2021, however we have not. The plastic that we export often ends up in the ocean polluting the ecosystems of our planet, or it is burnt or ends up as land fill waste.",
