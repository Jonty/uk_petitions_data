Website couldn't deal with this so i called the council. I was told can't speak to anyone. This is ridiculous. How are you supposed to get this resolved?  Public are paying for a service which isn't being provided and councils cannot hide behind Covid and use it as an excuse so public can't get in touch.",

For complicated queries, we need to speak to someone in council departments. Councils must not use Covid as an excuse to avoid providing services.",
