        "additional_details": "Without in-cell telephones, prisoners must use a communal phone which can generally only be accessed during daytime office hours.\r\n\r\nThis leaves prisoners unable to contact family members who have daytime work or educational commitments.\r\n\r\nThis is distressing not only for the prisoner, but also for their loved ones, who have committed no offences but are equally deprived of contact. \r\n\r\nIn-cell telephones in all prisons would strengthen family ties and reduce distress for the families of prisoners.",
        "background": "In-cell telephones in all prisons would strengthen family ties and reduce distress for the families of prisoners. \r\n\r\nA 2017 review by Lord Farmer found that strong ties between prisoners and their families can help to reduce reoffending.",
