        "additional_details": "Universities have remained open during lockdown to provide face to face teaching for students.  Many students have tested positive for  COVID 19 but most have experienced no or minor symptoms. However they may be transmitting the virus to staff who work on campus. The risk assessment process does not allow for older staff and those with moderate heath concerns to work from home and thus many staff are fearful of coming to work although they understand the importance of remaining open for the well being of students. Please make sure they can receive the vaccine before term starts after Christmas.",
