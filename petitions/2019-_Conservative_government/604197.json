        "additional_details": "Higher education offers skills which are vital for our nation\u2019s future, so should be funded centrally by the Government & not through the process of fees. Graduates can & do contribute greatly to wider society, and shouldn't shoulder the debt, especially because many of them may not be able to earn above the threshold or could even be unemployed, especially disabled graduates. \r\n  \r\nThe Government need to reconsider whether the money spent on the long-term administration of student loans is worth it. ",
        "background": "During the petition debate for https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/550344, it was stated that only 25% of university graduates pay off their debt. 75% of graduates do not expect to pay back their tuition fees in full and the debt will eventually be written off after 30 years.",
