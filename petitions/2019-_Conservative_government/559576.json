Animals suffer with all kinds of anxiety and stress. \r\nThe emergency services also have their workload unnecessarily increased due to accidents and fires caused whether they\u2019re genuine accidents or results from stupidity! I appreciate the children enjoy them but would they not have more enjoyment at an organised event with family and friends in a safe environment preferably away from all animals!",
