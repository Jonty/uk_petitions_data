        "additional_details": "It is evident that resident marine mammals are vulnerable to boat strike. Due to their frequent interaction with humans and watercraft, these animals can get closer and suffer injury. Generally the speed limit outside of bays increases from five to ten knots which is double the speed. Marine mammals going between the speed limits are very vulnerable. Clear signage and a review of a slowly increasing limit could encourage more caution from watercraft users.",
        "background": "The Government should establish a system for registering the presence of marine mammals, and requiring relevant authorities to take action to protect these animals. Action should include establishing speed guidelines for watercraft and marine signage to indicate presence of marine mammals.",
