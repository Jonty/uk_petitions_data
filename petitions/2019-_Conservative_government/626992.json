Our Armed Forces, who are willing to fight for you and your loved ones freedom and security, are also not entitled to the national minimum wage. They have & will continue to pay the ultimate price to defend you. A new recruit in the Army Reserve is paid just \u00a342.29/day. An Army day is often 24hrs. This is unacceptable. We demand all Armed Forces personnel receive the national minimum wage",
        "background": "The British armed forces are ready, able and willing to give the ultimate sacrifice in order to defend you, your family, our country and its values. Given the current war in Europe we should be especially grateful for their contribution to society. Why then are they not entitled to the minimum wage?",
