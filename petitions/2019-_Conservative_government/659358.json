We understand that you are concerned about the cost of free-from food, but we're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nThe pricing of individual products would be a matter for suppliers and retailers, not the UK Government or Parliament. You could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, we could accept a petition calling for the Government to fund vouchers or prescriptions for allergy sufferers to subsidise free-from foods, if this is something you would like to see happen.\r\n\r\nWe have already published the following petition, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nIntroduce voucher scheme: free gluten-free food for those with coeliac disease: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/658203"
