        "additional_details": "The Welsh Government has failed to produce convincing evidence to support claims of safety with a blanket change of 30mph to 20mph across Wales. The broad-brush approach is indiscriminate and is not needed throughout Wales. To date, the Welsh Government have refused to reconsider the new law and it's time for National Government to intervene.",
        "background": "We request that His Majesty's Government legislates such that powers over national speed limits are returned to National Government.\r\n\r\nThe new 20mph law has come into force on the 17th September 2023 in Wales and a Welsh Government petition for it to be revoked has gained momentum nationally.",
