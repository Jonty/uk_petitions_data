        "additional_details": "Rather than use the summer to catch up with the national curriculum, which will create yet more pressure for young people, we should create opportunities for them to be together relaxing, playing and having fun: experiences central to their learning, development and mental health and almost totally denied to them during lockdown. The Summer of Fun would also provide a crucial source of paid employment for those in the creative and events sectors.",
        "background": "We ask the government to coordinate and fund a 6-week \u2018Summer of Fun\u2019: an engaging programme of free events and activities for young people to enable them to relax, to heal, and to be together. This would include, but not be confined to, arts and crafts, music, theatre, dance, games and sports.",
