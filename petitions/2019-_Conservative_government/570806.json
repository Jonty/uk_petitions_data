In addition, all CBILS lenders should be encouraged to offer 10 year CBILS offerings. the Virus has impacted everyone far more than initially anticipated and therefore some flexibility on these matters would be very well received.",

For those early applicants, the first payments will be due soon but the virus has not allowed sufficient trading to allow for this.",
