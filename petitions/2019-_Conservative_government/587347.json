It has been cut to shreds and isn\u2019t fit for purpose. Therefore I am petitioning for non-clinical  mental wellbeing to become an integral part of the school curriculum so that this unnecessary suicide epidemic stops. \r\n\r\nThis pandemic has only exasperated the situation and God knows where we\u2019ll be after. \r\n\r\nPlease I beg you be the change you want to see in this world. End suicide now.",

Kids don\u2019t get taught how to handle feelings, emotions, how to cope with life, loss, adversity and neither did their parents so something needs to change now \r\n\r\nThis needs to change",
