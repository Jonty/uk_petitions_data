So much trauma and anxiety can be caused for children and their families.\r\n \r\nChildren put into 'restraint' or 'seclusion' rooms are often left unattended for lengthy periods of time. We believe this is barbaric treatment of children and young people and is totally unacceptable in this day and age.
