        "additional_details": "The current economic turmoil and due to the Corona virus pandemic, the job market has been highly affected and there are not enough jobs available in the market. The situation has been very unfortunate for the students and a lot of money has been spent without the possibility of having the opportunity to apply for jobs in the current job market. It\u2019s a sincere request to allow the current Tier 4 students to also be eligible for a 2 year work visa which is only applicable for incoming students of 2020 and not 2019.",
        "background": "In light of the current situation, we would like to request the Government to extend all the Tier 4 visa with a 2 year extension to stay in the country and apply for jobs. The 2 year extension is applicable to the incoming students of 2020 but it will be fair to include the existing students as well",
