Given the task the motor trade could adapt to facilitate testing of these vehicles as part of the existing MOT test process.\r\n\r\nAllowing hybrid and mild hybrid vehicles to continue to drive around completely unchecked is not consistent with creating a clean environment.\r\n \r\nThe Government should take this very simple action to help ensure our planet's survival.\r\n",
