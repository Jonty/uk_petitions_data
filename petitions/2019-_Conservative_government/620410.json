        "additional_details": "Cost of living is at a record high, what with fuel costs and living costs it's just too much. e-bikes can help people save money on travel costs, encourage healthier lifestyles (so less demand on NHS services), cut road congestion. \r\n \r\n250 watts does not provide the power needed to make e-bikes suitable for everyone, so many people are sticking with cars!\r\n",
        "background": "Increasing the maximum allowed power of an e-bike, but not the speed, from 250 watts to 750 watts would enable e-bikes to be designed for larger people, for whom most current e-bikes are not suitable. This could help more people get into cycling, and make fewer journeys by car.",
