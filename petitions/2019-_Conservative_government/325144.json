Give people a safe outlet to protest, and show support for such an important movement. No noise, just a minute of silence outside our houses to show support and to contemplate the destruction and injustice racism has caused throughout history and continues to cause today. Let\u2019s put a stop to racism.",
        "background": "Similarly to the NHS clap, I would like the government to encourage and take part in a minute of silence, every Saturday at 6pm to show support of the BLM movement. No clapping, banging pots and pans, or fireworks, just everyone standing outside their house and taking a minute to show support.",
