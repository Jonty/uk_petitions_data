        "additional_details": "Many independent footwear retailers provide a support service to healthcare professionals such as Podiatrists, Physiotherapists, Paediatricians, Orthopaedic clinics, and a variety of Consultants. Children's growth rates can happen in a matter of weeks so it is vital that parents have access to professionally fitted footwear for their children especially those that are coping with lower limb challenges such as Hypermobility and EDS. Footwear management is also vital for people with Diabetes.",
        "background": "Foot and lower limb health should receive the same recognition as other healthcare support services and be allowed to stay open during any restrictions. Feet never stop growing and changing throughout our lifetime and professionally fitted footwear can have a major positive impact.",
