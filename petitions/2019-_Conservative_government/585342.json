        "additional_details": "If you have a gambling problem emails and phone notifications only encourage someone to go back onto the site and fall back into the trap of gambling. With no limits online there is a possibility people can lose everything. Just from an offer of a free \u00a35 or free spins encourages people to go back. People I know have serious issues with gambling. I believe that this needs looking at urgently. People who try to shield themselves from these companies are often the people who get the most emails.",
        "background": "I believe that all gambling marketing emails or phone notifications, such as those about current offers, should be against the law as it can encourage problem gamblers who are trying to take a break from online gambling abuse to slip back onto the sites that they are trying to stay away from.",
