        "background": "The Coronavirus Pandemic is probably one of the biggest public health Crises that the UK has faced for Generations, and is spreading like wildfire across Europe.\r\nThis Government should, in response, close our Borders to new arrivals from Europe and countries most affected, to help slow the spread.",
