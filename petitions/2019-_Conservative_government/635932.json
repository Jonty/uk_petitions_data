        "additional_details": "SEN children in Academy schools face disproportionate suspensions & exclusions due to outdated behaviour policies. Government & Parliament must intervene to ensure equal opportunities, end discrimination, and promote an inclusive learning environment. These actions will benefit not only SEN children, but also improve the overall educational system, fostering empathy, understanding, and a more equitable society. Investing in the future of all children is essential for the UK's social and economic progress.",
        "background": "We urge the UK Govt. & Parliament to reform behaviour policies in Academy schools for SEN children: mandate inclusive policies, provide specialised training, promote collaboration, ensure accountability & monitoring, and invest in research for continuous improvement. #InclusiveEducation #SENReform",
