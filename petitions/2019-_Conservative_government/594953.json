By delaying this years submission the educational opportunities of these students are at risk of disappearing under Taliban rule.\r\n\r\nIt is morally wrong to leave these students behind in an increasingly dangerous situation and deny them of this prestigious, life-changing opportunity, particularly female students who are at high risk of losing their education under Taliban rule.",
