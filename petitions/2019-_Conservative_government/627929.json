        "additional_details": "Retail parks and supermarkets and coffee shops are places people spend time at their leisure and browse they also pay hefty business rates and taxes . Private car park owners are manipulating the situation to benefit their own money making scheme. Setting unrealistic time limits on how long people can stay for affecting trade for retailers. Giving out hefty fines for car owners if they exceed the time limit. This style of money making constitutes entrapment.",
        "background": "Ban private car parks from fining people who stay over the unrealistic times stipulated when shopping in the area. The retail sector is already in a state of dismay and this creates a barrier for shoppers. Hefty fines leave people in debt and struggling to pay and are harassed by the companies.",
