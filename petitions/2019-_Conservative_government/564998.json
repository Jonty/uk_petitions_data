        "additional_details": "Student teachers will spend 30-35 hours a week working in school. The government have recently scrapped bursaries for most subjects and all primary school trainees. A good teacher can change a child's life for ever, however the government's decision shows no respect for the profession. This decision will leave student teachers unable to buy basic necessities and transport to and from placements. Student teachers are working in schools and should be paid for the work they do.",
        "background": "Student teachers should be paid a basic wage for the hours that they spend in schools, which is full time and leaves no time to be able to work outside of their training. Student finance often does not cover trainee\u2019s rent and bills, leaving them unable to buy food or transport to placements.",
