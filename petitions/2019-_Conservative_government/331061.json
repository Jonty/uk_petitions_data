        "additional_details": "The UK\u2019s approach to plastic recycling is a sham and the environmental harm being caused is immoral. \r\n\r\nAs seen on TV, much of the UK\u2019s plastic waste is being exported to places like Turkey and Asia, where much of the waste is burned, poisoning the environment. \r\n\r\nIf the UK builds sufficient plastic waste processing plants, we can take responsibility for our own waste, and stop exporting our problem. \r\n\r\nThis will create jobs, reduce environmental harm, and improve the UK\u2019s international reputation.",
        "background": "Plastic waste processing plants should be built across the UK. Plastic waste should be processed in a way to minimize environmental harm. Within three years the export of plastic waste should be banned.",
