        "additional_details": "Common sense dictates that nobody with an active Covid-19 infection should be discharged from hospital into a care home yet PHE guidance persists in advising care homes that patients can be effectively isolated. \r\n\r\nThere is still chance to save care homes which are virus free, enable the infected homes to eventually recover and prevent more deaths of our vulnerable elderly. \r\n\r\nNightingale Hospitals/specialised isolation units need to be utilised until patients are free of the virus.",
        "background": "As of 24th April 1/3 of care homes in England have reported an outbreak of Covid-19 with 5,281 deaths.\r\n\r\nPublic Health England (PHE) policy is to discharge positive Covid-19 patients to care homes. \r\n\r\nThe NHS has capacity yet rapid discharge continues and needs urgent review.",
