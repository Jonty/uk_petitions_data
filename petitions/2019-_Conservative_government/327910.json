        "additional_details": "The current fee for registering a child as a British citizen is \u00a31,012, while the Home Office\u2019s estimated processing cost for this application is \u00a3372. That represents a surplus of \u00a3640 per application. Families are put under enormous pressure by this. \r\nA landmark judgment from the High Court in December 2019 found that the Home Office\u2019s child citizenship fee is unlawful. The court found a \u201cmass of evidence\u201d showing the fee prevented many children from registering for British citizenship, leaving them feeling \u201calienated, excluded, \u2018second-best\u2019, insecure and not fully assimilated into the culture and social fabric of the UK\u201d.",
        "background": "UK has some of the highest child citizenship fees in Europe.This high fee level means that children may be prevented from accessing their right to citizenship . Furthermore, numerous increases in the price of the application make it almost impossible for people afford to pay the price.",
