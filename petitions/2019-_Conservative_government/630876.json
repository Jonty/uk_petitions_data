Students work a variety of days, nights, and weekends; playing a vital role in ensuring the needs of patients are met.",
        "background": "It's no secret that the NHS is understaffed, and scrapping the \u00a327,550 price-tag attached to an undergraduate nursing degree could help attract more to the profession. Let's not forget that students already work 37.5 hours a week for free on busy wards.",
