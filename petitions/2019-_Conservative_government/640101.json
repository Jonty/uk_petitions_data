Four petitions in four years - each triggered parliamentary debates, with a total of 684,970 signatures.\r\n\r\nFollowing a recommendation from the Pet Theft Taskforce, the Government added pet abduction (\"taking of pets\") to the Animal Welfare (Kept Animals) Bill in November 2021. \r\n\r\nThe Government dropped the Kept Animals Bill in May 2023.",

The Government should recognise the emotional & welfare impacts this crime has on people & pets by introducing a 'pet abduction' offence.",
