        "additional_details": "Ear cropping is illegal in England and Wales, under Section 5 of the Animal Welfare Act 2006. It's a painful process where a dog's outer ears are removed altogether or are surgically altered, with the tips or huge sections of the outer ear being cut off.\r\nIt's against the law to carry out this procedure yourself or to send your dog to a vet in this country or abroad to have their ears cropped. Unfortunately, it still happens and many UK owners are purchasing puppies from Europe for this purpose.",
        "background": "Fine the buying of, or owning of a canine that has had the procedure of 'ear cropping' in the UK, or has had it prior to arriving in the UK, from birth to 1 year, in order to protect dogs from the inhumane mutilation of the removal of all or part of it's ear flaps for cosmetic reasons.",
