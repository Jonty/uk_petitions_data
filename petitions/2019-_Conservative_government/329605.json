        "action": "Make the teaching of Black History mandatory in all UK schools",
        "additional_details": "Throughout my entire 14 academic school years, I was never taught the subject of black history. It wasn't until year 12 when I took it upon myself to gain a greater understanding of racism and the impacts that it had/has on society. Without doing this, I wouldn't have known about the relentless prejudiced attitudes and acts that black individuals face everyday just because of their skin colour. Whilst schools are closed, now is the perfect time to implement change.",
        "background": "I strongly believe that by incorporating Black History into teaching within the UK, we would be taking a massive step towards promoting equality. Whether it be in History, English or PSHE, the curriculum must become more diverse and representative. Black History month is not enough.",
