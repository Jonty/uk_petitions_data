However Ofcom only regulate the BBC, Channel 3, Channel 4, Channel 5 and S4C. We're not sure whether you would like your petition to extend Ofcom's remit for regulating these channels, or whether you would like Ofcom to regulate other channels.\r\n\r\nWe're also not sure what you mean by website content. It is already under Ofcom's remit to regulate video-on-demand services, so you need to be clear what other website content you would like to see regulated.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
