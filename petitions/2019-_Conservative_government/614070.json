        "additional_details": "Analysts believe that a privatised C4 would face a 40-50% cut to its \u00a3660m programming budget. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, it is reported that 90% of respondents to the public consultation said it was \u201ca bad idea\u201d. \r\n\r\nA report published by government found that the number of C4 jobs would fall by 18%. \r\n\r\nBenefits of a cash windfall to government are greatly outweighed by the detrimental impact on the independent TV sector.\r\n\r\nExamples of C4 broadcasts: The Great British Bake Off, Gogglebox, Friday Night Dinner.",
        "background": "Revoke plans to privatise Channel 4. There is no sound economic or social reason to do so.\r\n\r\nPrivatisation threatens less profitable programmes like news/current affairs and reduces its capacity to nurture new talent/innovation.\r\n\r\nC4 does not cost the taxpayer - the money it makes is reinvested.",
