        "additional_details": "Recently non-essential businesses such as pubs, bars and cinemas have been given the okay to open on July 4th. Tattoo studios have been told they cannot.\r\n\r\nStaff at these businesses will have little to no training on health and safety, yet they will open.\r\n\r\nAt tattoo studios all staff are carefully trained on cross contamination, every surface is covered and cleaned down multiple times a day and PPE is readily accessible and constantly used (even before COVID-19). We should be allowed to open.",
        "background": "The UK government should allow tattoo and piercing shops/parlours to reopen on May 4th alongside Hair Salons and Barbers rather than including them in the list of places that aren't allowed to open (alongside nightclubs and water parks?!)",
