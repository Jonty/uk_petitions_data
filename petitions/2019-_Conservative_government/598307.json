        "additional_details": "There is an endemic culture of sexism and misogyny in this country, which leads to incidences of male violence against women and girls. This culture begins early and must be tackled within our education system, but calls for changes to the PHSE curriculum do not go far enough. The DfE must require and support schools to review both the content and teaching of the entire curriculum to erase gender bias and tackle the root of this issue.",
        "background": "The Department for Education should adopt a whole curriculum approach to tackling sexism in schools. The content & teaching of every subject must be reviewed & reformed to address the gender imbalance in taught material, placing equal value on the works, achievements & experiences of women & men.",
