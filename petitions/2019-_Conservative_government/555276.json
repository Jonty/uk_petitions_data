        "additional_details": "There are currently thousands of organisations, charities and support groups for Domestic Violence victims. Yet, as it stands, the law can prevent abusers from being investigated and charged.\r\n \r\nAs a victim myself, it took over a year from starting counselling to speak up about all my pain and suffering. Only to be told I was too late. Not only is this damaging, it may fail to prevent new victims. We are victims too. Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow. More need to be done to protect people.",
        "background": "Since Domestic Violence is not a specific Criminal Offence, suspects will be investigated for related offences. If the reported abuse is categorised as \u2018Common Assault\u2019, time limits mean victims can be denied an investigation despite building the strength, courage and willpower to come forward.",
