        "background": "Whilst Boris Johnson was the mayor of London he bought a number of water cannons just in case he needed them for demonstrations, but the current mayor Sadiq Khan got rid of them saying they were a waste of time well in hindsight how wrong could he be in the heat of the current situation.",
