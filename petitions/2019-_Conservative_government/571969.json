        "additional_details": "Two-years of NQT induction, training and assessing against the teacher standards will not directly lead to teacher retention more aversion, since a lot of my fellow colleagues are re-considering completing their NQT year due to the strenuous amounts of pressure they have had to face whilst training to teach during COVID. If the government really wanted to look at how better to encourage early-career retention rate then it should look towards reducing teacher accountability and the constant assessing of teacher standards. More time should be allocated to continued professional development in teaching the subject they have chosen and that should be across the whole teaching body not only to early-career staff.",
        "background": "The statutory duration of the NQT induction should remain as one academic year.  My fellow colleagues strongly believe that to wait for another year to fully qualify as a teacher is arduous and counter-productive.",
