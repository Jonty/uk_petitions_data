It is clear that these measures must now return to support and protect those in sectors such as hospitality, entertainment and travel whose otherwise viable income sources have stopped or been substantially impaired as UK citizens follow public health guidance for extreme caution to control COVID-19 infection rates",
        "background": "As one of the wealthiest global economies, provide appropriate financial support to protect the livelihoods of UK individuals and businesses whose incomes are being adversely affected by the public health protection measures required to control soaring COVID-19 transmission rates in the community.",
