What can we do to deter the perpetrators?\r\nWhen my abuser signed the Sex Offenders Register, I was shocked to learn that this wasn\u2019t information that he had to disclose with future partners and it wasn\u2019t something that the public would be able to access. Would the fear of public knowledge be enough to make perpetrators think twice? I think it is about time we find out.",

This would give people the power and the confidence to ensure their safety in a number of situations.",
