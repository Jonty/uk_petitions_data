        "additional_details": "We believe that with recent local council failures, which could pass millions of pounds of debt to council tax payers, it\u2019s evident that some Councillors are ill prepared to make the massive financial decisions which now fall on their shoulders. We think the part time nature of the role inhibits the full time contributions that modern councils need to make in order to provide services to residents. This structure needs to change to increase accountability on local councils.",
        "background": "We would like to see the role of a local Councillor change from part-time to full-time and for it to be a paid position. We also ask for these full-time councillors to be fully trained and tested in financial management and for the results of these test to be made available to the public.",
