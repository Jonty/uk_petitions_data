        "additional_details": "When a person involved in any sort of abuse to children the justice system always disappoints when It comes to sentencing the person involved, the public have noticed other crimes have longer sentences e.g growing a small amount of cannabis, how can cannabis a plant that grows naturally harm people worse than a paedophile harms a child? This is why we want cannabis to be legalised in the UK and for any person involved with child abuse to get a longer and harsher sentence.",
        "background": "We want the government to make sentencing harsher/longer for people who commit and are involved with grooming children, child abuse and any type of paedophilia and also want the government to legalise the use of cannabis for health conditions, in a person's own property and in certain venues.",
