        "additional_details": "Last year 2020, Teachers awarded grades to students without any formal assessment. There was a very high degree of subjectivity which gave room for most of the Black and Ethnic Minority students in white dominated schools to be discriminated against by some unprofessional racist teachers.\r\nCovid is no respecter of persons, and considering the recent worldwide racial outcry against Blacks as spearheaded by the Black Lives Matter Movement, exams will be the most unbiased grading system.",
        "background": "Government must ensure all students are given equal playing field to tackle this year's exams. Doing so will prevent parents, especially, of Black and ethnic minorities from complaining about their children  being discriminated against in white dominated schools with respect to grade awarding",
