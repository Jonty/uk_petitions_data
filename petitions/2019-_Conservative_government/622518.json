        "additional_details": "Women already already treated far worse than men are in society and taking away abortion rights is just a nail in the coffin. Women deserve to have a choice over their own body and other people shouldn't have a say in the matter. There are many scenarios where having an abortion is a reasonable option. E.g. if a women is raped then she can't be expected to keep the baby.\r\nWe shouldn't be prioritising unwanted, unborn children over women that could have their lives destroyed by having children.",
        "background": "All I would like the government to do is make society a more equal place for women, to start doing this, keeping abortions legal and within a woman's right is a great step in the right direction. Abortions are needed in a lot of unfortunate situations. You cannot take it away. Keep abortions legal.",
