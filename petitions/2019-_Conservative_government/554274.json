The pay increase of \u00a33,360 will take an MP\u2019s basic salary to \u00a385,291, whilst throughout the UK thousands are losing jobs due to the Covid crisis. It is wholly inappropriate for any such increase in MP\u2019s pay at this time, and the proposed IPSA plans should be scrapped in their entirety.",
