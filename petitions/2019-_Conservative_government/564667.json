Equipment is socially distant and majority of individuals train alone and stick to government guidelines. Fitness is extremely beneficial for those suffering with mental health issues, many relying on fitness facilities to keep themselves mentally stable. Closing indoor gyms once again will have a substantial negative effect on mental health sufferers.",
