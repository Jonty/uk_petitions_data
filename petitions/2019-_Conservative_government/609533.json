        "additional_details": "The UK Government should not act on any military intervention. Instead, it should provide Visa Free Movement to the people of Ukraine, in order to provide safe refuge and protection of their lives and liberties. The people of Ukraine must not be abandoned and left at the mercy of Vladimir Putin, but be given the opportunity to seek peace away from Russia\u2019s Imperial Conquest.\r\n\r\nThis would allow for families separated in Ukraine and the UK to reunite, away from any harm the conflict may bring.",
        "background": "On the 24th February 2022, Russian forces invaded Ukraine, with more than 200 military strikes attacking cities and regions across the country.\r\nThe UK Government, alongside it\u2019s sanctions against Russia, must provide Visa Free Movement to Ukrainians.",
