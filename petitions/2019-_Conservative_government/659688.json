        "additional_details": "We think the books that are often studied for GCSE English amplify out of date, offensive viewpoints to children and reading them creates a lack of interest in English. They can make students feel unrepresented. We think students should be reading books that represent multiple cultures or identities and tell positive stories.\r\n \r\nWe want the Government to amend the English curriculum for Key Stage 4 so that a more diverse range of literature has to be taught.\r\n",
        "background": "For GCSE English students often study books mainly written by white men. There is often a lack of representation of other races in the books studied, and female characters are often portrayed in a negative way. We don't think this reflects our society today.",
