        "additional_details": "The campaign has continued post redundancies and is attempting to petition for the revocation of BA\u2019s lucrative LHR slots. With many jobs of their crew relying on these slots it is extremely counterproductive, and arguably demonstrates the unions lack of interest for its members livelihoods. The use of this leverage campaign has not been consulted by members and has already detracted from meaningful negotiations with BA throughout its existence. Unite must stop and put members first.",
