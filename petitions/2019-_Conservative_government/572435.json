To continue with standard UC procedures during these unprecedented times, is ruthless and unnecessary. \r\n\r\nFor those who have been assessed as 'Gainfully Self Employed', consumer work opportunities and yearly turnover have been vastly reduced due to ongoing Coronavirus social distancing and recurring lockdowns.\r\n\r\nExample - A wedding photographer who is usually employed for 8+ hours, can only attend 15 person micro weddings now.",
