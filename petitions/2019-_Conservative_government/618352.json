We live in world of equality but when fathers are concerned it\u2019s extremely one sided, mothers should be legally required to provide evidence that they are in fact using our CSA payments towards the child and not for personal purposes just as fathers are legally required to provide evidence of earnings to evaluate what we should be paying",
