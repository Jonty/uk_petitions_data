        "additional_details": "Adenomyosis has no known cause, there is little treatment and the only definite cure is a hysterectomy. I suffer with both Adenomyosis and Endometriosis, taking eight years to diagnose, earlier diagnostic times are needed. \r\n\r\nWe need a care pathway for Adenomyosis with treatment plans and support. The condition can impact sufferers lives hugely. We need better awareness surrounding the condition, a reliable source of information and an increase of funding into research.",
        "background": "Adenomyosis is a condition where the endometrium grows into the myometrium and penetrates the tissue, causing the uterus to thicken and enlarge. Symptoms can include heavy menstrual bleeding and extreme pain.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition for achieving to improve healthcare for Adenomyosis sufferers.",

For example, we could accept a petition calling on the Government to fund research to help Adenomyosis patients."
