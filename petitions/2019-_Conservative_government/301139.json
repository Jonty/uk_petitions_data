        "additional_details": "Over the past few years, specialist companies like Livability Holidays and Safehands Holidays who covered this market have ceased trading and this has left a gap in the Disabled Holiday Market. Unfortunately the Equality Act 2010 doesn't \"cut-it\" for the Severely Disabled Person as holidays for an able-bodied person are much cheaper. If such facilities were available in most hotels, then part of this inequality would be redressed or irradicated and would help many Severely Disabled People.",
        "background": "Currently there are only a handful of Hotels in the UK which provide such facilities.\r\n\r\nThe room(s) should include Electric Profile Bed with Cot Sides, Electric Air Pressure Mattress, Overhead Ceiling Hoist, Wet Room with Wheel-In Shower Chair and Wheelchair Friendly Disabled Access throughout.",
