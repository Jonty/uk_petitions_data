        "additional_details": "It is unproven that gender is a choice and not the same as biological sex, and teaching children this is contrary to the views of some conservative groups and religious teachings.\r\n\r\nCurrently, teachers must listen to parents\u2019 concerns, but aren\u2019t obliged to act on them. Religion is a protected characteristic under the equality act, gender identity is not. Disagreeing parents could give conflicting messages, which may create anxiety, distrust in teachers and confusion.\r\n\r\nWe request the right for parents to withdraw their children from lessons where teachings are against their beliefs or religion.",
