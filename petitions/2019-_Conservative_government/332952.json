Religion is a protected characteristic under the equality act, gender identity is not. Disagreeing parents could give conflicting messages, which may create anxiety, distrust in teachers and confusion.\r\n\r\nWe request the right for parents to withdraw their children from lessons where teachings are against their beliefs or religion.",
