        "action": "Stop the DFID-FCO merger.",
        "additional_details": "The merger will worsen life-saving services by making the aid budget subject to the political interests of the Foreign Secretary, meaning key decisions will be in the hands of those with no expertise in global health and poverty. The economic interests of one of the world's richest countries should not come above the lives of those in the world's poorest. DFID performs better in independent reviews of transparency and aid impact than the FCO, and the merger risks more lives lost.",
        "background": "Retain the Department for International Development as an independent body accountable for improving the lives of the world's most vulnerable communities, not for promoting British economic and political interests.",
