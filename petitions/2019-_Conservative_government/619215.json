        "additional_details": "The government need to step in and abolish parking charges for NHS staff.  Without our nurses we wouldn\u2019t have an NHS. Nurses have to work nights/shifts/unsociable hours and driving to work is often the only way to get to work.\r\n\r\nPleas support this petition and stop hospitals charging our nurses for parking at work. Thank you.",
        "background": "I was shocked to find out nurses and others who work in hospital have high monthly parking charges deducted automatically from their wages.  The nurse I know who only had 3 days holiday during the whole of 2020 has \u00a330 deducted from her wage every month just to park near work.",
