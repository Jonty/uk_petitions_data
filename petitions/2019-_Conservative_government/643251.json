        "additional_details": "We have a major crisis with homeless cats. Many rescues are full and cannot help all stray cats. This is because owners are not getting cats neutered allowing them to multiply.\r\n \r\nThe breeding is totally out of control, kittens are being born outside, with some being eaten by other wildlife or creating feral colonies. Come the winter, many may die of hypothermia.\r\n \r\nFuture breeding of cats must be controlled and licensed accordingly.\r\n",
        "background": "In April Spain introduced compulsory sterilisation of cats by six months of age, unless they are registered as breeding animals. We are calling on the Government to tackle the crisis of homeless cats, by making neutering of cats mandatory by six months of age, except of licensed breeding cats.",
