Currently, for example; during a rush hour it may take you 30-40 minutes to get to your station / incident when lives are at risk. Most incidents require a number of team to be on scene to carry out certain applications of rescue. Green lights would not give exemptions to traffic rules but would allow road users to know that an incident is being attended to and could therefore ease congestion en route to an incident, scene or station.",
