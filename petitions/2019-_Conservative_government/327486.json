Once school is out, these families' kids get left behind. Since schools closed because of the crisis, a voucher scheme has made sure these children don\u2019t go hungry. The Government is planning to take these vouchers away. \r\nWe\u2019re calling on the Government to make sure no child goes hungry this summer by funding Free School Meals. We need the Government to save these children.",
