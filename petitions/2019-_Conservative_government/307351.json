        "additional_details": "I would like the government to think more creatively about the plight of the UK\u2019s small businesses (which now make up the vast majority of commercial activity in the country) before it forces businesses already in trouble to borrow their way out a crisis. This means that businesses will go into the post-Coronavirus period carrying debt and assumes that the trading activity will return to normal. The risks for all businesses is too great.",
        "background": "The government has said it will defer VAT payments for SMEs. However this means payments will still be due at a later date. Almost all businesses are now in financial crisis. Cancelling VAT and Corporation Tax means that they won\u2019t have to borrow money from the Govt to pay the Govt.",
