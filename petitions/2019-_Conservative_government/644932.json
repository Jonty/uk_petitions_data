        "additional_details": "The UK is falling behind our neighbours. The US and EU have made progressive steps to bringing pay transparency to work to help improve gender pay gap, and pay equality opportunities for all. Equal pay claims like those in Birmingham will become more regular in the future and we must do something to turn the tide. Businesses will suffer if they aren\u2019t given some legal impetus to change. This isn't just what employees want, its what employers need to maintain equality and safeguard themselves",
        "background": "We want pay transparency laws to be introduced to the UK to ensure employers are legally obliged to include salaries and pay when advertising jobs, and ensure employees have the right upon request to information around pay decisions made concerning their roles (eg how they are made and calculated)",
