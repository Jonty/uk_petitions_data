        "additional_details": "The time for a monopoly on tv channels has well come to pass, they can use adverts like everyone else to gain an income for the corporation, the tv license is outdated and un needed, to be charged simply for having an aerial on your roof is despicable, i personally do not view bbc programming at all because i use streaming services such as netflix or amazon video as do thousands.\r\nI propose an abolishment on rhe BBC's tv licensing and monopoly over the airwaves.\r\nIt should not have been allowed.",
        "background": "The BBC first started the tv license on  the 1/06/1946 , as it is 2020 and they still run this scheme when all other broadcasters use adverts it seems an unfair advantage for them to: \u2022 charge for a licence to watch their shows\r\n\u2022 reserve more bandwidth than they truly need",
