        "action": "Cancel HS2, and use funding to offset against Taxpayer bill for Covid-19 support",
        "additional_details": "Once support for homes and Taxpayers ends for Covid-19, there will undoubtedly be a tax bill that needs to be paid. By cancelling the remaining HS2 programme this will save billions of pounds and help ease any future burden on UK households via tax. HS2 is not needed, it's already long overdue and well over budget, the sensible thing would be cut our losses and move forward. UK Gov should review all major spend commitments, identify those we can do without and repurpose funds to Covid as well.",
        "background": "Request the government cancels HS2 or postpones it until a future date, repurposing the funds to offset against the Taxpayer bill for Covid-19 Support. This would help reduce the Taxpayer bill and alleviate some of the need to increase taxes in the future. HS2 is a luxury can live without.",
