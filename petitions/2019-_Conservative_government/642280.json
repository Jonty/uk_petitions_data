        "additional_details": "Ukraine schemes are limited to 3 years and thousands of visas are set to expire in 2025. The schemes\u2019 duration depends on the end of the war which is unknown. This uncertainty creates lots of pressure for already stressed refugees and makes long-term planning and commitments impossible, which can significantly reduce the quality of life. Alternative visa routes to settle could be costly and not fit for all Ukrainians, putting them at risk of eventually having to leave the UK or stay in the UK illegally.",
