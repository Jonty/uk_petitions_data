        "additional_details": "In March 2023 North Somerset Council used some of a \u00a348 million grant from central government to unnecessarily create a new 24 hour bus lane in the direction of Bristol on the A370 Long Ashton bypass; reducing car lanes from two to one. However only SIX public buses an hour use the new bus lane. Congestion has increased hugely and it takes considerably longer to travel into and out of Bristol. As a result more traffic is also likely to travel through neighbouring Long Ashton village.",
        "background": "Users of the A370 Long Ashton Bypass in North Somerset travelling into Bristol want the unnecessary new bus lane removed and the road returned to two lanes for all traffic to use; and the outgoing A370 from Bristol also returned to two lanes. T",
