Multi-billion pound contracts have been awarded to businesses with little health experience run by Ministers\u2019 friends or family. If they can deliver better value than the NHS they should do so under their own name, and not hide behind the NHS brand. Also any failure of such initiatives undermines confidence in the real NHS, and this is also misleading.",
        "background": "The Government has awarded billions of pounds worth of health contracts to private sector companies which are labelled as \u201cNHS\u201d This is misleading, and if the private firm is not buying a licence to use the NHS brand it is arguably passing itself off as something that is isn\u2019t, which is also illegal",
