        "additional_details": "I feel this is so important to do because it shows that we are moving in a positive direction for humanity. Section 28 enforced a deluded narrative around same-sex relationships and that still exists in the bedrock of some societies in the UK today. Fundamentally this awful narrative is taking lives in the UK every week do doubt about it and feel doing this will enforce a narrative closer to humanity's truth and will save lives.",
        "background": "I want the Government to identify Section 28 as a Crime Against Humanity. This is far from an attack on Margret Thatcher and the Government, but an attack on the toxic deluded narrative that was in place at the time.",
