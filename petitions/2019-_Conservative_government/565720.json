        "additional_details": "The current plan to delay GCSE and A levels by three weeks does not go far enough to make up for the months of school closures and periods of isolation faced by many students.\r\nTherefore, students who do not achieve the results they hope for, or need for their continuing education or career plans, should be given the option of repeating the year by all schools and colleges in order to ensure they reach their full potential.\r\nWe should not allow COVID-19 to negatively affect our children\u2019s futures.",
        "background": "The current year 11 & 13 cohorts have missed a huge chunk of classroom time during the COVID-19 pandemic, as much as 25% of the total GCSE and A level courses.\r\nWhile many schools have maximised the use of online lessons, many students will still be at a disadvantage when the exams begin in June.",
