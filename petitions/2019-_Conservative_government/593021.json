Had there been no crossing patrol to slow down the traffic, the car that hit my son would have been travelling faster and the consequences far greater. \r\nSchool Crossing Patrol is a symbol of trust and safety for children (and parents relinquishing some independence to their older children walking to school) and it would be detrimental to every community to lose such a role who helps to keep our children safe. Please sign the petition to show your support against removing the School Crossing Patrol funding.",
