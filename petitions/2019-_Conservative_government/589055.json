        "additional_details": "I want you to do this because I feel a lot of autistic people are missing out on seeing films at the cinema, because of it being so loud.  I also feel it is important to extend this law to both children's films and those aimed at adults as many adult autistic people will want to go to see such films but don't feel able to because of the noise.  Benefits of this new law should be helping autistic and learning disabled people to experience films at the cinema.",
        "background": "I would like the government to make autism friendly screenings of all cinema films mandatory, this is important to me because as an autistic person one of my passions is film, however due to how loud cinemas are i find going to the cinema far too much.",
