        "action": "Nationalise energy companies who display profiteering motives.",
        "additional_details": "Current energy costs continue to exacerbate the cost of living crisis by applying more pressure on homeowners who are already struggling with other piling costs. Such price rises are excess of the rise in price of resources required to produce this electricity, and the companies with monopoly in the sector continue to profiteer and raise prices higher. The government must step in by either threat of, or full nationaliation of profiteering companies to lift the burden of the energy cost crisis.",
        "background": "Institute a wide ranging reform that would allow for the nationalisation of energy companies who continue to destroy family livelihoods by exacerbating the cost of living crisis using meteoric rises in energy costs to profiteer off the common citizen.",
