        "additional_details": "Public testing saves lives. Evidence suggests that when public testing services such as The Loop are operating on site, festivals see a 10-15% reduction in drug related harm. \r\nCertain 2023 festivals saw crystal methamphetamine being sold on site. Such a substance can easy be missold as MDMA crystals - statistically the most widely used substance at festivals. \r\nPublic testing can prevent such atrocities. Harm reduction and education will always be more effective than a blanket ban.",
        "background": "The Home Office recently introduced a law under which festival organisers who wish to offer on-site public drug testing will have to apply for a license to be able to do so. It can take up to 16 weeks for the license to be approved, at a significant cost.Festivals have been unable to offer testing.",
