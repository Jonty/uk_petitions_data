        "additional_details": "With the need for elderly people to isolate from coronavirus for their protection, many will only have television for \"company\" and for essential information. The introduction of a licence fee for those 75 years of age and over will act as a disincentive to keep even that minimal level of contact with the outside world.",
        "background": "To ensure that the proposed introduction in June 2020 of the television licence fee for those aged over 75 is postponed until at least the coronavirus emergency is declared over.",
