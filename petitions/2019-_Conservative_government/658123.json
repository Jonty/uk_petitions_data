        "additional_details": "This review should consider changes to regulation to ensure Physician Associates are properly regulated and always closely supervised by a senior doctor. They are a potential danger to patients if Physician Associates are working beyond their competency, with the risk of tragic consequences. It must be clear to patients that Physician Associates are not doctors, and we believe they must not be used to mitigate the shortage of doctors in the UK.",
