        "additional_details": "Those who have served their time prior to Covid-19 experienced punishment differently. During Covid inmates in closed prisons have been locked in cells for 23 hours a day. Inmates in the open estate have been unable to access ROTLS. Prisoners serving during the global pandemic are been dually punished. One through an act or omission committed by themselves and the other (the effects of the pandemic) which is wholly out of their control. \r\n\r\nPlease see: HMI Inspectorate Reports",
        "background": "Reduce the time that prisoners have not been able to access purposeful activities off their sentences. The time missed out on education, programmes, work, visits, RDR/ROR (Resettlement day release, resettlement overnight release) should be deducted of their overall sentence.",
