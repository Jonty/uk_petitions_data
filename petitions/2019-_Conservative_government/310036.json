        "additional_details": "All school, high school and college qualifications have been cancelled following the pandemic, this is not career defining as they will receive predicted grades and are not required to sit final exams. University students in the final year still have assignments and dissertations due within weeks, this puts them at an extreme disadvantage and can affect further career options. They should be able to end study now and graduate with predicted grades.",
        "background": "During the covid 19 pandemic universities have closed, while many final year students are expected to continue working on their degrees from home with little to no support. It is only fair that they should graduate with predicted grades, rather than attempt to complete final assignments alone.",
