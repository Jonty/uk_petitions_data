        "additional_details": "Holidays are meant to be a fun time of joyous celebration of achievement in school, work or anything else. But for 37.9 million people this is not the case. The government are not helping already vulnerable people, people who are starving, stressed, sad. Food poverty has doubled in the last year, with 37 percent of parents struggling to feed their children. With the cost of living crisis, I call for the government to make provisions for young people, living under the poverty line, to have free school meals in the holidays.",
        "background": "4.7 million people , 12 percent children, cannot eat, cannot get the right nutrition to thrive. That is why I am calling for the government to make provisions and help young people living beneath the poverty line, so they can eat. Eating is a human right, the fact that some young people eat is awful",
