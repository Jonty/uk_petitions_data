        "action": "Demand compensation from plastic producers for every British citizen.",
        "additional_details": "Companies in the business of producing plastic have historically misled the government and the public about how reusable and recyclable they are. Plastics are not very reusable or recyclable and the production of plastic needs to be halted unless it is shown to be wholly recyclable or biodegradable. In the meantime, restitution must be paid for the damage done by plastic pollution and the misleading information about resuability and recycling.",
        "background": "I want parliament to force plastic producers to pay compensation to the public for the nuisance, unsightliness and danger of plastic pollution on land and at sea. Our wildlife, beaches, towns and countryside are awash with non-recyclable, non-biodegradable plastic and drastic action is needed.",
