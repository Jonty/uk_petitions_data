By others having a lack of understanding, people like me (who struggle with mental well-being) can be made to feel as though our thoughts and feelings are invalid. This then takes a toll on a persons mental state, potentially resulting in self-sabotaging, or harm to one\u2019s self or worse.",
        "background": "By creating mental health as an educative subject in secondary school, as a country we\u2019ll be able to end the stigma as well as raising generations up to be more understanding of others. By teaching mental health in schools, people would have better knowledge on how to support those who struggle.",
