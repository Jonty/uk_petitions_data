This has limited my access to cheap and environmentally-friendly heating.\r\n \r\nThe Government is offering \u00a35,000 (\u00a37,500 from 23 October) grants to install heat pumps, but these leasehold flat owners cannot access these if the freeholder refuses permission for the installation of a heat pump.\r\n \r\nThe UK can't expect to get everyone onto energy efficient forms of heating, as long as freeholders have the right to deny their requests to install the outside units.\r\n ",
