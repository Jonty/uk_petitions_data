        "additional_details": "I have been campaigning for road crash victims since 2014, after I was hit by a London bus in 2007. My mother was killed in the same incident and my daughter who was only two lost her leg. I felt as traumatised by the trial of the bus driver and by the difficulties of navigating the criminal justice system as I did by the crash. I have set up the TfL Sarah Hope Line to support victims of road crashes in London. More needs to be done. Too many people are talking and no one is helping the victims.",
