        "additional_details": "We believe these schemes amount to a stealth tax on your privacy; sign up to their scheme and hand over your data, or pay higher prices. Your data carries value and can be used, either to track the goods you are buying or sell on. The supermarkets are making a huge profit and they know our Government will not act. We believe the only way to force action is through signing this petition and securing a debate. We are sick and tired of being ripped off, with absolutely no help from our government.",
        "background": "We are worried by the trend of supermarkets implementing so-called \u2018loyalty card schemes\u2019. There are reports that some supermarkets have been artificially raising their prices in order to incentivise customers to sign up to schemes and share their personal data, or else pay an inflated price.",
