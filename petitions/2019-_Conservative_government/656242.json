        "additional_details": "I don't think epilepsy is being adequately catered for, as outlined in NASH Report 2020. I am concerned that this has a negative impact on epileptic patients, putting them at more risk of serious harm and sudden unexplained death. I think more training will help professionals understand a common Neurological condition that affects over 600,000 people in the UK alone. I think more training could help ensure the right care is provided, and help reduce risks of harm that currently people with epilepsy might be experiencing.",
