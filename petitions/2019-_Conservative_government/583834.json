        "action": "Return professional football clubs to majority fan ownership.",
        "additional_details": "The failed proposal for a European Super League has highlighted the excessive levels of greed that permeate through professional football at all levels to the detriment of fans and communities alike. Without prior consultation, club 'owners' are able to take decisions which have sometimes irreversible impacts on society (think ESL, Wimbledon FC and Bury FC), with very little recourse. Returning clubs to majority fan ownership is a proven way to ensure that this does not happen again.",
        "background": "Implement a new model of ownership for all professional football clubs in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland which rests majority ownership of clubs with fan trusts, similar to the German 50+1 rule, rewarding owners with exemptions due to longevity of investment in clubs and communities.",
