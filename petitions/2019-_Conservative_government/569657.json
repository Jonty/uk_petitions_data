        "action": "Stop the authorisation and use of pesticides believed to kill bees in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "The government must stop the use of neonicotinoids in the UK due to the significant environmental risks they pose for bees and other species of insects - particularly pollinators. Insects perform vital roles in the pollination of crops & wildflowers, and nutrient recycling, but have suffered drastic declines. Evidence suggests at least 50% of insects have been lost since 1970, and 41% of insect species are now 'threatened with extinction'. Use of neonicotinoids will only exacerbate this situation.",
        "background": "Stop the emergency authorisation of the use of a bee-killing pesticide - a product containing neonicotinoid thiamethoxam - on sugar beet and other crops in the UK.",
