The government have announced there\u2019s no exams yet now theres news on whether there might be \u201cmini exams\u201d which is draining all of us out. Our mental health isn\u2019t stable enough and some students struggle with online learning so how can they be assessed simply just on what they have learnt in online lessons and perform well in these \u201cmini exams\u201d.",
