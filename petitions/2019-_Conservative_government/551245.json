        "additional_details": "13,000 people, including 4,000 children, have been left homeless and traumatised after a devastating fire in the Moria refugee camp. It is time for the UK to uphold its human rights commitments as many other countries have done.\r\n\r\nInnocent children should not be punished by asylum systems based on deterrence and hostility.\r\n\r\nWith the Kindertransport, we used to have a proud tradition of helping people fleeing conflict and persecution. In this crisis the UK must uphold this tradition.",
        "background": "The UK must immediately take in more asylum seekers from Moria - with transparency on numbers. Unaccompanied children should take priority. Resettlement operations and facilitating family reunification should be urgently resumed, including transport for those with a legal right to enter the UK.",
