        "additional_details": "Currently those holding contracts from NHS are not obliged to offer their staff similar pay or conditions to those staff directly employed by the NHS. This means that staff who are putting themselves at risk for the benefit of patients (including staff in community pharmacies) are exposed to risk and should they fall ill are then only eligible for SSP of \u00a394.25 per week as the contractors refuse to offer full sick pay. The covid19 pandemic has highlighted this but it is an ongoing issue.",
        "background": "Government should make it a contractual requirement that all companies that are awarded a contract to deliver services for the NHS (including Community Pharmacy and cleaning services) must pay sick pay on the same basis as staff employed directly by the NHS.",
