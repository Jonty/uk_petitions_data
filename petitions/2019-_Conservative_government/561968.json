They also like to say that in times of hardship \"we are all in it together\". The economic impact of Covid-19 is likely to be felt for many years and most of us will end up paying higher taxes as a result. MPs should be leading by example and requiring them to publish their tax returns they can prove that we are really \"all in it together\" and contributing fairly.",

To demonstrate that \"we're all in it together\", MPs should publish their tax returns to show the tax they pay to the public.",
