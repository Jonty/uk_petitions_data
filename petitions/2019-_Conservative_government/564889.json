        "additional_details": "Students in college, unlike in schools, usually travel longer and from different areas to get there. Students come from tier 2 to 3 areas to get to a college in a tier 4 area, so they could potentially be going back home and infecting families and other people there. Students in college also use more public transport to get their education, such as trains and buses. Closing colleges or switching to online is a better option to prevent the spread of COVID and prevent students acting as spreaders",
        "background": "There aren\u2019t usually many lessons a day for college students, so coming into college for just one or two lessons is not worth infecting other people for.",
