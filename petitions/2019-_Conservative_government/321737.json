It causes distress and heartache to so many people and families, so this greed needs to stop! The Home Office has never given a reasonable explanation for their charges and needs to be held to account. Each application only costs a fraction of what is being charged, so the rest is profit. If your application fails, you lose all of your money which is just wrong.",
