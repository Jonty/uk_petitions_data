        "additional_details": "Far too often families within the UK have their children removed based on judgements by social workers and the courts that a child is likely to suffer harm in the future. Unless there is sufficient and factual evidence to suggest that a child has suffered harm then how can a court justify removing children? In order to convict someone of a criminal offence, guilt must be established beyond reasonable doubt. The same should apply to care orders.\r\n \r\nCurrent rules are an absolute disgrace and need to be changed.",
