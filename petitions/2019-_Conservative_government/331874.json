        "additional_details": "Looking at the history curriculum, such topics only appear at KS3. Kids should not need to wait until then to know about key points in British history. According to the Department for Education, it's up to the teachers to decide which parts they want to teach, when this history should be compulsory. And finally, the way this history is taught should be changed. For example, teaching the story of Sam Sharpe so that kids learn a different side to slavery.",
        "background": "I believe that British history is important for kids to learn, not to dwell on, but to understand the issues that POC in the country faced and are currently facing so that these children can grow with the knowledge to make this country a fair and equal place for all races.",
