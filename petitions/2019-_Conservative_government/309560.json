        "additional_details": "Please place the setup of this hospital in a non residential area, it would be better placed in a military base or grounds that have sufficient surrounding infrastructure to support the vast flow of both patients and staff. \r\n\r\nWe feel there could be an increased risk of Covid-19 infection to local residents due to the increase of infected patients and NHS workers within the local area.",
        "background": "We do not want a 4,000 bed Covid-19 hospital in the Excel Centre as this is extremely close to residential areas and will cause massive disruption and upset to neighbouring residents. \r\n\r\nWe feel this hospital would be better placed in an area that is not residential.",
