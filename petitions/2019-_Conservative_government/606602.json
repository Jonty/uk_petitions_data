        "additional_details": "We believe a standardised template, developed following consultation, would be helpful to families, if this was simplified, especially where they have children attending school/ college in different LAs. It should also support settings / leaders who have children and young people from different local authorities in their establishment. It should also better enable the Government / inspectorates to quality assure the quality of EHCPs across local authorities.",
        "background": "As part of forthcoming & long awaited SEND Review the Government should develop a single national template for EHCPs, following consultation, including with parents and school leaders.",
