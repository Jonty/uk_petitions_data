        "additional_details": "Crisis in Nepal is unrecognized globally due to its low presence in international affairs. As an under-resourced country, situation like this could claim many more lives which can be saved through minimal support from the highly privileged countries like the UK. Humanity is in danger and those who can make a difference should take an action immediately. Any support from the UK would give positive message to local people to fight against the disease both physically and emotionally.",
        "background": "There is a stark warning that the COVID crisis is going to be brutally bad in coming days in Nepal. Without pause, we urge the Gov. of UK to take swift effort to ease the pain and suffering of many by directly donating the essential materials (Oxygen & Ventilators) to the COVID patients in Nepal.",
