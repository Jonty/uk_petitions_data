Expecting self-employed parents to take unpaid adoption leave whilst supporting their child during a critical transitional period is unfair. This current policy is not inclusive of adoptive families and to many, reads as an act of discrimination.\r\nI wish the Government to introduce an Adoption Allowance comparable with the Maternity Allowance for the Self-Employed.",
