        "action": "Make catcalling illegal in the UK",
        "additional_details": "I was walking to the station for my first day of work since March and I was aggressively catcalled by two men on the same side of the road as me. I didn\u2019t say anything because I was alone, it was early so not many people were around and I was SCARED. I know it\u2019s not a massive deal, there are far worse things going on and most of the time I can shake this sort of thing off but today it really upset me. Like most women I know, although this is sexual assault it is also very much an \u201ceveryday\u201d occurrence.",
        "background": "I want catcalling to be illegal in the UK. We will never achieve a far society until women don\u2019t feel threatened walking down the street. France, Belgium and Portugal all have legislation against this and people receive upfront fines for any kind of sexual harassment against women.",
