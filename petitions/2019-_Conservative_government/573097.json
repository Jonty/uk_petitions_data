        "additional_details": "I feel that no one should own a river, they should be publicly accessible. Land ownership should extend to the high water mark, allowing fisheries to charge for bank access rather than the right to fish, but the use of a boat or wading up a river should be legal, as people shouldn't be allowed to own a waterway. people should be allowed to swim or boat along any waterway, since the landowner should own the bank, not the river.",
        "background": "Make all waterways legal for the public to access for recreation, be that canoeing, swimming or fishing and have land ownership extend only to the high water mark. Anyone should have the right to enjoy Britains rivers without paying or having to ask permission from land owners.",
