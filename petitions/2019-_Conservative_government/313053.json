        "additional_details": "It has been announced that home testing kits for COVID-19 will soon be available to buy for \u00a36. However, companies should not be able to profit from this. People are dying from the virus before they meet the criteria to get tested at hospital. To save time and resources, I propose that a home testing kit is sent to every registered household for at least a family of 4 for a \u00a32 donation to the NHS to help research. That would ensure at least \u00a355m is funded into our NHS (est. From 2019 stats ONS)",
        "background": "I want the government to make sure home testing kits for COVID-19 are sent out to every registered address for at least 4 people per household. If a household holds more than 4 persons, they at least have a 4 in x chance of finding out if anyone has been infected with the deadly virus.",
