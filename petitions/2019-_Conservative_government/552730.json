        "additional_details": "In an economy still wrestling with the pandemic, the planned implementation of IR35 in 2021 is causing a great deal of uncertainty and stress throughout the UK labour market. This threatens to put further strain on the wider economy looking to get back on its feet.\r\n\r\nAs COVID is showing no real signs of abating, this petition asks to pause IR35 to a time when the economy can address the issues surrounding this legislation in a more singular fashion and from a position of strength.",
        "background": "Freelancers play a vital role in the UK economy and are the changing face of work. This petition requests the Government to delay the implementation of the upcoming IR35 legislation until COVID-19 is eradicated and the economy recovers to a level where such a change can be better addressed by all.",
