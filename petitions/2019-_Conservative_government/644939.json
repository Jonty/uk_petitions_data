        "action": "Ban the sale of cigarettes and tobacco in England.",
        "additional_details": "A ban on the sale of cigarettes and tobacco in England would improve public health and well being for both smokers and non - smokers. It would help reduce the financial and staffing pressures of the NHS, billions are spent every year treating conditions caused or exacerbated by smoking e.g Cancer, Heart disease, Strokes, Lung disease, Diabetes, COPD, certain types of dementias. Smokers with mental health illnesses die on average 10 - 20 years earlier.",
        "background": "I want the Government and Parliament to seriously review why they are allowing the sale of an Item that causes so much unnecessary harm to public health and wellbeing. Particularly to society's most vulnerable who do not fully understand the harm being done to them both mentally and physically.",
