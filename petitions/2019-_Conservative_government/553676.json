Current issues surrounding community funding have reached breaking point with community relations between councillors at an all time low and even in areas of the borough of Southwark bin collections no longer happen.",
        "background": "We as united people demand that local councillors and MP\u2019s recognise their local tenancy committee leaders and meet them monthly in an effort to restore order to the communities. \r\n\r\nThis way they can help build trust with local leaders and ensure their community is better funded.",
