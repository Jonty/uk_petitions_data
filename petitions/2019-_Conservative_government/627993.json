        "additional_details": "There are no restrictions on the display of alcohol, and we believe current rules on labelling should be amended to make alcohol products less attractive to consumers.\r\n \r\nNew research from the University of Stirling has highlighted the significant impact that alcohol packaging has on capturing the attention of, and creating appeal amongst, young people.\r\n \r\nThe research found that, for young adult drinkers in Scotland, alcohol packaging can capture attention, create appeal, and help shape perceptions of the product, drinker and drinking experience.\r\n",
        "background": "We want the Government to mandate a standardised appearance for all alcohol products, including a set size, font and placement of brand and product names, and the size, shape and colour of the bottle. Shops should also be required to conceal alcohol products, in same way as tobacco.",
