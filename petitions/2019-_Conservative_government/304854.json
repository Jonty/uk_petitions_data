How can we contribute a full picture?\r\n\r\nPeople who could be working in essential services are in self isolation, potentially unnecessarily. \r\n\r\nWe need to know if we have it and if we get it again. The unknown causes fear. This is in itself isolating. \r\nThe impact on our mental health and in turn physical health is great.",
