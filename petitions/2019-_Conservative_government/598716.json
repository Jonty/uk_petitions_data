        "additional_details": "There are raging issues with power in this country and especially in London,a woman gets killed almost every day and there are no hope for them to be safe when it's illegal to carry a tazor,mace or any kind of form of decent self defence.If women are allowed to protect,defend and empower themselves it will help to heal the community,help women feel much safer being able to legally carry a weapon that can be used in emergency as a protection. \r\nIt's more necessary than ever.",
