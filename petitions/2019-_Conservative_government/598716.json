        "additional_details": "There are raging issues with power in this country and especially in London,a woman gets killed almost every day and there are no hope for them to be safe when it's illegal to carry a tazor,mace or any kind of form of decent self defence.If women are allowed to protect,defend and empower themselves it will help to heal the community,help women feel much safer being able to legally carry a weapon that can be used in emergency as a protection. \r\nIt's more necessary than ever.",
        "background": "In light of the last years issues surrounding women,black lives matter movement and constant issues surrounding MET police and the poor management of power. \r\nI want women,transgender people to be able to defend themselves if a situation has escalated to it.\r\nWe need to be able to defend ourselves.",
