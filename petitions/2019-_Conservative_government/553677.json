        "action": "Remove interest rates on student loans.",
        "additional_details": "Students shouldn't have to incur excessive debt for pursuing degrees that will improve the economy. Benefits of university graduates in the labour force includes higher annual earnings which irrefutably contributes to economic growth and improved living standards. Subsequently, the government can expect increased tax revenue. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, since Muslims can't take loans with interest, interest rates on loans are discriminatory against the Muslim community wishing to access higher education.",
        "background": "At present most universities charge \u00a39,250 a year, with an interest charged at RPI + 3% (currently 5.6%) while studying. The government should remove the 3%. Students are being exploited for wanting to improve their skills and better the economy. Interest is also a deterrent for Muslim students.",
