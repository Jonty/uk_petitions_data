        "additional_details": "Before the crisis, there was a widespread view in the country that politicians were 'all the same', 'only in it for themselves', etc. The media, too, were distrusted by many. An Act of Parliament enshrining in UK law the duty of the Government to live stream / broadcast the daily briefing to journalists / the lobby would allow for public scrutiny of press and politicians, fostering connections between executive and populace, nurturing national unity.",
        "background": "The Covid 19 crisis has shown us ways in which our society can work better; one good thing to come out of it is the Daily Briefing, when senior ministers answer questions put by journalists from across the political spectrum. Retaining a version of this would be very good for our democracy.",
