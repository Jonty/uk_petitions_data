During lockdown myself, my partner and a few friends of mine have all been victim to this Probation period rule. It\u2019s unfair and morally degrading and if I don\u2019t try make a difference and point it out then I don\u2019t see where the change will come as we have been put into these situations for many years.",
        "background": "I would like the government to look into making probation periods in work places shorter if not completely gone during lockdowns as plenty of employers don\u2019t follow probation properly they just get rid of you before your contacts ended based off of personal reasons rather then work ethic.",
