        "additional_details": "The government have repeatedly lied to the British public;\r\n1. About the true extent of deaths recorded as Covid\r\n2. Adopted an underhand approach and reneged on its promises; Mr Johnson initially stated Covid passports would not be a requirement for pubs and similar venues but has now stated that they will be mandatory thus proving themselves to be faithless and untrustworthy.\r\n\r\nThe economy is being destroyed; repeated lockdowns have caused permeant business closures and loss of jobs.",
        "background": "Take a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson and his ministers. Their response to the Covid 'crisis' has been erratic, disorganised and draconian. Freedoms and liberties are being  stripped away - inability to protest, police arrests for 'alleged breaking' of Covid 'rules' - just  two examples.",
