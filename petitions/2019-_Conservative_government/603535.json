        "additional_details": "I have seen that these abusers and paedophiles who abuse children have taken great pleasure in making there victims suffer and why they should get an easy ride in prison. They are protected and given rights that they did not even consider giving to there victims. These abusers need to know that in prison you are not going to be treated better than there victims and the punishment should fit the crime. I genuinely think if these people know they are not going to be given basic rights then they might think twice before abusing a CHILD. These people have had an easy ride for far too long and the numbers of abused children in this country is alarming and prison on its own doesn't seem to be working and I feel its time something has to be done to level the playground",
