        "additional_details": "There is an increasing concern that without a reasonable increase that people, especially nurses, will continue to leave this sector thereby reducing the ability to provide a quality caring service.\r\nPeople have clapped and painted rainbows in support of the NHS. Now is the time to back up that support with a reward for the commitment and dedication which has held this nation together over the last year.",
        "background": "Increasing the tax rate by 1p in the pound would generate an additional \u00a35.5bn which on its own would allow an increase of 9.8% for NHS workers. However a proposal of a 5% increase for all NHS staff from this funding would cost \u00a32.8bn leaving \u00a32.7bn to be used for other public sector workers",
