        "additional_details": "Not enough is known about Cov-19 transmission or its long term health effects-nor is immunity guaranteed. Reopening of schools prior to the widespread availability of a successful vaccine would be based on governmental speculation and dangerous wishful thinking rather than facts. By opening schools before a vaccine is ready, the government risks compounding the already atrocious number of unnecessary deaths within our population-that very population the government is elected and paid to protect.",
        "background": "Keep UK schools closed until a successful Covid-19 vaccine is widely available to all members of the public. Efforts/funding should be solely focused on research, PPE provision, re-establishment of effective nationalised social services, support for long distance learning, and housing/food security.",
