Enmisions include dioxins, Box and ultrafine particulate matter that can be harmful to both human health and the natural environment, there is not enough monitoring, enforcement or transpararency by the industry. Traffic will increase having 22 HGV movements per day carrying waste in and out across the North East adding more pollution. A 50 meter stack will be much higher than any building in the area, therefore the night and industrial nature of this incinerator will cause substantial,adverse and permanent visual effects bringing unacceptable harm and retirement to the character of the landscape.",
