If a building can be listed and protected, then why should an English institution, founded and built by Britain's working class be bought and sold with debt like an interest-only mortgage? \r\n\r\nE.g. the Glazers\u2019 ownership has cost Man Utd \u00a31.5 billion in interest, debt and other outgoings. \r\n\r\nAs we have seen with the aborted ESL, football is nothing without its fans. It's time to give the fans power over their club the way Bayern Munich do.",
        "background": "Foreign billionaire owners are ruining football. The proposed European Super League was the final straw. \r\n\r\nProtect fans and introduce the 50+1 rule (the power of veto over board decisions) or Golden Share rule (ensures fans hold a 51% stake in their clubs).",
