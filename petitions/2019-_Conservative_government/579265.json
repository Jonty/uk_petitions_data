        "additional_details": "The Istanbul Convention contains a comprehensive legal framework to tackle violence against women more effectively, which has been highlighted recently by the Sarah Everard case to be a relenting issue in the UK. Ratifying the Convention would show the world that the UK is highlighting and addressing this issue and making the UK safer for women. The UK signed the Convention almost 9 years ago, showing that we support it; it is time to ratify it and address violence against women.",

This is also a call for the Government to adhere to the minimum standard outlined in the Convention in order to be able to ratify it.",
