        "additional_details": "The large swastika was put on the floor of Upminster Bridge station in 1934, 1 year after Hitler come to power, 1 year and 9 months after the opening of the first concentration camp in Dachau. We now know the revoltingly evil actions that Hitler went on to commit and equally the heroic actions of our ancestors, many of which laid down their lives to stop that symbol of hatred infesting our country like it did much of Europe. This symbol is an insult to them and any people of the BAME community.",
        "background": "This symbol that appeared at the station just one year after Hitler rose to power should be replaced with a memorial that commemorates the efforts of both soldiers and civilians throughout the commonwealth. This memorial should be a reminder of the strength of the people when they stand together.",
