        "additional_details": "I want the UK government to make it clear that women going topless in public is not indecent exposure in order to remove the threat of prosecution. To achieve equality and remove breast shame from society. If men can walk around topless in public spaces without it being deemed as public/ indecent exposure, women should be granted the same right.",
        "background": "Women should be allowed to walk around topless in public spaces just the same as men can without it being deemed as indecent exposure. Breast shame needs to be stopped and that starts with legislation and removal of the fear of prosecution.",
