        "additional_details": "Lost lives & unplanned closures result in a high cost for people and the economy. Despite being a junction priority for Highways England it is unfunded in RIS2. 2016 plans combined improvements to this and Lean Quarry junctions with provision of a local access road between them allowing right turn manoeuvres to be prohibited by the closing of the central reserve gaps. This would dramatically improve cycling and pedestrian access too. DfT should release funds for detailed design and construction.",
        "background": "A38 Menheniot Junction in Cornwall is not fit for purpose. Designed in the 1970s it is a cluster site for fatal and serious collisions. Right hand turns across the dual carriageway, inadequate central reserve gap, high traffic volumes beyond design life should make it a priority for modernisation.",
