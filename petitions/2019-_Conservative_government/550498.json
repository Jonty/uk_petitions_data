        "action": "Permit larger weddings based on guests testing negative for COVID-19",
        "additional_details": "There is a stark contrast in the way bars, pubs restaurants operate compared to that of a wedding despite being very similar eg multiple people in one space, socially distanced with music, food & drinks. Multiple Individuals (capacity permitting) can remain in a pub for the duration of the day without much limitation apart from distancing, whereas a wedding is heavily restrained with a cap on guests, activities and time limits in cases. Please can this balance, especially on guests be reviewed.",
        "background": "Current restrictions permit max. 30 guests at a wedding including suppliers; DJ, photographers & officiant etc. This petition asks that the limit be reviewed and raised for example if guests prove negative for a COVID-19 test prior to the wedding and engage in isolation measures until such time.",
