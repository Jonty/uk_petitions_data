Uncertain as to whether I could have children & being given the wrong types of medication resulted in me not having a period for 3 years. After fortunately bearing my child, I did not have a period for 5 months. I then had a period which has been ongoing for 8 months. I have been referred for a hysteroscopy however, I am still on the waiting list & all the GP wants to do it give me the pill which is wrong.",
