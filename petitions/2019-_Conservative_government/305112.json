        "action": "Cancel bank overdraft changes and reduce interest rates in Corona Virus pandemic",
        "additional_details": "By definition, overdraft debt is typically associated with lower paid / working class / less affluent households. Obliging banks to  lower interest rates will provide immediate, targeted benefit to those in most need and reduce pressures on workers most affected by the pandemic, e.g. Gig economy workers and those losing their employment as the pandemic continues. This will also help individuals pay down debt reducing risk to credit providers / the banking system which will be under pressure.",
        "background": "Parliament should consider exceptional provisions for a period of say 2 years to oblige banks to cancel overdraft rate changes and lower interest rates to a nominal rate (e.g 5%)+Base Rate to aid households and reduce mental health issues in Corona Virus pandemic.",
