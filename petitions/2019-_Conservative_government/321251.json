        "additional_details": "It is the perception of many that the UK Governments response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been less than optimal in any aspect.\r\n But for the dedication of NHS frontline and Care Home staff,  and the common sense applied by the UK public the currently difficult, painful yet manageable situation could have become a tragedy of nationwide proportions in each of the four UK nations.\r\n\r\nThe Administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland also have had issues that need scrutiny and correction.",
