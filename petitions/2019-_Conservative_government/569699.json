        "additional_details": "This requires a national effort, retired NHS staff, dentists, pharmacists, optometrists are trained in administering vaccines but their help is being denied by Westminster. On 10/01/21, Matt Hancock announced that  \"every adult will have been offered a vaccination by the autumn\". This is not soon enough. Those on the furlough scheme could be trained in vaccine administration, to vaccinate the country as quickly, and as efficiently as possible. We, the people, want an appointment, day or night.",
        "background": "Downing Street has denied that there is a demand for coronavirus vaccines to be delivered out-of-hours, stating there is currently \"not a clamour for jabs after 8pm\". Allegra Stratton, has said \"If people say they would like an appointment over 8pm then that is something they will consider.\"",
