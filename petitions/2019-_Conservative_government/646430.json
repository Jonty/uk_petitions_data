        "additional_details": "Cap the prices landlord's charge as this is currently a free for all. It needs to be regulated as so many people including myself will never get on the property ladder so this is our only choice. Something has to give as it's just breaking people and doesn't seem to be getting any better. What used to be affordable is just not possible anymore and the owners of this property is taking every penny spare for people.",
        "background": "After the pandemic I understand things have gone up in price but the cost of rents now in private accommodation is just unsustainable. With the wages at a all time low and the rents massive inflation it's just not affordable.",
