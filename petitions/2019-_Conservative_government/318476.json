        "additional_details": "Many Year 10s that are completing their GCSEs in 2021 will be disappointed with their results, leading to high rates of depression and could lead crime later on. Cancelling GCSEs and using the students\u2019 last achieved grades is an intelligent and safe option, rather than forcing pupils to complete GCSEs, only to fail.",
        "background": "Current Year 10s miss out on lessons and aren\u2019t able to catch up with the curriculum online. GCSEs in 2021 should also be cancelled, as the pandemic has hindered studying. Letting Year 10s do GCSEs is setting them up for failure and there is no chance for them to catch up to the lesson work.",
