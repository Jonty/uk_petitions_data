        "additional_details": "Protests in the United States, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere show that the time is right to investigate issues of race and equality here in the UK. We need a vehicle to search for that change: a thorough national enquiry with adequate funding outlining concrete suggestions for overcoming systematic racism in all areas of life in the UK would be an excellent start. \"BAME\" people are disadvantaged in the justice system, healthcare, education, employment, housing, public policy and more.",
        "background": "The enquiry should produce specific recommendations for overcoming racial prejudice/ racism in each area, accompanied by an implementation plan and timeline. It should be conducted by experts from diverse specialties, backgrounds and ethnicities, giving a voice to those who are normally not heard.",
