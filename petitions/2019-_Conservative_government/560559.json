        "additional_details": "University students in particular, have been detrimentally impacted with majority, if not all, of the content being taught remotely. Though it is not something many like to admit, the student community has been left feeling overwhelmed and academically strained. Further, the decline of student mental health is extremely prevalent at universities. As COVID-19 restrictions and precautions continue, anxiety and uncertainty amongst the student population remains evident.",
        "background": "Students are paying \u00a39,250 per year to receive the full student experience: face-to-face teaching and full access to all academic resources. Students are not receiving the same support as previous years. Thus, it is illogical to pay such a substantial amount for an experience different to the norm.",
