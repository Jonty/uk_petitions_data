Off licences and supermarkets are allowed to sell cheep alcohol but pubs have been limited so badly, that people are scared to come out. We have been made to put so many restrictions in place that it\u2019s safer to be in a pub than most shops. We have implemented distance between tables which has limited the capacity. Forced people to wear masks to go to the bathroom. Got in extra staff that we can\u2019t afford to wait tables. All this at our own cost and still they blame pubs for the spread. WE NEED A BREAK!!!!",
