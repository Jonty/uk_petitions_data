Theatres and other arts venues are not banned from opening, but must operate within Government guidance on social distancing.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter for individual operators to decide if they can safely operate within these guidelines. You can find out more about these here: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/performing-arts#arts-3-1\r\n                \r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example if you would like social distancing restrictions removed to allow theatres to operate at full capacity, you could start a petition calling for this to happen."
