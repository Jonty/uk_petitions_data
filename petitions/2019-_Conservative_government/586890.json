        "additional_details": "The environmental problem of micro plastics is widely recognised, but 60% of those micro plastics are coming from domestic washing machines in the form of polyester and nylon microfibres. This has been recognised by the Environmental Audit Committee in the 'Fixing Fashion' report 2019. Our antiquated waste water system is not up to the job and retro fitting WWTP's to eliminate the problem would lead to higher bills for consumers which would disproportionately affect the poor.",
        "background": "Follow France who have introduced legislation to require all new washing machines to include a microfibre filter by 2025 at the latest. As manufacturers will be introducing models that fulfil this function due to French legislation this should be easy to implement.",
