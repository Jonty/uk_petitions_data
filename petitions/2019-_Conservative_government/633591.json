        "additional_details": "In 2021, 302,423 animals were used in regulatory tests, including 2,431 dogs and 1956 primates, primarily in legally required \u2018tick box\u2019 safety/toxicity studies. Yet, animal tests cannot reliably predict human responses to chemicals or pharmaceuticals, or provide adequate information regarding safety and efficacy. Evidence shows NAMs to be more predictive of human biology, more economically advantageous via new prospects in scientific innovation, and prevent the suffering of millions of animals.",
        "background": "Radically divert funding and evolve policy to implement the use of NAMs in all regulatory toxicity tests. Actively encourage use of NAMs, noting that this data is of superior human relevance compared to animal tests data. Establish clear pathways to develop & validate NAMs and end the use of animal.",
