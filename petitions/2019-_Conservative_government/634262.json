        "additional_details": "Rivers, streams and the sea are vital to everyone and they need to be kept clean for wildlife and also for people to be able to enjoy swimming in them. To give bonuses to water company executives when they have failed to protect waterways is wrong and sends out the signal that whatever you do you will get rewarded for good or bad work . Where is the incentive to put things right and find ways to stop polluting these vital resources.",
        "background": "As the water companies have not stopped sewage going into our waterways therefore failing wildlife and the general public they should not receive the bonuses they are supposed to be getting.",
