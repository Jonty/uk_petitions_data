Energy companies still in existence in the summer of 2022 will be able to afford the wholesale energy purchases using their vast profits from the first half of 2022.",
        "background": "The price cap rise planned in October and January should not go ahead. \r\nEnergy companies can use their recent record profits to buy energy instead of using the pocket of U.K. customers.",
