        "additional_details": "Us students believe that parliament are not putting forward preventative measures to protect us students among the outbreak. Many of us are travelling to these establishments in fear of catching the virus, and being penalised for not wanting to go. We are told to avoid mass gatherings, however it does not seem fair, us being forced into these establishments with thousands of students, and an increased risk when commuting through the busiest of areas to get there. We ask that you reconsider.",
        "background": "We ask that parliament consider the welfare of students across the UK by closing down these establishments for an appropriate amount of time. We ask that you proceed to the next stage of the strategy against Covid-19 as soon as possible, we believe delaying closure will do more harm to us than good.",
