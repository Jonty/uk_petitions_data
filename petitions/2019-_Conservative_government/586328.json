        "background": "The Covid PCR Test for travel is now to expensive, the average is \u00a3140, and for a family like mine is not sustainable. I\u2019ve had my first child in November and I couldn\u2019t show him to my parents yet, so we are planning to go in Italy in July, but the PCR Test is to expensive for us.",
