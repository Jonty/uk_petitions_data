        "additional_details": "The government must not take this action as doing so would rob students of opportunities, after already being robbed of so many experiences during the Covid-19 pandemic. Helping us with exams and streamlining exams so they can remain at the same time in 2021 is the only way to prioritise the well-being and development of students. This supposed extra time for learning will not make enough of a difference if balanced with all the negitive effects of postponing exams.",
        "background": "As a student, I know the changing of exam dates in 2021 is incredibly harmful to students and would cause numerous knock on effects. It clearly indicates that this government does not take the mental well-being of students into consideration and simply prioritises results over well-being.",
