        "additional_details": "Our local Queen Elizabeth Hospital is still in use well past its intended operational lifespan.\r\n \r\nPapers published by the hospital Board show that there are 200 props presently holding up the roof of the hospital to ensure safety.\r\n \r\nStaff deliver quality care in spite of these dreadful conditions, and \u00a320m emergency government funding is welcome, but does not adequately address the issue, only the interim safety concerns.\r\n \r\nA new hospital, at the heart of the community, is vital and will play a huge role in the region's integrated care system now and in the future.",
        "background": "A new hospital for King's Lynn & West Norfolk should be prioritised for funding in forthcoming funding announcements, and support provided to fast-track its design and build, to ensure the area has a modern, fit-for-purpose hospital that meets the needs of patients, staff and visitors.",
