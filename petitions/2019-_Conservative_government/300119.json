        "additional_details": "There are not enough spaces for children with SEN, even with an EHCP and being allowed to name a school, you are still turned down due to 'no room'. My son was granted his EHCP in 2019 and every school I\u2019ve named have refused due to lack of space. Meaning when he is of age he will have nowhere to go and will end up being home schooled. Although some people think this is acceptable my son is going to miss out on valuable learning for a child with his needs and also miss out on socialising,as will many children who are in this 'predicament'.",
        "background": "More school places are needed for children who have an EHCP, so they have the choice of going to a SEN school rather than end up being forced into a mainstream school where there full needs are not met, or end up being home schooled due to lack of spaces.",
