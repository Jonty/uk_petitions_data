        "additional_details": "We believe the Government is putting the environment over public health. The Government says that fines from companies that pollute rivers/seas will be re-invested in our natural environment. We want the health/safety of water users to be prioritised. Many bathers are oblivious that there are over 300,000 sewage discharges a year. The Government has instructed water companies to install monitors on all storm overflows by the end of 2023. This data could form the basis of a national network of signage to cover the hundreds of designated bathing waters.",
        "background": "The Government has said money from fines to water companies that pollute rivers and seas will be invested in schemes that benefit the natural environment. It will take decades to fix water quality. Some of this cash should fund immediate sewage pollution warnings and improved water quality testing.",
