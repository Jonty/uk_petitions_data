It would be very reasonable to extend these rights to Muslim men and the women who want to enjoy their marriage ceremony according to their religious beliefs.  The Marriage Act 1949 should be amended to extend provisions for the recognition of Quaker and Jewish marriage ceremonies to Islamic ceremonies.",
