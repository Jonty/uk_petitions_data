        "additional_details": "This is not a new topic with over 500,000 people singing the previous petition. However government has closed the gyms yet again  with people being able to use outside gyms , exercise places and Personal training outside to be open. These costs a lot of money and not feasible for most people. In order to keep our minds and bodies engaged to good health we need immediate opening of gyms.",
        "background": "The percentage of covid cases in gyms has been very low and to keep morale and fitness up during lockdown we need have these facilities open.",
