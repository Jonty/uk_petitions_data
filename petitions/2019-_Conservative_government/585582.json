When they do speak out there are often challenges in regard to a jointly owned property and net proceeds of sale. I am requesting that the law is changed and convicted abusers negate their rights to anything more than what they contributed at the time of purchase. Specifically this would ensure abusers do not benefit from gifted deposits that were paid by the victim's family.",

I feel that under these circumstances arrangements pertaining to joint ownership and a division of net proceeds should be revised in the event of one partner violently assaulting another.",
