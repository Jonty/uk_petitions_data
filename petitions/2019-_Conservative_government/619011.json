        "additional_details": "As I explain in the above box due to staff shortages in the NHS trusts it is isn\u2019t fair because it affecting everyone mental and physical health. NHS have been under pressure for a long time and not proper support from the government. As a NHS worker the distress it is causing for everyone and amount of people leaving their jobs and struggling financially it not fair. As seen on the news few months back nurses going homeless because they can\u2019t afford the bills etc. NHS deserve a fair pay rise.",
        "background": "I want the government and Parliament to give NHS a fair pay rise. The amount of people leaving NHS or not coming into work due to all the severe stress and not paid enough for the job we all do, the government need to do something about this we deserve at least 10-15% pay rise.",
