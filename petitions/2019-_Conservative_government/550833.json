        "action": "Modify A-Level Exams 2021 and reconsider Ofqual's decision on A-Level Exams",
        "additional_details": "Ofqual can no longer be trusted to make appropriate, down to earth decisions on behalf of those in education and it was ridiculous of every A Level student to hear that because we are more independent than GCSE students, we need not any changes to our exams. After the chaos of the 2020 results days, we hope the Government recognises the detrimental impacts COVID-19 has disproportionately had on A-Level students nationwide with months of lost teaching time, and make efforts to re-balance this.",
        "background": "The government should ensure the disruption of Covid-19 on 2021 A-Level's are recognised properly and appropriate modifications are made to exam/ syllabus to allow for a balancing of the disruption and the teaching hours lost by students. Changes should aim to make exams easier than previous years.",
