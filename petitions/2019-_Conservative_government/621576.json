        "additional_details": "The Government rebate (\u00a3350, of which \u00a3200 is a loan) is welcome but due to the huge scale of the energy price rises it will help but will still fall well short of helping families through this winter, when the current annual price cap of \u00a31,971 is expected to rise significantly.\r\n \r\nWith salary sacrifice employees have the chance to save huge amounts of tax and national insurance and reduce the level of energy debt they will be in by Feb / March next year. This unfortunately is a decision that cannot wait or be discussed in 6 months time.",
        "background": "With prices getting incredibly high for electricity bills, we want the Government to enable people to pay energy bills via a salary sacrifice scheme. You can currently lease an electric car, buy a bike, contribute to pension and pay for child care through a salary sacrifice scheme.",
