Taxpayer relief of businesses and rising unemployment is at a record high and the national debt is rising. \r\nWe believe that UK MPs should follow the example set by other legislatures and Governments around the world and take a reasonable paycut to reflect the position of the economy and the electorate.\r\n\r\n2. MPs representing London constituencies have no reasonable need for a taxpayer-subsidised second home. Savings for the public purse can be made by ceasing this.",

We, the British taxpayer and electorate want our elected MPs to take a 5% pay cut (\u00a34,096) to bring their basic salary to \u00a377,836. \r\n2. Also, we want taxpayer subsidy of second homes for London MPs to be abolished.",
