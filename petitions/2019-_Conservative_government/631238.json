        "additional_details": "I am petitioning for this due to my own personal experience and recognise many other women will be at some point in their life in the same situation. This will help government not only save money and time as it will help keep women in the work place if perimenopause is detected early on but will prevent hospital admissions and referrals to mental health services if women are screened and identified early on as suffering with this. GP\u2019s and key health professionals need a perimenopause screening tool.",
        "background": "Create awareness that many women are being misdiagnosed with depression and anxiety symptoms without questioning their menstrual cycle and using a screening tool to indicate if this is peri menopause related symptoms.",
