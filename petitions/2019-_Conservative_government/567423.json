During the second lockdown we allowed non-essential store to operate a click and collect service, this saw many more people out in shopping malls and on high streets, we also saw that there wasn't as large a drop in cases compared to the first lockdown. Do it right, lock it all down, stay at home, stay safe, save the NHS.",
