She died a couple of weeks after her 54th birthday. Treatment was due to start 49 days after first diagnosis. She died on day 53. Had her treatment started sooner she would have had increased chances of survival. I\u2019m sure this is the case for many others with aggressive cancers.",

The doctors clearly try their best but the timescale is too long for people with aggressive cancer types. I would like the government to support the NHS in reducing the time in anyway that\u2019s needed.",
