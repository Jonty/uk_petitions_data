        "action": "Make street sexual harassment of women and girls a criminal offence.",
        "additional_details": "Actions such as the aforementioned induce severe anxiety and fear for a woman upon so much as leaving home; at any point, they may be approached by a man making unsolicited sexual advances, whether they be through verbal or physical means. Disturbingly, young girls, often in school uniforms, are harassed. This is blatant paedophilia, with no repercussions whatsoever. Until some action is taken to punish those who conduct such actions, women and girls are perpetually afraid and unsafe.",
        "background": "Make street sexual harassment illegal, including, but not limited to:\r\n1. Catcalling\r\n2. Sexual comments\r\n3. Following a woman with intent to harass\r\n4. Unsolicited physical contact \r\nThis should be criminalised, with increased severity when underaged girls are involved.",
