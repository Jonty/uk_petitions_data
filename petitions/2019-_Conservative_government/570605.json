        "additional_details": "Would you not expect a painful medical procedure to be accompanied by pain relief? Then why is this not offered to people having an IUD inserted? \r\nThis is well known to be a horrendous experience, especially for those who have not gone through childbirth, and no pain medication has to be offered to these patients. \r\nA percentage of people do receive local anesthetic beforehand, but this is not necessarily routine. I believe this should be offered as it is with any other painful medical procedure.",
        "background": "Not providing pain relief for this incredibly painful procedure is unacceptable. After going through an IUD insertion and nearly passing out from pain, this needs to be rectified so more people can have a less painful experience than I have. This should be routine and it's shocking it's not already.",
