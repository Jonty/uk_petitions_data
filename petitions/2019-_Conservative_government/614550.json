        "additional_details": "The UK bears a moral responsibility to the Bidoon's plight. Britain developed Kuwait\u2019s administrative systems when it was a protectorate. Sir Richard Beaumont attested (Registry No. BA 1017/26) the Kuwaiti Nationality Law would create a deprived people \"in what is and has always been their home\u201d. However, the British Government then did not intervene, and it allowed an incompetent, less transparent elite to deprive the Bidoon from their right to belong to their homeland to take place.",
        "background": "We want the Parliament to listen to the indigenous stateless Kuwaiti Bidoon people and call on the Government of the United Kingdom to take a decisive part in advocating an urgent, fair and conclusive solution to the Bidoon\u2019s problem in liaison with the Kuwaiti diplomatic and political leadership.",
