        "additional_details": "I want this as animals are like humans! Animals are like a family member to most people, especially pets so wild animals being killed should be taken just as seriously as if someone was to kill a pet, there should be stricter penalties for this! They feel feelings like us but can't vocalise them! If people continue to kill animals we're going to have more animals endangered of extinction so please put a stop to people killing animals as a sport and \"enjoyment\", we need to save our animals!",

I've loved animals all my life and they've helped me mentally so much, so seeing people kill and harm them makes me want to protect them as all animals deserve to stay alive!",
