Our hearts are shattered and the only thing we can do with our pain is turn it into power by not only spreading Ronnie's name, story and legacy but fighting for all babies to be scanned at birth. The reason we are fighting for this is simply because if Ronnies heart condition, which he had since he was born, was detected in either pregnancy or birth then maybe just maybe he would be here with us today\u2026in fact we are certain.",
