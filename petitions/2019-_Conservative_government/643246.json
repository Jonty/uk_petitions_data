        "additional_details": "Around a quarter of the average UK citizen's carbon footprint comes from their food. Currently, the majority of people do not appreciate the relative carbon footprint linked to different foods e.g. Beef has as much as 10 times the carbon footprint of chicken. Labelling food with CO2eq values will empower people to make better informed choices. Reducing emissions linked to our food should form an important part of government strategy to minimise the effects of climate change.",
        "background": "Mandate that food packaging indicates the approximate CO2eq emissions per KG of food, and use a traffic light system similar to those employed for fat etc. to indicate relative high, medium and low values for CO2eq emissions. This will enable consumers to make informed choices when buying food.",
