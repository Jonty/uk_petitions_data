        "additional_details": "There are approximately 1.3 million UK citizens living in the EU and a high proportion of these are relying on receiving their UK pensions into a UK Bank.  If the banks close these accounts it will mean that those who receive pensions will be left at the mercy of the banks in terms of the (usually very low) exchange rates offered by banks in their country of residence.  This will impact heavily on those surviving on their pensions.",
        "background": "To date, Brexit negotiations with the EU has failed to include an extension to 'passporting' to protect UK Citizens living in Europe.  This petition calls on the Government to urgently address this situation that will impact heavily on those receiving UK Pensions.",
