        "additional_details": "There are a massive number of reasons why this should be done, such as: Saving Ukrainian innocents from the continuing senseless Russian Bombardment, preventing an evil dictator like Vladimir Putin from becoming even more powerful than he already is and setting the important precedent that the UK is a country founded on high moral standards which will not cave to Putin or any other evil dictator who has the delusion that they are entitled to maim and kill unchecked.",
        "background": "A few days ago (at the time of writing) Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President of Ukraine asked the UK for fighter jets to be used in defending Ukraine against the illegal Russian invasion. These jets, no matter how small in number should be supplied to Ukraine.",
