        "additional_details": "It isn\u2019t financially viable to open under current guidelines. Venues will be forced to remain closed due to social distancing, local lockdowns and lack of realistic timelines. Productions can\u2019t be switched on overnight. Live events, arts and TV & Film are worth billions in revenue to the UK economy. \r\nThere will be mass job losses and huge damage to whole sector without further support.\r\nThe furlough scheme needs to extended, grants are required and a more realistic opening plan is needed.",
        "background": "Events industry experts have warned that guidance won\u2019t allow venues (theatres & arenas) to open this year which will lead to mass redundancies and closure of venues by October. Further support and a more realistic plan is needed for the industry to allow it to restart and protect jobs until it can.",
