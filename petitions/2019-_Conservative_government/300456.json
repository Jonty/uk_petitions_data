        "action": "Return the Chagos Islands to Mauritius",
        "additional_details": "Clearly if there is to be an end to this unjustified trace of colonization after centuries of abuse to those it colonized (including the those from Mauritius), then the return of the islands is only ethical and right. The territory is not British land to own, yet Britain insists on keeping it despite the UN backing Mauritius in its request for the return of the Islands. Many of those evicted are alive today, yet they are unable to return home. Therefore the Islands should be returned.",
        "background": "The Chagos Islands have been part of Mauritius since back in the 18th century when the French settled on Mauritius. However, when Mauritius gained independence, part of this meant Mauritius giving up the Chagos Islands, resulting in the eviction of over 2,000 innocent people from their home.",
