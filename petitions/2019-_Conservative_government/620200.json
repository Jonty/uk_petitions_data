        "additional_details": "Both adults and children with ME/CFS can wait many years for a confirmed diagnosis. Because this condition can be so debilitating the length of time many wait for diagnosis is unacceptable. Many patients face scepticism, prejudice and stigma from medical professionals, too many of whom assume symptoms are psychological. This could be prevented if medical and care professionals better understood the condition. I therefore request funding to better train medical and professionals in diagnosis of ME/CFS, and to improve diagnosis and care provision.",
