        "additional_details": "The history of the Balkans include wars, mass genocides and sexual assaults, many of which have only occurred in the last 30 years. This history is very important as there are many survivors and victims today, including my mother who fled to Sarajevo when her childhood home was bombed four years before I was born. We must acknowledge these events and how the Balkan people rebuilt their lives in a very short amount of time. This is some of the most relevant history that is simply being overlooked.",
        "background": "Living in UK and being from Kosovo, I get many questions about where I\u2019m from, many of which asking where Kosovo is and what the Balkans are. In history class at secondary school I hoped that one lesson would be about the Balkans but every year we learn the same history and the Balkans are ignored.",
