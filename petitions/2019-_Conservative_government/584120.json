We must take this chance to put a limit on non-essential flights before people get used to flying all the time again. If we are to start flight holidays again, there must be rules to decrease aviation emissions from individuals.\r\n\r\nFlying is one of the biggest emitters of CO2 per mile of all modes of transport, accounting for around 3% of global emissions. It is the mode of transport that is often the least essential and the most dependent on fossil fuels.",
        "background": "There should be a law that limits the amount of non-essential flying an individual is allowed annually, to reduce aviation emissions, which have a huge contribution to the climate crisis. \r\nEither limit distance for flying per year and/or limit the number of flights per year.",
