        "action": "Hold a public vote on how the UK should respond to the second wave of SARS-CoV-2",
        "additional_details": "It makes no sense that people can't visit friends and family in secluded private properties, but can still go to public venues, such as bars and restaurants, surrounded by strangers. The government has essentially proved themselves inept with the current and past handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\r\n\r\nA public vote should be held with detailed choices for the people to make an educated decision on how the UK should handle this pandemic.",
        "background": "The current and past lockdown rules have either not been strict enough or make zero sense. This has come to light due to recent guidelines stating that unessential workers still have to work, the ability to still go to restaurants/bars but the termination of being able to see our friends and family.",
