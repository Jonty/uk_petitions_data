This means some months I'll either have 2 wages going in one assessment period or none, affecting my Universal Credit payment. UC payments also come after my rent is due which can mean being late with rent. If I was able to change my assessment period to one 5 days later this wouldn't keep happening, as it probably does to many other people.",
