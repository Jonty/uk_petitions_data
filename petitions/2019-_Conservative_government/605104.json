Children, and adults without phones or with older phones, need Covid proof of Covid-19 recovery. It is not acceptable that some people cannot obtain proof of Covid-19 recovery. I petition United Kingdom government to make Covid-19 recovery passes available on paper, by telephone request, delivered by mail.",
