There is already a struggle to gain maths teachers who are fully qualified, alongside finding the timetable space to ensure space for 5 subjects rather than 3. Furthermore, combining a levels and t levels defeats the object of both qualifications, and forces students who do not wish to attend university into academic pathways they may not wish to go down.",
