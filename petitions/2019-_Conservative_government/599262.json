        "additional_details": "We believe that many 16 year olds lack the knowledge of adulthood, responsibilities and social understanding and as a result can be at risk of being groomed and convinced to do things they might not really want to do.\r\n \r\nA 16 year old dating a 30 year old is completely legal in the eyes of the law, unless they are in a position of trust. Many children over the age of 16 are easy targets for older people, especially if they have mental health problems or disabilities.",
