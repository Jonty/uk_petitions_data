        "additional_details": "The ability to focus or concentrate is affected due to their fears of the Corona-virus. Also, the possibility to contract the virus and spread it further is more likely, as most of the students don't live by themselves and use the public transport. Some of them decided not to come in the last couple of days and this affects their attendance. I consider the Government measures to be very soft yet, as we are facing a world disease which might have a huge impact on our lives. Because the technology allows us to learn and work from home, why not to do this in those hard times?",
        "background": "I would like the Government to enforce this action due to the growing fear among students to attend classes.",
