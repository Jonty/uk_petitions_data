        "additional_details": "The Turkish state has criminalised the very identity of Kurds and labelled us as terrorists for wanting to keep our language, identity and culture. We are tired of being used when we are needed, making our lives seemingly dispensable in return for financial benefits from the Turks. Since World War I, Kurds in Turkey have been the victims of persistent assaults on their ethnic, cultural, religious identity and economic & political status by successive Turkish governments. Kurdistan deserves better.",
        "background": "The U.K. has been aiding Turkey in their attempt to exterminate the fourth largest ethnicity in the Middle East by sending them weapons & drone parts. 81 air strikes have been launched, most of which had been completed through the use of weapons that the U.K. has sent to Turkey. THIS NEEDS TO STOP!",
