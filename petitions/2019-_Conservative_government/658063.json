We have now reached a point where we need our pensions paid to support us. It shouldn't matter where we live as we have contributed to our pension through the system our whole working life. We believe the non-payment of increases for pensioners living abroad in certain countries is downright immoral. We think the only justification for this is that the government wishes to save money. We are only asking for what we believe we are entitled to, nothing less nothing more.",
