        "action": "End UK Export Finance's loans and financial guarantees to fossil fuel projects.",
        "additional_details": "Climate change is the most significant strategic threat to our wellbeing, both nationally and globally.  There is no doubt that the extraction and burning of fossil fuels has been a significant cause. Given what we know about the situation, continuing to invest in the oil and gas industry when we should be transitioning to sustainable energy sources is madness. \r\nThe UK government should seize the opportunity to become a world leader in developing sustainable energy solutions instead.",
        "background": "UK Export Finance offers loans and financial guarantees.\r\nBetween 2013 and 2020 it invested \u00a36bn in fossil fuel projects.\r\nUK support to the oil and gas industry has to end if we are to address global climate change. We are asking the UK government to change its policy on this issue immediately.",
