Often, we are told it's our period or an STI, and given contraception to \"fix\" the problem. Often, we go undiagnosed with our issues, sometimes until it's too late. People are physically, mentally, and emotionally suffering because of the sheer lack of care and understanding surrounding our bodies. More research is urgently needed to help improve this situation.
