They also do not get the option to self quarantine should they wish or  the option to work from home. \r\n\r\nThey are some of the lowered payed jobs and some of these key workers work harder than any other sometimes taking on more than one job role and in these times much more of a risk.  \r\n \r\nNot to mention with the hours being decreased this cuts into their monthly pay as some work evenings etc. \r\nNurses\r\nCarers \r\nRetails workers \r\nCleaners \r\nDelivery drivers \r\n\r\nAnd so on, without these people, we would not be able to function and to show appreciation and support a pay rise would be a good start. \r\n\r\nDo the right thing by them and acknowledge them. \r\n\r\nThank you.",
