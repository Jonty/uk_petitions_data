Homework comes along with all sorts of stress and anxiety about deadlines etc. If British schools aren\u2019t damaging enough to one\u2019s mental health they have to go home and continue work from school at home. Children deserve breaks and the border between school and home should not be crossed. Also children will socialise more which is really important after being locked inside during covid.",
