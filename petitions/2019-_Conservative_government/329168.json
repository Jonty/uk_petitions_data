        "additional_details": "The way in which Paternity Leave is currently available does not allow adequate family time to bond and support before one parent must return to work. The change this petition implores the government to implement is:\r\n\r\nMake Paternity Leave equal to Maternity leave, with the same guidelines for pay, duration and when it can be taken, to enable fathers/partners to support the mother through the last few weeks of pregnancy, and to allow more quality family and bonding time with new baby.",
        "background": "Currently, Paternity Leave is unfair. Gov.uk states fathers and partners of pregnant women can:\r\n- only have 2 weeks leave, which must end within 56 days of the birth\r\n- not take leave before the birth\r\n- only take extra leave through Shared Parental Leave IF the mother is also eligible for SPL.",
