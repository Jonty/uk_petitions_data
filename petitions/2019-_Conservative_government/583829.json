        "additional_details": "Following the events of the last 48 hours, the current ownership system in the UK is a direct threat to the culture and livelihood of the game. The government needs to crack down and make legislative change for the betterment of our game.\r\n\r\n50-1 means that private investors cannot take over clubs and push through measures that prioritise profit over the wishes of supporters. The ruling simultaneously protects against reckless owners and safeguards the democratic customs of German clubs.",
        "background": "Implement the 50-1 rule which means that clubs \u2013 and, by extension, the fans - hold a majority of their own voting rights. For example under German Football League [DFL] rules, football clubs will not be allowed to play in the Bundesliga if commercial investors have more than a 49 percent stake.",
