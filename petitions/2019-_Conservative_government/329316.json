        "additional_details": "Students have been out of National education for reasons beyond their control; they do not deserve to be discriminated against, simply because of the year they were born. Many students rely on these grades for their dream University Course, or a life shaping apprenticeship, perhaps their Sixth Form. Therefore, we implore the government to overturn this ruling, these grades change people's lives. We have worked just as hard as any students before us, and deserve our futures just as much.",
        "background": "The grades that are awarded by the education body should be in line with previous years and not be statistically adjusted to reflect how they haven't been in education. The government should award grades that reflect every student's ability as accurately and consistently as possible.",
