        "additional_details": "There are thousands of British citizens who are trapped in Australia without any form of income or ways of travelling back to the UK.\r\nDue to COVID-19, work places are not taking on staff and have let large numbers on temporary workers go. This has lead to many people being unable to financially support themselves.\r\nNearly all transit destinations have closed borders and flights have been cancelled.\r\nMany are trapped due to following the FCO's disgustingly delayed and inadequate advice.",
        "background": "We want the government to act to create safe and secure travel routes for all British citizens who are stuck in Australia. Also the creation of a quarantine facility when we arrive in the UK so as to not put further strain on friends and families.",
