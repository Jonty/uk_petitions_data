        "additional_details": "Everyone is having to pay higher rate NI but the pension tax relief is clearly a system which favours the wealthy, the very group who need it less, while the lower rate tax payer who needs every opportunity to save for retirement is only afforded tax relief at 20%.  Equalising everyone to 20% would at least end the discrimination against the lower paid.",
        "background": "Reduce pension tax relief to 20% for all.  Lower rate earners should not be disadvantaged with lower tax relief than higher rate earners. Current system is socially unacceptable and patently unjust to the lower paid. Ending the differentiated system would also bring major savings for the treasury.",
