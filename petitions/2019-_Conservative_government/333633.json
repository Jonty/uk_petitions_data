The hospitals also have regulations in place, so we believe that with measures, one other person may attend antenatal appointments with low risk of spread.\r\nCurrently, Fathers-to-be are unable to take a first look at their child/children through scans, and women who are expecting may feel distressed attending these appointments on their own.",
