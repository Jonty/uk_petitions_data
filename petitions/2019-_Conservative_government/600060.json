        "additional_details": "If cannabis was legalized by the government it could be taxed like cigarettes and alcohol. Cannabis maybe considered harmful but cigarettes are much more harmful.\r\n\r\nCannabis legalization should generate profits and taxes. It could help empower people that risk their life over drugs. Companies from other countries could move and generate more taxes and revenue for the UK.",
        "background": "I want the Government to legalize cannabis for recreational and medical use in the UK. By legalizing cannabis the Government can help step out of recession.",
