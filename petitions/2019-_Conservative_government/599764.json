        "additional_details": "Quality education without discrimination is a basic human right - and Muslims should not have to face this difficulty. There should be a fair alternative if this is the case - an interest-free loan can help thousands of Muslims not feel as if they are disobeying their religious belief and going against morals in order to pursue a higher education. This is a burden no-one should bear!",
        "background": "Each year, Muslim students in the UK struggle making to take out a loan (that is forbidden as it accrues interest). Some Muslim students try and fund their education themselves - and struggle a lot in the process because they cannot afford such high fees. This is clearly an unfair injustice.",
