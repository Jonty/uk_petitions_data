They are advertised as 'veterinary' but are obviously for general sale. Nothing says you have to prove you're a vet to buy it. If your dog needs it's ear amputating for medical reason a veterinary surgeon already has the surgical instruments required.  I believe these kits are likely to be used without anaesthesia, pain relief or under aseptic conditions.",
