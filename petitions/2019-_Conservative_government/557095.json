They also play a huge part in relieving the stress on the NHS as without them, other conditions will worsen and result in medical attention. Gyms have not been proven to be a breeding ground for COVID and they have all adopted strict measurements to enable safe operation. It defeats the object allowing everyone else to work hand in hand together, but forcing fitness centres to close.",
