        "additional_details": "Because fitness centres are vital in maintaining public health and well being. They also play a huge part in relieving the stress on the NHS as without them, other conditions will worsen and result in medical attention. Gyms have not been proven to be a breeding ground for COVID and they have all adopted strict measurements to enable safe operation. It defeats the object allowing everyone else to work hand in hand together, but forcing fitness centres to close.",
        "background": "Allow gyms and fitness centres to remain open following the guidelines which they have already put in place. Without this, this winter will face a massive increase in depression/ even possible suicide and more.",
