More than 100,000 hospital admissions are due to heart attack.\r\n\r\nTherefore routine screening for heart problems should be considered as a preventative and potentially cost saving approach.",
        "background": "Currently no routine cardiovascular screening programme on the NHS. Many people die each year from undiagnosed heart conditions. A routine heart screening programme should be offered to all over the age of 30 in order to prevent undiagnosed heart conditions and prevent early death from heart attack.",
