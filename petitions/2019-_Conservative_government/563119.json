        "additional_details": "The challenging conditions of Bangladeshi Cox's Bazar (where the Rohingya refugees fled from systemic persecution and violence in Myanmar) does not justify the decision to shift over 100,000 refugees to Bhasan Char, an unsuitable, formerly uninhabited, remote island; in effect a detention camp. An inhumane decision and a deprivation of the human rights of the Rohingya. Lack of medical care and humanitarian aid, serious environmental issues will result in suffering and oppression of the Rohingya.",
        "background": "So the United Nations\u2019 may undertake a prior independent technical and protection assessment of Bhasan Char and review the sustainability and environmental conditions on the island. Bangledeshi Government to permit unfettered humanitarian access to Bhasan Char by relevant human rights organisations.",
