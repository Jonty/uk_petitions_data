        "additional_details": "Immunotherapy is working wonders on many cancers. However, the NHS will only fund many immunotherapy treatments for a maximum of 2 years/35 cycles. Furthermore, if the cancer returns or spreads after this time, NHS rules mean many patients are not allowed to re-access these treatments if they had received them previously \u2013 even if they didn\u2019t receive their full 2 years/35 cycles in the first round. Lives are being lost when there are effective treatments available.",
        "background": "Currently many cancer patients can receive immunotherapy only for a maximum of 2 years, even if it is having a positive effect on the cancer. Commit to funding immunotherapy for cancer patients on the NHS with no cap on treatment duration, and allow patients to re-access this treatment if required.",
