        "additional_details": "Period poverty is a problem in this country:10% of girls can't afford products, 15% struggle, 12% have had to use make-shift products and 14% borrow from friends because of affordability issues. Hundreds of thousands of homeless women also can't afford products. The pandemic has exacerbated this, with more people falling into poverty. Scotland can do it. So can we.",
        "background": "I would like the U.K. government to make Period products (i.e. pads, tampons) free. The tampon tax has been abolished but Period products are still costly, especially for people struggling financially.",
