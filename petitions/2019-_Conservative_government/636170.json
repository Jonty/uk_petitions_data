        "additional_details": "I have contacted several EU embassies in London, but they have redirected me to visa booking companies, who are known to engage in this exploitative practice. Formerly, I started searching for other visa agencies and found several which sold a visa appointment slot for over \u00a3300. \r\n\r\nThis highlights the urgent need for the UK Government and Parliament to take action and ensure that the visa appointment system is fair and accessible to all UK residents. #RegulateEUEmbassyAppointments",
        "background": "The current state of booking a Schengen visa appointment is unfair to those in need and causes significant financial and emotional stress due to poor services. As a result, I want the UK Government and Parliament to regulate visa appointments for EU embassies to ensure fair access for UK residents.",
