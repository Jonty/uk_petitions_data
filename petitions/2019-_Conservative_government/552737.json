        "additional_details": "There are concerns that the ban on using external agencies which \u201cpromote partisan political views\u201d could prevent movements like Black Lives Matter, and learning resources produced by agencies which support it, from being taught simply because some might feel this is a partisan matter. This is despite the fact that the protests and widespread calls for change have been worldwide news. A PSHE Curriculum should be relevant for children and provide an opportunity for current issues to be reflected on in a safe space. It also seems strange that, when discussing politics, certain political views cannot be referred to.",
        "background": "In the new Government guidance for planning a RSE and Health Education Curriculum for PSHE there is an ambiguous section on guidance around using external agencies and their materials. There needs to be clearer guidance on what this means and which type of organisations are being referred to.",
