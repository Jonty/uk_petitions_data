        "additional_details": "Given that the result of any Police investigation would likely result in only Fixed Penalty Notices being issued there is simply no justifiable reason for any further delay to the publication of Sue Gray's report, or for the report to not be published in full.  To the public and Parliament the reasons given for delay appear as a Whitehall whitewash and manipulation by Downing Street intended to buy the Prime Minister time to garner support.",
        "background": "Parliament and the public expected Sue Gray's report to be published and available for scrutiny early last week (commencing 24th January 2022).  We have been told that the report has been delayed in order to not compromise the Police investigation and that the report will likely be edited",
