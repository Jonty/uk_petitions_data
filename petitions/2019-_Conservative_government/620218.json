        "additional_details": "To ensure ostomates can change their bags with ease, this funding should be used to provide the following in these facilities:\r\n\r\n- A shelf area\r\n- 2 hooks\r\n- A full length mirror\r\n \r\nFunding should also be used to ensure a sanitary bin for the disposal of stoma bags is placed in all toilets.\r\n \r\nEvery 39 minutes an individual undergoes stoma surgery (Colostomy UK statistic). Ostomates use disabled toilets and whilst these facilities meet the needs of those with mobility issues they do not meet the needs of ostomates, whose needs too, fall under the Equality Act 2010. Ostomates deserve access to appropriate facilities. Men should also have access a sanitary bin for disposals. These changes will support ostomates to continue reaching their potential without facing avoidable barriers.",
        "background": "The Government should fund local authorities and businesses to improve disabled toilets for the public and workers, so they meet the needs of people with a stoma (ostomates). Disabled toilets often do not have space required for the equipment needed to change a stoma bag.",
