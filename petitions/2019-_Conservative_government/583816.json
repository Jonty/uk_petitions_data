        "action": "Mandate at least 51% fan ownership of all English professional football clubs",
        "additional_details": "Following the attempt by 6 English football clubs to break away into a European Super League, systematic ownership reform is needed to ensure the national game isn\u2019t stolen from fans and communities by wealthy, distant investors with little connection to the history and traditions of the sport. This change would mean supporters who helped build these football clubs and have deep cultural ties to them, would retain control of the direction, core values and decision making at Board level.",
        "background": "The government should introduce new legislation to mandate all football clubs in England must maintain a majority ownership stake of at least 51% by non-profit supporters association(s). This measure should mirror and have the same objectives as the current model in Germany, founded in 1998.",
