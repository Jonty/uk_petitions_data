        "additional_details": "Abortion or termination of pregnancy is the deliberate ending of a pregnancy. Over 200,000 abortions take place in the UK every year, 98.1% of which are conducted under ground C, which is to say that the abortion has been allowed to protect the mental and physical health of the pregnant woman. This is a life saving procedure in more ways than one, that needs to be protected.",
        "background": "The government needs to enshrine women's right to abortion into law, to ensure the right to choose is protected. Due to the recent reversal of Roe v. Wade in the USA, and wide scale banning of abortion in America, it is clear that women's right to abortion is not as safe as we thought.",
