        "additional_details": "1. Infection is rising. Masks offer some protection. \r\n\r\n2. Masks do not harm the economy, but  help by protecting shop and transport staff and commuters.\r\n\r\n3. We might choose a mask, but the choices of others will be imposed on us - the opposite of personal freedom and responsibilty, especially for  the vulnerable and fearful. \r\n\r\n4. Vaccinations : make masks optional when the programme is complete.  It insults all the  commitment, sacrifice and tragedy if gesture politics wreck the few remaining weeks before vaccination protects us all.",
        "background": "We urge Government to keep the legal requirement for masks in shops and on public transport until vaccinations are practically complete.",
