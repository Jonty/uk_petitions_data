        "additional_details": "I believe the Highway Code now favours cyclists to the detriment of pedestrians, especially regarding the use of shared pathways. Much of the Highway Code is merely advisory to cyclists including the use of a 'bell'. The HC states: \"...slow down when necessary ... let [pedestrians] know you are there; eg., by ringing your bell (it is recommended that a bell is fitted to your bike), or by calling out politely.... do not pass pedestrians at high speed...\".",
        "background": "With so many cycle lanes, the Government must implement clearer rules. Some cyclists do not adhere to speed limits. Cyclists often go at speed and without bells. This can often result in heated encounters and has potential for accidents.",
