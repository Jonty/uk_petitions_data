        "additional_details": "I think the Uk government need to work together to solve ongoing crises. No single party will be able to provide what the country needs; many have tried, and all have fallen short of the requirements. Ive had enough of listening to MPs bickering like children and not working together interparty to provide for the nation. The role of running the nation requires teamwork and maturity. A mixed cabinet would allow every party to have influence over proceedings after a vote on which MP is assigned which role, it also portrays a more unified front to the country's population and allows the people to believe that there is some order about things as the government has become a laughingstock.",
        "background": "not only elect cabinet members from the same party but rather have votes within parties to elect worthy MPs regardless of party.",
