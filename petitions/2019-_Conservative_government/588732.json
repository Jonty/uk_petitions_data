She recently recieved a letter just in time for another appointment.\r\nAs mentioned before, if The Royal Mail are currently falling far behind with deliveries (as they are here), then I strongly believe until things are back to normal and they can once again deliver a good service there should be no 1st or 2nd class but a set price between the two.",
        "background": "The Royal Mail are saying 'due to Covid' they can't gaurantee delivery times. If they can't gaurantee delivery within a 1st class period then they should not be allowed to charge for 1st class. Until they can once more deliver on time I feel there should be a fixed price between 1st and 2nd class.",
