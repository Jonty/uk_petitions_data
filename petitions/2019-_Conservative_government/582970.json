        "action": "Change the punishment for stealing/attempting to steal family pets to kidnapping",
        "additional_details": "If the sentence was the same as kidnapping a child, for example, there would be much higher risk for the criminals if they got caught, and the number of dog thefts would reduce drastically. Currently dogs are being stolen from their owners in broad daylight in the street, criminals are breaking into homes and they are endangering thousands of people. It's up to Parliament to make our streets and our homes safe again for the many, many people who have pets in their lives.",
        "background": "Make the sentence for stealing family pets to the same as kidnapping a person. Pets are members of the family, they love us, they breathe, and they feel pain. They are not possessions that can be replaced and the current punishment isn't enough to deter criminals from trying to ruin a family.",
