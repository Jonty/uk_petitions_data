Although the Government is not responsible for individual closures, we think it is important they share this information. We believe the closure of the Post Office can be a contribute to the economic decline of an area, and vulnerable residents can struggle to cope with the closure. Many people, e.g parents of young children, are busy and confined by routines so we believe need a local Post Office.",
