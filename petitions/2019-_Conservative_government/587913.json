It shouldn\u2019t be.\r\n \r\nThe Government needs to ensure that \"allergy waivers\" do not become the norm by banning their use. \r\n \r\nCatering for allergies is possible and is not difficult.\r\n \r\nMany restaurants and cafes actively engage in training to understand and better serve allergy customers. They are food champions and should be used as examples of excellence. \r\n \r\nThe use of waivers will damage progress in food safety, put allergy customers - and others - at risk, and increase social isolation for those with allergies.",
