        "additional_details": "The world is under threat from the effects of global warming.\r\n\r\nLegislating for improved fridge efficiency should help reduce our carbon footprint and prevent climate change.\r\n\r\nFridge doors may be useful, but can cause problems with hygiene (particularly since the covid-19 pandemic) and for people with mobility issues. Therefore the aim should be improving efficiency whilst maintaining the open design if possible.\r\n\r\nI propose legislating for a target of 50% improvement in energy efficiency over the next 10 years.",
