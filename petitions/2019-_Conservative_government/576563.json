        "additional_details": "I've been a water safety campaigner for nearly 10 years. In 2011 my 1st born son went for what he thought was an innocent swim, sadly it cost him his life.\r\n\r\nLife's never been the same.\r\n \r\nMany people lose their lives due to a slip, trip or fall. Runners, walkers & cyclists are all high-risk categories where drownings are concerned.\r\n\r\nI've tried & failed many times to get water safety on the national curriculum.\r\n \r\nThe Government should review and enhance curriculum content on water safety, so schools are required to ensure that all children know about and know how to deal with issues such as cold water shock and rip currents.\r\n \r\nIt will soon be the 10-year anniversary of Dylan\u2019s death. I never want you to feel the pain I do.",
        "background": "As a country we see many water-related fatalities every year. We see many more call outs to water related incidents. Throughout lockdown year our coastguards were tasked to almost double the call outs than in the previous year. Our children NEED to learn about Cold water shock & rip currents.",
