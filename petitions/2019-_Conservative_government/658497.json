We believe the general public do not require the access to any substance that can be used as a chemical weapon. Many cleaning products are corrosive enough to be used as a weapon and are sold widely in supermarkets. We believe no household requires such strong cleaning agents. These substances can cause injury and death.",

This should include; bleach sodium hydroxide, ammonia, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or any substance with a concentration great enough to cause injury.",
