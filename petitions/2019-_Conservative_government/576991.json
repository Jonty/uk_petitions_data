        "additional_details": "With COP26 in November 2021, we have to start viewing these types of products in a similar way as we do tobacco.\r\n\r\nThis ban would not prevent the sale of these products but would make them less attractive. Additionally, this ban would incentivise organisations into producing their products in a much more sustainable way and/or consider plant-based/cruelty free alternatives.\r\n\r\nBy making these changes, organisations could then take full advantage of the benefits of a multi channel marketing campaign.",
