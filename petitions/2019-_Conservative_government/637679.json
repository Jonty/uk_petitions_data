        "additional_details": "Disabled people should have the same right to travel abroad for holidays, work, family and other reasons as non-disabled people. Travel like this does not change a person's care or mobility needs. Disabled people shouldn't have to inform the DWP of travel abroad lasting under four weeks. People on tax credits only need to notify travel abroad of over 8 weeks. This is less favourable treatment of disabled people and we believe is discriminatory.",
        "background": "The PIP handbook says claimants should notify the DWP if they are planning to go abroad for 4 weeks or more, but the guidance on changes of circumstances says \"You must contact the PIP enquiry line if [...] you go abroad.\" This is inconsistent. Both pages should refer to travel of over four weeks.",
