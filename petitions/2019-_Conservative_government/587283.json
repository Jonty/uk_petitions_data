        "additional_details": "An increase in equity will eliminate the line between the less fortunate and the rich. The government wouldn't have to give financial aid for low in-come families, which is known as benefits. Hopefully this would come to your understanding and acknowledgment that this issue can have an impact on families' and workers' quality of living. We believe that the pros will outshine the negatives and we're sure the two million of the UK's lowest paid workers would agree too.",
        "background": "Raising the minimum wage is important for around 2 million UK's lowest paid workers.These workers would be expected to benefit in things such as rent and other house hold expenses. Raising The Minimum Wage would allow the low paid workers not to be effected by inflation.",
