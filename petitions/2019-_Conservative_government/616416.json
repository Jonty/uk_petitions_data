Your petition refers to adding a \"None of the above\" option to all elections, but it's not clear if you want a majority voting for none of the above in a local election in a particular area to result in the dissolution of Parliament. In the case of a general election, Parliament is already dissolved, and does not sit again until a date set by royal proclamation."
