        "additional_details": "As we emerge from covid, many employers recognise the benefits of flexible working arrangements and many employees want a mix of home and office work. \r\n\r\nCurrently, train season tickets are duration based. This pricing structure means commuting two or three days a week costs the same as five days and for some will prevent a return to office based working at all and for others will force a full return.\r\nNeither outcome is good for individuals or businesses.",
        "background": "Season tickets do not support flexible working - to be cost effective they require individuals to be in the office full time. This already discriminated against part-time workers, and will hamper post-covid part-home/part-office transition. We need new bulk journey ticket pricing - eg. 100 journeys.",
