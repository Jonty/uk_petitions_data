        "additional_details": "A new industry is emerging in the UK for converting ICE powered vehicles to electric. This has the potential to be a big sector of the automotive world in years to come, especially with the ban on new ICE cars from 2030. The conversion costs are lower than the cost of a new car, and this would potentially allow those who cannot afford a new car to get an older model converted to keep it on the road and be green at the same time. At present converted cars are still subject to their tax class.",
        "background": "Change legislation to allow cars converted to electric propulsion to be inspected and reclassified as zero emissions for their road fund licence. This would open up a new industry in the UK for converting cars to electric, which is more environmentally friendly than buying a new car.",
