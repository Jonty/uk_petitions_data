        "additional_details": "Many MPs don't know what it is like to receive a one percent pay rise on an already low salary, and if public sector workers had been given the same rise as MPs have been given, year after year for at least a decade, then their salaries would not have fallen behind and there may not have been any need for strikes.\r\n\r\nPay for public sector workers should be linked to pay for MPs, to show equality is given to everyone. MPs are paid by the tax payer like public sector workers, but are awarded generous pay deals. Public sector workers deserve better.\r\n",
        "background": "Ensure there is equal pay awards for all public sector workers to match the percentage rise given to MPs each year. This should stop their living standards from falling behind and help prevent strikes. The Government should no longer set public sector pay increases.",
