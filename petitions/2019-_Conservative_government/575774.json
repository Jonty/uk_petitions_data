        "additional_details": "I feel it will be very educational for students to know as many come out of graduating and schools clueless of these topics as they are not taught in schools. Most people over 18 wanting to get a house won\u2019t know what a mortgage is, how to get a good credit score, how to avoid being in debt. If the government would swap lessons that aren\u2019t needed as much for this is will be educational and help people that will want to buy a house in the future etc.",
        "background": "I feel strongly that as soon as kids graduate and leave school they are clueless about the real world. What I would like the government to do is to swap out unnecessary lessons such as pe for finance lessons to teach students about taxes, credit score etc.",
