A lorry started moving into my lane and despite using the horn, they were still pulling in and I was very quickly running out of room. Being the hard shoulder, I was about to be squished between the metal barrier and this lorry. I had less than a second to slam on the brakes and get behind them. I only narrowly avoided the trailer thanks to the Emergency Refuge Area. It was pure luck that it was there at the moment I needed more room.",

I was forced to slam my brakes and only just narrowly avoided the barrier or the trailer. I had nowhere to go except backward!",
