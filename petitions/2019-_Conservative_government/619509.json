An average person in the UK gets 56% of their calories from ultra-processed foods. Research is demonstrating how dangerous these products can be. We believe the NHS is in danger of being overwhelmed by cases of type 2 diabetes and other chronic illnesses if the Government does not require warnings on ultra-processed foods.",
