        "additional_details": "By global standards British women are safe: yet the UK has the second highest rate of Femicide in Europe. Countries across the world are considering making Femicide a crime. Violent killings of women by men are not isolated, but part of a social problem reflecting power and value. Criminalising Femicide in UK law would strengthen data and convene a national conversation about this pandemic. It is simply unacceptable that in 2021, in such a developed nation, a woman cannot safely walk home alone.",
        "background": "On average in the UK, one woman is killed by a man every three days. This figure is unacceptable. Femicide is defined as \"the killing of females by males because they are female.\" By criminalising Femicide, the UK will have the data and powers to address a prevalent and devastating social problem.",
