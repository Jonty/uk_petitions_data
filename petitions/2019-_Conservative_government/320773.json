        "additional_details": "Coronavirus Act 2020 does not take into consideration that business shutdown is not by choice but mandated by the national lockdown, merely deferring rents is not going to help cover the rental costs for the leased premises, infact the rent pile up has impacted the long term viability of the businesses. Govt. should waive off rents for the time the premises are not usable due to shutdown. Landlords should not charge rent for this period and renegotiate leases if business is no longer viable.",
        "background": "The UK lockdown measure for Covid-19 have mandated most businesses to close doors directly impacting their revenues, but as Tenants they are still liable to pay rents for their premises under the Commercial Lease agreements. Government should waive off rents for the time the premises are not usable.",
