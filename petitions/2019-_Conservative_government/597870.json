        "additional_details": "Parents are not only worried about the long term effects of COVID for their children but they are also worried about the stress their children are suffering worrying about possible GCSEs when they have missed so much school. As a teacher I have students breaking down worrying. Many didn\u2019t have support and resources to be able to work effectively and keep up with remote learning. We are trying to catch up students with very different starting points. Centre assessed grades are the fairest system",
        "background": "The current year 11\u2019s are perhaps THE most affected year so far in terms of interruption to their learning. There are many of them now testing positive and schools cannot possibly support those suffering with catch up when so many are already at very different points in terms of their understanding",
