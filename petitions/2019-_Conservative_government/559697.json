Our British Democracy has been bequeathed to us by previous generations, who, have fought two World wars for its continuance. If we are to learn from their sacrifices, it is that the only way to avoid war initiated by an aggressive protagonist is to invest in our Defence Forces to create a genuine deterrent",

Spending \u00a3100bn per year on defence that will stimulate significant economic growth. This is the \u2018now or never\u2019 moment for Britain to make our shores secure.",
