        "additional_details": "I am a British citizen and journalist in Ukraine. Like many others, I\u2019ve witnessed Russia\u2019s brutal military actions in Ukraine and Ukrainians, including children, continue to die from Russia drone and missile strikes. Many of these deaths could be prevented by the supply of more air defence systems. I believe it is our moral duty to provide these systems. Every day we delay we play a part in the unforgivable rise in civilian deaths. We promised to help Ukraine. Let\u2019s fulfil that promise.",
        "background": "The UK has done a great deal for Ukraine. But every day, we believe delay and inaction from western politicians is resulting in the deaths of more innocent Ukrainians, particularly in regions such as Kharkiv and Odesa. We have plenty of air defence systems - send them to Ukraine NOW!",
