        "additional_details": "Racist material on social media has proliferated with little accountability. Social networks often do not provide evidence to police, and take little action themselves, as though they bear no responsibility for the hate they publish. This must end.\r\n\r\nNew legislation must urgently introduce a requirement to remove racist incitement within set timeframes, a duty of care for social networks with personal liability for executives, and tighter requirements to provide evidence to police under warrant.",
        "background": "Campaign Against Antisemitism and others have long called for the regulation of social media. The #NoSafeSpaceForJewHate campaign arose due to social media companies\u2019 failure to remove hatred. The Government must bring an Online Harms Bill before Parliament during 2020 and make it law by July 2021.",
