People who already have a property and wanted to invest the money in \"buy to let\" will be happy. Whereas first-time buyers may suffer if property value goes up.\r\n \r\nRestricting this scheme to first-time buyers will help enable more people reach the property ladder, without increasing competition with existing homeowners or risking inflating property values.",
