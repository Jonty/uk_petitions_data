        "additional_details": "Rodenticides are causing the deaths of other species of birds and mammals, caused by the consumption of prey which has ingested a rodenticide. Toxins from the chemical brodifacoum for example build up causing a slow, suffering death. The use of rodenticides is not target specific enough and can cause wider lethal implications to other animals in the environment. We believe the sale and use of these products should be banned.",
