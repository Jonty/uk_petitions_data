        "additional_details": "Year 10 and Year 12 students have faced and still are facing an enormous challenge in the year prior to their exams, at the time of writing this they have not be informed of any changes to their exam season commencing in May 2021, despite the unprecedented levels of disruption due to the closure of schools to most pupils because of the Coronavirus pandemic. Many schools have not been doing virtual lessons, meaning many students have been left behind with the increasing strain of self teaching.",
        "background": "We ask the UK Government to give special consideration to Years 10 and Year 12 pupils sitting their exams in 2021, to ensure they receive a fair grade to recognise their work during this hugely disrupted academic year, not purely assessed by exams in 2021 but work done over their whole course.",
