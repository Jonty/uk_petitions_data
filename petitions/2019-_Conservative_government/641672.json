        "additional_details": "Contactless journeys have succeeded across London and the other cities in the UK and other places and they should be introduced more widely to the rest of England to modernise the rail industry. This is more needed when the rail industry intends to close many ticket offices. This is an easy system that can be introduced and should give better value for money and greater access to railway stations and other places.",
