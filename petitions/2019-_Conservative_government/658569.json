        "additional_details": "I think there is systemic underfunding of the NHS and the care sector which is contributing to poor outcomes for patients and citizens of the UK. I think the consequences are clear to see. In this context, I believe the Chancellor\u2019s decision to cut NI payments by 2p again, having already done this in his 2023 Autumn Statement is simply not in the best interest of the country. We want this decision to be revoked.",

We want this decision to be reversed immediately.",
