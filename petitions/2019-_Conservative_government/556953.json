I am aware that many people use fireworks appropriately, but even then, there are animals and children that are hurt and terribly frightened by the unexpected loud noises.",
        "background": "There are countless stories of how fireworks are used to cause damage, inflict pain and disrupt the peace. \r\nThey are used to throw at people walking their dogs, posted through letter boxes, thrown at cars and wildlife and used as ammo at protests. \r\nThey are too dangerous to be given to the public.",
