As such, they should have the ability to democratically decide their own constitutional future without undue interference from external entities.\r\n \r\nWe believe changing the Scotland Act to legislate for referenda on independence is essential for upholding the democratic rights of the Scottish people & respecting the principle of devolution. We think that denying this change undermines the democratic process.\r\n",
