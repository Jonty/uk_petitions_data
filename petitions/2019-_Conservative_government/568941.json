Country of origin is only discovered once the item has been paid for and delivered denying the consumer an informed choice.\r\n\r\nWhether consumers want to be patriotic and buy British, buy cheaply from China or opt for quality from whichever country they believe fulfills their requirements, they cannot do so within the current framework.
