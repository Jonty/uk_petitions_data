        "additional_details": "The decision of the UK government to open primary schools on June 1 may put the public at greater risk of being infected from the Coronavirus. The government's ambition to start with early year settings, nurseries, Years 1 & 6 will be detrimental to what has been achieved by the lockdown. It will jeopardise social distancing, especially when dealing with 0-5 year old kids. It is common sense not to rely on kids who are uncontrollable and can't control themselves.",
        "background": "The Parliament should force the government to revert its ambition of opening primary schools, nurseries and playgroups across England on June 1 and postpone it till the House of Commons and the House of Lords convene as full houses in their chambers and not virtually.",
