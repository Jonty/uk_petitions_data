        "additional_details": "The 12th of July 2021 marked the start of widespread rampage throughout the provinces of Kwa-Zulu Natal and Gauteng in South Africa. Many stores and businesses were entirely pillaged and burned to the ground. A devastating number of people lost their livelihoods in less than a day. Members of the community were forced out onto the streets, working around the clock to protect their homes and their families. Food shortages became a very real and frightening future. Thick clouds of smoke were seen for miles. Valiant efforts throughout the country have mitigated the immediate threats, however the root of the issue remains. The people of South Africa desperately need help.",
        "background": "Please consider allowing South Africans, particularly from the worst hit areas, to gain refuge in the UK. South Africa has had ties with the UK for years and it needs your help now. The riots have left whole cities ruined and resulted in hundreds of deaths. ",
