        "additional_details": "Many believe that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is on the horizon. All that may be needed for it to happen is more compute and data (money) being thrown at it. Some experts have said that powerful AI systems are already uncontrollable (and only not a significant danger because they are relatively weak). Systems much more intelligent than humans may be built soon, and may be inherently uncontrollable. We need to pause development of these systems globally until there is a consensus on how to align them to humanity.",
