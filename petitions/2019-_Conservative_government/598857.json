        "additional_details": "Bring in Legislation banning or restricting the use of magazine inserts which will help mitigate wasting resources and emissions not only caused by the production of the waste inserts but also reducing the weight of delivery that will also help. All of this benefits us in our mission of climate change. After all, reduce waste come before reuse and recycle as recycling still uses valuable resources.",
        "background": "I subscribe to magazines and receive excessive amounts of advertising inserts which are not remotely connected to the magazine and go straight into recycling. This is a huge waste of resource and energy and increases emissions due to the production and extra weight of delivery and needs regulation.",
