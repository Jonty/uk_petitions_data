        "additional_details": "Many autistic adults get rejected at the interview process, no matter how great their CV is. For example, if they struggle with communication, eye contact & processing information, most employers assume they're rude & incapable.\r\n \r\nIf autistic people get hired, not enough employers know how to best help them in the workplace, which can result in meltdowns and more mental health issues. If employers had more understanding, these issues could be prevented & autistic people could thrive in the workplace.\r\n",
        "background": "Even in this modern day and age, many employers still have a lack of knowledge and understanding on Autism Spectrum Disorder, why employing someone with autism can benefit the workplace, and how best to help staff with an autism diagnosis, but this needs to change to include this amazing community.",
