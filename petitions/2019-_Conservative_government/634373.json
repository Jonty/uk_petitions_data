Sue has an income of \u00a37800 per year plus ESA.\r\n\r\nSarah also works 15 hours per week at \u00a39.76 per hour and is paid monthly, which given V4800 means that she is NOT entitled to ESA for 8 months of the year. Sarah has an income is \u00a37612.80 per year with a loss in ESA.\r\n\r\nWe need to encourage people to work when able and not penalise them for doing so.",
