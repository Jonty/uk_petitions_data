        "additional_details": "It\u2019s important to work on information made available, pre-pandemic we were advised that Covid19 was not transmissible. The more we learn about how infectious the virus is and asymptomatic people are, is it not probable we have reached an earlier peak without any overwhelming of services or need for social distancing measures, considering the virus was circulating in Europe in December and no measures were in place and no travel measures still are in place. Can we re-evaluate our position now?",
