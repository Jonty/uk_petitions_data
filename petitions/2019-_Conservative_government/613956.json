        "additional_details": "The Brits today have no benefit of ease through passport security in either their own country or any EU country they visit. At a minimum we need our own GB passport section for arrival back to our own country. Treatment is not reciprocated and I have been told very clearly I cannot queue with EU passport holders when I travel abroad. This is about fairness and ease of travel.",
        "background": "On arrival into the UK there is GB/EU/Swiss section - then all other passports. I have to queue with EU passport holders to get into my own country - yet I am not permitted to queue with them on entry/exit from their country. I didn\u2019t want Brexit but I would like a GB passport holder section only.",
