Charities are inundated daily with pets that owners can't  afford to keep.\r\n\r\nResearch has shown that owning a pet can reduce stress levels, lower blood pressure, decrease feelings of loneliness etc.   In 2022, 62% of UK households had pets, but it is down to 57 per cent now.\r\n\r\n It is estimated that savings of up to \u00a32.45bn to the NHS could be achieved through the  therapeutic aspects  of pet ownership",
        "background": "We believe that the British Government should acknowledge the value that pets bring into our lives - not only as companions but also as contributors to our physical and mental wellbeing.\r\nUK government should provide tax relief for pet owners.",
