        "additional_details": "The effects of the Coronavirus pandemic have been devastating on everyone, particularly current year 12 students who had their GCSE learning curtailed and their A levels have been disrupted with students having to study online, periods of isolation by students and teachers, and reduced access to resources. Whilst many sixth form/colleges have done an amazing job of supporting students and providing A level content, this has not been equal for all students across the country.",
        "background": "Change the content of the 2022 A level exam papers. This could be by reducing the number of topics from each subject; give the students more question option choices, or by giving students advance notice of exam content or open book examinations. Each subject will need a different approach.",
