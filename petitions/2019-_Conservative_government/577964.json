        "additional_details": "In 2022 Red diesel will no longer be legal for users of off highway plant.  I understand the reasons but for small plant contractors in rural areas we will be competing against farmers and agricultural contractors whom will still be allowed to use Rebated fuel. Come April 2022 Owner Operators and Small Independent Plant contractors will have a harder Job operating in rural areas due to this. Allowing us to only use red in agricultural work would blur the lines and make enforcement harder.",
        "background": "I would like small providers of plant machinery in rural areas to be allowed to use rebated fuel in there machines so we can remain competitive with farmers and agricultural contractors who will continue to be allowed it.  The Industry should be a level playing field and at the moment it is not.",
