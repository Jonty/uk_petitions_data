        "additional_details": "I believe all associations with the politician trade within Bristol should be removed. This includes renaming street names, buildings, schools, removing all statues and plaques. These items should be place within a museum for people to view as historic artefacts. \r\n\r\nThe recent events of removing the statue of Edward Colston should be evident to how passionate the people of Bristol are about removing offensive bits of history to glamorise something as horrific as the transatlantic politician trade.",
        "background": "I would like the government to remove building names, statues and street names associated with the save trade as it encourages anxiety and depression to descendants of the politician trade as it glorifies these former politician owners. Over the years, we\u2019ve becoming more educated and understanding.",
