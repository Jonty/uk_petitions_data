        "additional_details": "Many of these British nationals are classed as high risk or elderly yet unable to obtain Covid-19 vaccinations locally either freely or by purchase. Many have found themselves trapped in a high risk country with few people vaccinated due to a variety of reasons. Unable to travel without considerable risk and expense and unable to get vaccinated locally, their only hope of obtaining a vaccine rests with the British Government helping them in their hour of need.",
        "background": "There are an estimated 5-6 million British Nationals living abroad. Many are unable to obtain Covid-19 vaccinations locally. We propose the British Government help by offering them the same access to Covid-19 vaccines they would get as if they were in the UK.",
