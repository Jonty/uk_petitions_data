        "additional_details": "The COVID-19 pandemic has placed major stress on low income individuals and families, particularly on their ability to put food on the table. \r\n\r\nIn 2019/2020, 1.9 million people used a food bank. However research from The Trussell Trust forecasted a 61% increase in food parcels being needed across its UK network as a result COVID-19.\r\n\r\nIt is shameful that 1.8 million tonnes of food are wasted each year by food manufacturers, their commitment to halve waste by 2030 is not enough.",
        "background": "The government should adapt laws surrounding excess food to permit supermarkets and retail businesses to donate their left over food to food banks and local charities without risk of legal action or requiring special insurance to do so.",
