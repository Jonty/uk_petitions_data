        "additional_details": "As schools move learning online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, digital inclusion is more important than ever. Already vulnerable young people should not be further disadvantaged by school closures. In UK state secondary schools, there were 468,780 pupils known to be eligible for and claiming free school meals in January 2019. These children and young people may not have access to adequate equipment and connectivity, and should not be excluded from their education.",
        "background": "The Government should ensure that children have unrestricted personal use of an up to date, internet-connected computer with a full keyboard, at least from KS4 (the school year they turn 15). Government should urgently fund this for disadvantaged students such as those entitled to free school meals.",
