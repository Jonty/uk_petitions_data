We should be educating our children about the British empire and the harm it caused to millions of people so colonialism never happens again, but we should not be celebrating these people in any way, shape or form due to the atrocities they have committed all over the world and their contribution to the racism we see in our societies today.",
        "background": "The UK has a number of statues, street names and venues which celebrate prominent figures in the slave trade and the British empire. For example, Cecil Rhodes in Oxford University, Chochrane Street in Glasgow and the Wills Memorial Building in Bristol, to name a few.",
