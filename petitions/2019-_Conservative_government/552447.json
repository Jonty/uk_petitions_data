        "additional_details": "We have seen this year through the Black Lives Matter protests, that actions have to be taken in order to make up for mistakes of the past. Greeks will soon be celebrating 200 years of independence from the Ottoman rule, which had oppressed them for 400 years and the marbles were allegedly obtained during this period. Therefore, this petition asks from Britain to make it up to people of Hellenic heritage by returning the marbles back to Acropolis to be housed in the new Acropolis Museum.",
