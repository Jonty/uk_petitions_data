The reduction of pain and the increase of safety for mothers and babies is important enough to put this measure in place.",
        "background": "Community midwives are often called to attend pregnant women at home who feel they are about to give birth. Paramedic training in childbirth is minimal and it is safer to have midwives present for both mum and newborn.",
