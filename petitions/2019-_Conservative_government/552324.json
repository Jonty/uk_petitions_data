        "additional_details": "By restricting the number of wedding guests to only 15 you are all but ruining the wedding industry\u2019s chance of recovering. When you allowed 30 there was a slight glimmer of hope. \r\n\r\nMany venues have an abundance of space at their disposal, meaning guests are almost always 1m plus from others.  Pubs and restaurants are allowed to have more than 15 people at a time, a venue is just the combination of the two.",
        "background": "We would like the number of people allowed at a wedding to be reversed back to the 30 previously allowed. Giving venue staff, events companies, cake decorators, photographers and many more a chance to earn a living.",
