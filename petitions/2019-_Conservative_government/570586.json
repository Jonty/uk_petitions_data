        "action": "Ensure all Police Forces enforce the emergency legislation for face coverings",
        "additional_details": "Many Police Forces are either wholly or partially failing to utilise their extensive enforcement powers under regulation 5 of The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Wearing of Face Coverings in a Relevant Place) (England) Regulations 2020.\r\n\r\nCurrently, many Forces are leaving almost all 'enforcement' to the premises staff, who have no powers whatsoever. This subject recently hit the headlines, when most of the big supermarkets decided they must take action themselves. This is almost entirely futile for the persistent offenders, who have been committing offences and continue to place lives at risk since the Regulations came into force on 24th July 2020.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls on the Home Secretary to urgently acknowledge and remedy this fact, in order to save lives.",
        "background": "The Home Secretary must take urgent corrective action to ensure that the emergency legislation concerning face coverings is being adequately enforced by every local Police Force. This is an urgent public heath issue, for which effective enforcement is vital to our fight back against this virus.",
