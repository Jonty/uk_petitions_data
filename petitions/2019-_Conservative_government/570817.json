        "additional_details": "Poultry keepers and businesses in NI and the RoI make a huge contribution to the poultry fancy in the UK. The above changes would mean the vast majority of those fanciers and businesses would not attend events in England, Scotland and Wales.\r\n \r\nWe fear this could lead to many fanciers giving up keeping rare, pure and traditional breeds of poultry, which could put many breeds at risk, and be to the detriment of poultry keeping across the UK, as well as businesses such as livestock auctioneers.",
        "background": "The introduction of the border down the Irish Sea has meant that poultry keepers in the RoI and NI wishing to move birds to and from GB need to meet strict rules, including salmonella tests, EU Health Checks and a 21 day quarantine in the host country. We ask for these changes to be reviewed.",
