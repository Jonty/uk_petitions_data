        "additional_details": "In Islam, the prayer is mandatory. Students should be allowed to pray in school, since it is one of the main parts of their faith. Since some schools do not allow students to pray, we believe it should be a legal right to do so. Students should be allowed to go to as private of a space as possible (e.g. an empty classroom) at lunch or during lesson time for 5-10 minutes each day around the midday prayer time (Dhuhr salah). Since prayer is such a huge part of their religion, school should not get in the way of letting them practice their faith.",
        "background": "Prayer is a compulsory part of Islam, however school can get in the way of one or more of the 5 required daily prayers. We think it should be a legal requirement to let students pray during school hours, and that not providing that opportunity goes against the Equality Act 2010.",
