        "additional_details": "The Government have decided to scrap the results of the consultation as they \"were skewed by an avalanche of responses generated by trans rights groups.\u201d\r\nThis is unfair and undemocratic! They held the consultation, got their results, & MUST follow up on them. Our trans siblings are one of the most vulnerable groups today, facing discrimination and often violence at a disproportionate rate. We need to carry out the results and apply the new guidelines from the consultation like they promised!",
