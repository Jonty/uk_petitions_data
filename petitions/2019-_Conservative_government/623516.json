        "additional_details": "In 2011, the IAPT National Team reported an average recovery rate of 43%. However, independent studies suggest the figure was lower, as those not completing treatment were not included in measure. Instead, perhaps only around 23% recovered. Those labelled recovered may also be borderline cases rather than achieving substantially improved quality of life. Figures for 2011-12 show the Government\u2019s targeted 50% recovery rate being missed by most IAPT services. We believe an independent review is needed into IAPT interventions, to explore their efficacy more fully.",
        "background": "The Government should commission an independent body to evaluate efficacy of Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services. This would provide better understanding of the efficacy of these services.",
