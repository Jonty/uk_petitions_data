LGBTQ+ people have a higher percentage of mental illness. Young LGBTQ+ people are more likely to self harm and commit suicide from bullying due to their identity. With the government now allowing the teaching of diversity and inclusion on the curriculum, LGBTQ+ anti-bullying campaigns should run alongside this, as they come hand in hand.",
