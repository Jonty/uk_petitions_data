        "additional_details": "This has been arranged by the government but a large number of students have been ignored and missed out. This is unfair. The specialist subjects are just as tough now as they will be moving forwards for new students in 2020 onwards. 2019 intake have Had placements and study time removed and this has to be made up I. Year two. This adds even more stress and insecurity to the students. They are already struggling and could do with all the help they SHOULD be entitled to.",

They are studying the same subjects. Especially New year 2 who have to struggle throughout Covid 19 without proper university time.",
