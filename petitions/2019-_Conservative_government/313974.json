        "action": "Make Economics an Ebacc subject for GCSE alongside History and Geography.",
        "additional_details": "In Economics you learn about small scale businesses and the huge political decisions a government makes. This can help broaden the mind of those who study it and create a relevant understanding of the processes that shape the world around them. It is in a government's best interest to promote Political education in order to increase participation in elections and the option to attain GCSE understanding of economics (which is often not available in secondary school) should improve this hugely.",
        "background": "The English Baccalaureate suggests all GCSE students take English, Maths, the Sciences, Geography or History and a language. I would like the government to include GCSE Economics as an option alongside History and Geography as I feel it is of equal significance and is often not taught until A Level.",
