        "additional_details": "COVID-19 severity is heightened by obesity, Heart disease and Type II diabetes. Mortality rises with these underlying conditions. Exercise can also help address Stress and Mental health problems. Fitness is a vital industry.\r\n \r\nReduced capacity due to COVID-19 has financially stressed the fitness industry. Every penny lost in VAT could save the NHS money & resources. The health and wellbeing of the population must improve to prevent a permanent health crisis the nation cannot afford.",
        "background": "Cut VAT on health and fitness services including personal training, gyms and any physical activities which can protect, preserve and enhance physical, mental and emotional health, helping relieve the burden on the NHS caused by obesity. This reduction in cost would make exercise more affordable.",
