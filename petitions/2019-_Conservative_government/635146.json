        "additional_details": "Student teachers should be paid to carry out placements that are needed to qualify as a teacher. We are expected to work to similar levels as teaching assistants and sometimes qualified teachers yet we are not paid. Due to this, many students have to work part-time as well as complete university work even though there is little time. This can have negative impacts on mental wellbeing. The shortage of teachers is often discussed and this change could encourage the younger generation to get into teaching.",
        "background": "The Government should provide schools with funding to pay students at least an apprentice wage. Becoming a student teacher is time-consuming and can be stressful, along with university work and part-time jobs. We make a huge contribution when on placement yet are not paid for this work.",
