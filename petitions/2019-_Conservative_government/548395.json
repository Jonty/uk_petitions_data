        "additional_details": "Williamson has proved how incapable he was at producing an efficient substitute system for judging eligibility for grades. A-Level students who were made to feel demoralised by a ludicrous substitute grading system, should be shown justice. The system used discriminated against minorities; where you come from, who you know and what your story is, should not determine your access to opportunities and it should definitely not be used as a barrier to achieving greatness.",
        "background": "To fire Gavin Williamson from Government for his manipulative \u2018algorithm\u2019 system of grading. It is no coincidence that private school students have attained higher top grades than ever before. Whereas, schools with low-income students received nothing but discrimination & demoralisation.",
