We consider that this is extremely damaging to their development. I have seen many examples of this in young people under 16. I am very much someone who thinks children need protecting at all costs, and I think this is a good place to start.",

We believe the algorithms are designed to take advantage of addictive tendencies, and exploit choices. We think this is morally wrong, and detrimental to children\u2019s minds.",
