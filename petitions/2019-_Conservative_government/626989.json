        "additional_details": "With abolishing the bedroom tax it would ease a bit of pressure from us as we are struggling to make ends meet. Being on benefits don\u2019t cover all living costs from eating to energy crisis and rising prices.  I would like this to be looked at something that can be done.  As more pressure is put on us as the energy price cap isn\u2019t for the 2 years as promised and prices set to rise again in April.  In a modern world we shouldn\u2019t have to live like this. So please consider this request",
        "background": "With the cost of living and rising prices I\u2019m asking that the bedroom tax be abolished to help us Vulnerable . Disabled and the Elderly who have to pay this out when it would help us in this crisis. As it would be spare money to help towards our cost of heating our homes this winter.",
