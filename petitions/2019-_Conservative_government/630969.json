        "additional_details": "The baby is genetically 50/50, and we believe it should not be up to the mother to agree whether a father is added to the birth certificate.\r\n \r\nIf a mother doesn't agree to reregister a birth certificate, a father needs to get a Declaration of Parentage from the courts, which can be time consuming and costly. We want fathers to have the right to be added to the birth certificate without a court case, if a DNA test has been completed and there are no welfare reasons.",

I would like Government to give fathers the right, if a DNA test has been completed and there are no welfare reasons, to be added to the birth certificate without a court case.",
