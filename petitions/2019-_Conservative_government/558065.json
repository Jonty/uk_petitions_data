        "additional_details": "It\u2019s unfair people have their driving tests postponed and due to the unlikelihood of coronavirus transmission in a car for around 40 minutes tests should continue. The executive and parliament must keep the nations interests at heart, and to cancel driving tests would be a depressing time for many especially with transmissions being incredibly low. Make sure tests aren\u2019t cancelled.",
        "background": "Everyone who has a driving test booked in November should sit their test. Many test centres are fully booked, the measures in place make tests safe enough to sit, the virus can only be transmitted from air particles, meaning the measures already in place are working, driving transmissions are low.",
