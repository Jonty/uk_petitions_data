As vaccines become unusable after a short period of time, this is a waste of valuable vaccination doses that could be given to other people, optimising the vaccination programme and saving more lives.",

This is to deter individuals from booking a vaccination if they don\u2019t intend to have it, thus avoiding wasting doses.",
