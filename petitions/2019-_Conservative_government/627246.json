        "additional_details": "Rarely do MPs vote after any consultation with the public, which means they are currently not fulfilling their role in representing the views of the majority of their own constituents in the House Of Commons. This is undemocratic. The public would then have a right to a full explanation if the MP chose to vote against what the majority of their own constituents have expressed they want via a simple online polling system that should be available before each vote.",
        "background": "The UK public elects MPs to represent their interests and concerns in the House of Commons. MPs currently vote on issues without polling to actually know how the majority of locals feel. An online voting system for all constituents would give MPs a very clear picture of how they should be voting.",
