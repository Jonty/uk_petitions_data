This means that not only do people have the option to choose the right motorcycle for them but it also helps with the interest and sales of motorcycles in the USA from the younger generation. The interest in motorcycles in the UK isn't as high as they used to be, this is because the younger generations are not interested because the amount of licence types and underpowered bikes you can only ride until you turn 21/24(direct).",

This would allow anyone who has passed the CBT, theory test, practical test can ride any cc/type motorcycle at the age of 17 years.",
