        "additional_details": "There are 5 million self-employed workers in the UK, many of whom are the main earner in their household. Many are the entrepreneurs of the UK, they pay a higher % of their earnings to tax as their overheads tend to be lower than a business and yet they are the group that are being penalised by the government during this unprecedented worldwide pandemic. The package currently in place for self-employed would not even cover most families food bill. There businesses will never recover.",
        "background": "The self-employed should be treated the same as employees, to be funded to the same 80% or similar. If not done then the self-employed will be forced to abandon their businesses they have built over years to earn money other ways, meaning most won\u2019t ever be able to return to the business they built.",
