        "additional_details": "Family and frequent visitors who would like to avail this option have to dish out a lot. These visitors do not avail any public funds and spend towards the tourism industry anyways. Giving them a cheaper option to get a long term multiple entry visa could lead to more travellers and boost to economy. The hassle of going through a visa process every time you have to travel puts people off and sometime causes unnecessary hassle.",
        "background": "The Government should reduce the cost of Standard Visitor visas so they are more in line with other countries such as France which charges 99 Euros. The current Standard Visitor visa fees for 5 and 10 years are cost \u00a3655 and \u00a3822. This is too much. ",
