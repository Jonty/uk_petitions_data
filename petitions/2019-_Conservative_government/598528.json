Women are under attack because of an unchallenged culture of misogyny, and it has to stop.  Make misogyny a hate crime, so women start to have more confidence to live their lives fully.  Make misogyny a hate crime so that police forces can deal with it.  Make it a hate crime to transform our culture into one where misogyny is no longer acceptable.",
