        "additional_details": "The spread of COVID-19 is only worsening and keeping schools open is an oversight.\r\n\r\n\u201cSchool bubbles\u201d do not function as intended, since schools across the country are connected by siblings and parents, e.g. my household connects to five different schools, due to four pupils and two teachers. \r\n\r\nUniversities are proven breeding grounds for this virus, with many students hospitalised due to COVID caught at university, despite safety measures.\r\n\r\nA lockdown with open schools will not stop the spread.",
        "background": "In the event of a second national lockdown, the government should close the schools and universities, reinstating online learning until the virus is under control and no longer a nationwide threat to life.",
