        "additional_details": "Local wildlife, farmers, communities have relied on moorlands for generations and these vital peatlands are under threat with livestock unable to graze safely now. These illegal, vehicle users are shredding moorland to pieces. This problem has grown over the years and the increase is mainly adults using our moorland to exercise off-road bikes/4x4s and has now reached an overwhelming level. The huge increase in this illegal activity is damaging breeding grounds and the environment to a huge level.",
        "background": "Penalties for illegal off-road driving should be increased, with greater minimum sentences/fines and vehicle confiscation, to deter the huge increase in recreational off-road vehicle usage on grazing/common land which is damaging the livestock, our wildlife, environment and rural communities.",
