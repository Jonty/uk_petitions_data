Forcing us to do our exams a year later, or even just in September, is extremely detrimental for morale, forcing us to spend Summer holidays revising, something we\u2019ve been doing for the past 2+ years.\r\n\r\nWe feel we deserve a proper break. Making us do exams later will be a domino effect on our whole educational career, causing late university and college entrances.",
