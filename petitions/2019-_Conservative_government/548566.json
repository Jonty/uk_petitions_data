        "action": "We would like more funding to be given to NHS Mental Heath Services",
        "additional_details": "The Government promised more funding and in particular long term support for trauma survivors. This funding was inadequate. People who already suffer from trauma are being left with no face to face consultations. COVID is by is nature re-traumatising these patients. In particular patients with Dissociative Identity Disorder are being failed as they require long term therapy. They cannot access this via the NHS because NHS do not have the resources to provide long term therapy. We ask for action.",
        "background": "We feel people with long standing mental health issues are deteriorating due to COVID. More people are developing anxiety for example during this time. NHS is struggling to keep up with demand on their services and patients are suffering due to help not being available.",
