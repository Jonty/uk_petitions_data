        "additional_details": "On April 11, I was walking on Quay Street in Manchester when someone shouted anti-Asian abuse at me. While I was watching Compartment No. 6 today, a mass shooting took place at a subway station in Brookly's Chinatown. Many Asians were at the scene, and some were shot. The police are still investigating whether it's a terrorist attack (or a hate crime). The anti-Asian hate is spreading fast on the Internet and it has no border.",
        "background": "In the film, a character jokes that she only thinks of redheads as real humans, and goes on to say that for this reason, she doesn't count Chinese people as humans. This film thus promotes the ongoing anti-Asian hate. Please suspend showing it in the UK for the moment.",
