        "additional_details": "I think that conversion therapy should be banned under the Human Rights law like other countries have. Many places have introduced a full or partial ban, including Canada, Malta, Germany, Mexico and parts of Australia. In Germany, under-18s are not allowed to receive conversion therapy. AND now FINLAND have banned it.\r\n\r\nScientists have even said it is harmful to stop people from being who they want, please make it against the law.\r\n\r\nProfessional bodies have warned all forms of conversion therapy are unethical and potentially harmful. In practice, it means trying to stop or suppress someone from being gay, or from living as a different gender to their sex recorded at birth.",
        "background": "I want the UK to ban Conversion in the UK as I feel it is unacceptable and we should be allowed to be who we are, whether that's non-binary, being Gay, Lesbian or whatever us as people want to be, why should there be a horrible therapy that denies people who are part of the LGBTQ+ community be them.",
