Children are vulnerable to severe impacts from government decision making. They have no legal representation in process, and their future needs as citizens who deserve sustainable lives is poorly factored in. The coronavirus response, resulting educational disruption for those who can tolerate it least without adequate mitigation, and the failure to respond adequately to the climate crisis, demonstrate that something is wrong in how government accounts for and acts on equality issues.",
