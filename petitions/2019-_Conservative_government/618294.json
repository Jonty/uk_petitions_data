Girls and women shouldn't be charged for a natural life process and something they can't control. Especially if they're in a public restroom, and the toilet paper is free because it's needed for a natural life process, and that's what a period is, yet it costs money. They would save money on pads, tampons, underwear, and the waste that goes along with it.",
