        "action": "Impose a 100% tax on alcohol and gambling advertising to fund support services",
        "additional_details": "I believe alcohol and gambling companies should be free to spend as much as they like on advertising, so long as they are legally required to contribute an equal amount to fund support services for people adversely affected by alcohol and gambling.\r\n\r\nThere are huge numbers of people addicted to alcohol and/or gambling. With the current financial situation Government funding for support services is constrained. These companies have profited from people's addiction so it seems appropriate to require that they financially contribute to funding support for victims of addiction.",
        "background": "Some years ago tobacco companies were banned from advertising. It has been suggested that a similar ban should be imposed on alcohol and gambling advertising, but I believe a tax requiring these businesses pay an amount equal to any advertising, to fund support services would be more effective.",
