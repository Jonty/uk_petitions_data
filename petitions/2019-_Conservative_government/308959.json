        "additional_details": "There will be thousands of A-LEVEL students walking into University with their predicted grades without even having to touch an exam paper, and there will be thousands of BTEC students who will never enter a university because they would have failed their course due to the amount of stress from the Covid 19 virus and having to complete their assignments at home with limited guidance from their tutors. It's only fair if we did the same for our btec students.",
