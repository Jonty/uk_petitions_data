        "additional_details": "Not only are these reception and Year 1 children less likely to be able to observe social distancing, but have more time to compensate for lost time in schools. Children sitting their GCSEs and A-Levels next year don't have this extra time to compensate for online learning, which isn't as effective as in-person lessons. Boris Johnson expressed a clear desire in his speech on 10/05/20 to get all primary students back at school by summer but was incredibly vague regarding secondary education.",
        "background": "As of 12/05/20, the UK government's roadmap for slowly easing lockdown mentions very little about students facing exams next year. The current plan is to open schools for younger children first, which I don't believe is fair on secondary school students, especially those with vital exams near.",
