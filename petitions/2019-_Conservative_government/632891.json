        "additional_details": "As the Government supported victims in Ukraine, we would expect to see the same support for the victims of the Earthquake affecting Turkey and Syria. The Government was willing to pay people to house Ukranians. The Turkish Community would do this for free. The Turkish people need help and support and the UK CAN provide such help. We would happily open our homes to victims given the opportunity to do so. Support your Turkish population. We have done much for this economy. Please help us in return",
        "background": "The UK has an estimated 500,000 people of Turkish origin living in the UK, and almost 30,000 Syrians. All of these people, and more, would be willing to open their homes to victims, since most are related by family anyway. Open the borders, and allow victims of the earthquake in to stay.",
