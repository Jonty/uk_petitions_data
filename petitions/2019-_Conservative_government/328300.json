        "action": "End the UK's provision of weapons, military training and support to Saudi Arabia",
        "additional_details": "The Yemen crisis is becoming one of the world's worst disasters with 24 million in need of humanitarian aid. The UK are complicit in the war as Saudi's second largest arms exporter. British bombs are killing Yemeni citizens. The MoD fails to keep track of whether Saudi-led coalition attacks constitute a violation of international law. By claiming not to know if attacks are unlawful, the government can allege there is no clear risk that weapons will be misused and hence no reason to halt exports.",
        "background": "In June 2019, the court of appeal found UK weapon sales to Saudi Arabia to be unlawful. Since then, the government has committed to not issuing any new licences for exports, but is allowing already-registered companies to continue exporting. We are petitioning for the government to end all exports.",
