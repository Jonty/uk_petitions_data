        "additional_details": "Studies have shown that online learning is 15% less effective than regular learning, it therefore makes sense that students should be paying less for a lesser service in their tuition fees. Universities have been lacking in not only their support offered for studies, but also for those having to self-isolate in university accommodations and beyond. It is not fair that students should pay full fee for a greatly reduced and inadequate service to what was originally offered to them.",
        "background": "RefundUsNow2020- Students have been majorly neglected by universities and offered a reduced service, therefore a 15% flat rate refund on tuition fees is necessary to better reflect the change in service.",
