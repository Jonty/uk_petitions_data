        "additional_details": "At a time when our bee and pollinator numbers are in freefall, it is madness to allow the use of a pesticide known to be extremely harmful to our bee populations. What is even more frustrating is that this decision goes against the Governments own expert panel who recommended against the move. \r\nBees play an essential role in supporting our food pollination. We need to move away from a reliance on toxic chemical pesticides if we are going to reverse the nature emergency in the UK.",
        "background": "We call on the government to reverse its decision to approve the emergency use of thiamethoxam, a type of neonicotinoid which is known to be lethal to bees, wasps and other pollinators.\r\nThis decision comes just days after the European Union's highest court blocked its deployment on the Continent.",
