        "additional_details": "Many teams will not be able to survive the season if they don't allow fans back in. Ticket sales is where clubs earn most of their money from, if you take that away they won't be able to pay their players and staff and will eventually lead to the club folding. If the club folds then many people will be made unemployed. On top of that going to watch football is a distraction from fans lives for a number of fans and not allowing them in will affect their mental health especially if they fold.",
        "background": "Repeal the new restrictions that stops clubs from opening their doors again. Clubs that have the capability to open with fans socially distancing should be allowed to allow fans back in, in a reduced capacity.",
