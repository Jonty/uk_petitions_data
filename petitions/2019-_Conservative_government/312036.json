        "additional_details": "The cost of this is estimated to be \u00a35.3m, which could be better spent on frontline support to deal with the pandemic.\r\nMost people have access to television, radio, social media or mobile phones. The media has been flooding people with this information, and the letter has already been published online, so there is no point sending it.\r\nThe benefit of most methods is that people can access information in their preferred language, whereas it is likely that the letter will only be sent in English.",
        "background": "It was announced today that the Prime Minister is going to send a letter and leaflet to every household in the UK about the Covid-19 pandemic. This is a waste of resources - financial, those of the Royal Mail, and the postal delivery service.",
