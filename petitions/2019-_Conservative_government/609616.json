        "additional_details": "Many Ukrainian people are fleeing their country in order to escape the Russian invasion. The fighting is escalating and people are scared for their lives and those of their families. \r\n\r\nThe UK has stopped accepting visa applications from Ukrainians stuck in their country,  meaning there is currently no safe and legal route for them to seek asylum in Britain unless they have British relatives.",
        "background": "The government should waive all visa requirements for Ukrainian refugees fleeing the fighting, and provide a safe and legal route to the UK. This would comply with Priti Patel's claim of 'unwavering support for Ukraine', which are words at odds with her current actions.",
