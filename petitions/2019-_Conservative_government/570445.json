        "additional_details": "Myths about rape are so widely believed by the public that their ability to deliver justice is compromised. Change rape trials from a panel of juries to a panel of assessors. This would mean informed individuals would look at evidence and make more informed decisions regarding rape convictions. Panellists could help inform the judge in the case about relevant issues, and remind them of some of the facts as well as the myths; for example, people of all ages, from babies to elderly women are raped (sexual attraction has nothing to do with it). In the UK, we are scraping 6% in getting a rape conviction out of rapes reported, nevermind convincing 12 members of the public the defendant is 100% guilty.",
        "background": "(42%) of the time defendants in rape trials walk away free as the jury are told to vote \u2018not guilty\u2019 if they have even 1% of doubt. Multiple reports find false beliefs regarding rape affected jurors decisions in court. This includes myths that blame the victim and beliefs of what \u2018real rape\u2019 is.",
