However, many animals still suffer due to their owners' errors, often stemming from a lack of accessible, evidence-based information. Government courses would increase the accessibility of this information and prevent animal suffering. The UK already has some of the most comprehensive animal protection laws in the world. Let's properly support all pet owners in upholding them!",
