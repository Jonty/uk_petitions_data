If children were educated on this, maybe there would be more understanding in the world. We teach children to be happy in our own skin, but not enough about being happy with other children\u2019s differences. So many children and adults have these conditions and yet not everyone understands them, people are sometimes bullied for being \u201cdifferent\u201d and for seeing the world a different way. Educating at a young age may help and it may not, but isn\u2019t this worth a shot?",
