Currently, BWV is not in full use in all UK police forces, and, crucially, it is the officer's decision when to record and when to turn off the recording.\r\n\r\nThis must change.\r\n\r\nTo achieve true accountability in a manner consistent with the principle of policing by consent, the Government must ensure this technology is used to scrutinise the police as well as the public.",
