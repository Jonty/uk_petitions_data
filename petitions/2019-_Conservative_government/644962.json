        "additional_details": "I want the Government to fund regular vocal checks such as a stroboscopy with a ENT and speech therapy sessions without the need to use expensive private services or having to wait months on NHS waiting lists.\r\n\r\nI lost my voice four months ago and it never came back completely. Voice problems are a common thing amongst teachers in the world, the school system doesn\u2019t help them. There\u2019s no regular checks, no vocal health support offered and no vocal hygiene sessions. In UK, teachers are left having to tame classes of 30 pupils at the time, some of them with problematic/dangerous behaviour. And if you teach a subject that is not English or maths, you very rarely get the support of a TA.",
