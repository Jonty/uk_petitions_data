There's no cure for CVS they can only treat the symptoms and there are few preventative medications due to lots of triggers being the cause of this illness. No doctor I've personally seen knows how to manage this illness effectively. If the doctors can't how can people with this illness maintain a normal working life? as a sufferer of this illness of 12 years its very hard.",
        "background": "Have the NHS and Government recognise CVS as a disability due to its debilitating nature. lasting 5-14 days sometimes longer in severe cases. CVS causes receptive vomiting episodes, severe headaches, loss of consciousness and for some have no quality of life and aren't covered by anything.",
