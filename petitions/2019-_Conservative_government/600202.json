        "additional_details": "Whales and sharks are not \u201cmonsters\u201d. They have rights!\r\n Whales, dolphins are sometimes used for their meat and fins, but they are hunted by countries that aren\u2019t third world countries, such as Norway, Iceland and Japan. Other countries manage to feed people without hunting them. These animals are hunted for money, driven by greed.\r\n Sharks actually are not as dangerous as we make them out to be. They actually kill only around ten people per year, and this is usually by mistake.",
        "background": "Commercial whaling was banned in 1986. However, Japan, Norway and Iceland have probably killed over 40,000 of these magnificent and vital animals since then. Whaling is not \u201cscientific research\u201d, it is animal cruelty, and it is an assault on animals who are vital to our oceans.",
