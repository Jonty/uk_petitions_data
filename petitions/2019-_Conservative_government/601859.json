The 1986 Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act has been surpassed by the 2003 Human Genome Project & Trans-Species Modelling Theory, explaining the human medical failure of animal tests. The Government must change the law to allow charities to exist for the purpose of securing a change in the law, such as revoking legislation that enables and requires animal experiments.",
