        "action": "Award Lance Corporal Job Maseko the Victoria Cross posthumously.",
        "additional_details": "L/Corp Maseko was a non combatant stretcher bearer who when captured by the axis forces took it onto himself as a POW to manufacture a home made bomb with which he blew up a German ship filled with military hardware, ammunition and fuel destined for General Rommel\u2019s troops fighting against General Montgomery . This probably helped the allied victory at El Alamein.\r\nHe was recommended a Victoria Cross by British higher command but his own command declined to award him this because he was black.",
        "background": "I want the government to investigate this case as the only reason he was denied the Victoria Cross was that he was black. His bravery exceeds most citations given to other Victoria Cross recipients. He planned his action and knew that if he was caught he would have been executed by the enemy.",
