People who suffer from long-term or chronic health conditions with no known cure like Parkinson's disease, asthma, COPD etc are not included in prescription exemptions list, which means sufferers must pay for prescriptions for their medication. There are some long term avoidable conditions that do qualify you as exempt such as diabetes.",
