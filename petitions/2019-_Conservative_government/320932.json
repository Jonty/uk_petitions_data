        "additional_details": "The fundamental rule of natural justice is that a disciplinary authority should be impartial and free from bias. The only person authorised to recommend the removal of a court judge from office is the Lord Chancellor. That does not guarantee impartiality or protect against bias.\r\n\r\nThe Government should reform the laws for removing judges and establish a new system whereby complaints against judges, and decisions about removing a judge from office, are considered and made by a public jury.",
        "background": "The law relating to a judge holding office during good behaviour only was introduced in 1701 but has never been used in the jurisdiction of England and Wales. Records confirm that at no stage during the last 319 years has the law ever been needed to remove a judge on the grounds of bad behaviour.",
