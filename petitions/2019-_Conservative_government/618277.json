        "additional_details": "I believe that only licensed and regulated professions should be allowed to buy and use sharply pointed knives.\r\n\r\nThis should help cut down on injuries caused in domestic knife crime. Yes indeed one could still be injured from a regular knife in an attack but generally not as severely.\r\n\r\nWhile this may not stop premeditated attacks, it should cut down life threatening injuries on moments of madness (spur of the moment attack).",
        "background": "The Government should ban the sale of all knives with a sharply pointed tip to the general public for domestic use.\r\n\r\nSharp end knives such as steak knives are too easily available, making it too easy for many to access a potentially dangerous weapon.",
