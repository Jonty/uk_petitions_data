        "additional_details": "Without specific legislation covering bullying, with a clear definition in law, be believe the extremely vulnerable individuals who encounter damaging or life changing behaviour/s in the workplace are being failed.\r\n \r\nThe Equality Act 2010 makes it unlawful to harass, discriminate against or victimise someone due to having one or more of the 9 protected characteristics as outlined by law. We want workplace bullying to be made unlawful on the basis of behavioural misconduct, free of such limitations.",
        "background": "There is no UK legislation to protect individuals specifically from bullying. Bullying can have devastating impacts on victims yet legislation does not make it unlawful. Employees can only take cases of harassment, discrimination or victimisation to an employment tribunal, not workplace bullying.",
