        "additional_details": "Electric vehicle (EV) public charging points are critical for EV adoption, yet all too often EV owners are discouraged from using an EV for any journey that requires a top-up charge because of the unpredictability of public charge point operational status. Typical charging point issues include loss of signal to the device or software malfunction. The onus is generally on the EV owner to report the issue to the charging point operator and that in itself is often a frustrating and fruitless process.",
