Causing considerable financial hardship.",
        "background": "Key workers who are unable to work as they have no suitable childcare available - due to the situation with covid-19 - who are unable to work from home, should be furloughed by their employers or be allowed to claim 80% of wages from the government. Instead of being forced to take unpaid leave.",
