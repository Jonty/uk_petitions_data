Dangerous drivers will be removed from the roads making our roads much safer and CO2 emissions could be hugely reduced with less vehicles on the road. Safer roads means less incidents caused, which in turn creates a safer environment for everyone. The rates of car insurance could be significantly reduced as the risk of collision/injury will be cut.",

Amber - Pass but must have some retraining. Fail - Must retrain and retest, can no longer drive on their current license.",
