        "additional_details": "It's hard to justify that the Ottomans had a legitimate right to sanction the removal of the marbles from Greece in the first place. \r\n\r\nI am loathe to make comparisons with the 20th century but, thankfully much looted art and property has been returned to its rightful owner since 1945.\r\n\r\nIt could be argued that the British Museum is the trustee of the marbles, as opposed to the owner. Therefore, there should be no reason why the government could not finally do the right thing and insist that the marbles are sent home.",
        "background": "I'd like to see the Parthenon Marbles returned to Athens and replaced in the British Museum by a copy thus allowing people to appreciate and study the history of ancient Greece just as effectively.",
