UK Public Sector spends \u00a3300B per annum, tax payers money should be spent to prevent negative climate impact and encourage positive climate solutions and innovation. This supports Governments stated strategy of being a world leader in climate change, its COP26 and broader climate obligations, while encouraging economic growth. Current policies have proven to be insufficient to drive the change required, hence legislation is needed.",
