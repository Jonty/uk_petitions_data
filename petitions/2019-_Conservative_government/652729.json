        "additional_details": "The changes will be impossible for many, especially younger people & women who have been shown to earn less. Cruel & completely unjustified, in the name of reducing immigration, it's going to rip families and relationships apart. Absolutely heartbreaking when most people just want to enjoy a life in the UK with the person they love and/or their family. The new requirements are impossible for many people yet they will be punished personally for it by not now being able to be with who they love.",
        "background": "Reverse the rule change due to be happening in april 2024 that will require British citizens or people settled in the UK to be earning a minimum of \u00a338,700 before their overseas partner can live with them on a spousal visa. An insane increase from the \u00a318,600 needed before and completely devastating",
