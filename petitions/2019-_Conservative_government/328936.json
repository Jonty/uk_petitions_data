        "additional_details": "The Highway Code states that drivers must not leave a parked vehicle with the engine running while that vehicle is stationary on a public road.\r\n\r\nLocal authorities can issue \u00a320 fixed penalties for emission offences, but this is imposed only if a motorist refuses to switch off engine when asked by an authorised person. \r\n\r\nEngine idling is a pointless and unnecessary contributor to carbon emissions, as well as being bad for our health. The current legislation is ineffective and needs to be reviewed",
        "background": "There is currently no way of reporting motorists who are parked up but are deliberately leaving their engine idling. \r\n\r\nThis is bad for the environment, and our health. \r\n\r\nWe need an app or similar that can be used on a phone to report engine idling, and for this to result in actions",
