        "additional_details": "During the periods of fireworks there is a high anxiety in animals not only just household animals but livestock as well this leading to post traumatic stress, loss of hearing and death. Fireworks cause a lot of air pollution in a short amount of time, leaving metal particles, dangerous toxins, harmful chemicals and smoke in the air for hours and days. In a fireworks display, those particles that fall to the ground often contain propellant chemicals and colorants which find their way into the soil and our water systems.",
        "background": "I would like you to make it illegal for anyone to use or buy fireworks. The only dates they could set them off is Bonfire night and New years eve",
