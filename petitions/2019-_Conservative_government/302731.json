        "additional_details": "Without understanding the extent of COVID19 infections, informed decisions cannot be taken by either HM Government or the general public. This stokes fear and panic and will not make the response to the pandemic effective. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommend testing and the NHS is prepared for it. WHO have also branded the decision not to proceed with testing a potentially deadly mistake. Ministers should review this carefully to ensure the country is protected effectively.",
        "background": "The World Health Organisation (WHO) has recommended an increase in testing however HM Government no longer view this as a priority. Full support should be given by the government for testing to ensure the UK is fully aware of the extent of COVID19 and can appropriately take action.",
