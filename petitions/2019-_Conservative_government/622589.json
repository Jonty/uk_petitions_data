        "additional_details": "Ofgem are supposed to regulate companies and heir prices for the benefit of the consumer yet their current focus appears to be to keep energy generators/suppliers in business. These companies have made excessive profits and must be able to limit their profit margins and still pay dividnends to their shareholders. There is no need for further price increases for consumers. This strategy would prevent government paying grants to them or pay outs to consumers.",
        "background": "Energy companies have made excessive profits yet they ask government to pay grants to cover price increases to keep energy prices as the are. This is neither economic for the country or customers who will eventually have to pay the for these grants to the government through taxation.",
