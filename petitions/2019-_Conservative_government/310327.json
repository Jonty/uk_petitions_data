        "action": "Extend Universal Credit to all UK residents during Coronavirus lockdown",
        "additional_details": "This crisis will have an enormous impact on the economy and the established infrastructures. People without income could become malnourished, and civil unrest could ensue leading to an increase in criminal behaviour. The current provision offered leaves many in the population without the support they need; the self employed, free lancers, zero hours workers, amongst others. This proposal streamlines systems that are already in place, freeing up administrators to focus on other urgent issues.",
        "background": "To support everyone & reduce administrative burden during the lockdown, extend Universal Credit to all residents without application. At the end of the tax year, those earning over an agreed liveable wage pay tax to fund the credit, the more they earn, the more they would pay back.",
