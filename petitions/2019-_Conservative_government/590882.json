This should be based on workers\u2019 earnings during the pandemic.\r\n\r\nHealthcare professionals (HCPs) aided the public in their time of need. Lack of adequate PPE has increased the risk to staff and patients. More preventative measures could have helped to avoid tens of thousands of deaths. HCPs have had covid, some suffer long covid. We do not yet know for certain the long-term effects of the vaccine. We should not face discrimination or financial hardship. With no choice please give us a chance.",
