        "additional_details": "We knew that once the 1921 census was made public, access would (initially) be via a charged service, to allow the contractors to recover the cost of the digitisation process.   It was assumed that this would be via a subscription based service licenced to the various Genealogy database providers. It is now apparent that online access is only availabe via a system that is too expensive for genuine access.  Access should either be granted on an affordable subscription or via all public libraries.",
        "background": "The 1921 census has recently been published, but the system of micropayments being operated by the contractor, Findmypast, means that effective access is only available to thos with extensive funding or with direct access to the National Archive at Kew or one of the fewdesignated libraries.",
