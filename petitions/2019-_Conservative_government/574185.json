        "additional_details": "No animal should suffer because their owner cannot afford treatment. Veterinary practitioners have a duty of care. The prices that vets are charging are nothing short of extortion and there is no safety net in place. Regulate the animal healthcare system as you would the human healthcare system and DO NOT deny animals treatment based on financial situation. I believe putting suitable measures in place would also reduce the number of animals surrendered to shelters, the RSPCA and such like.",
        "background": "I want Veterinary services regulated so that they cannot charge extortionate prices for basic animal healthcare. I also want a scheme in place that doesn't rely on credit history  to ensure that EVERY animal can be given the necessary care as and when it is needed , not when the owner can afford it.",
