For those reliant on insulin, carbohydrate counting is critical to administer the correct dose. Without nutrition information provided by the food service establishment, diabetics are left to estimate this value. This can lead to an incorrect dose of insulin and potentially result in hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia. This legislation would help diabetics all across the country.",
