        "additional_details": "In my personal experience, mental health issues and the stigma that follows are two different topics. I want this age group to be taught about the stigma attached to mental health, and the consequences of this. Primary school is often where bullying begins, which can affect the whole community and family dynamics. Had there been better teaching about this when I was an infant, I could have been saved from unnecessary suffering.",

By three years of age, common mental disorders can start to appear as disruptive behaviours, and emotional disorders. This can lead to disapproval, bullying, and further distress.",
