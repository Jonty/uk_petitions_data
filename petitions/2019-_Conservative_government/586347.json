        "additional_details": "Boris Johnson  pledged in February 2021 at a G7 meeting  to donate most of UK's unused supply of COVID vaccines, however to date there has been no clear indication of when this is to happen. The UK has ordered enough COVID Vaccine doses to vaccinate 3.6 times it's population while, globally, countries have enough vaccine for a fraction of their populations. The UK  needs to respond with urgency for the common good of humanity and to play it's role in supporting equitable vaccine distribution.",
        "background": "The UK Government should  be held to account regarding Boris Johnson' pledge to G7 and urgently begin to donate excess COVID vaccines to COVAX to allow distribution of vaccines to countries in significant need and should not delay while we witness a global catastrophe.",
