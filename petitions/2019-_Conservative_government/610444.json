        "action": "Bring forward legislation to end 'no-fault' section 21 evictions now",
        "additional_details": "If the law doesn't change urgently, landlords can deprive a good reliable tenant from the possibility to stay in the area where they have been living for 15+ years (because the cost of alternative shared-flats in the area might price them out, or withdrawal of the promise to rent once the previous accommodation is already resigned). While no-fault evictions continue, tenants face having to relocate to areas where they might not want to live.",
        "background": "The Government should urgently introduce its Renters' Reform Bill and eliminate no-fault section 21 evictions. These evictions enable landlords to repossess a property they rent even if the tenant has a good character, always paid on time, in full. This should end as soon as possible.",
