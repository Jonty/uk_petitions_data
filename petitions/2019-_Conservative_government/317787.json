        "additional_details": "Many UK residents suffer from emotional and mental health issues making them feel lonely and most of the time lost in their own thoughts without anyone to help or understand. This will give people an option to have a dog to keep them company and comfort regardless of whether they live in a rented/brought property that do not allow pets or not. I feel that this will really help a wide range of people who need emotional and mental support.",
        "background": "If ESA dogs have the same legal support as guide dogs then resident will have the legal action to have a pet as a coping mechanism providing they can care for it.",
