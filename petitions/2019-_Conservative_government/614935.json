        "action": "Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak broke the law and must resign.",
        "additional_details": "The government has a responsibility to pursue democracy, which cannot exist in a country where the prime minister knowingly attempts to deceive the public. At a time of both national and international crisis, we need a leader who can be trusted to do the right thing. Johnson and Sunak have demonstrated a complete lack of empathy, responsibility and honesty and are not fit for government. They must be replaced with law abiding, qualified and trusted individuals.",
        "background": "Whilst people across the country stayed home and were not able to visit loved ones in hospitals and care homes, Johnson and Sunak partied, and then proceeded to lie about it. They broke the law and broke the Ministerial Code by lying to the House of Commons and to the public.",
