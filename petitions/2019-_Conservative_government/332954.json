        "additional_details": "Amy\u2019s response to Covid-19 has been extremely disappointing, and has not inspired any confidence in why she receives a salary of \u00a383,169.  I have only seen Amy mention one venue gaining financial support; the Royal Vauxhall Tavern.",
        "background": "This petition is for the role to be abolished, or for Amy to be replaced with someone that will take a far more active role as a defender and supporter for nightlife as well as London\u2019s music festivals and wider music scene, as a crucial and vibrant part of London\u2019s arts and culture landscape.",
