        "additional_details": "The idea for \u201cAnnie\u2019s Law\u201d arose when our local NCT parents group were visiting a cafe in the Hammersmith area popular with parents and babies. \r\n\r\nWe were forced to change our infants on the floor of their bathroom or in our prams, because the business lacked baby changing facilities. The venue said they didn\u2019t provide facilities because it was \u201cexpensive and smelly.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe agreed this was neither\u00a0safe nor sanitary, so we decided to do something about it by campaigning to change the law.",
        "background": "We want the Government to amend the Public Health Act 1848, so that private premises such as cafes, pubs and restaurants have to provide baby changing facilities by law. This should be known as \u201cAnnie\u2019s Law.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis is an issue that affects millions of people across the U.K.",
