        "additional_details": "Some schools are already using external trainers to teach students how to use bleed control kits. I think that education about bleed control kits should be required across all schools. These workshops also raise awareness of knife crime and the catastrophic effects it has on those involved. We believe these workshops are crucial to education on knife crime, and every school child should have the opportunity to be involved in one.",
        "background": "Make Bleed control kit training part of the curriculum in schools so that all school-aged children have to learn how to stop a catastrophic bleed. With rates of knife crime increasing, having the knowledge to be able to stem a bleed could be lifesaving. ",
