The cost & failing hurts even more every single time.\r\n\r\nCouples need more support, more discount or free cycles of IVF.\r\n\r\nThis is discrimination against same sex couples.",
        "background": "IVF can cost a minimum of \u00a35000+ per Each cycle.\r\nThe NHS will give a free round of IVF after the couple have tried 12 cycles and failed.\r\nIf each cycle cost \u00a35000 and not more... that adds up to \u00a360,000 in total for 12 failed cycles & not the emotional trauma included.\r\nThere needs to be a change!",
