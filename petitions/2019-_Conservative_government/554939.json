At a time when the sport is struggling already due to the pandemic, the last thing it needs is life long fans giving up on it die to this ridiculous system. When you add this to the lack of fans (also a joke) and the introduction of pay per view games, the lower levels of our great institution are going to miss out and football will come to an end thus ending a large proportion of our tourist attraction.",
        "background": "I would like the government to discuss removing the use of VAR as it is ruining football. \r\n\r\nI believe this is a government problem as it is destroying one of the major pulls to this country, tourism to witness the worlds greatest game at the highest level.",
