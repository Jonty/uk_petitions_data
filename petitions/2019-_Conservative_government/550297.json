        "additional_details": "Table dancing clubs plays crucial part in the UKs economy. Thousands of dancers, bar tenders, managers and DJs with regular jobs have been out of work since March, and furlough fast reducing will put many jobs in danger. Many people\u2019s livelihoods could be ruined, with no reason to be. Everyone involved in running strip clubs plays a vital role and should be allowed, and given the right to return to work like all other businesses have. To keep strip clubs closed is unfair on the workers.",
        "background": "With most strict no contact policies in strip clubs, the government should give the go ahead for them reopening. With strict social distancing, table service, and cleaning; strip clubs should reopen.",
