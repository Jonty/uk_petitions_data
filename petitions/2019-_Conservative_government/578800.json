        "additional_details": "Such UK-wide information campaigns, e.g. on road safety or AIDS, have proven highly effective in the past in changing public behaviour and attitudes. Only the central Government in Westminster is capable of  executing such campaigns. The climate and ecological crisis demands urgent and major intervention but has become politicised and so the media convey mixed messages about it. A Government-led campaign (but with cross-party support) would lend authority and build national purpose for action.",
        "background": "I want the Government to launch a science-based information campaign via the major media outlets (TV, radio and press) to coincide (if possible) with the COP 26 talks in Glasgow later this year and help build public support and understanding for the measures needed, as well as changes in behaviour.",
