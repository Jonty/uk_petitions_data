Attempts by the Government to dictate what Student Unions can discuss or campaign for, or to dictate which subjects may be taught at Universities, must be avoided at all costs. The decision to impose conditions on Universities requiring financial assistance sets a dangerous precedent which threatens to stifle free expression.",
