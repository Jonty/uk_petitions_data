        "action": "Allow the British public to vote on abolishing COVID-19 lockdown rules",
        "additional_details": "Many people have expressed their concern on being at an extremely high risk of unemployment and being so restricted, especially with Christmas just a short time away. If the government was to allow members of the British public to vote on ridding the majority of the COVID-19 lockdown rules in favour of a more targeted approach to the elderly and/or the vulnerable whereby social distancing etc. is only strongly advised than law, this will really help the economy and overall health of the people.",
        "background": "In order to improve the economy, prevent further unemployment and reduce the frustration clearly felt amongst the people of Britain, I believe the power to vote should be given to the British people on keeping or abolishing most of the current lockdown rules surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.",
