        "additional_details": "The government plans to ban the sale of petrol/diesel cars by 2030 but this doesn't mean the iniment ban of these cars off the road. We currently pay tax of over 55p per litre of fuel, to fill this void after the banning of fuel car sales the government wants to charge us up to 1 pound and 55p for every mile we drive! That's 500 pound for a round trip from yorkshire to London before you have filled up with fuel! We CAN'T let this happen. A fairer way needs to be implemented",
        "background": "The government needs to propose a fairer way of replacing vehicle tax rather than the proposed pay per mile tax.",
