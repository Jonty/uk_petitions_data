        "additional_details": "I want Parliament to stop neglecting the severity of Eating Disorders. I want them to understand that just because calorie labels are there doesn\u2019t mean they will be acknowledged by your target audience. The people who will acknowledge this are the ones who have tried so tirelessly not to. People who are suffering or have suffered with eating disorders. There has to be other ways. Apps, online menus, alternative menus. Let\u2019s take care of everyone and stop neglecting people who suffer with ED.",
        "background": "Being fixated on cracking down on obesity but failing to acknowledge how triggering calorie labels may be for those who suffer(ed) with ED. Calorie labelling is an aid to eating disorders. A mental illness with the highest death rate of any psychiatric illness. We can\u2019t allow this to be introduced.",
