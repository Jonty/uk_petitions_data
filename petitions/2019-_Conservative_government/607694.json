        "additional_details": "This represents a serious liability since Public Services have a duty of care by providing language services to a standard that at the moment does not exist.\r\nAs it is, agencies are being allowed to pay below the National Minimum Wage and to exploit qualified professionals, to the point that it is now financially unsustainable to offer our essential services to the public. \r\nInterpreters and Translators see these issues resolved if the Government grants the professions a designated title.",
        "background": "Since the Government outsourced the language service providers to private companies, these agencies have been slashing Interpreters\u2019 and Translators\u2019 rates by more than 50% and have been offering jobs to unqualified, unconcerned, unaccountable bilinguals who are willing to accept low-paid jobs.",
