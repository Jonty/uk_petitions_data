        "additional_details": "Experts are warning of an extended period of COVID-19 cases being in circulation and to last until 2021. \r\n\r\nAt this time, a highspeed rail line doesn't need to be developed when possible fatalities are expected to rise considerably. With many front line staff in the NHS, social care and even the services expected to assist people in the next year, the availability of all funding should come from HS2 as there is no immediate benefit and can be picked back up on after the crisis has passed.",
        "background": "In the growing crisis of the COVID-19 Pandemic, we wish for the government to prioritise and half HS2 until the crisis has passed.\r\n\r\nSocial Care for Over 70s in particular and NHS front line services will require as much money beyond the budget announced by Rishi Sunak in early March 2020.",
