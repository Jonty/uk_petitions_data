        "additional_details": "There have been various studies on the incubation period of COVID-19. WHO states on average 5-6 days, CDC states a median time of 4-5 days.\r\n\r\nA reduction would help the ailing airline industry and ultimately support the UK economy. Much overseas travel is prevented due to the risk that the government will, with insufficient notice, remove a country from their list of exceptions.\r\n\r\nA reduced quarantine period would have higher levels of compliance and be easier to enforce resulting in it potentially becoming more effective.",
        "background": "COVID-19 is widespread in the UK. An arrival from a country with fewer cases per head may be less likely to have Covid-19 than the average UK resident who\u2019s not been abroad.",
