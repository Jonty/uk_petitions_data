        "additional_details": "Mainstream schools who attract SEND children because of their inclusive/supportive environment are then finding their funding is being cut because their SAT results are falling. This is resulting in some schools providing hostile non inclusive environments for SEND children in a hope to force them out and protect their funding. Whilst SEND children do receive additional funding it is no where near what is needed. Truly Inclusive schools should be rewarded not punished.",
