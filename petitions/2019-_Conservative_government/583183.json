        "action": "Enforce MP's to work only one job (as an MP) as to prevent conflict of interest.",
        "additional_details": "Having political influence creates conflict of interests in any other career - especially for those who are subject to pressure from lobbyists and those with financial interests in political decisions. MPs often are influenced by financial gain (see Health Secretary with shares in his sister's company). The public needs MPs with our best interests at heart. This law should also be backed up with deeper scrutiny on financial assets of MPs to identify where integrity could be breached.",
        "background": "The government should enforce that MPs should only be allowed to work their one job as an MP. This means no side-jobs, no board members, no lobbyists, etc. Parliamentary integrity needs to be upheld and any members that are earning income elsewhere should be immediately removed from their positions.",
