        "additional_details": "We have not taught nearly enough about the concept of consent in school, or how it's not just a stranger in the night who assaults you, it can be the people close to you. Female puberty is not nearly covered enough and is barely taught to women let alone men. gender identity and sexual orientation are completely ignored within schools' curriculum, so many LGBTQ+ children are left in the dark and forced into the dark, often making it difficult to understand their identities, feeling out of place.",
        "background": "Reform and adjust the curriculum regarding sexual education in schools to teach consent correctly, male AND female puberty to all genders with very in-depth descriptions, and more education regarding homosexuality, non-binary and safe sex for all genders (not just heterosexual sex).",
