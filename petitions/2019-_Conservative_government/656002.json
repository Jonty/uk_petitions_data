With the inflationary impact on our country lessening and the economy avoiding recession, I think we are able to lead from the front. With the upcoming US Presidential elections, I don't think we can guarantee US support for NATO's combined forces at the same levels. I think this approach would act to galvanize our Allies and deter our enemies.",

Some nations outside NATO have increased their size, and we believe the UK Government should respond accordingly.",
