        "additional_details": "Areas such as London are becoming increasingly unaffordable for many of its inhabitants. According to data the average rent in London rose 16.1% in 2022 \u2013 the highest annual jump on record. The current situation is unsustainable and unfair. An increasingly alarming number of families are finding themselves without a home as the housing situation spirals out of control. It's time we put a stop to these unreasonable rent increases that are leaving hard-working families on the brink of homelessness.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to implement rent control measures that would cap yearly rent increases for existing tenants at 2%, and also to impose additional taxes on properties that have been vacant for an extended period.",
