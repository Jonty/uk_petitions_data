Life has many urgent situations - families broken apart; parents separated from their children overseas; etc. The passport office doesn't consider these cases to be urgent and the application process takes up to 6 weeks.\r\n \r\nEither expand the criteria for urgent applications or restart the fast track 1week process.\r\nThe current situation is inhumane.",
