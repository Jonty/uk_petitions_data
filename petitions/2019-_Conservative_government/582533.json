        "action": "Allow university students to return to their term-time address in England",
        "additional_details": "It has been a dismal year for young people with a widespread mental health crisis, over a year of university experience gone with no fee rebates, and students facing final exams in childhood bedrooms.\r\n\r\nSome students live privately and can return without permission, leading to fairness issues around accessing campus resources.\r\n\r\nThis issue has not been prioritised. The Government had planned to make an announcement on this by the end of the Easter holidays, but this hasn't happened yet.",
        "background": "Most university students do not qualify for return to their term-time address. With self-catered accommodation all open from April 12th, the progress of vaccinations, and cases lower than last October, it's time to let students return, regardless of whether teaching is face-to-face or all online.",
