        "additional_details": "All University students in 2020-2021 year intake should not have to pay the tuition fees.  A full refund should be funded by the government. As students are not receiving a full proactive education at university level, courses are recorded to view but these are not adequate. They should only be paying the equivalent of an open university course.   And therefore, not bearing the immense costs of teaching fees and rents, when most students are being placed in full lockdown scenarios away from home",
