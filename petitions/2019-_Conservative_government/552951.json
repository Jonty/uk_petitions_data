        "additional_details": "With a larger set of markers being needed, there would be no moral basis to compel testing. But it could be made attractive to volunteers simply by allowing the participants free use of the database for their own purposes (genealogy, identifying an unknown parent or half-sibling). This would give a much larger and so more effective resource than expecting people to pay for their own commercial test and then consent to Law Enforcement Matching using their data. Why would you do that?",
        "background": "The current 16 DNA marker police database would continue but with forced collection of new data only when justified for the immediate case. Along side this a modern database capable of matching criminals to crime scenes via distant relatives would hold data from random volunteers.",
