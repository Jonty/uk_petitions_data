        "action": "Do Not Raise The Energy Price Cap",
        "additional_details": "The public are already paying the highest price in history, for their domestic gas and electricity. Raising the energy price cap again this October will force the elderly and those on lower incomes to choose between heating their homes, or putting food on the table. This is totally unacceptable, and OFGEM cannot justify raising the price cap any further in 2022. The large \u2018big six\u2019 energy companies are reporting record profits in the region of billions of pounds, so a rise is wholly unjustified.",
        "background": "The Energy Price Cap (Gas & Electricity) is due to rise again on 1st October 2022, by an estimated 42% (Source: OFGEM 24.05.22). This will push millions of people into fuel poverty. Another price cap rise in 2022 is completely unjustified, especially when we are facing a cost of living crisis.",
