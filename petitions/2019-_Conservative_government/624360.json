        "additional_details": "Everyone can play a part in collectively reducing the use of fossil fuels by a significant amount. The winter in Europe is likely to bring disruption of supply for electricity/heating when we run low on natural gas. The UK population could make small changes to more closely match electricity demand to supply from renewables generation by observing Carbon Intensity forecasts to reduce this risk. The National Grid, Oxford University and WWF have already developed a web site and an app for this.",
        "background": "UK Electricity Suppliers should actively promote Carbon Intensity to domestic customers. Simple decisions about when to charge cars and run appliances for all customers including (counter-intuitively) those on green tariffs can help to reduce the risk of running out of natural gas over winter.",
