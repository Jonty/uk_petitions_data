        "additional_details": "In 2015, 16 million people didn't vote in the general election. Similarly, in 2019, 15.5 million people didn't vote. Those numbers are approximately equivalent to 1/3 of registered voters not voting. If all of those people were to protest vote, it would mean the government wouldn't have a majority mandate from the public, making it public how unpopular our politicians and political parties are. Further information on protest voting:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.votenone.org.uk/protest_votes_count.html",
        "background": "It is fair to say many have and feel let down by the current political parties. Protest voting allows people to voice their opinion that they are unsatisfied with, or feel like they don't understand, the current political climate. However, many are unaware of this voting option and don't vote.",
