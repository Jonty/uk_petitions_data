        "action": "Make it illegal to walk a dog off lead in a public space",
        "additional_details": "Currently, in the UK dog owners are responsible for the actions of their dogs. However, enforcing stricter leash laws nationwide would create safer environments for both pets and people alike. This is not about restricting freedom but about ensuring safety and respect for all members of our community.\r\n\r\nWe urge lawmakers to consider making it illegal to walk your dog in public off lead - a small change with potentially significant impacts on the wellbeing of our pets and communities at large.",
        "background": "I am a dog walker who is constantly on edge. My dog, always kept on a leash, often becomes anxious when approached by dogs off lead. It's an issue that not only affects us but countless other pet owners & pedestrians.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you believe in creating safer public spaces.",
