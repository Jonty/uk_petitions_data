        "additional_details": "For those with medical conditions, that put them at higher risk if they were to catch COVID, the requirement to wear masks in confined public spaces has allowed them to come out of shielding and regain some level of normality.  If these restrictions are ended before 80% of the population have been vaccinated then, it could mean that many of these people will need to shield again which could endanger physical and mental health",
