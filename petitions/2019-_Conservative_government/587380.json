        "additional_details": "The Pearson Commission found that those injured as a result of vaccination should have access to financial support. The VDPA was intended to provide that access, but fails: data suggests that less than 2% of applications in recent years have been successful, and there is a maximum payment of \u00a3120,000 and a threshold of 60% disablement. Reforming the VDPA will maintain vaccine confidence and provide urgent support for those injured/bereaved through covid-19 vaccination.",

The current scheme is archaic and inadequate. The new scheme should be more accessible, visible and applicant friendly.",
