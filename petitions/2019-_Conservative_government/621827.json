        "additional_details": "Any account holder with grid-connected on-site renewable generation should have access to this type of contract.\r\n\r\nThe Feed in Tariff for renewable energy generation on homes and businesses closed to new entrants. Since then, payment for generation & export has not kept pace with rapidly rising cost of energy purchase.\r\n\r\nSmart meters measure electricity import from, and export to the grid. This makes it technically possible to implement a Net Metering contract.\r\n\r\nExample: Solar system credit would be accrued during clear sunny days and paid back later.\r\n\r\nAn account holder with surplus energy credit could donate to others, to people in need.",
