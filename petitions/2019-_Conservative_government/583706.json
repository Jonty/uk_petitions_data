        "additional_details": "The heart and soul of our national game is at stake here. Overseas owners do not seem to understand the principals of a meritocracy, whereby clubs are rewarded or penalised with promotion/relagation or admission to European competition based on their performance throughout the season. The American sports franchise system, where there is an absence of jeopardy, will not work in the English or European game.",
        "background": "I propose that ownership of English Premier League clubs is immediately changed to mirror the German model, whereby an individual owner can not hold more than 49% of the shares, the majority has always to be controlled by the fans of the club.",
