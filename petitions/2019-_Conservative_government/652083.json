        "additional_details": "I am a 46 year old mother of 4. In July 2023 I was diagnosed with breast cancer. Due to my type of cancer and the position I never would have been able to feel a lump. My cancer was found by chance, after investigation of something else. The situation worsened when tests showed my cancer had metastasised to my bones. If I had had a routine mammogram at 40 years of age or even 43 I wouldn't now be living with advanced cancer and dying sooner than I should. Many women like myself could be saved.",
        "background": "Currently women are invited for a breast cancer screening mammogram between the age of 50-53. I would like the Government to provide funding to support breast cancer screening being offered from the age of 40.",
