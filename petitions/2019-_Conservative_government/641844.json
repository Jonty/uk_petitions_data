        "additional_details": "School plays an essential role in the lives of young people and can serve as a lifeline for LGBTIQA+ youth who don\u2019t have supportive homes. Teachers have warned Government proposals are unworkable and cruel, we therefore want a change of approach that recognises the necessity of support for LGBTIQA+ students. Given the risk of negative reactions to coming out from parents & guardians, as well as the immorality of outing someone we want to see a more compassionate approach.",
        "background": "The Government must not publish guidance that promotes the outing of trans & non-binary students. We are also calling on the government to scrap plans to require parental consent to socially transition. We want the government to ensure schools remain safe and ensure LGBTIQA+ students are welcome.",
