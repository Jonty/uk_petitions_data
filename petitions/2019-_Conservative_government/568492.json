        "additional_details": "As the exams are now confirmed not to be going ahead in May, June and July. I think that ALL exams in England should be cancelled including IGCSEs. As a student who studies FOUR IGCSE subjects that are all assessed in many different countries across the world, I would like the Education Secretary to cancel all the IGCSEs that are set out by UK exam boards.These boards include Pearson and Cambridge. Cancelling these exams can only be the right thing to do during a lockdown and being taught online",
        "background": "Dear UK Government. I am writing to you and starting this petition on behalf of students in England who study subjects that are taught Internationally after the Education Secretary announced yesterday, that GCSEs weren\u2019t going ahead this year as planned. It can only be fair to cancel IGCSEs as well.",
