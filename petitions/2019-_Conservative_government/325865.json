You can not \"pick and choose\" what to remember and what not to remember.We must learn from history not to make the same mistakes again. Some memorials are a reminder of the mistakes that should not be repeated at any cost.The important memorials remind us of the sacrifice made by men and women of ALL creeds and colours who stood together when evil threatened to wipe out those targeted as inferior.",
