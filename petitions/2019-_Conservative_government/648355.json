        "additional_details": "Currently, travel between Kirkliston and South Queensferry is very limited. The last consistent bus service ends at 6pm making it difficult for those working or seeing friends in the opposite village, leaving them hard-pressed to find a way home. Launching even an hourly service running later into the night would massively help those who are forced to walk home or fork out money for a taxi. Also, this would strengthen pre existing links between the two villages, lifting community spirit:",
        "background": "We would like the government to launch a bus service that runs later than 6-7pm. Currently the last consistent bus service ends around this time, and should be extended to allow greater mobility between the two closely linked villages.",
