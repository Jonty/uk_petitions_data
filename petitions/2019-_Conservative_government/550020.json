GP practices remain open, albeit with some changes to provision of services, such as moving some appointments to online and postponing some non-urgent services. The classification of these services is a clinical matter for the NHS, not the UK Government or Parliament. \r\n                \r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. The Government has passed legislation suspending certain requirements on NHS providers, and we could accept a petition calling for this legislation to be repealed."
