        "action": "Stop mandatory vaccinations for care workers.",
        "additional_details": "We are campaigning to stop this law because we believe that ALL human beings deserve the right to decline medical treatment and that it should be a persons own choice whether they undergo a procedure or have a vaccination. The human rights act 1998 states that every individual with the mental capacity to make a decision about their health and well-being must by law be afforded the right to choose whether or not to undergo any medical procedure.",
        "background": "It has been decided that by law all care workers must have mandatory vaccinations by October or lose their jobs. This petition aims to give carers back their free will and allow them to make a personal choice regarding their own bodies, without being coerced or at risk of losing their livelihood.",
