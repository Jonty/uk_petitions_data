        "additional_details": "Here are 4 reasons:\r\n- Period pants are specifically designed to absorb menstrual blood and prevent leaks, just like others\r\n- They provide an eco-friendly and sustainable option to traditional menstrual products, as they are reusable and reduce waste.\r\n- Recognizing period pants as menstrual products would make them more accessible and affordable, as they would be eligible for the same tax exemptions and subsidies as other menstrual products\r\n- Periods are not a luxury and women should not pay to bleed.",
        "background": "The Government announced there will be no VAT on women's menstrual products from Jan 2021 but failed to acknowledge reusable period pants as menstrual products. This creates an unfair playing field for consumers who want to use sustainable period products We want the Government to remove 20% VAT.",
