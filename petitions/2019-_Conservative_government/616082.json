        "additional_details": "Increases in state pensions take effect in April but are based on average earnings from the preceding May to July, or inflation for the year ending the previous September.\r\n \r\nDue to the massive increase in energy costs plus cost of living increases, the Government must bring forward the annual increase in the State Pension to November of this year. Such a move should help to lessen the severe impact of energy costs in particular. If nothing is done to help pensioners, some may not survive through the winter.",
