        "additional_details": "This is a form of extortion.  During lockdown, they bought up hand wash and disinfectants. At Christmas they buy toys. They are a scourge to supply and demand.\r\nI ask for new legislation banning the use of bots on retail sites and to fine companies who facilitate scalpers by letting them resell the items they've prevented anyone else buying.",
        "background": "Scalpers use automated software (bots) to buyup stock for highly sought items, then use resale sites, such as eBay and StockX to resell those products at inflated prices. Scalpers don't add any value to the product or provide any additional service. They just prevent genuine customers buying at RRP.",
