        "additional_details": "Statutory Sick Pay of only \u00a394.25 is not enough to cover most people's outgoings and many people are now facing the prospect of severe financial hardship. Self-employed workers will often be the first people let go by businesses trying to save money to pay their staff. \r\n\r\nThe current plans offer up to \u00a315,000 per employed person - writing off just \u00a35,000 of tax for each self-employed person would be comparatively little but would help people survive for several months.",
        "background": "The Chancellor has just announced that the Government will step in to pay 80% of employees' wages, up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 per person, for up to six months. This is great news for employed people, but self-employed people have been left with almost no support.",
