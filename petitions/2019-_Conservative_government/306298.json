        "additional_details": "I am asking for this because students find it hard to fund their cost of living whilst studying. With everything being extended over the summer students can't commit to full time jobs as they are still studying and therefore cannot fund themselves. Many students cannot rely on the support of parents and family to help them through uni and the private sector is laying off so many staff finding a part time job is almost impossible.",
