        "additional_details": "There is a proven link between sexuality and eating disorders which shows there is more chance of someone who identifies as LGBT+ having an eating disorder. Research has shown that those as early as 12 who identify as LGBT+ are at a higher risk of an eating disorder than someone who is heterosexual. We know that eating disorders have the highest mortality rates among psychiatric disorders which shows that current understanding of eating disorders in the UK is lacking and that support services must be improved.",
        "background": "The Government should commission a review into the rise of eating disorders among the LGBT+ community to ensure that current NHS support services are fit for purpose. This could also help support charities to adapt and improve their services.",
