        "additional_details": "The current protests demonstrates that young people need to know the truth. I have been amazed to find that young people are very angry at white ancestors thinking that they invented slavery with the transatlantic slave trade, and that they can not accept that african ancestors were just as responsible and even opposed the abolishment as \u2018the white man\u2019 made them rich. I also think that the Spanish Inquisition should be covered especially as scholars believe it was the beginnings of racism.",
        "background": "Currently, the history of slavery is a very sparsely covered subject in schools. Slavery goes back thousands of years but is currently believed to have been invented by white people and that white people are those solely responsible for the transatlantic slave trade.",
