        "additional_details": "Whilst the current ban tackles rinse-off products, it does not cover products that are applied and left on the skin, such as sunscreen or cosmetics. This is despite the fact that sunscreens are applied before going for a swim. Over 75% of sunscreen products contain microplastic, and it's clear that the current ban on microplastics doesn't go far enough. Extending the ban to cover sunscreen and cosmetics would significantly reduce microplastic in our waterways, reducing impacts on wildlife.",
        "background": "In June 2018, microbeads in rinse-off products were banned in the UK, applying to products that immediately washed off after using them, such as toothpaste and face scrubs.  We would like to see the ban expanded to cover products that are applied and left on the skin, such as sunscreen & cosmetics.",
