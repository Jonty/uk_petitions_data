        "additional_details": "Often, people with severe food allergies miss out on the opportunity to eat at food establishments with peers due to the stress of lack of options and risk of eating something mistakingly. By adding a numbered allergen list (for example, wheat as 1, sesame as 11), and putting a list of the contained numbers next to each dish, it could minimise issues and the risks allergy sufferers have to take, therefore hopefully saving lives.",
        "background": "I am petitioning for simple allergen lists on restaurant menus. Ireland uses a numbered allergen system in all of their menus, meaning that before even entering the establishment, those with severe food allergies are able to tell if it is safe for them to eat there, and see the available options.",
