This was necessary at the start of the pandemic, however with government actively encouraging people to kick-start the economy (such as the 'Eat Out to Help Out' scheme) it is becoming increasingly unfair on both parents to continue to prevent attendance at maternity appointments. First time parents in particular have been forgotten by trusts.",

For example by publishing guidance which clearly and explicitly outlines a policy which can be adopted to protect the staff and patients who attend.",
