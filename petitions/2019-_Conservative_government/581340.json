Violence towards a person with or without injury has been in the top 3 crimes reported in Bridgend in 2020 and 2019. Thats 78% of all crimes reported. Women are vulnerable and scared to walk home at night. We need lighting to get home safe and have access to the recreation facilities at Bridgend tennis club and local leisure centre.",
