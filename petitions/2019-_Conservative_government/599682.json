        "additional_details": "As per regulations, a reserve soldier has to complete a minimum of eight working hours of service a day in order to meet the requirement to be paid a full day's wage. Any less than this will be deducted from half to a quarter based on hours worked.\r\n \r\nDaily rates are as follows:\r\n \r\nRecruits (in initial training); \u00a340.13 per day\r\nPrivate: \u00a351.22 per day\r\nLance Corporal: \u00a368.61 per day\r\n \r\nAny of the amounts above divided by eight will result in a number below the current minimum wage.",
        "background": "Currently, British Army reserve forces Recruits, Privates and Lance Corporals receive day rates that work out below the national minimum wage.\r\n \r\nThis needs to change!\r\n \r\nThe Government should increase day rates for low-ranked Army Reservists so the hourly equivalent is at least the minimum wage.",
