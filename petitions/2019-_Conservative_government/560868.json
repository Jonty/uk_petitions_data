(Original date being the 20/10/2020) I now have to wait nearly 4 months to take my test whilst people in December, January and February can have there test. The DVSA should postpone all test by 4 weeks in order for those who have had there test cancelled rebooked in this time. It is unfair than the minority group of people whose test were booked in November/Early December now get a test date after New Year. Everyone has had to face the COVID restrictions, why should we be forced to have them affect us more than others.",
        "background": "As per the Government announcing the second lockdown, all services were suspended if they were non essential such as school, essential shops, key workers etc. This is understandable as per the current situation surround the Coronavirus. However for many Learners, Test and Lessons has been cancelled.",
