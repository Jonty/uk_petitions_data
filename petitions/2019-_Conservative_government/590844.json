        "action": "Prevent the government from fully reopening the country on the 19th July 2021",
        "additional_details": "Currently we average 25,000 new cases a day, which is how the November-December spike happened and what lead to two more lockdowns. We need to be smart and not reopen the country because the consequences will be far more severe if we do that, than just remain with some restrictions. The US who have a similar vaccination rate as us are averaging 11,000 new cases with their 320m population.",
        "background": "The government shouldn't reopen the country on the 19th July 2021 due to the increased number of new cases each day. We should continue monitoring the situation and ensure the country isn't at immediate risk of more variants or another lockdown before reopening.",
