        "additional_details": "Although students have access to student loan support during term time, many rely on part time work to make up for any financial shortfall of living costs. Many students have jobs during the summer months when they do not have access to student loan funding. \r\n\r\nStudents have also been financially affected by this crisis but this has been overlooked. By the end of summer term, many students will be left without income for three months. Students may have to drop out to be eligible for support.",
        "background": "Many students have been unable to take part in the Treasury scheme for furloughed workers as they are employed on a zero hours or a casual basis. Anyone classed as a full time student is ineligible for universal credit. Lift the restrictions on who is eligible to claim universal credit.",
