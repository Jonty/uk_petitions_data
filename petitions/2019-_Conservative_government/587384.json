        "additional_details": "After a difficult year, student mental health is already struggling, mental health will be further hit by an unnecessary two month wait for results after most students have completed their studies. Earlier release will enable more time for appeals and more security for Students who don't have to worry about their grades over a much needed summer break. Moderation, as important as it is, can still happen but being given some degree of security would be appreciated by students",
        "background": "In Wales, Students will receive provisional grades after the submission deadline. Students in England will wait till August to receive their final grades and will have a tight window to appeal if they need to. The DfE should release CAGs after the submission deadline subject to moderation",
