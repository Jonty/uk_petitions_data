The government has a duty of care to ensure that they continue to maintain safe practise to help fight the virus. Lifting the \"rule of 6\" for Christmas could increase the spread of Covid19 virus.",
        "background": "The Prime Minister has mentioned the consideration of lifting lockdown \"rule of six\" for Christmas, where households can have more than 6 people visiting. This is unfair towards other religious events that non-Christians celebrate and who have had to adhere to the rules.",
