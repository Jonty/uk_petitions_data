        "additional_details": "This allows the community of researchers to download, check, experiment with, critique and extend such simulations. If a complex model is informing public policy (especially on such urgent matters as COVID19 and its impact), then the public have a right to know that such models have been under the most extensive scrutiny of scientific experts. The more complex the model, the more vital this is, as it is easy to include subtly wrong assumptions or not be aware of missing variables.",
        "background": "It is good practice for any complex simulation models to be released on a public archive, including its full documentation and source code. This should be a condition of engagement with expert modellers - a prerequisite for taking their advice (if based on such a model).",
