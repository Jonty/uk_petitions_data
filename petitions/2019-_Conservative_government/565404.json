        "additional_details": "I have read countless cases of cruelty and killing of animals yet there's never sufficient justice handed out to the perpetrators. Animals tend not to be aggressive unless they are mistreated, are unwell or are wild and hungry.\r\n \r\nThe Government should introduce mandatory life sentences for anyone found guilty of illegally killing an animal, and introduce mandatory custodial for any animal cruelty offences that do not result in the death of an animal.\r\n \r\nOne day I hope that this wrong can be addressed.",
        "background": "I feel that an animal's life matters just as much as a human's and this should be reflected in sentencing for killing or abusing an animal. Until that is recognised by law then animals will continue to be treated terribly or killed as the punishments are insufficient.",
