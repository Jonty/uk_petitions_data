        "additional_details": "During the pandemic, children were kept out of school for the protection of their physical health.\r\n \r\nHowever, a child\u2019s development depends on a holistic approach, and their wider wellbeing is of equal importance.\r\n \r\n5 days of permitted absence would allow more families to have affordable quality time and experiences together, which could have a lasting positive effect on development and the future generation of workers.\r\n \r\nWe believe these potential benefits far outweigh the minimal disruption to a child\u2019s education.\r\n",
        "background": "Allow school children 5 days of absence each year, to be taken at a time of their choosing, excluding periods of examination.\r\n\r\nWe believe current penalties for children being absent for reasons other than sickness are unfair, especially fines, which disproportionately impact lower income families.",
