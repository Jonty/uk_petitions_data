I thought the whole point was to take them from a bad and neglectful environment to a supportive and good environment. A lot of cared for people do not get the specified support or help they need to the extent they need it. I think the government should provide more funding to ensure we are doing a good enough job of supporting young people in care and leaving care.",

This should include more help with housing, more financial help i.e. help with budgeting and increased allowances; and weekly visits from their social worker to help them not fall out of routines.",
