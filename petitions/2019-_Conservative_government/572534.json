Requiring them to be enrolled in this way will be harmful to abuse survivors and transgender people, amongst others. Doing this would make it a lot easier for abuse victims to be found by their abusers again \u2013 many change their name to get away from them. It could also potentially be used for hate crime purposes against trans people as you must declare your address on a deed poll. This is a dangerous precedent.",
