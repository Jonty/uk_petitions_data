Too many good teachers are leaving the profession because of the demands made on them are too much, unreachable targets and not enough support in the classroom. Having a teaching assistant in every class should help support teachers and the children and lead to better outcomes.",
        "background": "I want the Government to understand the strain teachers can be under when teaching large classes, and require a teaching assistant for every class. Currently children, including those with learning difficulties, can be left with too little support, making it hard for them to access the curriculum.",
