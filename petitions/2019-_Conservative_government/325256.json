        "additional_details": "I believe the use of police horses is animal cruelty. Most animals can be unpredictable, especially when placed in a stressful situation which can be dangerous both for the animal and for the public. This is particularly relevant now with the footage shown of the BLM peaceful protest in London - these horses were clearly distressed and some could not be controlled. We are taking advantage of animals that should be roaming free in a field.",
        "background": "The police force need to resort to a better, easier to fix if damaged vehicle than a horse. Replace the use of police horses with bikes or mopeds.",
