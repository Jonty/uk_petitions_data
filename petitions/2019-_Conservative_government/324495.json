        "additional_details": "I want Parliament to do this because it's something that I never learnt at school. It's not fair for this to be erased from history & not taught in schools. Black people are still being criminalized, discriminated against and abused. This is not ok. This part of Britain's history must be heard and cannot be whitewashed. Government needs to do this  to contribute to eradicating racism and making a change. This could start by talking to young people about racism and about Britain's part in that.",
        "background": "Teach schools about how Britain colonized countries & how Britain is  racist. Teach about how black British people have been fighting against racism and the challenges they have endured. This is not a subject that is not relevant to the UK. Teach schools that black people and culture are important.",
