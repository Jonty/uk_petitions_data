        "additional_details": "I see it all the time, people use the spaces just to park in or disabled people think because they have the magic blue badge, they can park in them. What about us poor mums just suffered c-sections or births, struggling to lift car seats in & out in small spaces. It should NOT be allowed. Give us a permit that lasts 8 years from child's birth. We get a medical exception from NHS, it wouldn't be too dissimilar to issue a permit too.",
        "background": "Everyone with a baby could be issued a parking permit to be able to park in parent & child spaces & they MUST display, the same as disabled spaces. I'm fed up with people with no children or disabled people taking up the bays when we have cars seats to get in out & especially when just given birth.",
