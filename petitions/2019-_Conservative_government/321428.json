        "additional_details": "Many self employed people have been hit hard financially during the pandemic. The time scale should be increased until more industries are allowed to safely return to work, or to match the furlough scheme. Small and new businesses are essential to our economy and will struggle to come back from this if they are relying on the SEISS alone! Bounce back loans and grants may not cover sole traders without a business bank account or a premises. Self employed people also have bills and food to pay for",
        "background": "I want the government to review the SEISS scheme so that self employed people are covered for longer than 3 months of income during the coronavirus pandemic.",
