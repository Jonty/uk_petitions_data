        "additional_details": "By law a child has to be in education but given the countries current situation we as parents feel out of our depth trying to do right by our kids . Every decision made has been by the government. For me personally it would do more harm sending my son into school too early then have to take him out again only 2weeks later. Any parent of an autistic child will understand what disruption to any routine is like. It's been hell enough home schooling. After Easter gives them a longer 'school period'",
        "background": "I have an autistic son. If I send him back to school on the 8th of March he will become very confused when a couple of weeks later they're off again for Easter hols. It will cause such distress. It makes far more sense the earliest return should be after Easter or at least give parents the choice.",
