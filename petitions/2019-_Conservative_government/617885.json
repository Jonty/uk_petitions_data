        "additional_details": "Driving tests are getting harder to book especially at the times of many theory tests expiring.Many people like myself think there should be an extension as now in 2022 it is impossible to book a practical test until mid 2023.This is unfair especially for people looking for 1st time tests and people who may need to retake their theory test as it's expiring.By having this extension it can help people find a test in time and prevent people from retaking and wasting money because of the pandemic.",
        "background": "To acknowledge the driving test backlog and to extend theory tests that were passed in 2021. Instead of theory tests expiring in 2023, they can go on until the end of 2024.",
