        "action": "Change the system so that students have teacher-assessed grades every year.",
        "additional_details": "The DfE have already stated that they trust teachers over algorithms, so can\u2019t they trust teachers\u2019 assessments over one single set of exams that determine everything? Or, could exams instead make up a percentage of the final grade and teachers, who know their students\u2019 abilities best, have a say in the rest?\r\n\r\nChanging the system would improve the mental health of students; it would also encourage them to work hard and improve throughout the year, without a stressful exam-period at the end.",
        "background": "The current education system is extremely detrimental to the mental health of students. GCSE and A-Level students learn content for 2 years, only for everything to be down to how they perform in a short exam-period at the end of their course(s), where no previous attainment is credited.",
