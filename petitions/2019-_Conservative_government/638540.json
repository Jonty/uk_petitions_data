To earn a wage should not cost someone their health or their life. It should be compulsory that if the Coroner have cited action or inaction by an employer to be a contributing factor in their PFD report, then a Government body should investigate that workplace to determine their work ethics/practices/duties. If found responsible, the body should have powers to require employers to implement reforms.\r\n",
