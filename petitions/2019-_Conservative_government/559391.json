        "additional_details": "We urgently require a revision of the eligibility criteria for the SEISS and a focus on the inclusion of several situations which are not currently covered by the scheme. It is unjust and discriminatory that nearly at the end of 2020 the last tax year considered as main criteria of eligibility is 2018-2019. This is not depicting an updated scenario for many people and any situation change happened after April 2019 is not taken into account. We urge all situation that do not qualify to ANY scheme to be reviewed ASAP",
        "background": "Since March 2020 nearly 3 million Self Employed have been left without any support, including after the scheme extension. The eligibility criteria are incomplete and never changed since the beginning. Six months later, nothing changed and we are going through a new lockdown again without support",
