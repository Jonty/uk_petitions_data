        "action": "Reverse the Immigration Act, and keep freedom of movement in the UK to EU",
        "additional_details": "This bill mainly affects the right of UK citizens to travel, work and holiday in the EU. Now UK citizens will have to pay for visas to work and travel to the 27 countries in the EU. This bill will mean that the UK loses out on free movement in the EU, while the rest of the EU enjoys free movement without issue. Sign this petition if you would like the government to reverse this legislation, and consider keeping the long standing rights of freedom of movement with the EU.",
        "background": "The government has passed the Immigration Act, which on December 31, at 11 pm, ends the freedom of movement in the UK for all EU citizens, without registered residence. I would like this act to be reversed, and allow for free movement to and from the EU as a right for all EU and UK citizens.",
