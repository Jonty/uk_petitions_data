There must be a deterrent to stop this, if people knew that by assaulting them in any way would attract a minimum 2 year prison sentence it should make people think twice.\r\n \r\nWe demand that our Emergency workers get the protection that they deserve when performing their duties for all of us, they deserve better protection from the Establishment for what they do.",
        "background": "Assaults on Emergency workers are all to common and there is no excuse for assaulting those who are serving and protecting the community and us. For example Hospital Emergency Centers where staff are abused and attacked, and 999 emergency Ambulances attacked when they respond.",
