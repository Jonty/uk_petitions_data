        "additional_details": "We currently have 1 examiner serving Burton-upon-Trent and 1 examiner serving the Derby area. New examiners are being recruited on \u00a325,000 per year and are only offered a 1 year contract. Current driving instructors are not incentivised to become examiners, because of the poor pay and the fact that need to give up their instructor status and retrain if they wish to return to being a driving instructor at a later point in time.",
        "background": "With the cost of living crisis, people are spending up to \u00a333 a lesson  to keep the driving skills of their son/daughter up to standard until they  get a test date. I am one of those parents. I am unable to book a test anywhere in a 40 mile radius in the next 6 months. This is a nationwide problem.",
