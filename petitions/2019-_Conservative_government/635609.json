Relief on Utility bills, relief on cost of public transport, relief to owning a vehicle. The past Governments over the last 50 years haven\u2019t built into state pension payments for the cost of Net Zero Carbon targets and policies. This has come at a cost to current retirees and those likely to retire over the next fifty years.",

It's not clear if you want the Government to increase the rate of the state pension, or provide financial support in other areas.\r\n\r\nThe Government is not directly responsible for the cost of utilities, public transport or owning a vehicle, but could provide grants or subsidies to help with the cost of these.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
