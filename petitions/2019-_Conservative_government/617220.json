        "additional_details": "The world is in the midst of an escalating climate crisis. The continuous supply of non-recyclable, single-use items, such as plastic cups at a water fountain or plastic bags used to carry groceries, damages the atmosphere from manufacturing emissions, fills space in landfills, and kills animals from pollution on both land and in the sea. Instilling this ban will not only raise awareness about the global climate crisis but it will also lead a strong trajectory to a more eco-friendly Britain.",
        "background": "Instil a firm ban on all single-use plastics and polystyrene. The UK is a first-world country and has the resources to become more environmentally friendly as a society, this ban is the first step.",
