        "additional_details": "People in the UK who lost their sponsorship are only permitted to stay 60 days. 60 days is a very short notice for a family to arrange departure as it could unsettle their children's schooling, lead to loss of rent or deposit, furnishing costs, air ticket and relocation costs. The request is to extend jobless health workers' stay in the UK for one more year for them to secure another job.",
        "background": "Several health care workers who arrived in UK are left without jobs as their sponsors are unable to provide them with one or that there wasn't a job available for them when they arrived. Some firms lose their licence to sponsor due to their own mistakes.",
