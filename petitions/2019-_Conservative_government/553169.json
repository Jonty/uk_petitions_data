        "additional_details": "As we (immigrant NHS workers) are entitled to very short number of annual leave, most of us utilize them to go back to our home country.\r\n\r\nMany of immigrant NHS workers do not have their families in the UK and they only get a chance to visit their families only once a year. Some of us have already not seen our families for more than a year.\r\n\r\nAllowing NHS works back to work as soon as they test negative will also relieve the immense pressure on the teams working day and night in the NHS.",
        "background": "Remove the 14-day quarantine rule for NHS worker on their return from their home countries. \r\n\r\nHowever, for health & safety reasons everyone returning from high risk countires should be tested and quarantined ONLY till they test negative for COVID-19.",
