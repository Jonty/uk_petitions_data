        "additional_details": "Recently, the Enterprise Investment Scheme Association (EISA) reported that over \u00a36.5b of private sector investment is needed by growing businesses, and the economic uncertainties caused both by Covid19, and Brexit have led to a further shortfall of over \u00a3350m. \r\n\r\nAlongside this shortfall, most early-stage startups were ineligible for the Future Fund, which was geared towards Venture Capital investments. We want SEIS raised to incentivise angel investment and give startups a vital lifeline.",
        "background": "We are calling on the Government to increase the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS) from \u00a3150,000 to \u00a3300,000 in the next budget, to help startups recover from the impacts of COVID-19.",
