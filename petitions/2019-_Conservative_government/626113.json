Not a new priminister who is chosen by the few.\r\n\r\nThe future elected will be elected fairly, let the public decide and restore stability to the United Kingdom. \r\n\r\nLet us the British people choose our own future, let us hear and decide why we should vote for those who will stand. We need to be given the democratic choice.",
