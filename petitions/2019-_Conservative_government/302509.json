        "additional_details": "Because it is fair, pragmatic and sensible. Not only is the NHS not up to the task, it may breakdown entirely if the government continues to do very little. As a result, we need every NHS worker - everyone from surgeon to janitor - to be taken care of so that they can focus on their jobs and focus on saving lives at serious risk, something the rest of us are unable to do once somebody has contracted COVID-19. This is about stemming the loss of life and taking some pressure off of health workers.",
        "background": "Give workers in the NHS with any number of children or those they provide care for, special provisions under the Civil Contingencies Act to priority childcare and care for the elderly services so that they can do their jobs uninterrupted and not be pulled from the workforce during this crisis",
