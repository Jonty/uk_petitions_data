        "additional_details": "The recent dethroning of Edward Colston's statue has made a large amount of people more about the UK slave trade than their schooling. The same applies to other historical figures and their involvement with the slave trade, colonialism, and the interaction between Britain, colonies, and native populations.\r\nIn addressing this, future generations will have an accurate understanding of our past, and help tackle exceptionalism and racism in the future.",
        "background": "The National Curriculum as it stands inadequately teaches the involvement of the UK in the slave trade, and the vagarities of colonialism. These should be taught in a way which does not always present the UK as the 'hero' of the story, in order to address the systemic racism this forms.",
