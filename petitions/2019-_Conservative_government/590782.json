We get these symptoms every year, it is normal. Common cold has majority of the symptoms.\r\nTesting them daily will also cause havoc because the kids will keep being sent home. We know what to do when kids are unwell & adults unwell we stay at home & use common sense. Like we have done all these years. Let's stop testing everywhere get life back to normal",
        "background": "As the restrictions are all gone on freedom Day July 19th, but testing should also be stopped every where in work places and in all education sectors such as primary schools, high schools, colleges and university. It is ruining our kids education and work life. People tired of this now.",
