        "action": "Do not ease COVID regulations for Christmas at the expense of another lockdown",
        "additional_details": "Easing COVID regulations for Christmas at the expense of another lockdown is detrimental to those who rely on returning to work, business owners, fitness and mental health, and the general well-being of the public.  Short term enjoyment will cause long term harm.  As a nation we are financially crashing and to ease regulations won't just cause a knock on effect, it will bring back the sense of being able to return to normal ways, and returning to a lockdown after will prove difficult.",
        "background": "To keep COVID regulations in place without compromise throughout the festive period, to work towards the greater goal of returning to work, sporting facilities opening without restrictions, families reuniting on a regular basis, and for us to work as a nation to fight COVID for the long run.",
