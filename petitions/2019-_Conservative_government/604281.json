        "additional_details": "Through my research involving scores of Councils I have discovered that only one Council provides a refund of council tax for their failure to collect bins. No Councils provided council tax refunds for the closure of amenity tips during the Covid pandemic last Spring. No Councils provide council tax refunds to council tax paying residents who live on unadopted roads, the maintenance of which is met totally by the residents. Council tax payers should be entitled to refunds when they do not receive services they pay for.",
