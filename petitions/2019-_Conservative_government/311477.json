        "additional_details": "Those examiners who are self-employed can receive support, those who pay via PAYE cannot. Awarding bodies exploit the loophole of 'contracted' work although they do not offer P45s every time a contract ends, and HMRC argues that they are the employers of examiners paying PAYE. It is not the fault of examiners who provide essential activity intensively during exam time that examinations have been cancelled. This is the only income some examiners receive.",
        "background": "Most examiners are paid 'employees' in that awarding bodies pay tax at source for them via PAYE. Awarding bodies have not pledged to support examiners whose main work this summer will not happen.",
