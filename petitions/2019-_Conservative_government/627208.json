        "additional_details": "We believe the following:\r\n \r\n- There is a consensus in published research that developing new oil and gas fields is incompatible with staying below 1.5C of warming;\r\n- The UK needs to demonstrate its commitment to move away from fossil fuels if we expect much poorer nations to do the same;\r\n- For countries to use energy security to justify exploiting new oil and gas reserves would destroy any hope of fighting climate change;\r\n- It will do nothing to address the current cost of living crisis.",
        "background": "We want the Government to take all action necessary to prevent new North Sea oil and gas exploration. This includes preventing new licences being granted as a result of the current Offshore Licensing Round, and revoking powers for any new licenses for exploration to be granted.",
