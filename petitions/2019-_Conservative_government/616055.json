        "action": "Reduce cost of cat neutering and spaying",
        "additional_details": "I believe the government needs to make it mandatory that neutering and spaying costs are reduced for everyone. And also microchipping it cost less than \u00a33 to microchip a cat yet vets charge \u00a320. You pay close to \u00a3100 just to have a cat chipped and neutered and sometimes vets charge a pre op consultation on top. It's no wonder we have a crisis on our hands. There's more un neutered cats than rescues can get through and it's getting more concerning by the day",
        "background": "We have a massive crisis with cats breeding at the moment and so many strays on the streets looking for mates. Neutering costs need to be made more affordable. This is going to get far worse with the cost of living going up. The government needs to step in and help these poor animals.",
