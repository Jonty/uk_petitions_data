        "additional_details": "I and many others like me are fully aware that there is a high risk of losing money while trading the markets (crypto, forex, commodity and other derivatives) and it is very clear that one could lose everything and more while trading.  However, access should not be just for so called \"investment professionals\" and I agree that the providers of such services should be regulated, however I think that the law needs to be brought up to date to allow informed members of the public to trade.",
        "background": "The notion of an \"investment professional\" has become outdated since the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 was enacted.  Whilst this was put in place to \"protect consumers\", and this is a legitimate concern, someone that does understand the risks should not be restricted.",
