The vast majority of affordable adapted mobility cars are in a higher tax bracket, this is due to the size of vehicle and subsequent engine size. Many elderly disabled people simply don't have the choice to have a smaller care. I want to Government to ensure that people on Attendance Allowance are exempted from vehicle tax, the same as it is for those who receive other disability benefits.",
