        "additional_details": "Bevacizumab (Avastin) is a drug that acts on cancer cells; it is used as a first line treatment of colorectal (bowel) and other cancers in some parts of Europe & the USA. However, the UK postcode lottery means patients have to self-fund this treatment, which can cost between \u00a3200-\u00a32000 per round of treatment, with some patients needing multiple rounds alongside chemotherapy \u2013 a terrifying choice for those already on reduced incomes.",
        "background": "NICE has previously reviewed Avastin (bevacizumab) as a treatment for colorectal cancer and recommended it should not be offered on the NHS. The drug\u2019s patent has since ended, which has reduced the cost. We request that this drug now be made available on the NHS for all colorectal cancer patients.",
