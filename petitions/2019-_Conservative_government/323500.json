        "additional_details": "It is a fact that the world's weather is altering. The UK has drier, hotter spring and summers now. Many countries already have this ban in place.\r\n\r\nA ban on bonfires between these dates should have many positive effects. The fire service should have fewer call outs to out of control garden burns, thus lessening the strain on public services. Air quality should improve.\r\n\r\nLast but not least people would not be subjected to unwanted smoke and unpleasant smells which can have a negative effect on their lives.This should also reduce the number of complaints being dealt with by local councils.",
