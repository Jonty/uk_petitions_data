If a child picked the virus up at school/college and are symptomatic they will pass it to family member that could be old or vulnerable. Also many children are vulnerable and have health issues. \r\n\r\nWe understand the importance of education. However, parents should be given the option as it\u2019s a safe guarding concern and should be taken seriously.",
