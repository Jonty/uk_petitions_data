Intensive support at a young age would yield better outcomes, allowing them to go on to live independent lives, thereby lessening the future ongoing cost to the NHS. So much more can be done for this vulnerable group of children. The NHS needs to invest more in their rehabilitation at a young age in order to deliver improved outcomes and enable these children to live full lives.",
        "background": "At 12 months old, our son had emergency surgery to completely disconnect and partially remove one side of his brain. We have since been under the local NHS services, where the care available is woefully inadequate. ",
