If the Government were to include laser eye surgery free for partially sighted (other eye conditions) patients on the NHS would make life easier for people with eye conditions. There are free non essential surgeries on the NHS that without you can still take part in daily activities without being inhibited like eye conditions can cause.",

Making laser eye surgery free for partially sighted patients (other eye conditions) would help the 360,000 other people diagnosed.",
