        "additional_details": "Under the proposed Schedule 27 of the Coronavirus Bill relating to disposal of dead bodies the government proposes suspending the wishes of the deceased to not be cremated. Cremation is against the religious rulings followed by many people of the Jewish and Muslim faiths. Many religious groups have suspended prayer gatherings to support the public efforts against COVID19. However forcing cremation of loved ones could cause immense undue emotional strain and seriously impact mental health.",
        "background": "To make an allowance for religious wishes in the proposed Coronavirus Bill and to stop forced cremation of loved ones which would be against the customs and rules of religious minorities in the country. Forcing cremation risks causing anxiety, depression and poor mental health for people.",
