        "additional_details": "Certain requirements in dress codes are already likely to be unlawful, but any separate dress codes for men and women are discriminatory. It can make women feel extremely uncomfortable to be singled out for their sex. Some women may even avoid certain work such as flight attendant work or joining the army. Skirts can be unflattering and feel humiliating for women who don't wear them and can make it hard to feel like an equal alongside male peers.",
        "background": "The Government should make it illegal to have different dress codes for men and women, such as requiring women to wear dresses or skirts as part of a uniform. Where there are options, both men and women should have the choice of which they will wear.",
