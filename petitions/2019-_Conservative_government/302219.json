        "additional_details": "Statutory pay does not cover the bills for most working families.  Employees may not be entitled to annual or sick pay if it has been used up or if they are self-employed.  Closing schools and nurseries could make families in arrears with their finances if unable to work and bring money in.  We do not want families on the streets or in financial crisis because the government is closing schools/nurseries without ensuring \r\nthat working families will get paid their wages.",
        "background": "Coronavirus is now a pandemic which threatens the closure of schools and nurseries, resulting in parents having to take time off work.  There is currently no set provision that enables working parents to have special leave at full pay, if they cannot take sick pay or annual leave.",
