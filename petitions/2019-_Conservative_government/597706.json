Usually, the goal of the abuser is to manipulate, control and instil a sense of worthlessness in the other person.Narcissistic abuse is often \u201cinvisible,\u201d and there may be not physical evidence of it like cuts or bruises.

If there are behaviours that aren't included in that list, we could accept a petition to add them, if it's clear what they are. \r\n\r\nWe can't publish petitions that include a requirement for mandatory medical treatment or assessment, such as requiring psychological evaluations for victims of abuse.
