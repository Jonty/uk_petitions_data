Currently it is only protected under Group B meaning that only delayed coverage of games is protected by law. By placing it in group A under the the Broadcasting Act 1996 it would prevent in law the organisers from placing the games behind a pay wall in a subscription TV service. 100,000s of people could be prevented from enjoying live coverage.",
