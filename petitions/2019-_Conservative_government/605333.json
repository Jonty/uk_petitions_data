        "additional_details": "Currently we believe the options for titles are not equal because:\r\n \r\n1. Males under 18 are often given the title 'Master', then 'Mr' when over 18. However this isn't the same for females who are normally given the title 'Miss' until married. Therefore age is often used to define male titles, but marriage for female titles.\r\n \r\n2. There are no distinct titles to indicate marriage for men or non-binary.\r\n \r\n3. Females shouldn't have to choose to hide their marital status whilst males do not have to consider this. It's outdated.\r\n \r\nThis is one step in the direction of equality.",
        "background": "Remove all other titles - including 'Miss\u2019, 'Mrs' and \u2018Master\u2019 where they are currently used on official documents - so the only options are 'Dr' for people with a doctorate, 'Ms' for females, 'Mr' for males and 'Mx' for non-binary people. We believe this will make options equal across all genders.",
