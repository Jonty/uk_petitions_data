This can lead people to feel self-conscious, depressed and overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nWe believe people with autoimmune diseases are getting turned down for PIP because they are able to carry out everyday tasks unaided, such as; eating, drinking and preparing food, and managing their own treatment. But this doesn\u2019t mean that their quality of life is not impacted and we think that being eligible for PIP would help improve the quality of life of people with autoimmune diseases.\r\n",
