        "additional_details": "Due to the Coronavirus crisis, UK zoos have had to remain closed to the public which has been detrimental to their income. With social distancing in place zoos could safely be reopened, allowing them to generate revenue in their busiest time of year. This is vital for zoos to be able to continue vital conservation work for both the UK and other countries internationally.",
        "background": "The Government has placed zoos on the list of businesses to remain closed, this will be detrimental to zoos' income if they are not allowed to reopen. There has been no financial support from the Government for large zoos, and they are under extreme financial pressure, and could end up closing.",
