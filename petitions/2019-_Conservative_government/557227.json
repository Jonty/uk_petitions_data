Even part of the child physical development care and health act talks about the importance of understanding Afro/very curly hair. Supermarkets/convenience stores have a limited amount of products or none at all for Afro hair. And myself and many families like mine struggled to keep our hair and our children's healthy.",

And not to close them during Any Local or National Lock Down. \r\nAs a black women with black children I found it impossible to find suitable hair care and skin care products in shops where I live.",
