        "additional_details": "We believe that the current arrangements for an Ombudsman scheme for financial services are fundamentally not fit for purpose and should be replaced by a free tribunal system.\r\n\r\nThis new tribunal system would provide an independent means of redress to complainants and have powers to handle complaints, call witnesses, require full disclosure, order remedies & compensation.\r\n \r\nThe Tribunal should be funded by financial businesses that are subject to complaints and be free to access for complainants.",
        "background": "We want the Government to replace the current provisions for an Ombudsman scheme for financial services with a free tribunal system that has unlimited power to review/reopen all complaints over the last 10 years about financial products and services plus order remedies and compensation.",
