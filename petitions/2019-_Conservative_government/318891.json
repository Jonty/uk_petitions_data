        "additional_details": "So many citizens misuse these spaces which causes parents to wait dangerously on streets in or car parks and, at times, even abandon there intentions to shop. It can cause raised tempers and upset in front of innocent children which is totally unacceptable. It would be really beneficial for the government to allocate parking passes, similar to a disabled pass, for parents or guardians to display whilst travelling with children.",
        "background": "Properly regulated parent and child parking spaces, similar to disabled parking, are important as there are so many citizens who misuse these spaces. Parent/guardian and child spaces are a real asset as it is difficult to get a child or baby in and out of a car in a normal sized parking space.",
