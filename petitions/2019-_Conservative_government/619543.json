        "additional_details": "Drivers/motorcyclists are meant to use all mirrors for 'life saver' checks when manoeuvring. How can you manoeuvre when you do not know what is going on behind or beside you?\r\n \r\nWe believe manoeuvring on the road without using a mirror to check is dangerous, and may force a vehicle to cross further over to the other side of the road into oncoming traffic. Cyclist numbers have increased so there should be further safety measures for bikes. ",
        "background": "All road users have a responsibility to ensure safety to themselves & others. A law should be passed so that it is a legal requirement for all cyclists to have wing mirrors or at least a right hand wing mirror. In addition all bicycle shops must now sell them with the wing mirror/s already attached.",
