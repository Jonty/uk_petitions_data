        "additional_details": "Given the catastrophe of COVID-19 across Europe we should delay the exit negotiations for at least a year.\r\n\r\nAll resources here and the EU should be free to work on fighting the spread and the impact of this devastating killer virus.\r\n\r\nOur current supply chains for food, medicines and other supplies need to remain in tact and not changed or undermined which could lead to an increase of the rate of illness and death across Europe, including the United Kingdom. Let's be patient, kind and careful.",
        "background": "Insist our politicians place resources where they are needed now and not take chances with vulnerable peoples lives to comply with a plan to leave the EU made before this devastating illness fell upon us all. Lives matter more than a delay.   Brexit will happen, but let\u2019s get our priorities right.",
