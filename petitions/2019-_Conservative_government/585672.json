        "additional_details": "There is a huge issue in Victoria Park in regards to litter and food waste - people keep feeding the animals and leaving food waste around which has attracted more rats, naturally. In response to this, instead of improving litter issues or improving messaging to discourage the public feeding animals, they have decided to install deadly traps to murder the rats.",
        "background": "An animal friendly and ethical way to reduce the rat issue within Victoria Park must be put into place. Traps that shoot a bolt through the rats heads have been installed, killing these animals - this is an unethical short-term solution to the issue of litter within the park.",
