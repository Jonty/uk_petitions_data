        "additional_details": "As a first year student, I haven\u2019t experienced the worst of this pandemic, I can only fight for second and third year\u2019s word that they\u2019re not getting the quality teaching they deserve. It\u2019s stressful enough living through these difficult times while being told to live a \u201cnormal life\u201d. The government were able to cancel/ rearrange A-levels and GCSE exams for 2021, we are only asking you to do the same for us University students. We have been through enough with trying to maintain good quality grades with hindered learning. Considering that we are paying 9K+ a year for Higher education, why are we not treated the same? I also hope you\u2019re discussing to refund at least a months worth of accommodation rent.",
        "background": "As a first year, we\u2019ve jumped into higher education that we\u2019ve had no support for. Online schooling is our source of \u201cquality\u201d learning, which is criticised as teachers are new to this too. Students are calling out to the government to lower boundaries, and be more sympathetic with our situation.",
