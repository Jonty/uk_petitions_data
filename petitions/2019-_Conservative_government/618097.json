        "additional_details": "Usually, a government wouldn't reduce the age due to lack of responsibility when it comes road safety, but that should not be an issue if they have never done drugs. Younger ages should have the opportunity to get around in a car rather than walking, taking the bus or a taxi, so giving the option for driving could improve learning in a way, by learning from an earlier age. A suggested idea is that there should be a younger age project that checks on younger adults alongside using a project license.",
        "background": "Reduce the driving minimum age to 15 years providing they have proven that they have never done cigarettes, vapes, drugs or alcohol illegally and proof of age will be necessary.",
