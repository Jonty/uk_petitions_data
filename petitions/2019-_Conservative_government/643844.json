        "additional_details": "The UK Hospitality industry represents approximately 5% of the UK GDP, 10% of employment and 6% of businesses here in the UK. As we have seen a massive decline in employment in hospitality, businesses have shut down due to staffing problems and a lack of adequate Government support. We believe the UK needs a Minister of Hospitality to meet with Hospitality representatives across the UK, and develop hospitality regional plans and plans to get more employment into the hospitality sector.",
