        "additional_details": "The 2021 IPCC report clearly shows the importance of ending the use of fossil fuels as a means for energy worldwide before 2030. The consequences of fossil fuel emissions are blatant both from this report, and from what\u2019s happening around the world today. Flash floods, wildfires, rising sea levels - these are all a result of human-accelerated climate change, and if the UK government continues with oil and coal extraction this decade, they will damage the planet further beyond repair.",
        "background": "The UK government, as the head of this years COP26 conference in Glasgow, should cancel the Cambo oilfield and Cumbria coalmine projects. By doing this, it maintains a continued priority on ending fossil fuel extraction and use in this country and abroad, reducing GHG emissions as a result.",
