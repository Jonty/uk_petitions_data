        "action": "Curb imports to force the Chinese government to stop suppression of Human Rights",
        "additional_details": "China uses trade as a political tool. Therefore curbing chinese imports sends a strong political signal as well as having an economic effect. China is increasingly becoming repressive under its current leader Xi Jinping. He needs to go.\r\nCurbing Chinese imports will also stimulate domestic production making the UK more self reliant and increasing its own exports worldwide. This also puts more pressure on China as they do not want the UK to challenge them.",
        "background": "Introduce barriers to trade such as additional import paperwork to make it too expensive or difficult to import Chinese goods. These should be targeted particularly where there is a shortage of domestic producers to encourage local start-ups (together with stimulus such as subsidies).",
