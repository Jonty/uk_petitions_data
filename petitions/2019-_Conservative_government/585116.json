        "additional_details": "We want a longer holiday, 3 days at most. We fast for a whole entire month & we get only one day in return to celebrate our celebration. It is unfair how Christmas gets a longer holiday as well as Easter. Eid is just as important as any celebration/ event in any other religion. We deserve 3 days or more at most to celebrate our special days, as do other people on their special days such as Christmas.",
        "background": "Muslims fast for a month, during the month of Ramadan. We only get one day to celebrate Eid, whereas the other holidays get 2/3 weeks. For example, the Christmas holiday is 2/3 weeks long, Easter is 2 weeks long. Those are Christian holidays, we have no holidays of our own.",
