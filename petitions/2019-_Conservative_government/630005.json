        "action": "Require all drivers to switch to winter tyres in November as a mandatory measure",
        "additional_details": "Making it mandatory for drivers to switch to winter tyres would improve road safety significantly, as winter tyres provide better grip, braking performance and fuel efficiency in cold temperatures. This would reduce the number of accidents caused by slippery roads and icy conditions, while also reducing the amount of fuel wasted due to inefficient tyres. Additionally, it would help reduce the amount of wear and tear on the roads, as the tyres would be better suited to the cold and wet conditions. Making it mandatory for drivers to switch to winter tyres would ultimately result in a safer and more efficient driving experience for everyone.",
        "background": "Drivers should be required to switch to winter tyres between 1st November and 31st March. This is important to ensure that vehicles are equipped to handle colder weather and icy conditions, which can significantly reduce the risk of accidents.",
