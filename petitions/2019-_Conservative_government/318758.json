However this has not been extended to the families of transport workers (for example the families of the 10 London bus drivers who have already died of COVID19) or other essential workers, such as care workers or shop assistants, who die of the disease. This group of workers are typically less well paid than NHS staff but their families still need to be cared for and their sacrifices honoured.",
