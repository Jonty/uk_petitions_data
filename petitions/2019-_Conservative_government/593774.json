        "additional_details": "Due to the continuous lockdowns England has been put in, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The social care of people living with neurological diseases has been put on the back burner. Meaning their quality of life has been significantly impacted due to the lack of social interaction, which I  believe contributes to them declining at a faster than normal rate. Therefore more needs to be done to help promote the social and mental wellbeing of people living with these diseases.",
