        "additional_details": "This issue was raised on 13th July by Kevin Brennan MP.\r\n\r\nThe government should legislate that tickets can only be resold through the site they were originally purchased from, with the max resale value being the face value that the ticket was originally sold for (as is the case on some sites). This would completely eradicate ticket touting whilst allowing fans the opportunity to resell the tickets for any events they can no longer attend.",
        "background": "Sites such as Viagogo allow 'affiliates' to resell tickets, often to sold out events, on their site for an inflated price.  This encourages ticket scalpers (people who buy tickets with the sole purpose of reselling) to purchase multiple tickets, pricing out real fans.",
