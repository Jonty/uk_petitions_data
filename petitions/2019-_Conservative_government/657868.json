        "additional_details": "Despite all the current increases in living costs, the Government has not increased compensation available for loss of earnings and additional care costs when the public is summoned for jury service. Many people struggle from financial hardship resulting from jury service, and we believe the payments available are far too low.\r\n \r\nExample. If I was doing jury service for 8 weeks the money received for loss of earnings would not cover my mortgage payments, electricity bills and utility bills.\r\n",
