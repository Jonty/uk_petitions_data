        "additional_details": "Insurance companies shouldn't get away with charging more as you have a foreign last name or a woman or a driver that's under 21 or as you don't come from a private estate and they shouldn't be increasing, especially doubling or more, insurance prices even though no claims bonus has increased from previous year and you've gained more experience on the road. Insurance prices should be done for a general area not a special area",
        "background": "Create new legislations towards insurance companies to stop being racist, sexist, ageist and regionalist to offer insurance at fairer more justified prices. Also to prevent them increasing insurance prices (sometimes double and more) even though no claims bonus increases annually.",
