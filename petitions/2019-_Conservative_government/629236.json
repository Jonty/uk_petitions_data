        "action": "Reduce train fares to make public transport cheaper than driving.",
        "additional_details": "Currently public transport costs are much greater than the cost of petrol on most routes (in many cases even if driving as a single person in a car). An example is, with a railcard to go one way from Birmingham to Edinburgh costs \u00a360 to \u00a390 whereas without a railcard this fee increases to upwards of \u00a3130. This same journey would cost around \u00a340 in fuel for an average performing personal car. The train fares should be lowered so that driving is not the cheaper option.",
        "background": "Reduce train fares to make public transport cheaper or comparable to driving a personal vehicle. This will make public transport more accessible, reduce road congestion and reduce overall UK carbon emissions as fewer people will be driving personal vehicles.",
