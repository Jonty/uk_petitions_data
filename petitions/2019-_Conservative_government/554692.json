        "additional_details": "In addition, Parliament and the British People deserve an explanation of the awarding of multi-million-pound contracts such as that handed to PPE Medpro,  a company only incorporated in May this year with a share capital of just \u00a3100, without tender, of a \u00a3110,000,000 contract to supply PPE to the NHS.",
        "background": "Parliament needs to turn the spotlight on the use, and possible misuse, of public funds during this COVID crisis. Millions of pounds have been wasted, on unsuitable PPE or COVID tests that don't work, or a private Track and Trace system that is unfit for purpose.",
