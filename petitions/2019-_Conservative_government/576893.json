        "additional_details": "Farming should have animal welfare as its top priority and in the case of rabbit battery farming this is not the case: females can be on a continuous cycle of producing litters and share small cages with their kittens who are then sent for slaughter.\r\n \r\nKeeping rabbits in such close proximity can also increases the spread of diseases such as RHD and Myxomatosis.\r\n \r\nMost importantly this is animal cruelty, it should not be permitted and should be a criminal offence.",
        "background": "Planning permission for rabbit battery farms is being sought in Nottinghamshire, Cornwall and Buckinghamshire. This barbaric farming method needs to be outlawed entirely, and we would like the Government to make the battery farming of rabbits a criminal offence.",
