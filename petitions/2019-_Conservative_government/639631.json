        "additional_details": "A dedicated Minister for Knife Crime Prevention could:\r\n\r\n- work across government departments, with law enforcement, community groups and educational institutions, to ensure that there is a coordinated approach to tackling knife crime.\r\n- develop strategic plans and policies to prevent knife crime and address its root causes.\r\n- help raise public awareness of knife crime and promote community engagement.\r\n- create greater accountability for addressing knife crime, as a single minister would be responsible for delivering on this issue.\r\n- collaborate with administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to share information, knowledge and best practice, to develop more effective strategies to combat knife crime.",
        "background": "Having a dedicated minister specifically assigned to prevent knife crime would demonstrate that the Government recognises the severity of the issue and is committed to tackling it. It would send a strong message that knife crime is a priority and requires targeted efforts.",
