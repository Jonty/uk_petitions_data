        "additional_details": "Channel 4 is publicly-owned and exists to foster inclusion and to support independent production companies. It is funded entirely from advertising and commercial activities and does not cost the taxpayer anything. \r\n\r\nThe government says that public ownership is holding Channel 4 back. But instead, privatisation will stifle creativity and stop Channel 4 from providing diversity in programming. Privatisation is not in the public\u2019s interests.",
