        "additional_details": "In March 2020, the UK's Conservative government put our country into a full scale national lockdown due to COVID-19. However, the virus was first announced as a potential threat in the UK in January and February of that year. Why were restrictions not put into place when this new threat emerged? Yes, the schools shut, but in my opinion too late. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons do I believe that the British public should be given a chance to rethink who they want to put their trust in to lead our country.",
        "background": "I personally believe that the government or parliament shoukd call a general election in the UK so that a new party can possibly be placed in power due to the Conservative Party's poor handling of the coronavirus pandemic.",
