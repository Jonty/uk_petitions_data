In the decade they\u2019ve had power the financial state of the country has gotten notably worse.\r\nThey\u2019ve allowed energy companies to secure record breaking profits by pushing the average person into a position where they can\u2019t afford to heat their homes. \r\nWith the tories it\u2019s always been profits over people.
