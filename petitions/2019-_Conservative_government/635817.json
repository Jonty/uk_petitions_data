There is currently no cure for Mesothelioma in particular with up to 2,700 people still being diagnosed every year. We have no accurate data on how much asbestos there is, figures fluctuate between 300,000 and 1.5 million buildings in the UK and as buildings age the asbestos deteriorates and the risk of exposure increases. The most high-risk settings are schools and hospitals.",
        "background": "I want the Government to commit to two key recommendations of the Work and Pensions Committee inquiry into the management of asbestos. We do not know where all the asbestos is in the country so we need a central register, and we need to make a plan for its safe removal over the next 40 years.",
