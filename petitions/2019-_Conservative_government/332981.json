        "additional_details": "Exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke kills over 1.2 million non-smokers a year (WHO 2020). \r\n\r\nCouncils have no legal powers to act on complaints about indoor tobacco smoking. \r\n\r\nPeople who breathe in second-hand smoke regularly are more likely to suffer the same diseases as smokers including asthma, lung cancer and heart disease (NHS 2020). These diseases also make people more vulnerable to COVID19 so a ban before the autumn (when more people will be spending more time indoors) will save lives.",
        "background": "Protect people who choose not to smoke, children, the vulnerable, the NHS and public funds.\r\n\r\nOblige councils to act on complaints about indoor tobacco smoking as they do noise, but with harsher penalties.\r\n\r\nImplement the ban immediately before a potential second spike in COVID19 and save lives.",
