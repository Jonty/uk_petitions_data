        "additional_details": "There are already regulations in place for the ethics of kills in slaughterhouses of other animals. The practice of boiling lobsters alive is unnecessary and outdated, especially since we are unsure of whether lobsters are capable of feeling pain or not. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, the process before the actual boiling can be considered traumatic for the animals, as it includes shipping in containers, and being placed in tanks with multiple other lobsters (even though lobsters are solitary beings).",
        "background": "Already banned in other countries, including Switzerland, the practice of boiling lobsters alive is barbaric and inhumane, and should be made illegal in the UK.",
