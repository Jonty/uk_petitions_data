        "additional_details": "Following the Prime Minister\u2019s comments regarding the 2030 Indian-UK Roadmap, the reality of Indian citizens currently residing in the UK and conversely, the vast number of UK citizens residing in India; the fact UK and India both have left hand drive, it would make intuitive sense to include India on this list of countries who can exchange their home license to a UK one. This action would further establish the stable and prospering relationship between the Republic of India and the UK.",
        "background": "An Indian visitor to the United Kingdom can drive on their international license for a year. It makes little sense why India citizens are allowed to drive for a year on this license and then they are required to undertake a theory & driving test on the roads they have been driving on for a year.",
