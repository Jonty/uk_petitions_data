Let me start by giving you an example. \r\n\r\nIf you currently have category D entitlement, you can drive a double decker bus full of school children (100) with the average vehicle weight of roughly 20 tonne. \r\n\r\nBut you can't drive a category C1 licence,\u00a0 7.5 tonne vehicle carrying non human items.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think DVLA should automatically allow current category D holders the ability to drive C1. \r\n\r\nThis would enable more lorries being able to transport essential items across the UK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI ask you for your support in getting the DVLA to reevaluate their strategy when they issue drivers licences.",
        "background": "Enforcement of a simple licence \r\n\r\nCurrent categories D & C1 should be the same category.",
