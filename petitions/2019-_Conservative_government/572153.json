They are worth more than they\u2019re paid and the country is grateful for their service. \r\n\r\nFor any periods of employment with the NHS they should not be expected to pay Tax or National Insurance.",
        "background": "It\u2019s generally accepted that NHS workers are underpaid for the jobs that they do. They are paid for with taxpayer money and they provide the services for which National Insurance is intended. COVID has shown us how important and dedicated these people are. Stop taxing their income.",
