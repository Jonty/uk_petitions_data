        "additional_details": "Across the UK, many women and girls cannot afford sanitary products. Some are forced to use socks as makeshift pads, or even bleed all over their clothes. Half of girls in the UK have missed a whole day of school because of their period, and this has very negative impact on their education and mental wellbeing. Shockingly, period poverty affects around 27% of women and girls around the UK. Women and girls can't suffer in silence any longer. Period poverty is outrageous and it has to stop. Now.",
        "background": "Make sanitary products freely available to women if they're already receiving other benefits, and create a coupon system so that disadvantaged women can receive coupons every week and exchange the coupons for products somewhere local.",
