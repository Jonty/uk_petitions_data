        "additional_details": "I want the government to provide the test as the majority of children in special needs schools are unable, due to the nature of their disabilty, to take a PCR test. The RT-LAMP test is saliva based and therefore easier for those with disabilties to complete. School policies, following government guidelines, are that a child showing 1 or more covid-19 symptoms needs to self isolate for 10 days, or have a negative PCR test. As some children can't do the PCR test, they are forced to self isolate.",
