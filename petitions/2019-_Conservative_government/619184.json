        "additional_details": "If the UK is to maintain its global standing in the world, it must carefully consider the benefits enhanced defence spending could bring, particularly in light of the war in Ukraine. We believe strong defence and security reinforces our seriousness in delivering on our international obligations, and should help deter the myriad of threats that exist in todays ever-changing international system.",
        "background": "Britain\u2019s defence spending currently stands at around 2.3% of its GDP, and spending as a proportion of GDP has fallen significantly in recent decades. Britain faces various threats & risks falling behind in developing its future capabilities. It therefore must increase spending to 3% of GDP or more.",
