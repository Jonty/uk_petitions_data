        "additional_details": "People in England has to pay for their medications unless they are exempted from prescription charge. People who suffer from long-term or chronic health conditions like Parkinson's disease, asthma, COPD, hypertension etc are not included in prescription exemptions list, which means sufferers must pay for prescriptions for their medication. This change will be even more important if the Government implements plans proposals to raise the age for free prescriptions to 66 years, which mean more people had to pay for their prescriptions.",

Providing free prescriptions would help ensure access to medication.",
