There will also be 1000s of children impacted by grief, and where long term impacts of COVID disrupt their futures.\r\n\r\nFree Education, available to all, is one clear way to support our young people in creating a post pandemic future we all want to live for and in. So let's make it available",

The amount should be index linked to match inflation.",
