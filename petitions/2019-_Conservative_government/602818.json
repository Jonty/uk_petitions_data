        "additional_details": "With the ARAP scheme closed and ACRS not yet open, there is currently no safe and \"legal\" passage that is easily accessible for Afghans to enter the UK. If they make the journey across Europe themselves, they risk criminalisation or worse, death. Afghanistan is not a safe place to live. The Taliban put the marginalised in Afghanistan at constant risk. With funds frozen, there is scarcity of money or food. Afghanistan faces a famine and humanitarian crisis. Safe passage must be provided now.",

We want the Government to open the ARCS to create accessible safe and \"legal\" passage for Afghans to enter the UK to claim asylum, with immediate effect.",
