        "additional_details": "Everyday millions worldwide are experiencing the impacts of climate change. It is vital that we act now before it is too late. If fossil fuel-run planes were banned, airlines would be forced to find a cleaner alternative as they would not want to lose the UK as a destination, and hopefully other countries would follow suit.\r\n \r\nThe Climate Clock says that by 2029 global warming will reach 1.5\u00b0C. We must act now. Planes must become sustainable or cease to be used.\r\n",
        "background": "Planes are one of the largest single contributors to global warming, because they use fossil fuels. This petition calls for the Government to ban all aircraft that use fossil fuels, to encourage investment in alternative technology that can use renewable energy sources.",
