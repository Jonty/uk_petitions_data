        "additional_details": "Currently, visiting care homes in areas with a high Covid alert level like Manchester is limited to exceptional circumstances such as end of life. Dementia can leave patients at a point where they don\u2019t even recognise their own family and their quality of life can plummet. It\u2019s heart-breaking to see families just like this being denied visitation to extremely vulnerable patients, yet the hospitality sector moves forward. Putting the economy before the value of life itself is barbaric.",

People with deteriorative health conditions like dementia NEED to be able to interact with their family before it\u2019s too late!",
