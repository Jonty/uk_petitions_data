        "additional_details": "Covid-19 has had a significant impact on the bus industry with the collapse of new orders from operators due to the crisis. The goal for cleaner buses entering service is only achievable if the government provide support fast.\r\nAs a result of Covid-19 lock down restrictions people have been told to work from home and avoid public transport, directly. While this was the right thing to do, running costs for both operators and manufacturers still went on.\r\n",
        "background": "Back in February the government made a pledge to provide funding for 4,000 new low or zero emission buses for the UK. Now more than ever this funding is critical to the UK bus industry to ensure that goal can be met. It should be provided urgently.",
