        "additional_details": "Dedicated spaces for under 18s, such as skate-ramps, pump-tracks and play fields, are expensive to create and maintain leaving many people under 18 unable to establish an active lifestyle, healthy social habits and safe engagement in their communities. Many communities have existing leisure facilities such as swimming pools, tennis courts and football pitches. If these were all freely available to under 18s, vast amounts of money could be saved in youth services and future NHS costs.",
