        "additional_details": "The government has laid out a clear roadmap of ending all covid restrictions, including the re-opening of night clubs. So why can\u2019t students attend lectures in which we pay over \u00a39,000 for? Online learning is not a enough to get us a degree, you cannot embrace the learning capacity of a potential graduate learning via a small screen. If the government refuses to let universities allow full capacity in September we must demand for lowered tuition fees, as it becomes an \u2018open university\u2019 course.",
        "background": "The government needs to lay a clear roadmap of how universities are going to manage next year, starting in September. On campus learning should resume, including non-practical students. If the government fails us, our tuition fees must be lowered!",
