        "action": "Ensure COVID testing remains free & that changes on the 1 April do not happen.",
        "additional_details": "I want government to rethink it's plan and ensure that we all have access to free testing as although we do need to live with COVID, we also need to realise that COVID is not going away and potential new variants may emerge. How will see these potential new variants if we have to pay for testing?",
        "background": "The changes that the government aim to implement on the 1 April means that people in England will have to pay for COVID testing and lateral flow kits. This must be stopped. The living with COVID plan needs to ensure that kits are still free for all people and not just people who are vulnerable.",
