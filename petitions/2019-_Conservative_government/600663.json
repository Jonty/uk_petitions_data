Someone caused these injuries.\r\nPumpkin is now fully paralysed from the waist down. She will never recover or walk again. \r\nShe is not in pain. She is trying to live a normal happy, puppy life without the use of her legs!\r\n\r\nplease sign this petition to support her cause and get justice to whoever did this.",
