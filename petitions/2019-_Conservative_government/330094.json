        "action": "Crack down on the meat and dairy industry and eventually ban their production",
        "additional_details": "The meat and dairy industry is one of the driving forces of global warming and the increase in greenhouse gases. It is also the main cause of the UK\u2019s number 1 killer; heart disease. Heart attacks are most often caused by cholesterol that is only found in animal products. By eventually banning meat and dairy, it will save our struggling NHS millions of pounds annually. Our Government is claiming to care for the environment, animals and our health, then why not tackle the worst thing for these?",
        "background": "Laws and regulations need to be immediately introduced to crack down on the meat and dairy industry. A safety net and re-hiring scheme also needs to be set up for farmers who will be out of work. Education on the effects of a meat and dairy diet must also become compulsory for pupils at school.",
