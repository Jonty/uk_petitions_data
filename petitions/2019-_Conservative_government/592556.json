        "additional_details": "As a registered British CIC, The Scheherazade Foundation is devoted to bridging cultures and healing wounds of the past. We regard the repatriation of these sacred religious objects as being central to the future of Anglo-Ethioipian cultural relations in the future. Given the developing wave of public agitation, stoked by BML and other cultural campaigns in recent months, we feel that returning the Tabots before widespread rage breaks out is the sensible option.",
        "background": "To decree that the sacred Ethiopian Tabots in the British Museum are returned to the Church of Ethiopia. These stone 'slabs', taken as loot by British forces at the Battle of Magdala in 1868, cannot be viewed or even studied by curators/academics, let alone ever put on show.",
