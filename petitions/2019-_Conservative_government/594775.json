        "action": "Provide humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan to support displaced families.",
        "additional_details": "More than a 1000 civilians have lost their lives in the last month(UN). Climate disasters, Covid-19 and conflict are converging in a living nightmare for the people of Afghanistan(IFRC). \r\n\r\nU.K has a moral duty to provide financial aid, to help alleviate the imminent humanitarian crisis. \r\n\r\nReducing foreign aid, during a time when international security is simultaneously being removed, will have catastrophic consequences for the lives of thousands of innocent families and children.",
        "background": "The decision to remove America troops from Afghanistan by 11th Sep 2021, has also signalled the end of freedom for millions of Afghans. Thousands of civilians, mostly children, have since been displaced, fleeing to makeshift camps. Families are without any access to safe sanitation, food or water.",
