It\u2019s a sad truth that a significant element of our wealth was derived from the slave trade - but this should not have to be celebrated in our public spaces.\r\n\r\nWe must use this significant moment as a catalyst for change to tackle racism, discrimination, and inequality.\r\n\r\nA Royal Commission into the slave trade, the full history, and its impact, should also be established - to ensure oversight for the future, and to make recommendations regarding all relevant aspects; including recommendations to ensure an appropriate curriculum for all children and young people is provided.",
        "background": "Establish a committee or subcommittee to oversee the timely review of slave trade related monuments across the United Kingdom, and to develop an action plan for their removal to a suitable and adequately funded national museum of slavery, or alternatively to a local museum.",
