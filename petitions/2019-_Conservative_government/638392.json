        "additional_details": "Every day dogs and humans are at risk of lead poisoning due to lead shot used legally to kill game birds. Water pipes containing lead are being removed, yet lead is still allowed in game birds deemed fit for human and animal consumption. In a recent study of pheasant based dog food products, some dog food samples were found to have 49, 135 and 245 times over the safe limits of lead for animals. Doses of lead in pheasant meat for humans consumption also exceeds safe limits. This needs to stop now for our health and that of our beloved pets.",
