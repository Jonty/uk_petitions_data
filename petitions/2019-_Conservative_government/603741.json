        "additional_details": "The need for more social workers is recognised locally and globally, however financial barriers stop many from training.\r\n \r\nGiven the need for social workers, and current financial barriers to postgraduate study, the Government should make more generous grants available to people undertaking postgraduate courses in social work.\r\n \r\nMany individuals with a undergraduate degree cannot afford to progress onto the masters. The NHS provide bursaries to some students, but not everyone receives this. If we want to make an active change to support people, children and adults, the Government needs to offer more financial support.",
