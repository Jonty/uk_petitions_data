        "additional_details": "Carers are required to do 35 hours per week in order to qualify for carers allowance. The allowance rate is \u00a366.15p a week, \u00a31.89 per hour. \r\nThe allowance is not considered a salary, yet a commitment of 35 hours is required. This reduces the carers availability to work another job.\r\nIt is not considered a wage for loans, despite it being classed as earnings enough to be removed from benefits. The cap when claiming also prevents carers from improving lives by earning a liveable salary.",
        "background": "1. Carers allowance to be paid at minimum wage for 16 hours per week and classed as a working wage, to class carers allowance as a taxable income.\r\n2. Wage cap to be increased to enable a second job for 20 hours a week.\r\n3.Allowance to reduce in line with overall earnings, not stop at the cap.",
