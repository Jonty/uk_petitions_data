        "additional_details": "In March PHE downgraded the guidelines for PPE for UK medical staff significantly. During the current pandemic medical staff have been actively engaged in trying to limit the human cost of this disease, often at significant personal risk. In Italy around 10% of infections are in healthcare professionals, seriously compromising the country\u2019s ability to fight the epidemic. This is despite following full WHO PPE guidelines. NHS staff deserve better than losing even this basic protection.",
