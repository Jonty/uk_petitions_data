        "additional_details": "It's good to show solidarity with a petitioner you agree with, and signing early can help to get a petition off the ground, but petitions are sorted by signature count and getting to the low count petitions can be time-consuming. The order of petitions also constantly changes, so viewing every petition takes more time than most people can spare. The option of sorting by deadline date would solve this.",
