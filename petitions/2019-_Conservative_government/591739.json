        "additional_details": "Over the last few years, there has been a worrying rise in cases of online abuse. As reported by Report Harmful Content (RHC) this has seen a rise in online hate speech by 225% this year. This rise is also in line with the number of hate crimes being reported to the police, which has doubled over the past 5 years. This is not acceptable, we as a country need to make a change to stop online abuse, hate crimes and hold people accountable for their comments and actions.",
        "background": "Big tech firms (Twitter, Facebook Instagram) who operate in the UK should have to have to ensure all users provide a valid ID to comment/message on their platform. As a result, users can be held accountable for comments made on these platforms and the law should change to reflect this",
