        "additional_details": "It is unfair that Black girls and boys are not taught about influential Black figures in history and it may make them feel excluded and out of place. Black history shouldn\u2019t be limited to one month a year! We are taught about the likes of Martin Luther King Jr and Rosa parks but there are so many others that go unnoticed. For example Lilian Bader. She was born in 1918 in Liverpool and went on to become one of the very first black women to join the British Armed Forces. Teach us this!!",
        "background": "Black history does not get taught enough in schools throughout England and the UK as a whole. The teaching of Black history should be compulsory throughout primary and secondary school. History should teach us about the successes of black individuals, about their bravery, their voices, their lives.",
