The family face reduced or lost income related benefits, and in some cases facing increased costs associated with travel to their apprenticeship for example. The families income drops simply due to the \"name\" of what they have chosen to do - \"apprenticeship\".",

If a child of a low income family takes up an apprenticeship it forces the family into financial hardship - climate due to covid this will impact families more.",
