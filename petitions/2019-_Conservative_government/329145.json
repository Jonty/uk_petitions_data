        "additional_details": "The anti Trump, anti conservative bias is acute. An enquiry is needed to investigate systematic left wing and liberal bias in the BBC. Why is this public funded organisation allowed to push a liberal left agenda? Why doesn't the BBC reflect the political views of the country?  This public body needs to be accountable to the people and should consider public votes on senior roles. All staff need to make a declaration stating their political allegiance to help POLITICAL diversity.",
        "background": "The BBC needs to stop spending 100 million on diversity which is positive discrimination. An investigation into systematic liberal bias is needed. The BBC should reflect the conservative majority in this country.",
