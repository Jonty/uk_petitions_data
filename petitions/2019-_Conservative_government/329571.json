Therefore work undertaken by women during their maternity leave should be valued as equal as a mans and other colleagues who are not on maternity leave. \r\nWe need to foster a fairer society, this requires equality in the value of work delivered by all genders. Currently the balance of power is unreasonably in the hands of unreasonable employers who benefit from government maternity pay reimbursements and cheap kit days.",

Thus disadvantaging all women that do not receive occupational maternity pay during the unpaid element of statutory maternity leave. Government should legislate to pay them fairly.",
