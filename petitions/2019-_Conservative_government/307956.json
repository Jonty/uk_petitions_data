        "additional_details": "This is a four fold approach. It supports the pubs and restaurants to keep getting revenue during the time they cannot open their doors, it helps people get a regular food delivery so reduces panic, it helps the supermarkets as it reduces the amount of deliveries and reduces the amount of people at the supermarket helping to slow down spreading the virus",
        "background": "Bring in new legislation so local pubs and restaurants are allocated a certain amount of households within a local catchment area. They are then given priority supermarket delivery slots for a certain amount of food and drink at a discounted rate to sell and deliver to their locals.",
