        "additional_details": "MPs are the 650 individuals who are responsible for creating & changing laws in the UK. Hence, racial bias could have a profound impact on laws around discrimination & racist acts.\r\n\r\nAnti-racist training must be a necessary requirement for all sitting MPs. It could be in the form of unconscious bias training, or another method, but this change needs to be made.\r\n\r\nWe must work to eliminate all racism. So, reducing racist biases in MPs is a great stepping stone along the road to a better society.",
        "background": "The UK is suffering from a racist endemic. Racist acts are on the rise & politicians aren\u2019t innocent. Labour\u2019s antisemitism report has highlighted how politics is part of the issue. MPs must take anti-racist training to help counter this problem & bring about a fairer society, starting from the top.",
