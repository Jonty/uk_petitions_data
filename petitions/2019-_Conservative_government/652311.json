When we overtake we're forced to use the wrong side of the road. \u20282) Cyclists don't pay road tax. \u20283) Most can't cycle in a straight line. \u20284) A lot don't wear any helmets. \u20285) Cyclists don't have to obey the Highway Code. \u20286) Cyclists have no insurance so if a cyclist damages a car the owner will likely have no compensation. \u20287) Some cycle double-abreast, creating an even greater hazard. \u20288) They are a danger to themselves and drivers as they can't keep up with a decent road speed. If a car was caught by Police travelling at a cycle's speed the driver would be fined for obstructing others and/or dangerous driving.",
