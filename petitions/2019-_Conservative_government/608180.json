        "additional_details": "In a persons lifetime of having a period they will roughly spend \u00a34,000+ - this is awful, many have been un able to afford this and have even gone without other items in order to afford period products. People are using unsafe ways or are being forced to free bleed because they cannot afford menstrual products. We cannot choose wether or not we get a period. Condoms are free, sex is a choice. Pads and tampons cost \u00a32-4, periods are not a choice.",
        "background": "I think the government should make period products around the UK free - schools, public buildings and all toilets should supply free period products. Scotland have done this.",
