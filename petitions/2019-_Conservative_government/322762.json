The RTI date should be moved until the end of the tax year so we are all treated the same. How is it fair that some directors qualify and some dont just because of the date when salaries are submitted. We should all get treated the same and none of us should be left out. Last years salary submission could be used for wages.",

Directors have until the end of the tax year to submit annually salaries into the PAYE system. How can some directors be penalised because we wernt in the system on the 19th March.",
