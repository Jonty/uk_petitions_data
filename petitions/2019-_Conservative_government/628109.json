It is the responsibility of the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. The London Assembly has its own petitions process. You can find out more about how to petition the London Assembly here: https://www.london.gov.uk/about-us/london-assembly/petitions\r\n\r\nIf you wan the Government to take action in relation to public transport in the rest of England we may be able to accept a petition on this, but you'd need to be clear what you want the Government to do."
