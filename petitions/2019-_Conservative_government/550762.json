        "additional_details": "With rarely any social distancing at schools, children are the most likely to catch the virus and spread it instantly. This does not only pose a threat for the youth, but also to the rest of society. Many children live with older parents who are more vunerable to the virus. Many children also use public transport or are interacting with others in the public in general. Little actions like this are all it takes for the virus to spread. Without schools being open, all these risks are eliminated.",
        "background": "I want the Government to reconsider whether schools should remain open. After the recent news surrounding the new laws with gatherings, keeping schools open openly contradicts that law.",
