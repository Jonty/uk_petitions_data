        "additional_details": "We, the British consumer find Sky Sports move anti consumer and see this as profiteering from the global COVID pandemic. It is unfair to ask paying customers to pay an additional fee to watch select premier league games where the government has banned in person attendance during a time of economic hardship. This is market cornering. We also ask that the British public boycott Sky Sports completely until they reverse this decision.",
