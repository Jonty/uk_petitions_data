New laws need to be introduced with legal accountability for MPs/Lords when the general public\u2019s safety/welfare is at risk. MPs & those running government departments must be accountable and not favour their own interests (i.e. business, 2nd jobs, party donors or lobbyists) over the public & constituents. The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards is not fit for purpose",

Currently the government does not allow petitions calling for the removal of MPs/Lords\u2019 Parliamentary Privileges. Accountability & new laws are required.",
