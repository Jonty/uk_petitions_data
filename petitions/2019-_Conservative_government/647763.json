        "additional_details": "Up 10% of babies are born with ankyloglossia (tongue tie) and many of these will struggle to feed effectively.\r\n \r\n'For some babies, the effects will be quite mild. For others, tongue-tie can make feeding extremely challenging or even impossible.' (NCT). How can something so crucial for survival be ignored?\r\n \r\nBabies may struggle with latching, poor weight gain, reflux and be unsettled (NHS.)\r\n \r\nBreastfeeding mothers can face sore/damaged nipples, recurring blocked ducts, mastitis and inevitable stress.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "We want the Government to provide funding to improve services to diagnose tongue tie, and provide lactation support with tongue-tie services embedded within them. Currently mothers are advised to breastfeed up to 6 months, but often receive no support even if their baby has tongue tie.",
