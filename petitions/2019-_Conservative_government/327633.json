        "additional_details": "Under British law, it\u2019s illegal to licence arms exports if they might be used recklessly against civilians or if they violate humanitarian law. It\u2019s argued that the UK doesn\u2019t choose the targets in Yemen & that the Saudi-led coalition already investigates its own alleged violations of humanitarian law, but 6 years on & with 18 million Yemen civilians expected to die from starvation alone this year, the government are due for an updated explanation on why the UK is still playing a part in this.",
        "background": "Every day Yemen is hit by British bombs, dropped by British planes and flown by British-trained pilots. Britain does not merely supply weapons for this war but it keeps the war going. In the wake of increasing social media coverage, the government must be held accountable to their actions in Yemen.",
