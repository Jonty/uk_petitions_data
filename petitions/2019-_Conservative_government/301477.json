        "additional_details": "Strict containment measures have proved to be effective in China, where the number of daily cases has decreased. The initial defiance in cities like Milan, where the campaign #Milanononsiferma (Milan won't stop) was trending for days, led to a spike in the number of cases. Preventing the same from happening in London, with a population of 9 million, is vital. Preventing further strain on the NHS, currently underfunded and distressed, is also vital. Economic considerations should be secondary.",
        "background": "Stricter containment measures such as social distancing should be implemented in densely populated areas. Panic should be avoided, but public authorities should stop encouraging people to engage in activities (such as public transport use) which are known to lead to easier contagion.",
