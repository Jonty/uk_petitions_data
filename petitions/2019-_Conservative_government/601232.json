Please take a moment to watch Alok Sharma, the president of the COP26 summit, summarize what was achieved at the conference: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-59277788\r\n\r\nWe must set serious targets for the next decade, not far in the future. And we must eradicate coal as a power source, not merely \"phase it down\".",

In the face of a climate change emergency the deal was a small step, when we urgently need to take a giant leap forward. We must plan, negotiate, and agree on a much stronger global climate deal by the end of COP 27, Egypt.",
