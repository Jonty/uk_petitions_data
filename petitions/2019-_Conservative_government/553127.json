        "additional_details": "Due to COVID-19 there has been mandatory restrictions enforced by the DVSA, means that the instructors must wait outside whilst the pupil complete their driving tests. As the winter approaches, the weather is more likely to be cold, windy and wet, this is totally unacceptable. As Driving Instructors are self-employed, staying outside in uncertain weather conditions may affect their health and due to this they may have to self isolate.",
        "background": "As the DVSA is a government agency, I would like to request the department to allow access to waiting areas and toilet facilities for pupils & instructors arriving for their driving tests. There are around 40,000 Driving Instructors in the UK and are a vital part of the community and road safety.",
