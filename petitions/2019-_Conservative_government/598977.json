        "additional_details": "There are too many cases of owners failing to prevent their dogs from attacking other dogs, which can lead to costly veterinary bills, and stress and anxiety for both dogs and owners.\r\n \r\nAt present it is not a specific criminal offence to allow a dog to attack another dog, and all too often the victims have to pursue these incidents through civil action. Making dog on dog attacks a specific criminal offence would mean that police and courts would be better empowered to take action in the event of dog on dog attacks.",
        "background": "I want it to be a specific crime rather than a matter of whether this comes under existing dangerous dogs legislation, or is a civil matter, if a dog with an owner attacks another dog. There should penalties for the owner, and action taken in respect of the dog involved, where an offence occurs.",
