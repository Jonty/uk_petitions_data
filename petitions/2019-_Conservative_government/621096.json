Thousands of parents are left without anywhere to change their little one. \r\n\r\nThis means an added stress to thousands of babies and parents when it\u2019s time to change their child. \r\n\r\nAs a Midwife and now new mum I was horrified to notice the lack of facility in so many places. This is discriminatory against those with children and often leaves parents changing babies in unsafe or unhygienic circumstances.",

To have either a designated changing room itself and/or to have a male and female toilet with suitable facilities to change. Too many times there is either no facility or it is just in the women's.",
