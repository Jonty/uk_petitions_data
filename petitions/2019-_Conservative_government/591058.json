        "additional_details": "We need to be following the science, many countries around the world are allowing us to enter if you are vaccinated or can prove natural immunity from previous infection. The human body creates fantastic immunity as has been shown in various studies. We should be giving credit to those that are contributing to herd immunity by having already gone through COVID-19 without forcing these people to receive two doses of the vaccine in addition to this.",
        "background": "Given that numerous studies have proven those that have had a prior infection with COVID-19 have strong natural immunity, the government is still discriminating against those that have not/cannot receive vaccination. For example to isolate coming back from an amber list country.",
