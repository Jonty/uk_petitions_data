        "additional_details": "Although the DfT claim to have informed the public and road users about the changes made in January 2022, many drivers still ignore the rules. I have recently observed a blind-registered woman using a white stick, who while attempting to cross a busy uncontrolled junction, was ignored by several drivers. And many pedestrians wait until the road is clear of traffic before they cross, which defeats the concept of hierarchy.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to launch a public awareness campaign about the hierarchy of road users and specifically the rights of pedestrians over other road users. These rules are not new but were amended in January 2022.  We would like the campaign to include television advertising.",
