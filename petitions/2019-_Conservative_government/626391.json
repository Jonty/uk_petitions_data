        "action": "Form a coalition National Government to see the UK through the current crisis.",
        "additional_details": "A National Government worked well in the Second World War and led to  key legislation that improved everyone's lives. While we are not quite at war, it could be argued that the situation in Ukraine, recovery from the Pandemic and the crisis in the economy justify this decisive action, which might restore the general public's faith in democracy while giving the UK the best chance of working towards recovery. A General Election would take place when it is due.",
        "background": "Rather than holding another divisive leadership election, or a General Election, the Government should invite the Opposition to join forces with them and put aside party politics and self interest. There are excellent MPs on both sides of the House who could serve the country best by coming together",
