        "additional_details": "The Pension Triple Lock has caused the state pension to rise by 15% more than inflation & average earnings.  In 2021, due to pandemic-related wage anomalies, an 8% pension rise will cost \u00a34bn (according to the NIESR). During the pandemic children have suffered emotionally and educationally. Many families have endured greatly reduced incomes whilst pensions have risen. Government advisers recommended a \u00a315bn catch-up fund. Government put forward \u00a31bn (just \u00a350 per pupil). More is needed!",
        "background": "Huge sacrifices made by children during the pandemic have been principally for the benefit of the elderly. It\u2019s time to redress the balance. If Mr Sunak can find an extra \u00a34 billion to fund a pension increase, he should instead give it to those who need it most by investing in children's education.",
