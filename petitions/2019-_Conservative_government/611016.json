        "additional_details": "While the Prime Minister expressed his commitment to the sanctions imposed on Russia after the invasion of Ukraine, he did not explicitly address the real \"treasure chest\" of Putin's associates: the UK's tax heavens. As far as 2018, these jurisdictions hold \u00a334 billion of money linked to Russian oligarchs (Global Witness 29/04/2018). If the government genuinely wants to commit to a global package of sanctions, we believe that a swift crackdown on tax havens is a moral and pragmatic imperative.",
        "background": "British tax havens are overtly behind 29% of global tax abuse (Reuters 07/07/2021). As if it was not a scandal already, after the global response to the invasion of Ukraine, a decisive blow on Russian finances can only happen if the UK will shut down these tax havens once and for all.",
