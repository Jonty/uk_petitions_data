        "action": "Ensure that all universities return to full in-person teaching from September.",
        "additional_details": "The govt has provided guidance to universities detailing that in-person teaching can resume from 17th May, this is being completely ignored. As such it is right that govt now intervenes to protect the interests of students and ensure we are getting an education worthy of the \u00a31000s paid in tuition fees. COVID cannot be used as a permanent excuse in the education sector when the rest of the country is re-opening. Sign this petition for a return to normality!",
        "background": "In-person teaching was permitted to resume on the Step 3 easing of lockdown, despite this many universities (including my own) have still decided to return to \u201cblended learning\u201d despite the high likelihood that all COVID restrictions will be gone by Sept. The logic here is completely flawed!",
