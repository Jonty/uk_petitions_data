It feels like the Falklands war is almost a forgotten war and that holding national event would offer true recognition to those who took part and a reminder to the nation of what was achieved.\r\nPortsmouth which was the embarkation and departure point for many of those who served on the task force would in my opinion be a fitting location for a this.",
