You, the Government, are fully aware of the energy crisis, as I am, from personal experience as a one person household. I have faced debt collection for small energy debts due to crisis (\u00a3200) first hand, which should not be happening!

The devastating impact of impossibly high energy bills will drive people to suicide. It is stressful enough to face such increased costs but to face proceedings-unacceptable!",
