        "additional_details": "We believe that the current use by many schools of Systematic, Synthetic Phonics (SSP) teaching programmes does not meet the need of all students, and in particular those with dyslexia.\r\n \r\nOnset-rime, syllable and rhythm based instructional approaches taught alongside phonics, could help enable those with reading difficulties to learn to read. Poor reading prevents children accessing the school curriculum and has a lifelong impact, significantly narrowing future work and life choices.",
        "background": "The Government should review guidance and funding arrangements for teaching reading, which currently focus on Systematic, Synthetic Phonics (SSP) teaching programmes. We believe teachers should be supported to teach a structured, cumulative and multi sensory approach and a range of strategies.",
