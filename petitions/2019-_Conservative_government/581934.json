        "additional_details": "During the banking crisis of 2008 which was the result of careless and reckless management on the bankers part, the government bailed the banks out with millions if not billions of pounds of taxpayers money. Fast forward to 2020/2021 in the middle of the Covid-19 with many taxpayers on Furlough, the banks are refusing mortgages for genuine hard working taxpayers because they refuse to accept the Furlough scheme as a form of income. This is immensely unfair and needs to be addressed.",
        "background": "Look at ways the banking sector can have assurances from the government that lending money for mortgages to taxpayers currenrly on or have been on Furlough will not be seen as a high risk.\r\nThis is potential crisis that will leave millions of taxpayers stuck on higher rate mortgages.",
