        "additional_details": "This campaign could help ensure pregnant women are made more aware of postpartum complications and how they can minimise risks. At present, women often lack rehabilitative education as midwives do not always discuss these risks. Prolapse and diastasis recti are serious issues which can require specialist support and rehabilitation, and this should be offered to all women after childbirth. Too many women are suffering due to little knowledge or advice being given on the risks of pelvic floor conditions.",
