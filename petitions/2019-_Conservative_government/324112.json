        "action": "Reform the Ethnocentric National Curriculum",
        "additional_details": "Reforming the Ethnocentric Curriculum is about encouraging pupils to become better-informed citizens and reducing ignorance surrounding racism and privilege, by giving them an education that helps them do so. Pupils in the UK will spend 16 years in mandatory education. The education system needs to reflect the current composition of Britain by amplifying parts of history that are often ignored and reducing overdone history. Pupils should come out of school truly aware of social inequality.",
        "background": "The Department for Education needs to drastically reform the National Curriculum to reflect the current social makeup of Britain. This means mandatory teaching of sociology at school, more diverse English text studied, multicultural music lessons, greater emphasis on BAME history and more.",
