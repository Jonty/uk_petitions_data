However, the NHS will not provide genetic testing on demand, forcing people to have counselling prior to testing, even then maybe denying a test to people whom they feel are not robust enough to cope with knowing they carry they gene.",
        "background": "I would like to see the NHS develop and implement a contact tracing service for HD, enabling people to have genetic testing and plan their futures with all the information they need. This could lead to HD being wiped out within a generation.",
