        "additional_details": "This generation of students has had unprecedented disruption to their education with CV-19, school closures, missed exams and now it continues with teacher disputes compounding what is now a desperate situation for many.\r\nStudents now leave education with thousands of pounds worth of debt for university education they are not receiving. This is patently unfair and is hitting young people who cannot afford this impasse to continue.\r\nLegislation is required to force universities to pay refunds.",
        "background": "University students are not getting value for money from their tuition fees. If this were any other service, there are statutory protections in place that require refunds. The government needs to either resolve the dispute with lecturers or force universities to refund students their tuition fees.",
