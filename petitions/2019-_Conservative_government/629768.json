        "additional_details": "My mum has been living in the UK for over 16 years. For the past few years, she has been struggling to pass her B1 test having failed it 4 times. I have been born and raised here. My mum has had no education back home whatsoever so she could not even read or write in our native language let alone having to try learning to read and write in English. My mum attends classes for English where she has been assessed to maybe dyslexic.",
