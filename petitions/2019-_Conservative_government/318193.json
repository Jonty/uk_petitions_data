        "additional_details": "This would allow each nation to be equal, where currently Scotland has better devolution deal compared to GB nations, stops  England being run by UK government as it would have its own.\r\n\r\nIf devolution was equal, each of the 4 nations will be the same, UK government would then have the focus on whole UK issues and take control of all four nations and led in times of crisis so when we have things like daily number 10 briefing going forward - it applies to everyone.",
        "background": "Current corona crisis has shown how devolution doesn\u2019t work in current form. Daily briefings from UK government are mainly relating to England when we are looking to UK government for a UK response.\r\nall 4 nations need to have parliaments with equal powers, UK gov then runs UK  wide issues.",
