        "additional_details": "Many sellers are using pets as cash cows, mistreating animals in order to make profit. Many pets are being sold from places like 'Puppy Farms', where the animals are forced to breed for purchase of their offspring. \r\nThis would reduce the number of animal cruelty incidents and the easy purchase of animals that are later discarded by owners who no longer want their pets, therefore also reducing the number of pets in shelters.",
        "background": "Private sale of pets should only be permitted by permit holders. If you wish to buy a pet (like a puppy for example), you can only buy from permitted sellers. If the permitted seller is found to be mistreating animals then the permit will be revoked.",
