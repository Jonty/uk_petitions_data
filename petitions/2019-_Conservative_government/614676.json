Does that mean we should not be present while we figure it out?\r\n\r\nParental inconsistency can be detrimental to a child\u2019s development especially in the early years of life. This is being forced upon my baby and others because of fathers who are NOT absent by choice but due to UK regulation. These rules can potentially break up families. This should never happen to anyone. It is discriminatory. This is time we will NEVER get back.",
