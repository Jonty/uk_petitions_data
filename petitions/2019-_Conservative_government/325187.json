Horses are easily scared, the slightest incident can make a horse petrified.\r\n\r\nHorses do receive some 'Amour', they wear plastic eye shields, leg armour and nose guards. But this doesn\u2019t compete with some things being thrown at them.\r\n\r\nThe only way we can be sure that horses and riders are not injured during protests and riots; is to exclude them from current and future Police Methods of riot control.",
