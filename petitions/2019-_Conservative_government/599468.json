        "additional_details": "Full time workers must be able to access GP appointments, but in its current state, this is all but impossible. How are people supposed to plan around their work if it not only takes up to hundreds of attempts to even contact a GP surgery, let alone actually get an appointment. Not only this, but people with disabilities often need regular, consistent contact with their GP. Please discuss implementing this system again. People should not be forced to choose between their pay and their health.",
        "background": "It's become increasingly difficult to access an appointment with a GP at all, especially those who work full time. On the day appointments are useless as full time workers cannot afford to take days off work to then be told there are no appointments that day, or not be given a time the GP will call.",
