        "additional_details": "It would be unfair to base our GCSE grades on exams we do not know half the required knowledge for. We have been off of school for months and some of our living conditions make it extremely hard to do online working. As last year had around 2-3 months off and exams got cancelled I believe it would simply be unfair and absurd to force these exams on us. Really take into account the wellbeing of the teachers and students and the stress and mental damage caused by covid-19 and school exams.",
        "background": "I want the Government to allow grades to be assessed by the work and effort everyone has put it over the year and year 10. Really take into account the wellbeing of the teachers and students and the stress caused by corona and school exams.",
