        "additional_details": "Closing the test centre is a disaster for learner drivers of High Wycombe.  At the moment (unless the DVSA come up with a different plan) candidates will have to travel to Slough, Aylesbury or Uxbridge test  centres meaning longer lessons, more travelling time and potentially longer waits as more people will be looking for slots - basically significantly more cost to pupils lesson prices will also have to be increased significantly to cover travel costs",
        "background": "We would like to keep the Driving test centre in High Wycombe. It has been based in High Wycombe for decades. The DVSA are closing it down 12th March 2021\r\nAs a result \r\nLesson prices could potentially increase in High Wycombe due to travelling time & fuel",
