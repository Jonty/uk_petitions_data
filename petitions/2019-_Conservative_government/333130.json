Individual local authorities are responsible for the provision of public toilets, and the Government has not required these to be closed at any point during the outbreak.\r\n\r\nOn 28 June Government ministers wrote to councils thanking those that had kept toilets open during the pandemic, and urging those that have closed them to refer to advice on measures that can be taken to open toilets in a safe way: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/896040/Joint_letter_Simon_Clarke_MP_and_Rebecca_Pow_MP.pdf\r\n\r\nIf your local authority has not reopened public toilets in your area, you should contact them directly about this."
