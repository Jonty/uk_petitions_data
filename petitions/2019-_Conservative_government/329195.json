        "additional_details": "Create a task force to  better standards, make them enforceable, introduce a license scheme. Better control of training courses and stop those making quick money over safety.\r\nWe want clients protected and confident they are in safe hands.\r\nRegulating the industry allows the professionals to grow and flourish this already profitable industry. \r\nTo recognise the risks involved, listen to the experts and act.\r\nReduce the number of insurance claims made and lives ruined by cleaning up the industry",
        "background": "The beauty industry is a multi-billion-pound industry and comes with lots of risks and yet its completely unregulated. In fact, you don\u2019t legally need a qualification or insurance and anyone can start doing treatments with no training.\r\nWe want the government to step in and regulate the industry",
