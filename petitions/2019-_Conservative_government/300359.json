        "additional_details": "There is a moral duty and obligation for cps and police to provide counselling to victims and protect their rights to do so without fear their actions may affect their trial or the outcome of it.\r\n \r\nMy brother Declan was raped by an adult man as a minor by a (later convicted) paedophile. Before the trial my mum begged CPS, Police & Local Authority to provide support for her children who were traumatised but she was advised this would compromise the trial via contamination of court evidence. Despite her repeated cries for help my brother took his own life aged 13. His death could have been prevented & this still happens now. \"Declan's Law\" would ensure future CSA victims get the support they deserve",
        "background": "To ensure the Police and Crown Prosecution Service provide all victims of child sexual abuse with counselling & support before during & after trial. This is in gov legislation but the CPS & Police still advise victims to the contrary in order to avoid contamination of evidence. This needs to end.",
