However, it is now considered obsolete in light of constitutional changes and developments in how Parliament scrutinises Ministers. See:\r\nhttps://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7612/. It is therefore not clear what action you want the Government to take.\r\n\r\nIn any case, impeachment of a Minister or Prime Minister would be a matter for Parliament, and not an action that could be started by public petition. We can't accept petitions about honours or appointments, which includes calling for Ministers or MPs to be sacked, resign, or to be subject to a recall vote or a vote of no confidence.\r\n\r\nYou may wish to sign this petition which calls for a related action: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/548400."
