        "additional_details": "I myself am a Semi Permanent Makeup artist and having worked in this industry, know how incredibly sterile our environments are. Even before Covid-19 we would sanitise our work stations before and after each client, wear face masks to prevent breathing in airborne blood spores, disposable gloves and disposable aprons. As well as using equipment that is either single use or protected with barrier tape and then sterilised after. \r\n\r\nI feel that we\u2019re in a better position than hair salons to protect ourselves and our clients against infection and therefore should be put in the same category as them.",
