        "additional_details": "Education is a right not a privilege, with academies setting their own admission policies and being able to take pupils from outside of their catchment areas, this is leading to a reduced number of school places for local pupils, this means that pupils are having to travel greater distances leading to greater environmental and financial impact. local councils are taking money from developers for infrastructure but do not seem to be providing any improvements",
        "background": "After moving across our Borough, we have been unable to secure a year 8 school place for our son. The two local secondary schools are academies that deal with their own admissions, this has meant that the nearest school for our son is 10 miles away, due to SEND our son can not make this journey",
