Most of my working days include sleep nights as a live in, you are there 24h, and my employer is deducting accommodation offset from my wage, but that money doesn't go towards my expenses in the client's house or in any benefit of my job, it goes into their pockets, and its thousands a year, just because they can. The property is privately owned so I don't see why my employer should charge money for a place they don't own!",
