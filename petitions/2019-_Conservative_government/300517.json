        "additional_details": "The lessons from China, South Korea, Italy and even Germany as well as France suggested a reactive approach will not work and a proactive approach is needed. Given all of the facts and examples in other countries, reducing the public crowd such as public transport is one of the most effective ways. So requiring people to work from home could help delay the major breakout. Technology companies in the big cities will be the best ones at the first stage.",
        "background": "Coronavirus has been spreading in the UK with evidence of community infection. To delay the massive infection, government could ask people who can do the job remotely to work from home as early as possible. It could start from the technology companies in the big cities such as London and Birmingham.",
