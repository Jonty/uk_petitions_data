        "additional_details": "One in four students in the UK suffer from poor mental health due to school. Students will struggle due to the immense pressure put on memorisation in these GCSE exams. A large amount of what you memorise for the exam will be forgotten. This is mainly due to students having to memorise information for many exams and having to make room for more information as they go along. It must be important to the UK government to have a good education system while still upholding the mental health of its students.",
        "background": "Currently the English GCSE exams focus on the memorisation of quotes from the text in question. I believe it would be better to include texts needed for the question and instead focus the exam on the analysis of these quotations. Students will get stressed over the exams just because of the quotes.",
