Once licences are obtained and a dog adopted/purchased a smart tag/chip has to be fitted to every dog which is linked to the licence database and any dog seen out without a smart tag/chip can be seized. Police are issued with a standard scanner which is attached to their Police issued mobiles\r\nThis will stop irresponsible owners from moving to another breed. We have to stop the problem from its core.",

The bull breed are being targeted and not the owners. Introduce licences like firearms, driving licences. We need to target the route problem; owners!",
