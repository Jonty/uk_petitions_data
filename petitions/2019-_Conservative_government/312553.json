        "additional_details": "More and more people are remaining at home to help 'flatten the curve' of the COVID19 outbreak. This means there is an increase in the use of basic utilities (Gas/Electric/Water) in many households. A lot of people on ESA/PIP already struggle to pay these bills. Food prices have increased and those with limited mobility are having to buy from more expensive local shops if they can't get to a supermarket or get a delivery slot. They deserve the same financial help as those on UC.",
        "background": "The Government has decided to increase Universal Credit payments by \u00a320 a week to help with the increased costs people are facing due to the Coronovirus. Many people are on ESA/PIP and deserve the same financial support during this time. These especially vulnerable citizens are being forgotten.",
