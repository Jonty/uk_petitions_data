        "additional_details": "Currently neuro-divergent people are often perceived to be under the influence, or assumed to be acting suspiciously. People who are neuro-divergent may also misunderstand directions from police officers or other people in authority, and can be at a greater risk of being injured or taken into custody.\r\n \r\nCurrently lanyards and cards are available, but not through a Government scheme. We believe an official Government scheme could help ensure better treatment for people with hidden disabilities.",
        "background": "The Government should create a national scheme that provides a free card to people with a diagnosed hidden disability (such as autism or cognitive impairment), so this can be presented to help people understand that they have a hidden disability.",
