        "additional_details": "In 2020, all international students paid the whole fee for the year. Many students were unable to travel to the UK. Those who travelled were falsely promised a blended learning approach. Instead they received a whole year of online learning. Students are annually paying over \u00a318,000 for using zoom/ Microsoft Teams. We want the government to help students with the financial burden as we students cant afford to pay for hotel quarantine. We request the government to exempt students.",
        "background": "There has been no support from the government or the university for  International students who are paying more than \u00a318,000 annually. Lack of support has caused a great deal of mental stress. Students should be exempted from hotel quarantine or government/university takes the burden of the cost.",
