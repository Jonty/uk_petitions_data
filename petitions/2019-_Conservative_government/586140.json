        "background": "Extend to 16 & 17 years old the right to be vaccinated by 31 July 2021, same as priority group 10. The Pfizer vaccine is already approved for these ages and would prevent asymptomatic viral spread+ rise of  variants in these sociable teens+ reduce the risk of infection-related harm in this cohort.",
