        "additional_details": "More should be done by ALL Energy Companies to lower prices for Everyone, People are struggling to make ends meet, having lost jobs, being furloughed, and the self employed being affected by the lockdown, People on Universal Credit. \r\nIt seems that they Energy Companies are just one of the many businesses set to gain from this, so should be made by law to give a 5 or 10% or more reduction on all energy prices instead of just sitting back & profiteering from the lockdown which is affecting us ALL",
        "background": "As we are all being told to stay at home, and work from home, everyone will be using more energy, but lots of people have lost jobs, being furloughed, and trying to scrape by on benefits, The Government should force ALL energy companies to help, as it seems they are only interested in profits",
