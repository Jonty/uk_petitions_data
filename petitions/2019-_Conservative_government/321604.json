I think it is only right that they recognise that some people have not had that choice and unfortunately, some people have lost their lives. The NHS staff have had below inflation pay rises for the past decade and I believe to recognise the outstanding work they have performed during this very challenging time they should have some sort of bonus, after all the public are on their steps every Thursday supporting them.",
