        "additional_details": "The retirement age is continually being reviewed adjusted so nobody spends more than a third of their adult life in retirement. This is unfair on those who have spent most of their working life doing shift work. These people will spend much less than a third of their life in retirement as a result. The risk of heart disease, cancers and other illnesses which are all increased from shift work would be reduced if shift workers could retire earlier putting less strain on the NHS.",
        "background": "Shift workers have a lower life expectancy than non shift workers. In the light of fairness the pensionable age should be reduced to reflect this.",
