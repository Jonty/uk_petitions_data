Consequently resulting in many Universities closing for the remaining academic year.\r\n\r\nWhy should students have to acquire debt from our final accommodation fee, when many of us no longer live their under guidance from our University.\r\n\r\nWe pay for this from loans, personal savings and with help from our parents. Making us and those who help us financially vulnerable. \r\n\r\nWould you let \u00a32000 get lost in the system? \r\n\r\nStudents need support too.",
        "background": "Students have ALREADY faced a lack of reliability from Universities whilst lecturers went on strike.\r\n\r\nWe are aware that Universities are doing all they can to protect us, but they could be doing more to help us.\r\n\r\nCovid-19, is infecting the nation at speed..",
