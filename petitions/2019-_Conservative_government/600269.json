        "action": "Ban the sale of fireworks to the general public",
        "additional_details": "The rationale behind this appeal is that year after year, there are many serious injuries and some deaths directly relating to fireworks. In 2020, around 15,600 injuries were caused as a direct result of fireworks. This number has grew exponentially from 2019\u2019s total of approximately 10,000. Fireworks events, like the famous 5th of November \u2018bonfire nights\u2019 organised by trained professionals significantly reduces the risk of people getting injured whilst also taking the strain off of our NHS.",
        "background": "The Government needs to introduce new legislation to stop the sale of fireworks and products associated to them to the general public and reserve these trades only for organised events that have appropriate training in the correct operation of these said products.",
