        "additional_details": "The current system disadvantages families where one parent earns over \u00a350,000 and the other earns less or even \u00a30. Families who have one parent as a stay at home parent receive nothing whereas families with two parents earning \u00a349,000 each, are still eligible. Children whose household income is much more, are receiving benefits compared to families whose joint income is much less. This only perpetuates the income gap when children whose household income is more can save money for the future and receive a lump sum of child benefit when they are adults, which is what lots of families do with the money.",
