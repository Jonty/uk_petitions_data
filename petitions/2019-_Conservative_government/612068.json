        "additional_details": "We believe this isn't fair or equitable, so call on the Government to provide free bus passes to all those who are over 60 years old. \r\n\r\nProviding these passes from 60 years old could also be better for the environment as it would encourage more people to use public transport, which could reduce car use.\r\n \r\nI also wanted to let you know that this would only apply to England as this issue is somewhat devolved and the local authorities in Scotland and Wales would be free to change the age at which you can apply for a bus pass.",
        "background": "Currently, people living in London, Wales and Scotland can obtain a free bus pass at 60 years old, however in the rest of England, you can only obtain one when you are of pension age. ",
