It currently brings a typical household energy bill in Great Britain for dual-fuel gas and electricity down to around \u00a32,500 per year, and in Northern Ireland to around \u00a31,950 per year. You can find out more about this guarantee here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/energy-bills-support/energy-bills-support-factsheet-8-september-2022\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling on the Government to increase support through the Energy Price Guarantee, but it would need to be clear how much you wanted this support to be increased by.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petition, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nSubsidise energy and fuel prices to mitigate cost increases: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/622530"
