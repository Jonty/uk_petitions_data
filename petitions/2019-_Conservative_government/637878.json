        "action": "Refund the South Korean state pension if British citizens return to the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Currently, the state pension in South Korea is only paid to British citizens who have made contributions for ten or more years, and is only paid when the state pension age is reached. This means many British citizens are paying towards a pension that they will never receive. This does not apply to citizens of 46 other countries, who are all eligible to reclaim the pension, many of whom regardless of their insured working period in Korea.",
        "background": "Reach an agreement on lump-sum refunds to British citizens upon leaving South Korea. Or, create a reciprocity agreement regarding South Korean pensions, so that any contributions made within the first ten years of working in Korea can be reclaimed by British citizens at a later date.",
