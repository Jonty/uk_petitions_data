        "additional_details": "The general public have gone outside to honour key workers at 8pm on a Thursday evening for ten weeks.  This has now ceased.  This new award would make the key workers proud to have served on the front line and can be kept and worn to indicate their bravery (similar to medals worn on Remembrance Sunday).  This would be a permanent memento for the people involved and for their relatives to recall their efforts in future years",
        "background": "Devise a medal, similar to a General Service Medal for all hospital staff playing a role from the start of the virus until it is overcome.  As well as doctors and nurses, this would include catering staff, cleaners, porters and anyone who was involved in front line work, including posthumous awards",
