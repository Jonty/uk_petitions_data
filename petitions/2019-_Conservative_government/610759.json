        "action": "Licence requirement for late night businesses to be trained in spiking awareness",
        "additional_details": "Currently no responsibility for late night businesses to ensure spiking victims are a) recognised or b) helped appropriately, placing victims in even greater danger. A close friend in desperate need of help was ejected from the spiking venue by door staff who believed she was drunk. Evidence on the scale of this problem has already been given to the Home Affairs Committee, but ensuing action from this report may take much longer than is needed to assist victims right now.",
        "background": "Pass legislation requiring spiking awareness/assistance training as a mandatory part of licence agreement. This includes a) how to identify victims of spiking and b) ensure victims can access appropriate care and/or safety. This would apply to bar/door staff, taxi/bus drivers, fast food outlets.",
