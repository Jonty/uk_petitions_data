        "additional_details": "Funeral processions are a time of mourning and reflection, and the sound of sirens can be a jarring interruption to this solemn occasion. It is important that we show respect for those who are grieving and allow them to mourn in peace. \r\n \r\nThe sound of sirens can also trigger traumatic memories, particularly for people who have experienced trauma related to emergency services. By stopping the use of sirens during funeral processions, we can help reduce the chances of PTSD and related disorders.\r\n",
        "background": "I would like to urge government to implement a policy that requires emergency service vehicles to switch off their sirens when passing a funeral procession on the road. This gesture of respect could help maintain the opinion of our emergency services in the public eye and help reduce cases of PTSD.",
