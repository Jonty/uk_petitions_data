        "action": "Release HMP prisoners waiting for trial due to Covid-19 temporary release, tag.",
        "additional_details": "As the Covid-19 has globally affected everyone it has also affected the prisoners. They are also humans with rights. All visits are cancelled as both the staff and prisoners are under risk, courts are closed therefore prisoners waiting for trials do not even know how much longer the dates will be moved. We will like this petition to go ahead for the well-being of both prisoners and prison staff as they are both under high risk. Once in the prison the virus is likely to spread very quickly.",
        "background": "We understand restrictions must be imposed so maybe people who have been waiting for a trial for a long time and having to wait longer due to the Covid-19 maybe released on until their date of trial.",
