        "additional_details": "The Femicide Census reports that across the UK on average a woman is killed by a man every 3 days. If these women had been provided with basic self-defence training perhaps their lives could have been saved. \r\nAccording to Rape Crisis in the year to the end of March 2017, 20% of women and 4% of men have experienced some type of sexual assault since the age of 16, equivalent to 3.4 million female and 631,000 male victims. How many of these attacks could have been prevented? Change needs to happen.",
        "background": "We should all feel safe on our streets and equipping people with the tools to protect themselves is a valuable lesson our children should be taught. The introduction of self-defence classes within the Physical Education curriculum to Year 6 and all Secondary school pupils could save lives.",
