It has to stop!\r\nDeal with those here, ideally with repatriation, and terminate all accommodation contracts. Our capacity is whatever our migrant facilities can handle, it ends there.",

No more hotels, no ex-military bases, no more housing.\r\nThe Home Office must deal with those already here and block any further migration until the backlog is cleared and current accommodation is emptied.",
