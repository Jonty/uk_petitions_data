        "additional_details": "This could raise the UK productivity as people can go to destinations quicker and therefore reducing the risk of an accident. There is alot of tailgating caused by slow moving vehicles raising peoples stress levels and increasing the risk of an accident  which is why there are more road deaths which some could have been better prevented. This is a fast moving environment with days getting more busy so the speed limit needs to be raised to meet the demands of ever fast changing world we live in.",
        "background": "I want the speed limit to raise to 80 mph on the specified types of roads mentioned, because this will improve road safety, because at the moment there are too many people tailgating each other so therefore raising the speed limit could make people drive more smoothly with less tailgating.",
