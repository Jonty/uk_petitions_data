        "action": "Review exchange of designated country driving licences for 5+ year residents",
        "additional_details": "Currently, drivers from designated countries can only exchange them up to 5 years after becoming residents in the UK. Unfortunately, many UK residents with valid non-UK driving licences have been trapped and discriminated against due to the fact that they didn't have an opportunity to exchange their licence before their country has become a designated, and are still unable to do it after it has become designated because they have been the residents for over five years.",
        "background": "The Government should abolish the requirement for residents to exchange a driving licence within 5 years or adjust the rule so it counts from the moment a particular country is designated, to give equal rights to all UK residents who might want to exchange a driving licence.",
