However Primary schools were given an option of whether they wanted to teach children about FGM or not. Despite awareness being raised to older students, most girls at risk of being cut are below secondary school age. Thus, it's necessary to raise awareness in primary schools as well as secondary. This should make children feel comfortable enough to open up about their stories if they ever faced or may face FGM.",
