        "additional_details": "The UK is lagging behind many EU countries with a donation rate less than half of Spain. 1000s of children & adults in the UK die due to lack of donor organs. Many grieving relatives stop donation. If families don\u2019t know their loved one\u2019s wish to donate then the majority block the donation. The Gov. needs to offer people more chances to register their decision on the NHS Organ Donor Register & encourage them to TALK TO THEIR FAMILY. Anyone can need a transplant. It could be you, or a loved one.",
        "background": "Give people the opportunity to register or reconfirm their organ donation decision on all government forms. Add the question \u2018Do you want relatives to be able to overrule your decision Yes/No? Grieving families often refuse consent, particularly if they do not know the decision of their loved one.",
