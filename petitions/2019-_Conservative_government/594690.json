        "additional_details": "Under current advice over 30 million would be offered a third jab, when hundreds of millions of vulnerable people around the world have not had their first dose. Currently, only just over 1% of people in low-income countries are vaccinated compared to more than half in high-income. Furthermore, the WHO have stated that \"the evidence remains limited and inconclusive on any widespread need for booster doses\". Therefore, it is a moral failure for the UK to be administering third doses so widely at this time.",
        "background": "The proposed booster programme should be limited, and a third jab only given where there is strong scientific evidence. Instead of hoarding limited vaccine supplies and thus worsening the already gross vaccine inequality, we should let supply reach poorer nations with low vaccination rates.",
