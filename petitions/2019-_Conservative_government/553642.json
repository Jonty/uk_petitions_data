The full state pension is currently \u00a3175.20 a week, or around \u00a39,100 a year, and is a crucial source of income for many retirees.\r\n \r\nPeople who want to draw their pension earlier than 66, provided they have paid the necessary national insurance contributions, should be able to so from the age of 63, with their pension reduced for every year early it\u2019s taken. People who are happy to delay taking their state pension would receive the full amount.\r\n \r\nThis would mean that people who have paid into private pensions could retire earlier, freeing up employment opportunities for younger people.",
