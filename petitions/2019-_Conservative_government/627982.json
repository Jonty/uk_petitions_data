        "additional_details": "The government must protect the rights of its citizens. Changing the equality act in this manner seems only to undermine this duty to protect. Transgender individuals have dealt with hatred from others, hate crime and gender dysphoria however the equality act gives them both legal ground and reduces this dysphoria. To change the act in any way would remove both of these things and that cannot be allowed to go ahead.",
        "background": "It has been reported that the government may change the Equality Act. \u201cSex\u201d is to mean biological sex, not gender. Doing so would unacceptably reduce the legal rights of transgender individuals and forces their biological sex to be their gender identity . This change cannot go ahead.",
