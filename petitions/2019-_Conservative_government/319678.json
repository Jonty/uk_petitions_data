        "additional_details": "About 0.6% of the population live in care homes, but they account for 50% of covid 19 deaths. As the deaths slow, in care homes they are accelerating.\r\nCurrent policy is based on freeing up hospital beds for younger people.  But thousands of beds are available in hospitals and nightingale hospitals. Meanwhile, the policy means that the virus is being 'seeded' into many care homes, costing the lives of 1000s of vulnerable elders.\r\nPolicy must allow them to stay in hospital and prevent these deaths.",
        "background": "Government policy currently dictates that elderly hospital patients who have covid 19 must be discharged from hospital into care homes, massively increasing the spread of the virus amongst this most vulnerable group.  This must stop! Care home residents are dying in their thousands...",
