I do not want the hassle of recharging an electric or hybrid car once every few hundred miles There is also nowhere near enough charging points in the UK for electric and hybrid cars and still will not be even by 2040 as well.  Petrol and Diesel cars are far more practical and easier, cheaper and more convienient to mantain as well.",
