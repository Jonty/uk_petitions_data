        "additional_details": "Mesh rectopexy is currently still being implanted and in some cases causing catastrophic complications to patients who have this type of implant. Due to limited data there is little documented in regards to auditing of patients post-op recovery. Therefore little is know about the true extent of the wellbeing of patients. Also with this implant seen to cause bowel and bladder damage, nerve entrapment among other chronic ailments we are questioning the safety of its use as a permanent implant.",
