        "additional_details": "Too many international students face a problem with the graduate visa if they don\u2019t receive their final degree result before their student visa has expired. This is a big challenge for international student as they can\u2019t apply for graduate visa even though they completed their course but need to wait for the exam board. The government needs to understand that the visa duration can\u2019t cover all circumstances and universities have their own plans for exam board and meetings that don\u2019t always work for students.",
        "background": "The Government should allow international students to apply for a graduate visa without having their final results, as long as their university is able to confirm they will graduate. This would help international students to obtain their graduate visa before their student visa expires.",
