        "additional_details": "On average, the races are a pleasurable experience. Yet, York residents and businesses have to endure some of the worst aggression, violence and anti-social behaviour during what should be a nice day. Alcohol fuels unwarranted demeanours & for many who travel to York for them, they are usually intoxicated or slightly drunk and this causes chaos for residents, businesses, security and the police. Limiting the amount of alcohol that can be sold on the way to the racecourse needs to be imposed.",
        "background": "Although seeing the frolics that many have during the races in York is a sight that one admires, there are many amongst those who enter the city already inebriated and cause havoc and anti-social behaviour. I want the government to limit the amount of alcohol that can be sold to these individuals.",
