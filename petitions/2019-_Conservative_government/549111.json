        "additional_details": "It is unfair to ask students to pay the full tuition price, when the majority of facilities will not be available in the ways they were before. Therefore, students will struggle to use resources such as the library. Also, students are not receiving the type of teaching they would have been paying the full price for, therefore, what would us students actually be putting all of that money into?",
