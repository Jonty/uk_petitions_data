        "additional_details": "The Government must instigate a programme of financial support for those who will be seriously impacted financially by job losses and business closures. \r\nSupport should be provided in terms of direct financial aid so those affected can pay their rent and bills whilst being able to feed their families.\r\nThis can be in conjunction with the private sector to freeze critical bills and rent where possible but direct government financial assistance is required in this moment of crisis.",
        "background": "The situation is dire with workers in many sectors from hospitality to travel already being released. \r\nMany, including those on zero hour contracts will struggle to pay rent and bills so need financial support to get through this period.\r\nLoans to businesses on their own do not help these citizens.",
