        "additional_details": "This is a very broad approach that does not take into account individual family circumstances.\r\n \r\nFor example, in our family in order for me to be able to work (we have children but no access to suitable childcare, even with the governments new proposals which do not come into affect properly for many years) it would mean my husband having to drastically reduce his availability/hours at work in a high paid job to enable me to work for NMW.\r\n \r\nWe would be worse off and actually have to rely on Universal Credit MORE to bridge the gap in loss of earnings. The couples AET needs to remain.\r\n",
        "background": "It was announced in the Spring 2023 Budget that the couples Administrative Earnings Threshold (AET) is set to be scrapped, meaning non-working or low earning members of a couple can be required to comply with work search or take up offers of work, or face sanctions.",
