        "additional_details": "We need an inquiry to investigate whether there is preferential treatment of White Nurses compared to Nurses of colour when suspicions of malpractice are raised. An inquiry must recommend stringent penalties for any identified race disparities and ensure CEOs and top management are held accountable, if these are found. We believe this would help to improve safety outcomes for service users and make healthcare services more equitable for all.",
        "background": "We believe that recent events at The Countess of Chester hospital have spotlighted the unequal treatment of Nurses of Colour compared to their White colleagues in similar situations. Unless stereotypes & bias are addressed, staff are treated differently & patients may be at risk of harm.",
