Family members who place their personal lives ahead of nation service will fail to earn the respect and affection of the British people and risks their personal activities becoming a source of deep political embarrassment to the country. The Monarchy isn't a soap opera nor should it ever be allowed to become one.",

This will ensure only those royal family members who have demonstrated true commitment to proudly serving the nation be allowed to sit on the Throne, thus preserving its dignity.",
