        "additional_details": "It is blinkered to see the Islamist threat solely as their rare attacks in the West. They are seeking, through terror at home, to reimpose their obsessional and misogynist oppression on millions who could otherwise be our friends in a dangerous world. Don\u2019t turn them into refugees.\r\nIt is na\u00efve to speak of \u2018compromise\u2019. Today we can support the legal government, tomorrow the alternative may be chaos.\r\nIf we refuse to abandon the women of Afghanistan, then France and America too may think again.",
        "background": "We have handed over the land battle to the Afghanis but, as the Taliban mount a conventional offensive, the support our aircraft carriers can provide could be critical. This is a fight for rights that women in the UK take for granted and that we all want our sisters and daughters to have.",
