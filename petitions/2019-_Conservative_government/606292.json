        "action": "Create a mandatory crash course in moral philosophy for all MPs.",
        "additional_details": "MPs have a duty of care to the public. Making a crash course in moral philosophy mandatory will create much needed confidence by the people towards parliament. Currently an MP does not need to understand morality in any formal/professional manner before being able to help decide what happens to the country in the House of Commons. Given the pandemic and brexit, the government must assure the UK they at least understand the moral implications of the actions they take.",
        "background": "All MPs must take a 2 month minimum crash course in moral philosophy taught by a professional(s) (PhD) before being able to debate and vote in the House of Commons from now onward. The syllabus will be a collaboration from multiple well respected UK Universities and there must be a closed book exam.",
