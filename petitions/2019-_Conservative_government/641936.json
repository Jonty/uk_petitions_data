Indeed, it is estimated that it could involve an eviction every 15 minutes. We believe that in these exceptional circumstances, Parliament should prioritise this Bill and allow it to become law by Autumn 2023. The Bill also should be amended so that it applies to all section 21 notices which have been issued but not executed at the time when the Bill is passed and becomes law.\"",
