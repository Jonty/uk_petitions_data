The Government should make the Covenant law, and create statutory requirements for the provision of services such as housing and mental health support for veterans.\r\nFar too many veterans have taken their own lives in recent years, and many have been ignored for housing because of the failure to implement legislation to protect the very people who gave up their lives to protect others. Actions is what we need, debates and promises will not be accepted any longer.\r\n",

This should place specific legal responsibilities on councils to help our community, and so open many doors that are currently being held closed.",
