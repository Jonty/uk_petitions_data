        "additional_details": "Many universities across the UK have told students to return home in light of the spread of COVID-19, unless they are unable to do so. As such, these students are currently faced with having to pay for a room for the third trimester of university, when most of them likely won't be staying there at all during that period. Furthermore, in many cases this will be paid for using student loan, which could be reduced this year instead, to free up government spending for other causes such as the NHS.",
