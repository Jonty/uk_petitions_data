        "additional_details": "Over the last two years my partner and I have been trying to conceive. We both have our own problems and we were told we were eligible for IVF. The CCG rejected our application due to my partner's BMI. The NHS is meant to be a universal health service but these decisions are restricting access to IVF across the country, which can have an adverse affect on mental health.",
        "background": "Many Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) are restricting access to IVF treatment on the basis of both the woman's and their partner's BMI. Using BMI is not a true measurement of health, and the Government should review access to IVF for people with a high BMI, to ensure fair access.",
