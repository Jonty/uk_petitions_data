        "additional_details": "There are reports of MPs taking holidays or otherwise choosing to be absent when the House is sitting. \r\nIf MPs are absent from their constituency and Parliament for 10 sitting days, we believe they are failing to provide their constituency with the representation the taxpayer is paying for. In this situation a recall petition should be opened so the constituency can decide whether to recall them.",
        "background": "A recall petition is opened if an MP is suspended from the Commons for ten sitting days, or certain convictions. However, there is no sanction for MPs who choose to be absent from constituency and Parliament while House sits. Constituencies should expect a minimum standard of service from their MP.",
