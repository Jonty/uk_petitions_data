        "additional_details": "My son and other pupils in year 9 and 10 at his school (and many other schools) deserve to still receive the GCSE grade that they have worked hard for.  Why should they be disadvantaged just because they are sitting the GCSE early, this is discrimination. OFQUAL said they can catch up but that is not true, pupils have decided other year 10 and 11 options and this will have a big impact on their future GCSEs as they will also not be allowed to sit the GCSE in Autumn 2020 you imagine.  They will have no lessons for many months to try to keep their learning up and in a subject like French or German you need to hear your French or German teacher speak.",
