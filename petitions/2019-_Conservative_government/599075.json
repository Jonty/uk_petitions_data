        "additional_details": "Over the last year we have seen some low performance from various ministers during the Pandemic as evidence by the recent cross Parliamentary report on Pandemic response. Both in Health, education, etc. For years successive governments have used league tables, public feedback and assessment in education, health and other public services. This gives rapid feedback looping into standards of care and performance which I believe the government and ministers could benefit from too.",
        "background": "I want the Government to set up a service for feedback from the public on government Ministers' performance with a corresponding league table so we can help to improve the government's policy-making and implementation. Preferably with a text service, (as per GP surgeries) and an online portal.",
