        "additional_details": "Millions furloughed due to Covid may soon be made redundant. Requiring companies publish diversity ratios through this process reduces risk that furlough retention decisions thoughtlessly lead to a major reduction in workplace diversity. There may be good reasons why companies rehire at differing diversity ratios than they furloughed, but requiring reporting of diversity ratios during this process will elevate awareness & reduce risk that workplace diversity suffers due to bias and disregard.",
        "background": "To ensure companies consider diversity impacts when deciding which furloughed workers to retain, the Treasury should require every company publish workforce diversity ratios (gender, racial, age...) overall prior to the furloughs, the diversity of those furloughed, and separately of those retained",
