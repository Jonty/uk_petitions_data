        "action": "Change the Government policy of GCSE and A-Level Examinations in 2021.",
        "additional_details": "With 78% of England's population now in Tier 4 and the Government decision to delay the reopening of schools in January, Years 11 and 13 have now lost a further week to their education.  This means that the three week delay to the examinations that was previously announced has now been effectively reduced to two weeks. Given that the other UK nations have decided to used teacher assessments for 2021, the current policy in England creates an unfair and unlevel United Kingdom playing field.",
        "background": "Align the educational assessment of England's Years 11 and 13 with the rest of the UK nations to ensure a fair and equitable approach to GCSEs and A-Levels in 2021 wherever you live in the United Kingdom.",
