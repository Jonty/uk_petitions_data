        "additional_details": "The group is very high risk of catching covid. Particularly those having immune suppressing treatment meaning they have no immunity to catching covid. Also due to covid, many people have to make multiple visits to hospitals as outpatients. The risk of being treated as an inpatient is far too dangerous. These outpatient visits themselves are risky and protection is needed. GP\u2019s agree but their hands are tied due to government guidelines of who gets vaccinated first.",
        "background": "To move the clinically vulnerable people into top group for covid vaccination especially those who have had their immune systems suppressed, making it very dangerous for them to catch covid, especially when there are multiple hospital visits involved.",
