        "additional_details": "The recent ban on XL bullies shows misplaced government focus in addressing dog-related incidents. Most attacks are caused by dogs bred by individuals exploiting them. Current laws require licensing only for breeding three or more litters annually or for dog sale businesses. These regulations are inadequate. Dog owner licenses should be renewed periodically. These reforms can address overpopulation and puppy farming, reducing aggression in dogs and enhancing community safety.",
        "background": "All dog breeding should require a license, home inspection, and mental health assessments to prevent misuse. Breeders should disclose puppy purchasers' identities, listed in a monitored database.",
