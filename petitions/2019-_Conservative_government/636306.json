        "additional_details": "females going through thier menstrual cycle or peri menopause alike isn't a choice,\r\n \r\nit's a natural acurance and it shouldn't be charged for. They are very expensive and a mother of three young girls who aren't working all going through this stage in this climate is a cost that I believe they shouldn't have to pay for. \r\n\r\nMany women would give anything not to have periods, it's a painful process and I dare say 100% of the cases sanitary is essential for mental and physical health.",
        "background": "For you to make sanitary items for example sanitary pads, tampons and liners free for women.\r\nCondoms are given out in youth centres and health clinics because it costs the NHS alot of money on free labour treatment.\r\nIt's unfair that women have to pay for a natural occurrence that isn't a choice.",
