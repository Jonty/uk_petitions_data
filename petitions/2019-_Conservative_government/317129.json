        "additional_details": "Leaving seafarers on board indefinitely is unsafe. Shipping is a dangerous business which requires crew to be alert, well rested and in a positive frame of mind. Indefinitely leaving crew on board is not sustainable or safe.\r\n\r\nA system of in-transit quarantine and health monitoring could be implemented to allow crew changes at designated ports and airports. Most crew on board have been effectively locked down in mobile quarantine in any case. The ICS is already pressing for this.",
        "background": "Crew changes for seafarers must be facilitated.\r\n\r\nThe UK depends every day on seafarers. They are now expected to work indefinitely as they cannot be relieved under the current restrictions.\r\n\r\nThis must be changed, for the safety of shipping and the well-being of seafarers and their families.",
