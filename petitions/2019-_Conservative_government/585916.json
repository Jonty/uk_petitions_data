        "additional_details": "Many A Level/GCSE students whose results were decided by CAGs have been unable to progress further in their education due to high resit costs. This has created a huge wealth divide in accessibility of further education. The approach to 2020 students\u2019 grades made university places difficult to secure. The option to resit in October 2020 was on short notice and inaccessible to many students. These students now have to pay to resit their exams, and for tutoring to achieve well in said exams.",
