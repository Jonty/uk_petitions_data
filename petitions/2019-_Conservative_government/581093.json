        "additional_details": "The only way for many people to move within social housing is to mutual exchange. Housing associations even promote this but there need to be clear rules to ensure exchanges go ahead. When people pull out, which happens a lot there are wasted expenses on staff time with paperwork, electric tests, gas tests & house inspection.\r\n \r\nThis is also affecting people\u2019s mental health and wellbeing. I myself and I know many more who have been affected. People drop out even just before moving day.",
        "background": "Introduce some clear rules to reduce the amount of tenants pulling out of mutual exchanges. Set Cut off dates to reduce pull outs for example 10 days after approved request. If a tenant pulls out of an exchange more than 3 times they no long can apply for a new exchange.",
