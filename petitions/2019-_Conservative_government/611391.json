        "additional_details": "Talks between the foreign ministers of Ukraine and Russia and the occasional conversation between the Russian president and European heads of state are too little given the importance of the situation. This petition calls on the UK government to propose a summit between Russia, Ukraine, the EU, the US, the UK, and eastern European countries to find a long-lasting peaceful agreement that ends the war in Ukraine, restore stability and establishes suitable working relations with Russia.",
        "background": "The war in Ukraine is resulting in a substantial loss of life as well as suffering and destruction. The longer it persists the more harm will be done and the greater the risk of dangerous escalation. This petition calls on the UK government to propose a summit.",
