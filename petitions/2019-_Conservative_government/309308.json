        "additional_details": "Many British nationals currently stranded abroad are powerless to make their own way home due to local restrictions and the widespread cancellation of flights. Staying in their current location is increasingly challenging with local measures restricting access to accommodation, food, and other basic necessities. With no end to this crisis in sight, only the government is able to bring them home. Even though they are abroad, it is still the government's responsibility to safeguard our citizens.",
        "background": "The government has recently arranged for British citizens trapped in Peru to be rescued and returned home. However, there are British citizens stranded across the world, including many medical professionals who want to support the NHS through this crisis. The government should bring them home.",
