        "additional_details": "Nearly all businesses have suffered dramatic reduction in revenue due to the disruption caused by COVID 19. For most SME's this is unsustainable for even a short time and many will not survive, leading to catastrophic job losses and a much slower economic recovery after the crisis.  The 12-month Business Rates holiday for the hospitality and entertainment industries was very welcome and it is essential this is now extended to all SME's in all sectors many of whom have suffered similar losses.",
        "background": "I would like parliament to expand the 12-month business rates discount (offered currently to shops, restaurants, bars etc) to include all SME's irrespective of their business category.",
