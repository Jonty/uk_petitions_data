        "additional_details": "by raising the minimum wage we can ensure that young workers are fairly compensated for their labour and have the opportunity to save for their future, persue education and gain valuable work experience without being financially disadvantaged \r\n\r\nwe urge for the minimum wage to be at least \u00a36.50 aligning it more closely with the national living wage and providing a fair and equitable wage for young workers across the uk",
        "background": "the current minimum wage is \u00a34.62 per hour which is significantly below the national living wage of \u00a38.91 per hour for those aged 23 and over, we propose that the minimum wage for 16+ should be raised to at least \u00a36.50 per hour to provide fair compensation to work",
