        "additional_details": "Over several years Hemsby has been hit with horrendous weather during the winter. The lack of sea defences has resulted in dangerous levels of erosion including the loss of homes and the ability to launch the lifeboat. Due to even more erosion this winter the beach is now so unsafe it has had to be closed off to the public. 85% of income in the area is from tourism, without a beach there will be a lack of visitors and the village will suffer even more. We need the government\u2019s help.",
        "background": "The government needs to provide appropriate funding and support to the Great Yarmouth Borough Council in order to put up erosion defences to save what is left of Hemsby Beach. The beach requires proper long term sea defences and rejuvenation before it\u2019s too late.",
