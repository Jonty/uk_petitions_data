        "additional_details": "We would like the government to look at this, as purchasing a freehold property should be just that, free from hold. Private management companies are making a fortune from residents in private estates by having charges (on top of council tax, regular charges and solicitor fees) to buy, sell and maintain an estate. There is no limit as to how much they can increase their fees, the quality of work is below par and companies bully residents into continued payments with threats of legal action.",
        "background": "New build estates are burdened with extra charges by private management companies that unfairly disadvantage residents. We'd like the government to scrap these companies and encourage councils to take over more estates or have the option for residents to manage / employ a company of their choosing.",
