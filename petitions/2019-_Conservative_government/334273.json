        "additional_details": "Government are opening schools as a priority and supporting the vulnerable with laptop schemes. But right now many children have become disadvantaged with a 6 months learning gap. To help schools and families to catch up and avoid the detrimental long term effects of missed learnig by today's children, resources need to be put in place quickly. Children need high quality learning now and in the years to come. Families are left behind by government having fixed criterias for the laptop scheme.",
        "background": "Expand the laptop/tablet scheme to reach all children because online learning is important for all. The learning gap was wide between the disadvantaged and the advantaged but  all children are now disadvantaged. Children need to catch up through supported online learning along side attending school.",
