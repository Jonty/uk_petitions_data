This is unacceptable\r\n\r\nIt will be the third Conservative prime minister since the last general election.\r\n\r\nWho is leading our country should be decided in a general election, not in yet another Conservative leadership election\r\n\r\nIts time for voters to decide who should govern the country",

The mandate they had is truly gone and there is no faith left in them.\r\n\r\nCall a General Election and you will clearly see the will of UK citizens.",
