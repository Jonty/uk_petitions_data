        "additional_details": "In London minors are eligible for free or discounted travel on public transport on the London transport system. With this kind of advantage, parents from the poorest households may send their children to a school that may be miles away without financial penalty for this.\r\n \r\nIn a many settings if the local school is unsuitable for a child they may be forced onto public transport, and the charges for this can lead even more affluent parents to make decisions that are not the best for the child.",
        "background": "The cost of public transport to and from school is an economic pressure on parents. This can force parents to make school selections based on location rather than suitability of the school for their child. Free public transport should be offered to all students attending state school.",
