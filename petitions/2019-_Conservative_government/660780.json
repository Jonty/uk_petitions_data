        "additional_details": "Due to the current policy, myself and my husband paid \u00a37k for the 1st cycle, which sadly failed. This means we are now forced to pay another \u00a37k for the 2nd cycle of treatment. For only two cycles, the total cost is now at \u00a314k, with no guarantee of the second cycle being successful. Considering I have no children, the NICE guidelines state if you are a woman aged under 40 you should be offered 3 full cycles of IVF if you have been trying for more than 2 years. Please review the policy to prevent others getting into unmanageable debt, for one chance at making a family.",
