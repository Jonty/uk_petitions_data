We should not ask couples to ignore their mothers' or second parents' contributions in order to be legally married, let alone force the children of single mothers to leave the field blank. \r\n\r\nWe want the government to amend marriage forms to give the option of listing both parents' information, or remove the fields entirely. \r\n\r\nThis would be a small but profoundly significant administrative change.",

We want forms to reflect the equal society we hope to live in, and ask for both parents' information, regardless of the gender of the parent.",
