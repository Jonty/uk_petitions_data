        "background": "The State Pension is far too low. The Government must increase the basic State Pension to \u00a321,673.60 a year (\u00a3416.80 pw) and extend this to everyone aged 60 or over. This should lift thousands out of poverty, give our elderly folk more power to survive, and help grow the real economy, bottom up.",
