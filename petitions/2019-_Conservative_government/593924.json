        "additional_details": "The government need to listen to the doctors and surgeons in the NHS about the very dangerous risk these small colourful balls hold. If these balls are swallowed, they can easily stick the intestinal track, stomach or bowel together, resulting in a life threating situation. Please sign this petition to get these balls removed from sale, i now know from first hand experience the threat these tiny balls hold.",
        "background": "The NHS have already called for a ban on these small magnetic ball toys. But Parliment once again is doing nothing. I have seen first hand what the dangers of these toys are and not helped by social media, these toys are now being swallowed by small children.",
