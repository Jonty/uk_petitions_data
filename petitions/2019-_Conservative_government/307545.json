While social media and the news continue to publicise the empty shelves this situation is not going to change. We need to help our NHS staff NOW. This cannot wait for the situation to calm down. Hospitals no doubt have a good supply of food and I cant imagine many Covid - 19 patients are eating much so please feed the nurses, doctors and support staff with that food",
