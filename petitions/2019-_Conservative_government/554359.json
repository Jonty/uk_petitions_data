        "action": "Allow Gay and Bisexual Men to Donate Blood Freely",
        "additional_details": "Currently, gay and bisexual men are only able to donate blood if they have abstained from oral and anal sex for at least 3 months- even if condoms and/or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) were used in either circumstance.\r\nAll donated blood is rigorously tested, and therefore there is no obvious rationale for this outdated restriction.\r\nThis restriction also affects women who have had sex with men who have sex with men, further reducing the donor pool.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, believe that men who have had sexual relations with men should be allowed to freely donate their blood, subject to the non-discriminatory standards set out to protect donors. This would mean the abolishment of the baseless requirement for 3-months of abstinence.",
