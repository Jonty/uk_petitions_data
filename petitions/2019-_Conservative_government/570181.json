        "additional_details": "Some people have missed out on valuable time that could've been spent practicing for their practical driving test or taking their practical test. \r\n\r\nLockdown restrictions could mean that certain people may have to retake their theory test due to lockdown taking them over the deadline, despite having remaining driving lessons or their practical theory test booked. \r\n\r\nBy extending the two year restrictions by the months that have been missed will help both learner drivers and their instructors.",
