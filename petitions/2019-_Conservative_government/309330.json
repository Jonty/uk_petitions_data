        "additional_details": "The next rent payment will be due mid April and it would be totally unfair to even request a rent payment from us, as many of us aren\u2019t occupying the residence due to unforeseeable circumstances and of no fault of our own.  And for those who are still in halls etc, the extra income from not having to pay the April rent could really benefit them during these very uncertain times, as they are without the emotional as well as the financial support of family.",
        "background": "As we all know, we\u2019re in a terrible state at the moment due to Covid-19 and many Uni students who would otherwise be living on campus, or in their respective student homes, including myself, have been forced to return to our family homes, with no more face to face sessions being provided at uni.",
