        "additional_details": "The government should scrap any plans to raise the minimum income amount for family visas, that is already set at high enough level (\u00a318,600) as it is anyway. The rise to over \u00a338,000 is a ridiculously high rise, and affects hard working honest people who simply want to lawfully live with their loved ones.",
        "background": "The government should scrap the plan to raise the minimum income required for family visas. A rise from \u00a318,600 to over \u00a338,000 is completely unjust and unethical, and puts a very difficult and immoral barrier in front of people who simply want to legally live with their loved ones.",
