A simple X ray of the dogs being used for breeding can help determine the risk of passing on these diseases to not only their offspring but future generations. By making Elbow & Hip Dysplasia screening mandatory many thousands of puppies can be prevented from being born with these debilitating diseases and suffering the consequences of poor breeding practices. Please make it law.",
