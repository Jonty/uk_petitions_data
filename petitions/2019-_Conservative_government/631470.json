        "additional_details": "Student nurses work on placement without a wage more weeks of the year than lectures, however they are paying \u00a39,250 for this. Student nurses receive a \u00a35,000 grant from the NHS a year to help fund their studies, however student nurses are not paid for the work they do on the ward and the community. Student nurses are making up staffing due to short staffing and are working 13+ hours a day. As a student, this year I am attending 22 weeks of placement and only 15 weeks of lectures. I believe many student nurses would be willing to sign an agreement with the NHS along the lines of the Welsh agreement.",

We want the Government to fund free tuition fees for student nurses who agree to work in NHS England for two years.",
