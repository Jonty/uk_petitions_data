        "action": "Allow non-cohabiting couples in England to stop distancing (as in Scotland)",
        "additional_details": "At the beginning of lockdown, couples were advised to \"test the strength of their relationship\" and either move in or split up. For many couples moving in together is not possible, for practical, financial, or moral reasons. If lockdown rules are to be effective, they need to be able to be followed without damaging key relationships. Nor is it fair for those whose conscience is only comfortable following government guidance. In Scotland this is now allowed - it's time for England to do likewise.",
        "background": "In England, non-cohabiting couples who have been following lockdown guidance have been unable to give each other a hug for four months (unless one member of the couple lives alone). This is not practical, carries heavy emotional and psychological cost and offers little hope as lockdown easing stops.",
