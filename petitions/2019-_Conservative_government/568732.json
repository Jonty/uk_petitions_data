Parliament, CIE & Edexcel are not taking into consideration the state of students' mental health, difficulty of access to online resources, and overall motivation to fully grasp the material taught in this 2 year period. Online learning has imposed a large variety of issues in a student's daily life, and it would be extremely unfair for CIE & Edexcel to not provide the same treatment.\r\n.",
        "background": "Cancel International A level & IGCSE Exams 2021. Boris Johnson made a statement that all exams in summer 2021. The IGCSE board are saying this doesn\u2019t effect them \r\n1) because they are not regulated by the government \r\n2) it\u2019s international. \r\nThis is unfair and wrong.",
