        "action": "Introduce legislation to prohibit the media from scaremongering and lying.",
        "additional_details": "There have been hundreds of examples of the media scaremongering over recent weeks - with dramatic music to accompany stories, click bait headlines and taking quotes from interviews completely out of context in order to create more drama. We have also witnessed lives being lost due to the media releasing what should be confidential information about peoples lives.\r\n\r\nCurrent journalism is deceitful and misleading, and it is beyond time that the government step in to control this.",
        "background": "I strongly think it is time that the British media is held accountable for its actions, and that \u201cfake news\u201d is strictly prohibited. There should be laws in place to protect the public from over-dramatised, invasive and in some cases, outright fake, news.",
