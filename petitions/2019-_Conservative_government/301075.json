You cannot get into the Dentist even privately, and the schools are suffering.\r\nI believe it should be a legal requirement for the Councils and Developers to ensure that there is sufficient services, before more houses are built.\r\nJust building houses is breaking the system. It is degrading the services for everyone, including newcomers.",
