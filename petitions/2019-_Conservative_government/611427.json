        "additional_details": "Hedgerow habitat is essential for a broad spectrum of wildlife across the UK ecosystem. Yet Government-granted subsidies for field border set-aside strips do not presently include hedgerow within the scope of protection.\r\n\r\nWe ask that annual and biannual cutting of hedge lines with tractor-driven machinery will disqualify the landowner from receipt of these subsidies, since this practice significantly reduces wildlife support and current grants do not represent good value for the tax payer.",
        "background": "Ensure that payments for field border set-aside allocations are made ONLY where accompanying hedgerow is sustainably managed.\r\n\r\nDisallow tractor-driven rotary or flail blade hedge cutting on an annual/bi-annual basis to constitute 'sustainability' and legislate against it in subsidy allowance.",
