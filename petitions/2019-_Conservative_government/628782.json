        "additional_details": "In light of Jeremy Hunts comments on the 23rd Nov 2022 when he said he wants people to reduce their consumption by 15% I believe the Government should do exactly the same to show we are all in it together. I would like to see The House of Commons and The House of Lords reduce their energy consumption by 15%. Also the Civil service should reduce consumption by 15% benchmarked against previous years together with government staff and MP\u2019s who would have 85% of their consumption paid.",
        "background": "The Chancellor says he expects members of the public to reduce their energy consumption by 15% to help meet energy bills. I would like to know that the government and its employees, representatives and members of The House of Commons and The House of Lords are leading by example and doing the same.",
