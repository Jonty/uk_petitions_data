        "action": "Make training about online sexual abuse mandatory for teachers",
        "additional_details": "We know that sexual abuse online is a huge issue among teenage students. A 2021 review by Ofsted found that nearly 90% of girls, and nearly 50% of boys, said being sent explicit pictures or videos of things they did not want to see happens a lot or sometimes to them or their peers. Over half of the girls who responded to a questionnaire by Ofsted also said that pictures or videos of themselves that they did not know about were circulated sometimes or a lot. Too many teachers aren't educated enough about social media to identify and tackle this behaviour.",
        "background": "We want the Government to require new training for teachers so they:\r\n1. Understand the definitions of online sexual abuse\r\n2. Can identify signs of peer-on-peer sexual abuse\r\n3. Know how to respond to sexual harassment and online sexual abuse\r\n4. Understand the potential dangers of social media",
