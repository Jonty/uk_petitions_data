        "additional_details": "E-bikes speed goes up to 45km/h (28 mph) even faster then lots of e-scooters, yet e-bike is allowed on the with no tax and insurance to pay, the police using public taxes paid money to waste they time on stopping people on e-scooter using it to go to work, and they take the scooter and resell it on auction, surely a human being living in UK going to buy that again. This is a big waste of our tax money, there are real crimes out there to Focus on. More people died on bike then on e-scooter.",
        "background": "E-scooter have to be allowed on the road just like e-bike and bike and all rides most wear helmet. Not everyone want to cycle to work and be all sweaty. E-scooter is eco-friendly and help reduce pollution. All others country\u2019s allowed e-scooter, why UK always have to be the one to make silly laws.",
