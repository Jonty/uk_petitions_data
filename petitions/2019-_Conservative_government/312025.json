        "additional_details": "I feel the FA should cancel this summer's transfer window. The reason being, the entire world is taking a massive financial hit, many losing jobs, potentially losing homes etc. Due to that, how can clubs justify spending millions on players when that money could be put back into the economy. It seems to me if they did spend in the summer it's a kick in the teeth to the fans, the public, everyone affected. \r\n\r\nThe FA should cancel this summer's transfer window due to the pandemic and financial woes",
        "background": "With the current economic struggles we are having due to the coronavirus, people are struggling financially, losing jobs and homes. I feel it very hypocritical if football clubs spend millions on a player when this money could be put towards the covid-19 funding of essential resources",
