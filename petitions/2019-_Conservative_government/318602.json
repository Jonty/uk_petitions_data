        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the UK Government to reconsider this offer and instead provide the families of these NHS workers with fair financial support.\r\n\r\nUnless less than than \u00a360,000 this support should be equal to the salary these NHS workers would have earned over their remaining working life and continue after their retirement age with the maximum pension they would have received. \r\n\r\nThis is the minimum the government should do for those who gave so much.",
        "background": "The \u00a360,000 life assurance payout announced today in no way compensates the families of NHS workers who tragically lost their own lives to coronavirus after bravely trying to save others. \u00a360,000 is a pittance and no single life should be seen as worth so little",
