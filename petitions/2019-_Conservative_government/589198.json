        "additional_details": "1 in 4 people will experience a mental health problem of some kind each year in England. 1 in 6 people report experiencing a common mental health problem in any given week in England (Mind.org.uk). Mental Health issues are rising significantly in the UK and that was before the pandemic. I like countless others suffer from this Hidden Disability which people still don't want to talk about. We are finding help dealing with these issues with dogs but are restricted by current outdated legislation.",

I want the Government to recognise Hidden Disabilities and that to some an Emotional Support Dog is just as invaluable as a Guide Dog.",
