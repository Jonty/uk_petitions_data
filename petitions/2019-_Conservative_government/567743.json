        "additional_details": "Many students have needed to self isolate and/or faced earlier school closures, so they have missed on hours of teaching time. Teachers across the country will have varying levels of assessment data to base final grades on.\r\n\r\nPrivate candidates will not have the needed assessment data for a final grade, so they will need to sit their exams next year. \r\n\r\nNot presenting the option of exams later in the year risks delaying many young people's future plans.",
        "background": "This year's GCSE and A level exams have been cancelled. Final grades will be determined by predicted and centre-assessed grades. \r\n\r\nExams are the fairest way of judging students\u2019 performance, so introducing the option of sitting exams when it is safe to do will help with awarding accurate grades.",
