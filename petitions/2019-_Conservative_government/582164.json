        "additional_details": "Even in pictures of the Virgin Mary we can see the Lady Mary wearing a veil. It is a symbol which represents chastity and dignity to make atrocious claims that it will help in fight against extremism is not true, rather the veil and its commonality in the Abrahamic faiths and in history should be seen and promoted.  Other Islamophobic policies should be stopped -banning the halal chicken and forcing halal shops to sell pork and alcohol - they should be inclusive not demonising the Islamic faith.",
        "background": "The French government is terrorising and making life difficult for Muslims who live in France. They are attempting to ban the hijab (headscarf) for anyone under 18 worn by Muslim women as part of their faith. This is against religious freedom. The veil has been seen in all the Abrahamic faiths.",
