Secondly, increased off-road access could encourage people to cycle, which may help with the government\u2019s fight against the obesity epidemic. Thirdly, implementing public rights of way would aid the government\u2019s goal of promoting lower carbon transport by increasing the usage of sustainable transport, such as cycling, for commuting and leisure.",
