        "action": "Legalise Cannabis in the UK to stop the coming recession caused by Covid-19",
        "additional_details": "The US legal Cannabis market is already worth $24.1bn. The UK legal market could net the treasury between \u00a31bn and \u00a33.5bn a year in tax revenues if legalisation takes place. The extra capital made by the government in the form of taxes and licensing fees can go towards boosting our economy, and ultimately, helping the country survive a coming recession.\r\n\r\nBy implementing this notion, the government will be demonstrating its willingness to explore all avenues to help this country survive.",
        "background": "The global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus is sweeping the globe, threatening the UK with an economic recession \r\n\r\nI propose the government legalise the sale of Cannabis and Cannabis-related products. The scheme would work similarly to that of California or Colorado in the United States.",
