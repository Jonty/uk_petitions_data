        "additional_details": "E-boards are cheap, practical, safe and fun. E-boards can be just as safe as normal scooters and skateboards if used properly. E-boards have brakes, are responsive and are stable. The UK is one of the few countries in the world that doesn\u2019t allow E-boards and yet could be the country that leads the way in E-board safety. Doing a trial with rental E-Scooters won\u2019t result in sufficient results. The public are much more likely to look after their own property rather than a rented scooter.",
        "background": "The UK should be making basic rules, informing the public and allowing the public to make their own decisions. Enforce clear rules-set speed limits, ensure rider safety with helmets, and mandatory board maintenance. E-boards result in less car usage by encouraging alternative transport solutions.",
