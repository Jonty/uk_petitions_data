        "additional_details": "Unilateral annexation would have a devastating impact on the prospects for peace and a solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. These annexations have been condemned by the UN and other world leaders as a direct violation of international law and conventions. The British government has a responsibility to speak out for a resolution that will result in equality and dignity for all in both Palestine and Israel.",
        "background": "The Israeli government recently revealed plans to begin annexing parts of the occupied West Bank beginning on 1st July 2020. This will leave thousands more Palestinians displaced from their homes and constitutes an illegal takeover of more Palestinian territory.",
