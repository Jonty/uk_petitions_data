        "additional_details": "My brother sadly passed away 2 years ago at the age of 42, and I have heard stories of young people passing away from stage 4 bowel cancer as young as 21. His son is 3 years old and will have to get screened from age 30, the doctors obviously feel he would benefit from screening at that age. Taking this seriously could help save lots of young lives. I have had breast cancer myself that was found early, this early diagnosis saved my life and led to me having less radical treatment.",
        "background": "The age at which people are offered bowel cancer screening in England should be lowered to 30 years old. The Government should work with NHS health bodies, and provide the funding needed, to make this happen.",
