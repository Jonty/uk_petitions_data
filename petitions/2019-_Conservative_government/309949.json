        "additional_details": "These sites must be closed to prevent the spread of COVID - 19. Construction companies, especially smaller ones, will struggle to pay their staff if they make the decision to close by themselves. This is why the government needs to act quickly to protect everyone in terms of both finance and public health.",
        "background": "The government must close construction sites to prevent the spread of COVID - 19. Construction sites often consist of large groups of workers (almost always over the government guideline which is 2 people). In turn this will only serve to increase the speed at which the disease threatens to spread.",
