        "background": "The UK government should make it compulsory for all taxis to have CCTV fitted inside their vehicles to help protect people from sexual assault.\r\n\r\nCurrently the absence of evidence, which could be provided by CCTV, means that victims of crimes in taxis receive no justice.",
