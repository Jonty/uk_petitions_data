        "additional_details": "Airlines are abusing this peak time to take extortionate amounts from hard working families who are trying to save money to travel. Everyone has been affected badly by the pandemic financially and emotionally and this will put further burden on the families. \r\nWhen airlines could operate on lower fares when less ppl were travelling, they can surely survive with lower fares when more people will travel and they can have more flights full on low fares! Stop abusing the family situation!!",
        "background": "During lockdown we saw how low the prices can fall for air tickets as no one was travelling. But with lockdown easing it is predicted that the prices will sky rocket. We request the government to put a cap on air fares as it is exploitation of hard working families situation.",
