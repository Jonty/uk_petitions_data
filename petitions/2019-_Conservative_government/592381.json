I recommend that cycling proficiency tests become a legal requirement for over 25 year olds, who must also carry some form of personal insurance in order to use UK roads so that in the result that they directly cause damage or injury to other road users or pedestrians they can be held accountable.",
        "background": "Cyclists present a danger to other road users and pedestrians due to a lack of training. all other road users must carry out a written and practical test to be allowed to use UK roads. with an estimated 7.5 million cyclists in 2020 this is 7.5 million major accidents waiting to happen.",
