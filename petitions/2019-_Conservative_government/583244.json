A DDA investigation represents cruel & unusual punishment sometimes prior to establishing a case, let alone guilt. The dog is detained by strangers in often unsanitary outhouses & neglected by officers who have neither the time, inclination nor training to provide care which is surely an offence of itself. \r\n\r\nWe put animals on trial during the middle ages. \r\n\r\nRepeal the Dangerous Dogs Act!",

Emulate Switzerland where dog attacks have been prevented with a licensing system for dogs that includes education on welfare needs, adopting a canine appropriate lifestyle & dependent on successful completion of basic training.",
