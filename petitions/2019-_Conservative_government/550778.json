        "additional_details": "Migraine symptoms can be varying in nature and severity, many experience loss of speech, confusion, inability to focus thoughts or process what is going on around them. Additionally some experience stroke like symptoms, loss of balance and extreme fatigue, making movement and consciousness difficult. Furthermore the pain in the head and neck can be agonising. \r\nAll of this goes against the guidance as they can considerably affect functionality both physically and mentally.",
        "background": "Published guidance advises assessors that during an attack no specific impairment of function would be expected and there should not be any change in awareness or intellect. It is not accurate at all and needs to be revised for assessors or panellists without personal experience to justly review.",
