        "additional_details": "As cases rise exponentially the planned change\r\ncontradicts scientific opinion & the opinions of the Scottish/Welsh governments who retain restrictions. Shops & public transport are also against the move.\r\n\r\nThe previous rushed lifting of lockdown caused many needless deaths. We don't want a single needless death this time.\r\n\r\nVaccines don't guarantee you will not catch Covid-19, nor that you won't die. Reinstate the law from 19/7/21. So many citizens in England feel unsafe with the planned change.",
        "background": "Facemask wearing is a small price to pay to reduce further casualties. Facemasks should remain mandatory in the same situations they are prior to 19th July. This should remain enforced until\u00a0the governments of all 3 UK countries unanimously agree the danger of huge leaps in Covid cases has passed.",
