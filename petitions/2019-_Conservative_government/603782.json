        "additional_details": "A specific proportion of the population is being deprived of their liberty to choose. Making this law will create more chaos in an already troubling situation. Nhs workers are relied on by the vast majority. This is not a wise move. You must remember the long term goal isn\u2019t just to be done with covid. It is to have a more stable and thriving society. Consider what this will do not just for 2022, but the difficulty over the next 5-10 years. Unemployment, reduced staff are just the start.",
        "background": "The covid vaccine doesn\u2019t impact transmission. Further variants will arise, making these mandatory vaccines obsolete. Making vaccines mandatory for a specific population is discriminatory. Either everyone is vaccinated because covid is so dangerous, or it remains a choice for your own safety.",
