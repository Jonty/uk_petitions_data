        "additional_details": "Most year 9 and 10 students had had as much GCSE tuition as those in Year 11 To discriminate against them simply because they are younger is possibly illegal (EA S96(1))and is certainly immoral.\r\n\r\nWhen students return to school it will be a full six months since they have had any formal teaching in the subjects in which they are being examined.  This will disadvantage them hugely.\r\n\r\nThis is an unnecessary addition to the strains on students\u2019 mental health at what is already a difficult time.",
        "background": "The government should abandon the discriminatory and damaging  proposal by Ofqual on 3 April 2020 not to award grades to students in Years 9 and 10 on the basis of teacher assessment and award grades to all students in the same way, irrespective of their age or the year group they are in.",
