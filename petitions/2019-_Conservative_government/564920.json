        "additional_details": "While the deal we signed with The EU did address some of our concerns, such as elimination of tariffs, we believe the British youth should be given the opportunities offered by Erasmus.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the mutual agreement between nations is key to this. \r\n\r\nIt has enhanced the education of many of our finest young minds, and should continue to do so. While we will leave with the agreed upon deal on December 31st, I believe that renegotiations could be opened up after that to include the Erasmus.",
        "background": "We believe that our deal with The EU signed today should've included the Erasmus programme, and that we should renegotiate the deal so that it does so after we leave with the current deal on.\r\n\r\nWe do not believe the Turing scheme will effectively replace it as it is not a mutual agreement.",
