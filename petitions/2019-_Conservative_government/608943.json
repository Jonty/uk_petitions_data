        "additional_details": "This should help prevent bias, and generate revenue for the courts and professionals appointed to the expert panel. Removing the ability to select expert witnesses themselves could also make parties think otherwise before going into litigation. Court fees for the panel of experts could also be set below the cost of privately funded experts, reducing the cost of litigation.",
        "background": "Abolish the use of personally selected and paid experts witnesses in courts. Instead there should be a panel of experts that can be assigned to cases as required, with fees paid to the court. This should help eliminate any element of bias resulting from people selecting and paying their own experts.",
