Many claimants are also eligible for Council Tax Support, free prescriptions and free school meals.\r\n \r\nHousehold Energy (Gas / Electric) is also a basic essential living cost. Access to warmth and the ability to cook are basic human rights.\r\n \r\nWith the rising costs of Energy bills we need additional financial support through Universal Credit to help the most vulnerable in society.\r\n",
        "background": "Just as with other essential living costs, household energy in the form of Gas and Electricity is a basic necessity.\r\n \r\nSpecific additional support for Energy bills should be provided to people on Universal Credit, in the same way as support for housing costs.\r\n",
