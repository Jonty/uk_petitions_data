        "additional_details": "I want the Government to address this issue and solve it as it is greatly important to the environment. Additionally these animals are becoming endangered due to their brutal hunting which is in humane and barbaric. These countries should conform to the law passed as they are damaging our ecosystem and oceans. Wherever whales are found, so are phytoplankton. These tiny creatures produce every second breath we take, by contributing to at least 50 per cent of all the oxygen in our atmosphere.",
        "background": "I want the Government to take notice of the importance of sea life, especially whales and dolphins that are being illegally killed in Japan, Iceland and Norway. Parliament need to address this issue and challenge them to control their fishing and enforce the whaling for profit law passed in 1986.",
