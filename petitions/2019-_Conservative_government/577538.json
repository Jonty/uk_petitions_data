        "additional_details": "Firstly, With the ongoing knock-on effects of COVID-19 still looking, one thing is clear. The country is falling into a tremendous pit of debt. The legalisation and taxation of Marijuana would have a nice impact on decreasing this. It\u2019s estimated that the market for cannabis in this country alone could be worth up to \u00a34 Billion with in 5 years. \r\n\r\nSecondly, the use of this plant in private places and establishments would limit \u201canti-social behaviour by giving people safe haven to relax and do what is harming no one around them. The one thing that makes users look bad is that they have to duck \u2018the law\u2019 when in reality they\u2019re just trying to relax and let the day go by.",
        "background": "It\u2019s about time the government gets off its high horse and stops trying to babysit every citizen of the country individually. We should allow the use of of Marijuana (Cannabis) to be legalised and regulated to the same extent as tobacco and alcohol. The \u201cPLANT\u201d is nowhere near as bad as you think.",
