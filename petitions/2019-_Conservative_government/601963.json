        "action": "Reform highways maintenance funding to reflect traffic volume",
        "additional_details": "The highway network is our largest and most visible publicly owned asset. It is used and relied upon by every single resident in the UK.\r\n\r\nSome highway networks carry much larger traffic volumes than others. In some cases, average traffic volume can be more than 3 times higher. This inevitably leads to more wear and tear.\r\n\r\nIf the funding formula gave weight to traffic volume as well as road length, it should result in a fairer allocation of funds.",
        "background": "We call upon the Government to reform the local highways maintenance funding formula to take into account traffic volume. The current method for calculating road maintenance funding relies almost solely upon road length. This can result in many busy highway networks being underfunded.",
