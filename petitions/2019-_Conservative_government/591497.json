It makes things fair because due to what has happened because of covid average people are losing money on many things as well as driving so I feel that it would be ideal in this great country that we live in to have this opportunity.",
        "background": "I would like for the government to give additional time of one year to those who have passed thier driving theory tests due to learners not being able to book a test and given the opportunity as it would normally have been given to any citizen of england.",
