        "additional_details": "Those who have been operating for fewer than three years will receive considerably less than the 80% subsidy. Childminding is an activity that yields high operating costs, leading to a misrepresentation of their income and a smaller grant. Many deductible expenses incurred need to be paid regardless of whether they are taking care of children, such as rents and utilities. Most childminders aren't eligible for Universal Credit nor can they rely on the goodwill of the families they work with.",
        "background": "The COVID-19 Self-employment Income Support Scheme needs to be more accessible and fair for recently self-employed workers and those with large unavoidable expenses, particularly childminders. In the year 2019-2020, 194,000 begun self-employed work and can't access this grant.",
