We know that there has been no documented cases of this in the UK but it is important to close legal loopholes and set an example so we can encourage other countries to make animal welfare laws. With this ban we can help make changes worldwide and join other countries and cities (US, Taiwan, Hong Kong etc) that have already made this illegal.",
