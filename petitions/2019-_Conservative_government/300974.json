        "additional_details": "The spread of Coronavirus will cause major economic disruption and place unprecedented pressure on UK businesses and public services, particularly the NHS. Leaving the Brexit transition on 1 January 2021 would hugely disadvantage the UK economy, compromise medical supply chains and place additional pressure on businesses at an already difficult time.\r\n\r\nThe Government must recognise that circumstances have dramatically changed. A Brexit transition extension is needed to protect the British public.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to extend the Brexit transition period beyond 31 December 2020 to support the British economy, businesses, NHS and public services during the mass outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID-19).",
