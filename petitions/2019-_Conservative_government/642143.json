Given the number of safe countries many of these individuals travel through in order to reach the UK, we also believe many are economic migrants, and not genuine refugees.\r\n \r\nWe are sick of the current situation, and platitudes from the Government. These people should be placed in basic accommodation, not hotels, until a solution can be reached for relocation.",
