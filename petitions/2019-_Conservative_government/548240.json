        "additional_details": "Manually review issued grades or allow students to have time to study in a legitimate study environment where they can then take their exams and hopefully achieve grades more accurate to their ability. The lack of teaching they have received due to Covid-19 as well as the other associated struggles should not be held against them, especially as marks awarded are significantly different to predicted grades. Students who worked significantly harder since mock exams have not been given opportunity.",
        "background": "Review the grades issued to 2020 A-level students as 39% of students have unfairly been downgraded. They have not been able to prove themselves in exams, the students have been under huge amounts of pressure due to Covid-19 and the last thing they need is for their future to be effected by algorithm",
