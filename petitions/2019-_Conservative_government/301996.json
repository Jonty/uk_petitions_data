I would like the government to impose proper active regulations instead of repeatedly telling us to wash our hands because If this worked we wouldn\u2019t have a global pandemic around. I want the figures of the cases to be active and for us to carry on taking corona testing so people know if they have the virus and have answers so they aren\u2019t anxious.We need to stop being focused on the economy but the people.",
        "background": "Following the prime Ministers speech, I am increasingly worried about the idea to let people get the virus to create immunity as this will endanger and even worse kill the most vulnerable in society. It seems like the government are willing for people to die in order to keep our economy working.",
