        "action": "Do not un-employ health & social care staff who decline the covid 19 vaccine",
        "additional_details": "Enforcing vaccination or coercing health and social care staff into being vaccinated against covid 19 removes the freedom of choice and their rights to body autonomy. Vaccination is optional even for elderly residents in care homes; if vaccination is done to the elderly without consent it is considered a deprivation of liberty and I believe enforcing vaccination on health and social care staff has a similar deprivation of liberty effect as well as unconsidering culture, background & religion",
        "background": "There is talk of deploying or dismissing health and social care staff who refuse or decline to take either one or both covid-19 vaccinations. I'd like to see this idea scrapped as it is discriminatory and removes staffs rights to freedom of choice, body autonomy and deprivess liberties",
