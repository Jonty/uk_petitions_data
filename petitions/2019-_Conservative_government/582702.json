        "additional_details": "Many communities are blighted by odour issues from landfill sites. The odour from a poorly managed landfill site can reach for many miles around and affect thousands of residents directly in their own homes, workplaces and places of leisure. The malodourous gasses can greatly affect physical and mental health. It should not be acceptable that communities suffer continuous or persistent odour issues from landfill sites and living in close proximity to one should not be detrimental to residents.",
        "background": "We call for the Government to review how the Environment Agency monitors and manages levels of malodourous gasses. Consideration should be given to compulsory monitoring of emissions of landfill sites and for the EA to be obliged to act with urgency when high levels of odour complaints are received.",
