        "additional_details": "The focus has tended to be on the disastrous effects where the prisoners are concerned, and while this is justifiable in its own right, there is another cohort that has slipped beneath the radar where the IPPs damaging legacy is concerned: the families of IPPs can be equally damaged, albeit in different ways. One of the more concerning by-products of the IPP is the financial impact it can have on the families of prisoners with an indeterminate prison sentence.",
        "background": "There have been several reports and inquires into the efficacy and the fairness of the indeterminate sentence for public protection (IPP), the outcomes of which have favoured resentencing those still subject to this now-repealed criminal sanction. The Government should enable this to happen.",
