        "action": "Give teachers higher priority in the Covid vaccination scheme.",
        "additional_details": "Our teachers continue to go above and beyond teaching our children, delivering virtual lessons, delivering food parcels etc. but in doing so they put themselves at risk albeit taking precautions by washing or sanitising their hands regularly, wearing masks and face shields and observing social distancing.  I am dismayed that they are not afforded the same protection as our doctors and nurses and to hear of teachers and teaching staff contracting Covid some of whom have also sadly passed away.",
        "background": "I would like our teachers and teaching staff to be afforded the same priority as our doctors, nurses and NHS staff and implement changes to give them the same priority in the Covid vaccination scheme thereby not only giving them the recognition that they deserve but also protecting them.",
