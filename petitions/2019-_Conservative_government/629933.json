        "additional_details": "Nurses have taken a real-terms pay cut in recent years, despite hospitals getting increasingly busier through a growing, and ageing, population. They are expected to take on the debt associated with university education.  This has caused a significant recruitment shortfall, exacerbated by a more limited access to European nursing talent, and driven morale of nurses into the ground, in turn generating a retention issue.",
        "background": "Raise the basic rate of income tax by 1p, the higher rate by 2p and the additional rate by 5p in the \u00a3.  The funds raised should be ring-fenced to improve the salaries and bursaries for Nursing in the NHS to drive recruitment, retention and morale amongst this invaluable resource.",
