Equipment is disinfected (in some cases steam cleaned) between play sessions. Yes the balls have gone from the ball pits!  \r\nThe toddler group class uses individual boxed play accessories. \r\nMy daughter has lost confidence in meeting other young children due to the Spring lockdown. Other parents of stay at home toddlers have said the same to me.",
        "background": "Not all babies and toddlers attend nursery. They rely on classes and play centres for socialisation and development.\r\n\r\nNurseries, schools and Universities are allowed to remain open. Keeping baby and toddler classes and play centres open will not significantly impact on the spread of Covid19.",
