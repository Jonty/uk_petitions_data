To remedy this undesirable, counterproductive air, we must ensure that a 'practice-what-you-preach' ethos is followed; as it is paramount that transparency, trust and fairness are at the forefront of politics in the modern world.\r\nAs the UK government is so staunchly anti-drug, with public money being spent on taking drugs off the streets, it is only right that we know for certain that we really are \"all in this together\".",
