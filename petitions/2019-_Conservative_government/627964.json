When the nurses need better pay why are we spending our money feeding MPs.  It sets an enormously bad example of \"us and them\".",

(Retain any subsidy for lower paid centrally employed staff of the House if they currently get it, but not MPs directly employed staff - they would just bring it back to their employers.)",
