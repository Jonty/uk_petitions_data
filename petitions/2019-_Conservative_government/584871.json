Current protections for consumers are inadequate, leaving victims who have been scammed or left with poor or dangerous workmanship at the hands of rogue builders unprotected. It's too easy for a rogue builder to prey on homeowners, and the few avenues of redress are costly for victims. Mandatory licensing and regulation of these workers should help protect consumers.",
