        "additional_details": "Animal cruelty often occurs alongside or precedes further extreme behaviours and antisocial behaviour disorders. \r\n\r\nWhilst the criminal system is already over strained and handing out long sentences for animal abuse may not always be possible. \r\n\r\nA registry would allow law enforcement and other relevant parties to monitor and track cases. It would also allow breeders to check potential buyers, bringing puppy purchasing more inline with adoption protocols.",
        "background": "The pandemic has fuelled a surge for puppies, as a direct result of demand, dog thefts have become endemic. \r\n\r\nOften gangs linked to other serious crimes such as drug and trafficking rings are now making millions off the heartbreak of loving families and naive buyers.",
