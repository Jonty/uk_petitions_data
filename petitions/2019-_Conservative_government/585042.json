        "additional_details": "My children's school is used as a polling station, which means it is completely closed to all pupils on election days. Other local suitable venues are available. Cumulatively, this results in many days of lost learning, in addition to Inset Days. It impacts families with no other child care options. It seems hypocritical when parents are fined for \"unauthorised absences\", no matter what the reason or potential benefit for the pupil. Attendance Numbers seem to be so important, except for this.",
