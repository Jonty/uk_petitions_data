Whilst we welcome HMRC's move to online services, we are not convinced this will happen fast enough and are concerned vulnerable individuals may be left behind. There will always be a demand for traditional channels and the service level can be improved with extra resources.",
        "background": "HMRC\u2019s customer service performance has declined and this causes significant problems for taxpayers and agents. We believe delays to Making Tax Digital and plans to move more enquiries to digital channels mean additional resources are needed to provide the country with an effective tax service.",
