        "additional_details": "A lot of people are losing out on money and joy at wedding venues as they have paid for a full evening for the venue. If there is available space, there can be safe social distance dancing with music even with the use of masks. Bring back the joy of weddings and let us dance. Venues are holding weddings that can hold hundreds with 15 people - there is definitely room to dance. It is the exact same as holding an exercise glass at a gym which are currently able to go ahead.",
        "background": "There is no reason why venues with the space capacity cannot allow social distance dancing even if masks are required. This could be done from sectioning the flooring into squares etc. Allow us to dance again especially on a day as special as a wedding day.",
