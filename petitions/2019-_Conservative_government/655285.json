There is a disproportionate amount of men earning over \u00a3170k in the UK which may bias angel investment towards men.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we believe the limits should not be changed until this has been a further reviewed and steps taken to make sure we level up investment in female led businesses.\r\n",
