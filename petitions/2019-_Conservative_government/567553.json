        "additional_details": "Fishing has been clearly identified as a particularly safe and healthy activity during the COVID-19 pandemic - particularly on rivers and streams. The usual coarse fishing closed season would prevent many people from carrying out this safe activity for 3 months which may encourage less safe alternatives. I feel the loss of the fish stocks recovery period in March-June will be counteracted by the fishing ban during the national lockdown in January 21 onwards.",
        "background": "Suspend the coarse fishing closed season in 2021 (normally 15 March - 15 June) so that fishing can continue in this period on rivers and streams after the national lockdown and fishing ban due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
