        "additional_details": "Government already provide this but we want it to be made permanent so people don't have to worry about affording these products which we think are a necessity for having a better chance of education. We also would like to see a wider variety of products on the website allocated for staff to buy from as people have different preferences on products they would use. This will increase the attendance of female students which means their grades will improve.",
        "background": "We would like to keep the funding for sanitary products so people in educational areas can use them and feel comfortable in a school/collage environment. This is in place until 2024 but we would like this to become permanent as it supports people who can't afford products.",
