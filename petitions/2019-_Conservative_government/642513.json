        "additional_details": "I therefore require the government of the day,  to seek the approval of the British people for this net zero policy.   Via a national Referendum, using the question, do you agree to the government\u2019s current policy on Net-zero?   Voting in a general election when all major parties subscribe to this policy is NOT consent.   Seek consent from the British people with a national Referendum.  We are a democracy.",
        "background": "Whilst in office, the Rt Hon Tony Blair, made an arbitrary decision that the science around man-made climate change was settled.  Since then,  \u201cman-made\u201d has been dropped,  and the goal posts have consistently changed.   To penalise the people for the whims of politicians is wrong",
