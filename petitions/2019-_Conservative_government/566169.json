        "additional_details": "It is a threat to human life to keep schools open. As aforementioned,  the risk is high, and it's simply unfair to prioritise exams and school work over a Global Pandemic. The fact that the new stain is much more infectious, and children as young as 9 years old are dying from covid, shows it also poses a risk to the children themsekves, and not just those who come in contact with them.",
        "background": "Reclose all schools due to the high risk of catching Covid at the current time, which at the moment is way worse than when schools were closed in March. If they were closed then, why not now, when the risk is much greater?",
