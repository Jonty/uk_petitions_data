        "additional_details": "This petition urges a fair and compassionate approach to accommodation allocation, emphasising the need to recognize veterans' sacrifices. With a daily expenditure of \u00a310 million on asylum seeker accommodation, it proposes a priority system, placing those who served our nation at the forefront.\r\n \r\nOur veterans, dedicated to defending the UK's values, deserve a dignified housing response. Prioritising them not only honours their service but also addresses the pressing need for equitable resource distribution. Aligned with gratitude and responsibility to those who risked their lives for the country, this initiative seeks a balance between asylum seekers' needs and the unique requirements of veterans who significantly contributed to the UK's safety and prosperity.",
        "background": "We would like the Government to consider an allocation of hotel accommodation to homeless veterans akin to that given to asylum seekers who come to England and await processing.",
