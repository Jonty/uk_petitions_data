Time and time again we see some asylum seekers putting their lives at risk to illegally breach those borders. The UK Government then has to use millions of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money to defend laws made in Parliament to control our borders. We feel this is unacceptable. The ECHR should have no say on what happens in the UK.",
