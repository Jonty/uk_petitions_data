Given the difficulties getting appointments with these professionals we believe this is an unnecessary hurdle and adds to the burden on social care and the NHS.\r\n \r\nVAT exemption is also only available if the care provider is a charity, public body or regulated welfare provider. These services can be hard to access. All self funders deserve to choose the best provider for them, regardless of company status.\r\n",
