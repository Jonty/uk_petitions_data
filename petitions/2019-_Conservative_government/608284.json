Suicide, mental ill health, anxiety & depression are not getting any better & cases are not getting any lower. If you have a physical health problem, there is a good chance you will be seen for free on the same day but this doesn't apply for mental health & we need to treat it the same we do as physical health, as it is just as bad, if not worse to be suffering mentally.",
        "background": "Mental health problems keep rising, with so much campaigning around mental health but not enough services, help or support on offer, the government needs to put more funding into mental health in the NHS. Every GP surgery should offer a physical or mental health appointment with immediate support.",
