The HMLR\u2019s inaction leaves buyers & those who suffer encroachment to their property unprotected which can allow experts such as Surveyors/Structural Engineers/Solicitors & Insurance Companies to drop claims. The impact to those affected needs to be rectified. Introduce tribunals to handle complaints.",
