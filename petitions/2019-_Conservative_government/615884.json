Benefits like PIP often only pay for the treatment the individual needs and there is no more left for the month to live. With the cost of living rising so rapidly, these circumstances are becoming worse very quickly.\r\n\r\nThere are millions of people in this awful situation across the UK. The stress makes their conditions worse so there is no end to this vicious circle! The government have not looked at these issues ever!",
