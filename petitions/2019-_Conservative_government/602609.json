        "additional_details": "Walk into any high street retailer or look at any online store that sells computer games and you will see that a large portion of the games they are saying are merely a download code in a plastic case. This makes no sense as the purpose of the case was initially to protect the cartridge or disc inside. Without a physical item inside, the plastic case is just a waste - and the code can be easily purchase in a digital form.\r\nOutlawing the sale of these cases would be a net good for the environment.",
        "background": "I am calling on the UK Government and Parliament to ban the selling of  computer games codes in physical boxes. These codes do not need to be sold physically as they can be purchased online. Banning their sale would be a simple and effective way of reducing excess plastic.",
