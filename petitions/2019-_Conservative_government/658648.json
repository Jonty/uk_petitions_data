        "additional_details": "In the year to March 2023 knife crime had a 4.7% increase. Youths are some of the most vulnerable and affected by knife crime, and we believe education on the matter is important. Some young people have said they carry knives due to fears for their safety and requiring protection; they need support. Since 2010 there have been substantial cuts in youth support centres and we believe there is a lack of support services available. We want more youth support services as a priority to help prevent increasing knife crime rates.",
        "background": "We want the Government to increase knife crime education in the national curriculum and provide additional funding for more youth support services and youth centres.",
