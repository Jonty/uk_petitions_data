        "additional_details": "I would like the government to take action because we owe the people of Hong Kong more then a new home, they deserve there home. Not a new one.\r\nAlso Britain has always maintained that they would uphold the declaration and the people of Hong Kong are having human rights crimes committed against them and it is morally wrong to not put a stop to something of which the UK can actually help. The people of Hong Kong deserve better then being moved halfway across the world although helpful for some.",
        "background": "Make China uphold the 'The Sino-British joint declaration' signed on 19/12/84 in Beijing. Which should end in 2047. \r\nAction should be taken against the CCP for imposing speech and protest regulation contra to the agreement which sais Hong Kongs way of life and system will go unchanged for 50 years.",
