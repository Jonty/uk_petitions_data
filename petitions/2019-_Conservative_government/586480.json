        "action": "Increase the personal tax allowance of single working parents.",
        "additional_details": "A 'single parent' has very similar financial outgoings as 'double parents'; but with the added pressure of parenting alone, they may need to pay for extra childcare in order to work. As the current tax system taxes individually, it means a single parent household could be taxed more when entering a higher tax band, than a 'double parent household'. This seems unfair and can be rectified by increasing the personal tax allowance of single working parents (*or by taxing a 'households income').",
        "background": "I am asking parliament to increase the tax allowance for single working parent families. Single working parents are being penalized under the current tax system for striving to increase their 'household income', and may end up taxed more, but as a 'household' earn less, compared to 'double parents'.",
