If it wasn\u2019t for them and many other key workers there would be many more people dying. It will give the families who have lost loved ones a place for them to go and remember them. It will also show how much the whole NHS is held in high esteem by the hole country. The 4th plinth needs a monument befitting it\u2019s position and I think this is perfect.",
