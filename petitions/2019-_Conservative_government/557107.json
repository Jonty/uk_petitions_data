        "additional_details": "Unfortunately, there are many humans and animals who do not enjoy fireworks, e.g. many people with autism who are sensitive to noise. Many animals cannot explain their fear, suffering with crippling anxiety because of this.  \r\n\r\nOur recent vet bill for our 7 year old staffordshire bull terrier cost almost \u00a360 for three doses of a calming medicine. Why should we have to sedate our animals for others? \r\nWhy should someone endure a panic attack because of the booming noises, that sound war-like?",
        "background": "With government support, shops can introduce the sale of silent fireworks to the public. Bonfire night and New Years Eve fireworks are no longer one night, we have had countless weeks where fireworks are booming. The sale of silent fireworks were introduced by Sainsbury's, therefore it is possible.",
