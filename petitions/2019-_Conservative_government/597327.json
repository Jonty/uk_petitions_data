        "additional_details": "Currently, travellers from Hong Kong to UK with negative pre-flight PCR test and passenger locator form (i.e. day-2 test booked) do not need to quarantine. Many of them are fully vaccinated with Pfizer BioNTech. One stated reason of UK gov for the rule change is to enable people to return from half-term breaks. By leaving out HK from the list of recognised countries the rules unjustifiably prejudice HK parents visiting their children for half-term, and children returning from holidays in HK.",
        "background": "Recognise in-bound travellers from Hong Kong (currently on the green-list) who have been fully vaccinated with full course of Pfizer BioNTech for at least 14 days as \"fully vaccinated travellers from rest of the world\" in the international travel rules coming into effect on 4 October 2021.",
