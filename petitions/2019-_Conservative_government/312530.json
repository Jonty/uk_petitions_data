        "additional_details": "Many garden centres currently risk financial ruin, their busiest trading period over the next 3 months. They make a vital contribution to the nation's care of our natural world and wildlife in particular, promoting plants that attract bees and butterflies, both under serious decline. Gardening, whether we have a garden, a balcony or simply a table, helps us to keep physically and mentally well, both essential during this lockdown. Caring for plants helps us to care for ourselves and each other.",
        "background": "Add garden centres, nurseries etc to list of essential business permitted to trade during Coronavirus. Many don't have online sale of plants. Allow opening with restrictions, protecting staff and customers, similar to supermarkets. Most of us live within 2 - 5 miles or less, much like supermarkets.",
