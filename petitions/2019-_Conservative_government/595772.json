        "action": "Revert back to the Covid vaccine being Non mandatory!",
        "additional_details": "First of all, this goes against human rights! All vaccines have been NON mandatory since birth onwards. There is not enough testing on this vaccine, lots of serious side effects from it so far, and vaccines DO NOT protect other people, it protects us and should be a personal choice as to whether we want the vaccine or not. We are being forced out of our jobs if we refuse the jab!",
        "background": "Revisit the new law that states the covid vaccine will be mandatory for all NHS staff, care home staff and anyone who works in the care sector and make it non mandatory again!",
