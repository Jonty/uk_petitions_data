        "additional_details": "As a delivery driver I see everyday cases of road abuses. While laws become tougher on motorists, cyclists are left without proper supervision for their actions, putting their own lives at risk and potentially risking someone innocent being charged because if their inconsiderate actions. If a driver will be penalised for using mobile phone what is the difference for cyclists? Obstructing your perception of environment using earplugs is another example. Sign for tougher policing on cyclists.",
        "background": "Enforce rules for cyclists, similar to the ones for motorists. If being in a car and using your mobile phone is punishable for motorists it makes no difference for cyclists as they're putting their in own life at risk. Distraction doesn't ask what vehicle you're using.",
