        "additional_details": "This should reduce the number of rabbits who are sick, traumatised & unsocialised due to low-welfare breeding & selling environments, as well as meet the requirements of the Animal Welfare Act 2006, which states that animals should have a \u201csuitable environment\u201d and \u201cbe able to exhibit normal behaviour patterns\u201d. Research has shown there are prevalent welfare issues in the UK pet rabbit industry & banning third party sellers should make rabbit breeders more accountable. ",

Licensed breeders will be required to show the rabbit's birth certificate & meet certain licence conditions. ",
