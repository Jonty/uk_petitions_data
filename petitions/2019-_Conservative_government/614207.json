        "action": "Support continued public ownership of Channel 4",
        "additional_details": "The privatisation of Channel 4 will undermine existing public access to factual and credible news and world class public service broadcasting within the UK. The sell off of Channel 4 is a direct attack on independent, high-quality journalism. It is against the public interest and undermines jobs and investment in the creative sector. This will disproportionally affect the North and Yorkshire in particular, and is not consistent with the government's supposed 'levelling up' agenda.",
        "background": "The government has recently confirmed that it will go ahead with plans to sell off Channel 4. The government should reverse this decision.",
