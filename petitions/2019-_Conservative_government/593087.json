        "additional_details": "We know under the current deal junior doctors receive a 2% increase every year, however this is less than what the government offered the rest of the NHS at the measly 3%, they have not done less work than other NHS workers and therefore deserve to be properly compensated as all NHS staff do, with a minimum 15% pay rise across the board. \r\n\r\nIt is the government's job to listen to the people it represents, and the people of this country want the NHS, including ALL its hard-working staff to be rewarded properly. The NHS saved thousands of lives, now is the time for the government to give back. \r\n\r\nNHS staff have been underpaid for years, a minimum 15% pay rise backdated to April 2020 which the government can afford if it chose to despite the current economical situation is owed to them all.",
        "background": "We want all NHS staff to be properly rewarded for all their efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic. The recent 3% pay rise which excludes the 61,000 junior doctors is unacceptable, we demand a minimum 15% pay rise for all NHS staff, including the 61,000 junior doctors which the government overlooked.",
