        "additional_details": "This conference should explore the potential construction of a pipeline from the Black Sea to pump water to the dried up Aral Sea basin to restore the Aral Sea, which should reduce the effects of SLR.\r\n\r\nSLR will affect countless populations causing potentially trillions of dollars of damage. Cutting greenhouse gasses will only go so far. I propose a new plan of action to slow and reduce SLR by restoring the Aral Sea! It doesn't take a genius to realize that if you take water out of the ocean that it will reduce its overall volume. Once the Aral Sea is restored it should help stabilize global weather patterns and also absorb CO2 from the atmosphere thereby slowing global warming, climate change and SLR.",
