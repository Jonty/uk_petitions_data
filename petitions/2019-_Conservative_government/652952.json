        "additional_details": "This has put myself and many others in a position where we will not be able to bring our loved ones the U.K. I can understand tightening immigration rules but this feels like British citizens are being punished.  I have requested a wage rise from my company to try and meet this threshold. I am also in panic mode to try and rush this wedding through so I may obtain a spouse visa before April.",
        "background": "Reduce the salary income of \u00a338,700 to the median U.K. salary OR only check this requirement at spouse visa renewal. If checked on renewal, then it gives the foreign spouse a chance to obtain work when they get here. Both incomes can be combined to meet this requirement",
