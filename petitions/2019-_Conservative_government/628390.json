We need more to do more, by requiring health warnings on those ads - as seen on betting and smoking adverts - so people are made aware to the negative consequences of over-consumption of fast-food.\r\n",

Whilst rules restricting advertising for unhealthy foods online and before 9pm on TV have been a step forward, more needs to be done.",
