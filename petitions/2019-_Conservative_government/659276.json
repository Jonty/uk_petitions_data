        "additional_details": "Currently, a woman can only be charged with other sexual offences. While some of these offences carry the same maximum sentence as rape, I think the law is highly discriminatory as it\u2019s very phallocentric. The woman may be charged with what some consider a lesser offence as it isn't possible for them to be charged for rape. I believe this is not appropriate and unfair to victims.",
        "background": "The Sexual Offences Act 2003 states that only a man can commit rape. However, women can use other parts of the body to penetrate another person and use a male to penetrate themselves. Therefore, I think all penetration should be included in section 1 of the Act.",
