        "additional_details": "Like all nations on Earth, the UK depends on the Arctic Ocean as a global life support to keep us cool and healthy. But today it is under threat. There is 75% less Arctic sea ice today than 50 years ago, making the Arctic Ocean vulnerable to exploitation which further harms the ice. Less ice contributes to unstable global weather, food and water supply; and refugees, diseases and deaths. The MAPS Treaty would protect all life by designating the Arctic Ocean north of the Arctic Circle as an ocean preserve.",
        "background": "We want the Government to sign the Marine Arctic Peace Sanctuary Treaty to protect the citizens and ecosystems of the United Kingdom, and all life. The Treaty is an addendum to the UN Law of the Sea and enters into force with the signatures of 99 world leaders.",
