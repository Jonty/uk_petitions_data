However because I was not on PAYE before the 28th February I am now stuck at home looking to claim Universal Credit (which is currently swamped with applications) and will lose out on hundreds of pounds a month. I know there are hundreds if not thousands of others out there in a similar situation. Why are we being left to fend for ourselves whilst everyone else gets help?",
