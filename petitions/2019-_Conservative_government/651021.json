A suitable environment means big enough (100cmX50cmX50cm) and deep enough for the required amount of bedding (8\u201d). \r\n\r\nThere needs to be some enforcement to stop pet shops selling and marketing cages towards animals especially hamsters because this goes against legal requirements and current legislation. \r\nEvery animal has the right to the \u20185 welfare needs\u2019.",
