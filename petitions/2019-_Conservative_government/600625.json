        "additional_details": "Employment Tribunals are extremely abusive towards claimants, especially the unrepresented ones. Judges shout and even lie about the law to make claimants give up on their rights.  I noticed when there is an audience the judges behave better and often the outcome is better. When they are by themselves they don't even do the basics of the job such as an assessment. There is a high degree of discrimination as well. This is causing problems in the fabric of the society. Thank you!",
        "background": "At the moment no audio recordings are allowed at hearings but the tribunal and judges record ordinarily for their own purposes. Judges often change the history of events or get it wrong in judgments but claimants and their solicitors cannot prove it because there is no definitive proof.",
