I think it is important to maintain a healthy diet so that the body can work properly. There are people who get benefits because they don't have high paying jobs or are unemployed. They can use these benefits to buy food. However, I believe that people who suffer from medical conditions (in which a special diet is needed) should be allowed vouchers.",
