        "additional_details": "I am calling on the government to make changes within the travel sector to make it possible for every family to be able to follow the rules of the school and not be financially punished by taking their children on holiday during school holidays. More parents are disobeying the school rules and taking children on holiday during school time because it is cheaper to do so although this often leads to a fine, the fine is still cheaper then having to pay the price of a holiday during school holidays.",
        "background": "I am asking the government to put a stop to travel companies being aloud to double if not sometimes triple the price of holidays during school holidays. Parents are penalised with a fine for taking your child out of school for a holiday unyet travel companies use this to their advantage.",
