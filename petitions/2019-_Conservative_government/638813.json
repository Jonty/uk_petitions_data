        "action": "The government should fully fund the NHS AfC pay award for outsourced services",
        "additional_details": "All NHS workers should be treated equally, regardless of the management arrangements, Trusts or other corporate structures put in to manage them. Without government funding, services could be cut, NHS employees will not receive their due pay, or fewer NHS staff will be recruited. This risks creating a two-tier NHS system, which will reduce patient care, reduce staff morale, and increase stress and concerns around mental health. NHS staff are not valued - this needs correction immediately.",
        "background": "Government to fund the non-consolidated aspect of the AfC pay award agreed on 2nd May 2023. NHS community services, and other care providers managed through Social Enterprises, Local Authorities and charities, are expected to fund this one-off payment for 2022 with no assistance from government.",
