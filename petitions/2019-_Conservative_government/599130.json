Update employment laws to facilitate the removal of unvaccinated staff in schools.\r\nMandatory vaccination has been introduced for people working or deployed in care homes, where residents can be vaccinated, and the same must be urgently implemented in schools to ensure children who are not eligible for vaccination are not deprived of any more of their education.\r\nA number of countries are implementing compulsory COVID vaccination in school staff.",

There are many instances of unvaccinated adults bringing the infection into schools and disrupting education for many children. Families can do no more than vaccinate themselves.",
