If a domesticated animal this can affect the owners as animals are seen as part of the family. \r\n\r\nSomething needs to be done, a free service or a number that we can call 24/7 to help collect and hopefully treat the animal. \r\n\r\nWe tried to call 101 and each time was directed to a website, this service needs to be improved.",

She was then ran over by another car killing her. It was distressing and no living thing should have their life ended like that.",
