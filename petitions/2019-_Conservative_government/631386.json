Statutory guidance sets out what it expects students to be taught, but leaves it to individual schools to decide how to deliver this. This means children can receive wildly varying standards of education on the subject. We want the Government to commission a comprehensive learning package that all schools are mandated to teach to achieve those outcomes.",
