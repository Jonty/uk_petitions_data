The opportunity for young people to work and travel almost anywhere in Europe is something many people can now only dream of rather than turn it into a reality, even when many young people voted to remain.\r\n \r\nWhilst we all respect democracy and vote leave won, I believe young Britons should still get a chance to experience living and working in an EEA country of their choice whilst young.",

Agreements are already in place for Canada, Australia, New Zealand etc. However, since Brexit opportunities, to work and live in the EEA are limited.",
