Production of compost, then used in farming has a number of benefits. \r\n\r\nCarbon is sequestered into the soil so carbon in the atmosphere is reduced. \r\nSoil structure is improved so desertification is reduced.\r\nSoil has a greater ability to absorb water, so less flooding, water run off, pollution of waterways. \r\nSoil has more nutrients, microbes can grow, these increase the amount of carbon removed from the atmosphere.",
