        "action": "Review the form of assessment for GCSE, A-Level and BTEC students (Year 10-13)",
        "additional_details": "The cancellation of exams for 2 academic years & the closure of schools & colleges, have shown that high weighting examinations sat in the summer are not required to assess a student\u2019s capability. The extremely stressful exams process does not fully highlight a student\u2019s academic ability, and often, their best work. Through other forms of assessment, students can establish a proper work ethic by consistently trying their best throughout the year rather than cramming in the weeks before.",
        "background": "Re-assess the idea of 80-100% exam for most qualifications at the end of the course. Replace with other forms of assessment such as coursework (with strict regulations), assignments, graded homework & lesser weighted standardised examinations sat throughout the year rather than all during the summer",
