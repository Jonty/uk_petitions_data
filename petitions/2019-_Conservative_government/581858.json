I feel that vulnerable, disabled people should have an equal right to refuse to be cared for by someone who provides personal care who is not vaccinated.\r\nDisabled and vulnerable people have an equal right to protect their health.\r\nCurrently organisations that provide personal care are requiring all newly recruited staff to be vaccinated.    This principle should apply to all staff.",
