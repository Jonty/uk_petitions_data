The debt Ukraine has is estimated be one third of the country's total economy.\r\n\r\nUkraine's debt repayment requirements this year are over $7.3 billion, which is more than its annual education budget.\r\n\r\nSince 2014 Ukraine has had to borrow $61 billion and the damage done since the Russian invasion is estimated to be $100 billion. Ukraine cannot possible afford to repay this and so the debt needs to be cancelled",
