Then they could find themselves facing deportation with nothing to go back to, which can cause mass depression to people affected. We believe that an immigrant who came in legally should not be blamed or penalised for the mistakes or wrong doings of their sponsors. Kindly create another way for them to continue to live and work in the UK legally.",
