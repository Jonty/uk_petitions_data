Now because we can\u2019t go to games they are putting more on tv but now charging extra on top of a very expensive subscription. This is unethical. We already pay a tv licence. This is so so wrong in so many ways. They are exploiting fans to get more in there coffers. And we are all facing uncertain futures financially right now.",
        "background": "This is totally unacceptable, we already pay very high subscriptions and now they are squeezing more money from people who love there football that can\u2019t currently watch teams for obvious reasons. Plus people are losing jobs and on furlough. This is pure greed and should be stopped immediately.",
