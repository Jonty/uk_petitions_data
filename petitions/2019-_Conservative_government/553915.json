The wait times are escalating and the only way to stop this upwards trend is an informed consent model. This will allow the wait times to decrease, a better doctor to patient relationship, and better access to healthcare which is what the NHS is meant to be about. This will because rather than lots of people going to a few locations they will be spread out more.",
