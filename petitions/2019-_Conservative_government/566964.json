        "additional_details": "Children in early years setting cough on each other, staff members cuddle them and change their nappies. Even in a bubble system it is still a very high risk. Even after sterilising and lots of measures in place, it is still an unnecessary risk, especially now that schools have been closed. \r\n\r\nClose early years settings to all but key workers and furlough the employees that aren't needed for the lesser numbers.",
        "background": "After the latest announcement, schools will be closed but key workers who need childcare are still allowed in. However, nurseries and other early years setting remain open as usual. This is putting staff and children at risk.\r\nRestrict the numbers in nurseries and allow the same rules to be applied.",
