        "additional_details": "I want the government to discuss the reasons for why Ribena (company) has changed the lucozade recipe after many enjoyable years . People are now not willing to buy lucozade because why would you change something that is already so well loved ! It\u2019s dreadful and something needs to be sorted . Also another point, why the half packaging it\u2019s not like you are reducing plastic because half of the bottle is now clear plastic which  defeats the whole object of making lucozade look disproportionate!",
        "background": "Bring back old Lucozade original. Lucozade lovers are distraught by the change of recipe. And this is really effecting the people who literally LIVE on Lucozade original 24/7 and has had the same recipe since 1927 and it is DISGUSTING that they are willing to change the recipe.",
