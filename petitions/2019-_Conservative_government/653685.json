If courier companies can\u2019t ring the bell and wait for an answer, and if there is no answer then try a neighbour or try again next day, then they should be fined by a regulator. Royal Mail manages, in the main, to deliver parcels direct to the customer or leave a card offering a redelivery or collection. Couriers should be obliged to do the same.",
        "background": "The standard of parcel deliveries by couriers has declined substantially in recent years. The normal procedure now seems to be: Drop the parcel on the doorstep and leave. They don\u2019t even ring the doorbell, let alone wait for you to answer the door.",
