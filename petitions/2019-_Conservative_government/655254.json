        "additional_details": "Car seats tested at such low speeds risk putting children in increased danger. I think there needs to be a new regulation in place which requires all car seats to be tested at higher speeds. I think this should follow the Swedish Plus Test, which considers impact to the head and neck and uses more through criteria when testing seats, to help protect children in crashes.",
        "background": "Regulations allow car seat manufacturers to crash test to as little as 32mph (frontal) or 18mph (rear). This means we can't know how car seat would perform in a crash above that speed. Many parents might be unaware of this, as it isn\u2019t against the law, and trust the seats are safe at higher speeds.",
