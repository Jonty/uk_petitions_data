        "action": "Pay parental leave for parents of school age children during the Covid crisis",
        "additional_details": "The furlough scheme and Universal and Tax Credits exclude so many people, school closures are random and without notice, causing working parents extreme difficulty in fulfilling work commitments and caring for their children, as well as educating them at home. The government needs to create paid parental leave for every day that parents cannot work. This should be available to all parents, and claimable directly for the days missed. Employers must not be made to foot this bill.",
        "background": "The Covid crisis has created a vast array of financial challenges for families. At no point has the government globally addressed the impact of school closures, or periods of children being sent home with no notice, and how this affects parents ability to work. They need to do this urgently.",
