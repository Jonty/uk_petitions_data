Blanket DNRs have been issued to some of the most vulnerable people in order to spare beds and cut costs. Human lives are being cut short for the sake of budgets. We cannot allow this to continue. This is inhumane. End this now. We are all human beings and have a right to life. Money does not have a higher value than human life.",
