        "additional_details": "It is currently illegal to resell football tickets for a higher price than they were originally sold. This law does not apply for reselling of tickets for other forms of entertainment (eg music concerts).\r\n\r\nThere are reseller websites such as Viagogo etc, which allow people to sell on their tickets for whatever price they want to, often for a massive profit.\r\n\r\nThis prices out real fans and causes a huge, unnecessary demand when tickets first go on sale. Resale should be allowed but not for profit.",
