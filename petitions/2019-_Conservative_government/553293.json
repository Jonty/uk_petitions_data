        "additional_details": "The Government should prohibit universities from increasing tuition fees during Covid-19, including for international students, since the situation for all people is hard. Taking me as an example, last academic year my tuition fees were \u00a38750 pounds for a semester and this year it is \u00a39100 pounds. I hope that the Government will address this problem and protected students from increases in tuition fees.",
        "background": "Covid-19 has changed how universities are delivering courses, with many moving to online lectures. Given this, tuition fees should have fallen, or at least remained the same, since because of the impact of Covid-19 on university courses. However, some universities have increased tuition fees.",
