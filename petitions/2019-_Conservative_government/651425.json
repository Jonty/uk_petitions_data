        "additional_details": "An inquiry should look at the reasons for this disparity and the implications of it. It should also look at the nutrition education that vet students receive. We believe that the health and welfare of pets is best served by foods, such as raw meaty bones, that reflect the full range of nutritional need; not processed food.\r\nMPs were aware of this issue in 2004: https://edm.parliament.uk/early-day-motion/26858\r\n\r\nPlease investigate and launch an inquiry into this important issue.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Doctors recommend fresh, minimally processed food to help prevent diet-related diseases, but some members of the veterinary profession have endorsed processed food for pets. Concerns have been raised that some members of the profession have an inappropriate relationship with the pet food industry.",
