We believe that the health and welfare of pets is best served by foods, such as raw meaty bones, that reflect the full range of nutritional need; not processed food.\r\nMPs were aware of this issue in 2004: https://edm.parliament.uk/early-day-motion/26858\r\n\r\nPlease investigate and launch an inquiry into this important issue.\r\n\r\n",

Concerns have been raised that some members of the profession have an inappropriate relationship with the pet food industry.",
