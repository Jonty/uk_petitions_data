        "additional_details": "Invisible from the outside, Hospitality in the U.K. is suffering its biggest staffing shortage crisis in history. \r\n\r\nThis perfect storm is caused by:\r\n\r\n- Pandemic created a veil of insecurity within the industry, driving people to change careers.\r\n- Brexit and working Visa regulations, reduced the inflow of hospitality professionals.\r\n- Current Covid-19 quarantine rules that prevent settled workers from coming back.\r\n- Salary of \u00a325600 required to be eligible for a working Visa in the U.K.",
        "background": "Hospitality being a low-profit industry often pays its employees very close to the NMW. \r\n\r\nThe current salary requirement of \u00a325600 prevents entry-level workers from abroad from effectively running the industry. \r\n\r\nBeing part of the Occupation Shortage List can help alleviate the crisis.",
