        "action": "Review recent energy strategy to make planning for onshore wind turbines easier",
        "additional_details": "Debate the planning legislation with regard to onshore wind to put it on a par with a war footing due to the urgent nature and vulnerability of the climate emergency and energy crisis. Consider permitted development on existing wind turbine sites to permit a blade tip height of 119m. Similarly, planning legislation with regards to wayleaves, easements for   infrastructure and grid connections  with a view to streamline and simplify planning and connections for onshore wind.",
        "background": "There is an energy crisis and climate emergency now. Onshore wind turbines are cheap, effective and quick to install. Onshore wind linked with Hydrogen storage would be a good way to provide clean green renewable energy 100% of the time quicker than the governments proposed strategy.",
