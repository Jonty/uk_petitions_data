        "additional_details": "Planting a forest is a positive action both in terms of improving our environment and creating a landscape through which citizens can walk and exercise. We could create a national forest or localised woodlands as spaces of remembrance and hope. We need something tangible to pay tribute to lost lives - so victims are never forgotten. And the forest/woodland could be used as a platform to educate citizens about habits to maintain good health in the future and how to respect nature.",
        "background": "Many UK citizens are personally touched by the loss of life due to covid 19, many of whom have been unable to grieve e.g. attend a funeral, or say farewell to a loved one. Many are left alone dealing with an intangible loss and no support. A tree signifies life/regrowth and is a living tribute.",
