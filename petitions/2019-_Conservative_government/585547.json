        "additional_details": "The absence of Government intervention in horse welfare has led to going equine crises. Over-breeding is a major cause of problems. The Government needs to address this issue by setting clear limits on the number of foals born annually. All breeders would need to apply for a licence to breed horses. There would be significant sanctions for anyone breeding horses without a licence or breeding more horses than licensed to do so, including anyone sending horses to slaughter.",
        "background": "Unrestricted horse breeding has led to an excessive number of equines. The result is the slaughter of thousands of horses each year. We call on the Government to introduce a national limit on the number of equines that can be produced by horse breeders, reducing the number of unwanted horses.",
