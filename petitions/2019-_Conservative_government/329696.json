        "action": "Condemn China for its gross human rights abuses of Uyghur citizens in Xinjiang",
        "additional_details": "Uyghurs have lived in Xinjiang for thousands of years. Xinjiang has been home to many Uyghur families for generations and the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) is attempting to eradicate their very existence. The Chinese government is detaining thousands of Uyghurs without trial, forcibly splitting up Uyghur children from their parents and taking them into state care, preventing Uyghurs from practicing Islam and now forcing Uyghur women to abort their unborn children and take birth control. This is unacceptable and abhorrent and as a tolerant, democratic nation we have a responsibility to put a stop to this.",
        "background": "The UK government is a significant middle power that has considerable global influence. The FCO and other senior figures in government should use their influence to condemn China for its repression against Uyghurs and encourage China to urgently rethink its birth control and mass detention policy.",
