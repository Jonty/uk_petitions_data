Yet we see MP's and members of the house of Lord's eating and drinking lavishly with subsides monies from the tax payer. The members of the house of Lords  are even getting paid lavish sums to attend. They treat it like a private members club. We have Matt Hancock in the Jungle when getting paid as a sittIng MP and getting a huge cheque from TV",
