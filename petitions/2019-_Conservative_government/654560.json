        "additional_details": "We believe the current approach to mental health training for teachers is economically inefficient and treats mental health education as additional knowledge when it should be a basic standard that all teachers have a right to.\r\n\r\nThis change would give teachers the ability to adapt lessons for students, intervene in concerning situations and better understand their own mental health.\r\n\r\nWe believe the best way to create a profession educated in mental health is by writing it into QTS standards.",
        "background": "In 2018, Sam, my 15 year old younger brother took his own life. It was an unexpected and unbearable loss.\r\nWe know that the suicide rate for people aged 15-19 is the highest in 30 years and 75% of mental illnesses arise by 18. All teachers, as a basic requirement, deserve training on mental health.",
