        "additional_details": "I would like the government to renegotiate and rejoin ERASMUS, a scheme which has given so many opportunities to many thousands of students. Such opportunities  are now  possible only for the privileged few which is certainly not anyone's idea of a level playing field or social mobility.",
        "background": "The ERASMUS scheme for UK students allowed them to study in another EU country for a year. This was a reciprocal arrangement from which all countries benefited enabling an exchange of ideas and cultures. It  also gave UK academics a smooth path to visit and engage with colleagues in Europe.",
