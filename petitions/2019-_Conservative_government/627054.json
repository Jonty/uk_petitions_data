        "action": "Rishi Sunak must apologise for calling climate activists lunatics.",
        "additional_details": "The term lunatic stems from the Victorian era when many of the current day sufferers from depression, anxiety and other mental disorders, whether chronic, caused by life events, post-natal etcetera risked being called mad and interred. \r\n\r\nWe have moved on as a society and many, charities, businesses, individuals, celebrities and royals, campaign about mental health awareness and how \"its ok not to be ok\".  This should apply to climate anxiety too.\r\n\r\nThis is whipping up hatred, division and alienation, none of which generally are good for the nation's mental health.",
        "background": "Rishi Sunak's language is not fitting for a prime minister and leader of a peaceful democracy, is socially divisive and harmful to those suffering with mental health issues.",
