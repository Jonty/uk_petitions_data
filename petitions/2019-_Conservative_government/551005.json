        "action": "Remove children under 12 from the Rule of 6 coronavirus restrictions in England.",
        "additional_details": "It will make life very difficult for any family with young children to see their family, wm  Children are less affected by coronavirus and science is showing they spread the virus less, and as a lot of these children are already mixing with many others at school/childcare it is crazy that they can't see family due to an arbitrary limit.  Family support is even more vital in times such as this pandemic and this restriction severely limits the help available to families with young children.",
        "background": "The new restrictions only allowing a maximum of 6 to meet anywhere will make it really difficult for any families with young children to meet anyone else. The Scottish government has taken this into account.  We want the English government to follow suit and not include under 12s in the 'Rule of 6'.",
