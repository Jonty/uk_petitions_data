        "additional_details": "Language Matters. It\u2019s important for the government and parliament to keep the pledge in the Women\u2019s Health Strategy, which states that they will work with NHS bodies to ensure \u201cthat there is appropriate use of sex-specific language to communicate matters that relate to women\u2019s and men\u2019s individual health issues, and their different biological needs.\u201d It is very traumatising for many women when sex-specific words are erased, because it makes us feel we have no value as women.",
        "background": "The Government\u2019s Women\u2019s Health Strategy for England states that sex-based language matters. We want the government to ensure all NHS hospitals, and agencies that work within the framework outlined in the strategy, use the words \u201cwoman\u201d and \u201cmother\u201d rather than gender-neutral alternatives.",
