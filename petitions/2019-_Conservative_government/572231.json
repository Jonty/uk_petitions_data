        "additional_details": "An investigation will show the responsibility the press has had in making the covid19 fight harder for the govt and health professionals and has not been holding govt to account, it\u2019s caused hate and much derision in communities and their responsibility in the negativity they\u2019ve created must be held to account. Had they worked with govt and health, the messaging around keeping safe and sticking to rules would have been positive and brought the country together.",
