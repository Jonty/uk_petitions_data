        "additional_details": "The government should offer a full or partial refund to students of their loans to reflect the online teaching. Whilst online teaching in many cases is good it is not as good as in person teaching! \r\nAlso, those of us who have been virtually attending Universities will see longer lasting impacts on us in areas such as the job market!\r\nThe government and parliament should reflect this by offering a refund proportional to the lose of teaching time, access to resources, and work spaces.",
        "background": "Due to the new announcement that students are to be stopped from going back to in person teaching this summer term it seems appropriate that a full or partial refund should be made to students to reflect this.",
