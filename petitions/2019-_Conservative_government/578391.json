        "additional_details": "After witnessing the utter devastation to families caused when a loved one is lost as a result of dangerous driving it became clear reform is needed. The existing sentences applied for this offence are not appropriate. How can taking a person\u2019s life result in a 4-year sentence serving 2 years inside. It is a complete insult to the families. We believe an average sentence of 10 years would be respectful to those lives lost, alongside a lifetime ban on driving.",
        "background": "Realise the everlasting impact to families of the deceased. People who are convicted of death by dangerous driving should face increased custodial sentences, and be banned from driving for life. Introduce a true deterrent that may help save lives on our roads.",
