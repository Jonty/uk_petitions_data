There needs to be stricter laws against dog and cat theft and heavier fines and punishments.\r\nThis needs to be laid down by the government as there are some vile people and groups who are stealing cats and dogs off the street, burgling houses for them, for breeding and selling on, then just dumping these beloved pets miles from home when no longer needed or not suitable for breeding or selling.",
