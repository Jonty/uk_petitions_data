        "action": "Make it mandatory for Staff & Pupils to wear a face mask in School during Covid.",
        "additional_details": "Public transport already requires people of all ages to wear a face mask, and a majority of 11-19 year old people travel to school using public transport. This means they are required to wear a mask to and from school but not during. \r\nOlder members of staff who are vulnerable will be put at risk by attending school in September. This may result in a stop-&-start education for a majority of schools. The online model was highly successful and if supported can act as a path to a strong education.",
        "background": "Scientific advice shows that people of all ages are vulnerable to Covid-19. It should be a mandatory uniform requirement for pupils and staff members to wear a face mask or face covering in order to control the virus and save the lives of both British teachers and British pupils.",
