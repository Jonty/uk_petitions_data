        "additional_details": "The Prime Minster has said the UK is driving for a high wage, high skill economy. The UK Real Living Wage is currently estimated at \u00a39.90/hour which translates to \u00a319305 per year (for a 37.5 hour working week). People should be able to earn the basic level of living without taxation to ensure they can meet their families\u2019 basic needs. This would reward work and put money back in workers\u2019 pockets. Recouping this funding from high earners would also assist in levelling this country.",
        "background": "The current income tax personal allowance is \u00a312570. The lowest earners will suffer most from the recent soaring cost of living. Increasing the personal allowance to \u00a319305, in line with the UK Living Wage, would put working people first and help the economy with a motivated workforce.",
