Furthermore, it is a danger to everyone who inhales the fumes of smoke as they too inhale the toxic chemicals found in tobacco and smoke. This can also increase their risk of developing smoking related diseases.\r\n \r\nIt is also bad for the environment as almost 4.5 trillion cigarettes pollute our skies and rivers each year. New Zealand has implemented similar laws.\r\n",
