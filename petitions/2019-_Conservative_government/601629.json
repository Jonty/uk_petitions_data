        "action": "Ban the mining of and trade in \"proof of work\" cryptocurrencies within the UK.",
        "additional_details": "The computers used to mine Bitcoin are specialised, can't be repurposed and rapidly become obsolete. This generates a lot of electronic waste. Recent estimates have concluded that mining operations consume 4% of specialised semiconductor manufacturing and 20% of all graphics card sales. A ban on proof of work based cryptocurrencies, would not be a full ban on cryptocurrencies but would instead incentivise them to move to more environmentally friendly mining algorithms such as proof of stake.",
        "background": "Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin are all popular cryptocurrencies which use proof of work to secure transactions. Proof of work is incredibly wasteful: current estimates suggest that it currently uses around 0.5% of the world's electricity. We cannot afford this waste if we want to reach net zero.",
