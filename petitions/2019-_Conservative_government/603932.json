        "additional_details": "The government must introduce urgent reform & nationalise care homes. The elderly should not face bargaining in their time of need for care. If elderly people are admitted to hospital & their condition worsens, the NHS pay for the 1st 4 weeks of admittance to a care home so hospital beds can be freed. If they are a couple it becomes difficult to admit them to the same care home as rates need to be negotiated. Couples are split by the system which is not caring but degrading & needs to be stopped",
        "background": "The government is treating our elderly like slaves with their care being priced & used for bargaining. Couples who have been together many years face being separated in the last years of their lives & not being placed in the same care home due to Care Homes & Social Services negotiating rates.",
