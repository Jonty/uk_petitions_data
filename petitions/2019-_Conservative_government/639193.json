        "additional_details": "Please put a ban on garden strimmer use, to be run alongside the ban on cutting agricultural hedges through the bird nesting season, as the hedgehog breeding/nesting season takes place around the same time. It could help to save many hedgehogs being killed. The ban should apply to domestic gardens, businesses, and also council workmen clearing hedgerows and wasteland as well.",
        "background": "Hedgehogs are in decline and every year many hedgehogs are seriously injured or killed by strimmers and mowers. We want the Government to ban the use of strimmers during the hedgehog breeding season. This should apply to domestic gardens, businesses and council workmen clearing public land.",
