        "additional_details": "Currently families are left without appropriate support in the community until crisis point. Often, when crisis point is reached children are placed on Child in need plans or removed. Due to the lack of funding in CWD departments our children are not receiving appropriate assessments by specially trained social workers that have an in-depth understanding of our children\u2019s difficulties and what they need. There is a lack of support currently and parent blaming. Early intervention is key.",
