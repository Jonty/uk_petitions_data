        "additional_details": "The UK has a huge number of sporting professionals, young and training athletes that travel year-round to Europe to train and compete. Wintersports, for example, can have athletes training and competing over 8 months of the year. Now, with many athletes self-funded and potentially each country asking for its own visa per trip, this will become impossible due to cost if there is this limit of 90 in 180 days travel. \r\n\r\nPlease negotiate a visa-free permit for athletes and sporting professionals!",
        "background": "Under the new agreement with the EU, British nationals can only travel for 90 in 180 days. I would like the government to work with the EU for visa-free permits to allow sporting professionals, athletes and young athletes to travel freely for training and competition across the 27 member states.",
