Currently companies do not discourage the use of this single use packaging as it provides a far reaching opportunity for widespread community advertising both when the packaging is in use and when it is littered. Once packaging doesn't work for them, then companies will look to cut costs by encouraging refillable and reusable packaging solutions instead.",

All takeaway food and drink containers must instead only display information regarding the correct disposal of the used packaging and providing this information should be mandatory.",
