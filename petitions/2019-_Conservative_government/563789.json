        "additional_details": "Teachers are the backbone for the nation. By stopping the funding for salaried route is becoming a barrier for many experienced people to pursue teaching as a career because they would not want finance or loan.  Therefore, the Government should withdraw decisions about cutting the fund for salaried routes into teaching and allow schools to train more teachers who are experienced and will be able to bring their expertise into teaching and developing learning for our future generation.",
        "background": "We are already in shortage of teachers. So the Government has put a stop to provide funding for schools to run salaried route into primary teaching.",
