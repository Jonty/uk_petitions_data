        "additional_details": "Giving us 3 weeks to cramp 6 months of missing work into if adding more unnecessary stress on young minds. We are already stressed enough about our futures without having to worry about getting all this work done in 3 weeks. We don\u2019t want longer to study we want 6 months worth of content reduced. I personally feel like the government shouldn\u2019t decide what gets reduced they should send every school a selection and the students vote depending on their own strengths and weaknesses.",
