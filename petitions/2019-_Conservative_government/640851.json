Treatment may require radiotherapy, surgery and inevitably medication.  Surgery is usually the last resort as it can lead to Hypothyroidism instead.",

This could cover people who have Hyperthyroidism (Overactive Thyroid), where this has a a \u2018substantial\u2019 and \u2018long-term\u2019 negative effect on their ability to do normal daily activities.\r\n\r\nThe Personal Independence Payment is paid to people who have a health condition or disability which causes difficulties with daily living or getting around. PIP is paid based on the difficulties causes by a health condition or disability, but there are not particular conditions which result in PIP being paid.
