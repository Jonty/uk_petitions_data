        "additional_details": "NHS workers are dying as a result of their exposure to corona virus. This is exacerbated by a shortage or effective personal protective equipment (PPE). The Government need to take action to make sure that there is support for the children under 18 who lose a parent as a result of undertaking their vocation by supporting the most vulnerable at their time of need in the NHS. This is real concern for NHS staff who have young children.",
        "background": "NHS workers are going above and beyond the call of duty by continuing to work shifts with patients with the highly contagious COVID-19. There are an increasing number of NHS staff dying and many staff are worried about the future of the children under 18 left behind.",
