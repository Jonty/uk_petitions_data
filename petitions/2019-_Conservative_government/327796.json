        "additional_details": "Black people were ten times more likely to be searched than white people in 2018/19. Reducing 'no suspicion' searches will direct police resources into more effective areas, such as intelligence-led policing. Evidence suggests stop and search has a marginal impact on crime reduction, is damaging to police community relations and can have a detrimental impact on effective community policing - searches more often find low level drugs. \r\n\r\nRef: Police Stop and Search briefing paper, House of Commons Library\r\nhttps://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/home-affairs/communities/stop-and-search-powers-extension-of-no-suspicion-searches/",
        "background": "The Government repealed the scheme with the aim of tackling violent crime (2019). However, research suggests this is not what it is being used for, and at least some aspects of it should be reintroduced by all Police Forces. The scheme ensures that powers are only used when absolutely necessary.",
