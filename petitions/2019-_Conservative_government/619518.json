        "additional_details": "Battery degradation is one of the major factors limiting the usable life of electric and hybrid cars. Replacement batteries are expensive and usually only supplied by car manufacturers. If all vehicles shared a common and modular battery design, a market could exist for replacement batteries with many manufacturers providing similar and interchangeable products. This should bring down the cost for consumers, extend the life of vehicles on the road and reduce the environmental impact of motoring.",
