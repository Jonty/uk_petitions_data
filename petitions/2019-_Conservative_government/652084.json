        "additional_details": "Increasing the notional budget could mean, that school won't need to request for an EHC plan assessment from their local authority as frequently as they do now. As central budget could cover the rising costs of teachers and TA. Putting less pressure on local authorities and more power for schools to provide intervention. The element 2 budget was set in 2014, there has been significant pay rises and increase of children with SEND. Increasing the notional budget could help those expenses to be paid.",
        "background": "I want the government to increase the notional budget of \u00a36000 given to schools to help children and young people with SEN to match current economical climate. This funding was set back in 2014 and hasn't increased even though school staff pay has. Schools and children with SEND are losing out.",
