        "additional_details": "So many dog owners don\u2019t realise how Rawhide is produced and aren\u2019t aware of the potential dangers. Rawhide has no nutritional benefit but can contain toxic chemicals. I believe Rawhide poses a massive risk to dogs and therefore should be banned.",
        "background": "Rawhide can be dangerous. It\u2019s hard to digest and can remain in their system causing blockages and has been known to kill. It\u2019s a by-product of the leather industry, Rawhide isn\u2019t meat, it\u2019s a leather chew. It can cause teeth breakage when pressed or glued as it can be very dense and hard.",
