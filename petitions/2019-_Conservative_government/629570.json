It certainly does not make us appear to be world leaders in the environmental field",
        "background": "The mine will provide coking coal for UK\u2019s steel industry but have massive implications on carbon emissions & environmental health. 85% would be exported. Greener alternatives are available, and if invested, could create a number of greener jobs. In addition, the demand for coking coal is declining",
