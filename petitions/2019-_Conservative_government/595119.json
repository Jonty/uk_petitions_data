It\u2019s a basic human right to make a choice and that choice is being taken away. With mostly all the elderly in care homes having taken the jab, and workers required to take LFT and PCR tests multiple times a week (as well as PPE) the chances of coronavirus outbreak as low. Do not take the choice away.",

It\u2019s forcing a percentage of workers to go against there basic human rights in order to keep there jobs. Abolish the law, just keep it as mandatory.",
