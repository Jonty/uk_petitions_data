At the very least capped with strict guidelines in place and limits to what can be expensed.",

We have high fuel prices, high food prices, high rental and mortgage prices and low salaries. \r\n\r\nThis is forcing a large majority of the U.K. people into poverty. At the same time we have members of parliament on good wages who are claiming expenses.",
