        "action": "Renationalise the water industry",
        "additional_details": "Since the water industry was privatised in 1989 sewage pollution has gradually spiralled out of control, causing enormous environmental harm, damage to tourism and coastal economies and risking public health.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile greedy, profiteering water companies are making record profits, led by directors earning millions of pounds per year. This money could be reinvested into upgrading the sewerage infrastructure to a modern standard.",
        "background": "Privitisation has failed. The government must take control of the water industry once again and fix the sewerage network which is not fit for purpose, with sewage pollution rampant and an estimated 3,112,700,000 litres of water lost to leaks every day.",
