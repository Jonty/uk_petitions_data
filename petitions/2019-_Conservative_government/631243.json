        "additional_details": "The 2022/23 A-Level class is the class that lost out on the majority of their GCSE years, (Year 10, 2020 & Year 11, 2021) and this has had a long-term impact on many students. Many current A Level students are struggling as a result of the impact of the pandemic on their GCSE education, and this is hindering AS & A Level performance.\r\n \r\nWe want the Government to work with Ofqual to ensure that A Level students are graded as generously in 2023 as they were in 2022, to reflect the disruption this group has experience.",
