        "additional_details": "Also there is a discrimination on girls who are masking behaviours outside, internalised anxiety causing outbursts when in a safe place. \r\nDiscrimination also of high functioning kids who are doing not bad enough to get any help on ADHD or ASD is unacceptable. This can unfortunately end in anorexia, boulimia, depression, self harm, suicidal thoughts, more likely to be bullied at school, and then it is already too late to act. Early assessments are necessary to prevent this in teenage years.",
        "background": "CAMHS is very often blaming parents for insecurity attachment or abusive neglected parenting when it has been proved it is genetic. This is delaying diagnosis and help, causing more harm on loving parents. \r\nCAMHS need more training urgently. Their wrong judgement is causing more harm than help.",
