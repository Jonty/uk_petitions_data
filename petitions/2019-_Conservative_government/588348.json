        "additional_details": "In an ever-progressing society where change is being made for trans and non-binary people to feel accepted, Mx is still not an option widely practised in the UK on forms. This gives gendernonconforming people limits on how to declare themselves in a legal sense, leading many of them to still choose the title associated with their assigned gender at birth, or choosing titles that deliberately don't reflect their status, such as Rev, Dr or Dame, just to make their point.",
        "background": "When filling in legal forms relating to the public sector (education, healthcare, etc.) include the honorary title Mx as a standard option alongside Mr, Mrs, Miss etc. It is still inconsistent across services, eg. accepted on driving licenses but often not when registering to a GP.",
