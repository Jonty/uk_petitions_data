The burden of critical illness is well documented yet many patients receive little or no support after discharge from hospital.  NICE Guideline CG83 has not been widely implemented. Many patients are left to try and recover alone, which leads to distress, anxiety and the risk of not achieving optimal recovery, hospital readmissions or not being able to return to work.\r\n\r\nRehabilitation needs to include assessment, information, outpatient meetings and access to community services, including multi-disciplinary physical, psychological and cognitive support",
