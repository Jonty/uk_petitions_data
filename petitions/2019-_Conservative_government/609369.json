Many disabilities are hidden or not discovered. If there was more support from secondary schools for these pupils this would not be such an issue, but in the current situation this change would be unacceptable.",

Penalising students who do not achieve certain grades by barring them from student loans is totally unfair. Many will not otherwise be able to afford to go to university.",
