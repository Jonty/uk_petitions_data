Older drivers are retiring and often cannot be replaced.\r\n \r\nI think that enabling qualified car drivers to operate 16 passenger seat minibuses for school transport could free professional PCV drivers from home to school transport work, and they could be better utilised for larger PCV work, helping to create a stronger workforce and increasing opportunities within the industry.\r\n",
