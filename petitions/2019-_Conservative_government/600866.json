Having a second job not only has the potential to create conflicts of interest, but it can also mean that the MP no longer has sufficient time to help and respond to the issues of their constituents, who are the ones that voted for the MP so that they would be represented fairly. There should be no need for MPs to have a second job, but more importantly, they should already be busy with their MAIN job as an MP.",
