        "additional_details": "Uncertainty in the times ahead is causing unrest and great anxiety among students who don\u2019t know whether the 3 weeks will be sufficient to give them a grade that truly reflects their ability. If exams are truly the best way of giving grades - why make it unjustifiably unfair by piling more pressure on already strained students? We need to act fast so measures can be implemented (such as coursework based curriculums or teacher assessments) so we can avoid a similar exam disaster to last year.",
        "background": "The COVID-19 pandemic had caused already irreplaceable time loss to students across the country. A few weeks of preparation cannot subsidise this time lost and we need to follow the examples of the other home nations, such as Wales, in cancelling exams. This must be done swiftly.",
