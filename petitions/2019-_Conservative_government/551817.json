        "additional_details": "We have been blessed with a bit of an Indian summer, which is set to to finish next week.  I suffer slightly from SAD myself, and the mere thought of the clocks going back is enough to depress me.  Historically, Europe and/or the Scots have opposed this, and I believe that Europe is actually stopping DST?  We are no longer in the EU, so that shouldn\u2019t be an obstacle any more, and Scotland, I\u2019m sure, could have a separate vote.  We could always change our clocks at the border!",
        "background": "Do not put the clocks back in October.  If we get another spike in Covid-19, people could be queuing for vaccines in car parks in the pitch dark.  SAD in lockdown would be a nightmare.  Trying to get the economy back on track would be easier.  Double BST next year would be a reward and an incentive.",
