However, times have changed and their are young adults aged 19 with their own homes and children but then people aged 24 in the same situation their rents will cost the same for the same house but the 24 year old is better off due to age. This is discrimination an employer cannot chose to not employ me because my age so why are they allowed to pay different?",
