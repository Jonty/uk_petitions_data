The Agenda For Change policy saw a minimal rise in pay that still keeps them below that threshold. \r\nIt is now time for all NHS staff to be paid fairly for the service they provide.",
        "background": "Put plans in place for all NHS staff to receive a sufficient pay rise. If it can\u2019t legally be completed now due to the \u2018Agenda For Change\u2019 policy then ensure they will be supported once that time has passed.",
