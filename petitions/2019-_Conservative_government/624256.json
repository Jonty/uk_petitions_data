        "additional_details": "My perpetrator's crimes were premeditated & committed for his own sexual gratification from 2011-2018. The crime I was a victim of has severely impacted my life. Without a doubt, voyeurism should be included in the scheme. The impact on victims' lives is real and long lasting. I have suffered extremely poor mental health as a result of what happened and I believe that as long as criminals are getting away with minimal sentencing, this type of crime will continue, and could even in increase.",
        "background": "I was the victim of a criminal who pleaded guilty to voyeurism charges. The criminal was sentenced to a 2-year suspended sentence. I was unable to appeal as the Unduly Lenient Sentence Scheme does not include the crime of Voyeurism. The Scheme should be expanded to include the crime of Voyeurism.",
