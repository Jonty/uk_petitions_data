        "additional_details": "As a parent of two children progressing through secondary education, and a further child in primary, I have witnessed first-hand the grave social and mental health issues directly associated with the use of mobile phones in and around the school environment by students. From the proliferation and enablement of bullying through social media access to the social-divide exacerbated by device brand and model. Remarkably, some students are now actively encouraged to use these devices in school.",
        "background": "The UK Government should set in place requirements for primary and secondary schools to ban the use of personal mobile phones in schools. This could help to combat the myriad social and mental health issues that have increased since the advent of their widespread use in school environments.",
