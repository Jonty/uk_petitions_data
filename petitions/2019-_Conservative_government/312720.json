We have seen now during Covid19 crisis how reliant we are on NHS, Police, Fire Brigade, Ambulance and store workers. We aren't able to work from home, we have to be adaptable to the detriment of our own lives. Our salaries are not increasing but the cost of living does. We don't want medals we just want fair pay.",

I would like the Government to review pay scales in public services. We have not received adequate pay rises in the last 11 years and yet the national living wage increases.",
