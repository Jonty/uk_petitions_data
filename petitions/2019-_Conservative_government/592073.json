        "action": "Allow stage 4 cancer patients to restart therapy after a treatment break",
        "additional_details": "There are various reasons why a patient may need to take a long break during successful treatment of advanced cancer. For example:\r\n1. Side effects so they need time to recover\r\n2. Major surgery means long breaks from treatment\r\n3. Clear scans because treatment was so successful, but the cancer may come back\r\n\r\nAll three of these examples demonstrate that the current 6-week rule is unethical and unfair, it needs to be reviewed and abolished.",
        "background": "Under the current NHS England policy, patients who are having successful treatment with the medicines cetuximab or panitumumab may not restart treatment if they need a break longer than 6 weeks. We believe this is unethical practice.",
