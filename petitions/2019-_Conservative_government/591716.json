Your title refers to racial equality, but the main text of your petition requests a wide range of different changes to the curriculum. You could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. You would need to ensure that the title of your petition covers the whole of your ask, and not just one aspect of it.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petition, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nDecolonise the UK curriculum and make it more diverse: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/581666"
