        "additional_details": "Releasing funds will allow companies that only usually offer SSP to pay more, which will reduce the risk of employees in key worker positions (such as supermarket and care homes) spreading the virus if they feel they have to go to work for financial reasons even if they should be in isolation. Funds should be available to allow these key workers to be paid a minimum of 80% in the same way as businesses otherwise closed.",
