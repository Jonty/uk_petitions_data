The extension of the Ukrainian scheme is very good and appreciated, but people still don't know what is next. Without the extension of the scheme, many Ukrainians may feel they have no choice but to apply for asylum. A scheme that allows Ukrainians who have been living and working in the UK, and not claimed benefits, to apply for ILR, would give security to a lot of really hardworking people.",
