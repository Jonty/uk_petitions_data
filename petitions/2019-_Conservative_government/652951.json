        "additional_details": "Affordable spouse and fiance visas will help people with partners who are from overseas to form families. Being able to have a have a family life should not be the preserve of the well paid and well off. The current Government plan discriminates against hard working people in low paid jobs. This is immoral and unjust.",
        "background": "The Government plans to raise the financial requirement for a spouse and fiance visa to \u00a338, 700. This is above the median average UK salary of \u00a334,963. Low paid workers will be denied this right. The government should fix the financial requirement at an affordable level for low paid workers.",
