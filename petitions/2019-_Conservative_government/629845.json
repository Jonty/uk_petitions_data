        "additional_details": "Recent increasing attacks on the Hindu community are of grave concern. There were multiple life-threatening attacks on the Hindu community along with the destruction of property and a systematic spread of hatred on social media to the point that police were misguided. This is serious as this problem's roots are linked to the country of origin from where this hatred is brewed. This needs to be handled efficiently and effectively to avoid growing issues in the coming days.",
