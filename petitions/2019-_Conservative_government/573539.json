        "additional_details": "We are asking for a reduction in tuition fees because of the reduced quality of our university education and student experience as a result of the shift to online learning. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Students deserve compensation for rent spent on leases for privately rented accommodation they can no longer legally access. This is after the government enforced a travel window for students to return home for Christmas but then forbade them from returning to university by closing universities for lockdown.",
        "background": "We would like the government to provide adequate financial support to all university students for private rented accommodation and a reduction in our tuition fees as a result of COVID restrictions. This can be delivered via a cash furlough to students using details from student finance.",
