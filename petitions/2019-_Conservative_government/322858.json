There are probably many more that we don't know about.\r\n\r\nDisposable barbecues burn the ground, cannot be recycled or composted and are extremely un-environmentally-friendly.  Disposable barbecues give off carbon monoxide when being used and continue to do so until they are completely cold and as we know this is poisonous.",
