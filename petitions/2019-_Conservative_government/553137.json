This has put international students of 2019/2020 at a disadvantage.\r\n\r\nGraduating 1st class, distinction or Merit counts for nothing, if we can not gain 6months, 1year or 2year of world class graduate training. \r\n\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has meant that employers have shelved graduate jobs of 2020 till 2021, by this period our visas would have expired.",
