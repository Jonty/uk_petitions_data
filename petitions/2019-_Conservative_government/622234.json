        "additional_details": "There are hundreds of knife crime offences a day, with some losing their lives often over a petty squabble. We believe introducing mandatory prison sentences of at least 2 years for carrying a knife in public could help tackle these crimes.\r\n\r\nJudges should not have the discretion to award sentences of below 2 years for a first offence, or 5 years for subsequent offences.",
        "background": "With knife crime at record levels in recent years the Government needs to get tough by introducing a mandatory 2-year sentence with no parole for carrying a knife in public, increasing to 5 years for a second offence, again with no parole.",
