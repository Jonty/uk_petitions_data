        "additional_details": "Unfortunately, while people born to a British mother before 1983 can apply for British citizenship, this is not automatic, and only applies once granted. This can mean that people born to those who were not automatically British citizens \u2013 because they were born to a British mother before 1983 \u2013 also miss out on rights to British citizenship, as even once someone has applied for British citizenship (using form UKM), this is not backdated and so does not grant citizenship to children they have had before that time.",
        "background": "Grant automatic UK citizenship to people who were born before 1 January 1983 to a British mother. Only those born to a British father before that time were automatically British citizens, which also means that their descendants may miss out on entitlements to British citizenship.",
