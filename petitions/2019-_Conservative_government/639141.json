        "additional_details": "We believe the Government acted in a totalitarian manner during the pandemic by requiring the dedicated carers who sacrificed their time, physical and mental health to look after our older people by putting them in the position of having both vaccines or risk losing their jobs. We believe this shows how little respect they have for carers who are in the majority women and almost a quarter are from Black, Asian and ethnic minorities, especially when the vaccine was new and it was not clear if all side effects were known. They deserve compensation.",
