        "additional_details": "Implement a full government lockdown.\r\n\r\nSuspend Mortages, Rent and bills.\r\n\r\nPeople will continue going to work out of desperation, regardless of having symptoms of the virus because they do not feel secure. A suspension of these bills, NOT a scenario where the payments are piled up, will reassure the public.\r\n\r\nFund the necessary provisions to keep the public indoors.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Herd immunity has not been proven to work for this virus! We do not consent to being participants in this experiment.",
        "background": "The government need to start serving the best interests of the people. We still have a head start on Italy and can hopefully prevent the mass spread of the virus under a government lock down. There is still a chance to maintain the virus. The government\u2019s lack of response to the virus is appalling.",
