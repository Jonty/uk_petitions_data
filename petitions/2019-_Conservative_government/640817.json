        "action": "Prohibit all non-official vehicles within a radius of 750 meters of schools",
        "additional_details": "The roads around schools become impassable at school opening and closing times due to the high quantity of private vehicles dropping off or picking up children. The children who do actually walk to school are in great danger of being knocked down by irresponsible drivers who are only paying attention to potential parking spaces. Double yellow lines and Zig Zag areas are completely ignored in the mad dash to park. The roads immediately outside schools should be a safer environment for children.",
        "background": "I would like Government or Parliament to pass legislation to prohibit non official vehicles from parking close to schools during school opening and closing times. 8.30 to 9.30 am and 2.30 to 3.30 pm",
