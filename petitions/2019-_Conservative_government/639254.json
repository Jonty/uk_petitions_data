        "additional_details": "Milk Allergy is the most common cause of food allergy in the paediatric population (Allergy UK). Yet, the lack of support is astonishing, and many parents struggle financially to provide their children with quality milk alternatives. \r\n\r\nThis is not to mention the fact that veganism is growing massively and a lot of children will follow this diet alongside their parents with absolutely no issues in terms of development.",
        "background": "The current scheme is not only excluding children with severe allergies but also other children who can't have dairy products for a variety of reasons, from intolerances to ethics. We would like the government to include dairy-free alternatives in the scheme to ensure all children are provided for.",
