        "additional_details": "We think that many serving personnel and their families would benefit from the planned policy. We also think that removing or delaying it could have a devastating effect on already strained family lives and place unnecessary limits on personnel's living conditions. Military personnel are suffering loss of experienced workforce and delaying this could impact personnel retention, across all ranks and ratings. We think that rank should not be dictating personnel standards of living.",

We think it is an effective policy that would improve the lives of serving personnel, regardless of rank. Make the MOD an inclusive place to work, ensuring equality of living standards regardless of rank.",
