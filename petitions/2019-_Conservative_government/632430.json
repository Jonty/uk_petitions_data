        "additional_details": "After 10 years of service doctors and nurses and other NHS staff will have paid back thousands of pounds of student loans, but most will still have significant student loan debts. The low take home pay for many NHS workers is driving highly skilled workers out of the work force, or overseas towards higher salaries. Rewarding loyalty to the NHS could help staff will feel valued, improve morale, and reduce gaps in staffing. This could ultimately help improve the quantity of care for our patients.",
        "background": "We want the Government to write off student loan debt for NHS workers after 10 years of service. This is to incentivise more workers to remain employed by the NHS, as well as to help mitigate the below inflation pay rises we have seen over so many years.",
