        "additional_details": "The British public deserve some much needed positivity and I believe Government should lead this with a National Week of Respite possibly held during the Summer Holidays and perhaps repeated each year.\r\n\r\nFunds should be provided for festivals, food, drink, fun and events for a week long period during which we celebrate overcoming many challenges and divisions, and get prepared for the ones in future. \r\n\r\nPlease help make this a reality by signing this petition. We've all earned it!",
