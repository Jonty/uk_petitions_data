        "additional_details": "We think that instead of punitive actions, the advice of government guidance to schools on behaviour policy should shift to focus more on restorative justice and positive reinforcement. Allocate funds for training teachers in trauma-informed approaches and social-emotional learning. We think that schools should be encouraged to have flexible policies, allowing schools to adapt interventions to individual needs. Prioritising empathy and proactive strategies could create a supportive, inclusive environment, promoting both academic success and student well-being.",
        "background": "We think that policy and guidance on behaviour management in schools often reflects outdated approaches that fail to address the complexities of student behaviour. Some schools rely heavily on punitive measures like taking away play time, instead of fostering a supportive environment.",
