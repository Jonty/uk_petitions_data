It would also save the Police significant amounts of time and in all likelihood reduce the backlog in the criminal justice system.\r\n\r\nOf course the inverse could also be true, if the Police investigated all cases equally,  where evidence of criminal activity indicates a crime has been committed, regardless of who the individual is or their position in society?",
