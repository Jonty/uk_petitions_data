        "additional_details": "An estimated 42% of marriages will end in divorce and that does not factor in unmarried families. The majority of these have no emotional support. Continued support from mental health professionals will ensure that the members of a family are coping and better equipped to handle the anxiety of the separation and grief process. Parents and children will learn coping techniques & ensure that the child does not blame themselves.",
        "background": "Divorce, separation & death can take an immense psychological toll on parents & children. The Government should provide funding for professional well-being support for each member of the family throughout the separation/divorce process, or after the loss of the family member.",
