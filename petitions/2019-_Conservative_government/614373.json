        "additional_details": "There are many important reasons why we believe domestic cats should be kept indoors.\r\n \r\n1. Many people are allergic to cat fur and therefore this is a health hazard. Cats leaving their fur in people's gardens is not something an allergic person should deal with.\r\n2. Cat droppings. It is simply not fair on people with no cats of their own to clean their gardens after they been used as a toilet. Cat poo can also be dangerous to humans.\r\n3. Cat safety, so they do not go missing.",
        "background": "We are a family who enjoy outdoors, and love our garden. However due to local cats coming and using our garden as a toilet, we spend a lot of time cleaning up after them. We want all domestic cats to be required to be kept indoors at all times, to prevent inconvenience to others.",
