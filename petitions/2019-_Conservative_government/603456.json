        "additional_details": "The Hospitality industry supported and abided by the restrictions, we struggled with the subsequent uncertainty  and consequences of restriction lifting including; lack of job takeup, rising costs, take on of debts via CBIL to support the industry. \r\n\r\nWe now face further uncertainty and have been left open with little restrictions and no support leading to an influx of cancellations across the industry and further financial instability, for many there will be no returning from this.",
        "background": "Despite early financial assistance for the industry, we have been hit hard yet again by the government's Plan B enforcement. We all held out for December where 25% of turnover is normally generated. To be hit with cancellations and lack of custom due to Hospitality being neglected in Plan B.",
