These figures only include cyclists killed or injured in road accidents that were reported to the police. Many cyclist casualties are not reported to the police. Driver aggression towards cyclists feels to be increasing & we are calling on the Department of Transport to run a national public awareness campaign to educate motorists about dangerous behaviours.",
