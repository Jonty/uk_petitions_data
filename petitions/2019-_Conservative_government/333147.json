        "additional_details": "This is DETRIMENTAL to anyone suffering with eating disorders, and to impressionable younger people who may already be conscious about calorie intake. To add calories to menus is highly likely to cause increased stress and anxious around food and trigger eating disorder sufferers, or those in recovery, to potentially dangerous degrees. Additionally, there is very little evidence or support that putting calories on menus will lead to reduced consumption for those suffering from obesity.",
        "background": "The UK gov. plans to tackle the obesity crisis by ensuring restaurants have meal calories on menus. The mindset behind this is to make people more conscious about the calories they are consuming, in the hope of reducing intake. This is likely to reinforce dangerous disordered eating patterns.",
