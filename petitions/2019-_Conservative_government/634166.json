        "additional_details": "The Animal Welfare Action Plan affirms the UK's commitment to supporting animal welfare initiatives worldwide. To enhance environmental sustainability and align with the Climate Action Framework 2021, plastic shuttlecocks that can be recycled or repaired should be used over real feathers, which have a higher environmental impact. This initiative can minimise waste and enhance the sport. The Government should implement this and facilitate a seamless transition to promote public adoption.",
        "background": "Live plucking geese feathers for badminton is a cruel and outdated practice that must be addressed urgently. Live feather plucking causes extreme pain and suffering to birds. The Government must ban the import and sale of feather shuttlecocks from 2024, and require alternatives are used instead.",
