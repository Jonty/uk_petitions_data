        "additional_details": "As the alleged pandemic progressed, facts came to light from world renowned scientists, virologists and doctors that are being ignored by the government and media alike, whilst the public at large are constantly drilled with a one sided story that cannot be rebutted. The fear instilled in the people has had a detrimental impact and as such we feel that an honest an open two sided dialogue needs to be entered into in the form of a public enquiry. The stats surrounding deaths and infections etc.",
        "background": "A public enquiry is needed to ascertain the number of mortalities due to covid 19 only in 2020. Deaths are being counted as Covid 19 even if that person died by other means, ie heart attack due to a positive test within 28 days, symptoms or not. Also the PCR test and its ability to detect a virus.",
