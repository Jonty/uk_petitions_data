        "additional_details": "Over recent weeks, there have been news reports on school children being attacked, raped, kidnapped, sexually harassed and all around bothered just trying to get to school. These things damage a child and causes fear to other children - it is not right at all and needs to be avoided in any way necessary. They are safe in school but if something happens to them on their travels to and from the \u201csafety\u201d goes out the window. These children need to be educated in these matters and  protected",
        "background": "It is imperative that efficient safety measures are put in place by school maybe walking groups with an adult, teachers guiding children to school, children being escorted to bus stops and when off the bus, age limits for travelling alone, automatic text messages to say a child has arrived safely.",
