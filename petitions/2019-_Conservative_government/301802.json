        "additional_details": "We want the government to work closer with farmers to help stop the TB crisis. Actions need to be done, too many lives are wasted as a result.\r\n \r\nThe Government should look for more accurate ways of testing for Bovine TB. Skin tests are outdated and not accurate enough.\r\n \r\nFarmers should also be better compensated for cows that have to be slaughtered. Compensation should be higher for in-calf cows, and increase in line with how long in-calf those cows are. Farmers should also receive higher compensation for cows raised organically.",
        "background": "Many farmers are appalled that cattle are being slaughtered as a result of testing positive for TB, especially in-calf cows, where often both the cow and calves are killed. The current rules for Bovine TB can also be seriously detrimental to farming enterprises.",
