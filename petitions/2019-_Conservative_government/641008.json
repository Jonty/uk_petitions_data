This is very serious. Multiple problems would be caused from the lack of just one thing-water. Imagine a future where we and our kids are not able to drink and live comfortably. Water is needed for multiple purposes such as cleaning, drinking and even in factories. These are all daily necessities and are what provide us with a comfortable life. Therefore it is vital we address this issue now.\r\n",
