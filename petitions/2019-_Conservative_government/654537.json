        "additional_details": "My little brother was killed by a friend of ours, but only received a sentence of 16 years, one year more than the normal minimum. We believe a sentence of 15 years is a joke, and that the sentence my brother's murderer received does not reflect the loss of my little brothers life! We know one day the murderer will walk free, but my little brother will never see another sunrise or feel the warmth of the sun on his face or hear the rain fall. We are going to suffer for the rest of our lives.",
        "background": "I'd like the minimum sentence for murder to be increased to 20 years, regardless of the circumstances and any mitigating factors. Currently the starting point for sentences for murders is 15 years in most cases.",
