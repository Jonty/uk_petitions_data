        "additional_details": "In the UK, an astounding 97% of women aged 18-24 have faced sexual harassment in public spaces [UN Women UK]. By not taking these events seriously, we make it harder for victims of more serious sexual crimes to come forward, fearing that nothing will be done as a result, or that people will say they're \"overreacting.\"\r\n\r\nPSH makes women feel \"powerless, objectified, hurt and angry\". These laws help to keep women safe and would empower victims to come forward.",
        "background": "Following in the footsteps of France, Belgium, and Portugal, where cases of sexual harassment on the street fell after public sexual harassment was made illegal, and fines subsequently handed out, we call for the UK government to make laws specifically making public sexual harassment a crime.",
