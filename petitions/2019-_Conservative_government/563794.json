        "additional_details": "I know of so many young people who have been taken on for short term low paid work to plug the gaps, promised with long term employment and lots of training only to be used and abused by the employers as they have not been with the company for longer than 2 years meaning they're ineligible for tribunal. Young people are less likely to find long term employment if they don't find a job in their first year of searching. The Government needs to do more to support young people not just apprentices.",
        "background": "The Government or Parliament need to plug this loop hole that employers are exploiting for short term labour. I was taken on as an apprentice and all of a sudden had my contract cut short just after a year and made redundant alongside my other employees.",
