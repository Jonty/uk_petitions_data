That is 8 weeks from winter equinox (shortest day falling on 21st December).  It makes no sense therefore that the UK then stays in GMT until 31st March 2021.  That is a whopping 13 weeks from 21st December.  It makes no sense!  \r\nBST (or maybe British Extended Time) should really start again on w/c 14th February.",
