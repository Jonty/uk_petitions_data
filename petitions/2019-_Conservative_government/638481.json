We need this to change before we can start making any real positive changes to how we run this country. \r\n\r\nI believe that most people are good and have good intentions. The problem is they are constantly being fed misinformation by people who look to exploit them for their own gain.\r\n \r\nA new offence for spreading misinformation could help tackle this.",
