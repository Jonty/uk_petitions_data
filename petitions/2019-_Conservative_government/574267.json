        "additional_details": "Because people are losing their businesses and losing their right to make a living and others are losing motivation to work. Furlough is bleeding money and handing out benefits over a situation that could've been avoided. Handing out benefits to workers while forcing g solation is only going to make them dependent on benefits, causing more strain on our economy. If this continues the hyper inflation could destroy the value of the British pound. We could end up going the way of Venezuela.",
        "background": "Lift the ban on hospitality and non essential shops during lockdown. Aslong as the owners take the safety measures they \"deem\" necessary. Allowing people to make their own choices and ensure their responsibility.",
