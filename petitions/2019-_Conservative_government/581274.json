        "additional_details": "It\u2019s not necessary for teachers to have a detailed course on self defence, a basic one would suffice. It will be mandatory for all teachers to learn and considered a survival skill like swimming. The course would entail teaching children how to escape different compromising positions an attacker might put them in and run to safety. These lessons could save lives and prevent anybody from feeling powerless in the face of an attack, and any afterward trauma too. Especially for young woman.",
        "background": "Most people are unable to afford self defence classes. If a person with no experience were attacked, they would be panicked or too weak to escape their attacker. With knowledge and experience they would be more confident and less panicked, they would know the right technique to escape to safety.",
