        "additional_details": "Parents pay taxes, schools and libraries provide children with educational resources, however without access to these facilities due to current circumstances parents are facing additional costs. This cost has been shifted from schools to parents. Parents already finding it difficult to make ends meet have to think twice about whether to spend money to meet the educational needs of their children. This will ultimately increase the educational gap between children of different social backgrounds.",
        "background": "It is costing parents more to provide for the extra equipment needed to educate their children at home. This includes paying for internet, printing, paper, stationary, books,  workbooks and equipment for a range of activities to develop and engage them.",
