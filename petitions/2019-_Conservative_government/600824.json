This means that damage will be caused uncontrollably, without us being able to make a difference. We don't know where this boulder is, if it is on the edge, we need to act now, we don't know whether it is here or not, therefore, we need to act as soon as it is possible.",

We have no idea what will happen in 29 years and this is a target where we can't say exactly what that time will be like. I want parliament to take action, to restore our planet for now and for the future.",
