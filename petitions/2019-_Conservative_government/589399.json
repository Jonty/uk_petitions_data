However most heterosexual couples qualify after 2 years of unprotected sex, which holds no additional financial cost. It feels discriminatory to force LGBTQ+ people to use private clinics if they want to access safe, medically-screened sperm, or risk more dangerous routes, or give up on hopes of creating a family.",
