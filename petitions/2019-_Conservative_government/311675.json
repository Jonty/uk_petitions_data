        "additional_details": "Retail and supermarket workers are being scrutinised even if they wish to self isolate. There is tremendous pressure on the staff. People are forced to work while being in a constant fear of catching this virus. There is no financial support for key workers who wish to stop working inorder to be safe and protect their families, sometimes with vulnerable individuals. It's very unfair for key workers who are working so hard, risking their lives.",
        "background": "Urge the food supply and retail bosses to pay the staff who want to be home during this Covid-19 outbreak. We can't survive only with SSP. We should be paid 80% like most of the staff working in other businesses.",
