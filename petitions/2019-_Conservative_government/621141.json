        "additional_details": "By removing and replacing the 'Empire' in OBE, MBE and CBE, the Government would be sending out a clear message that it does not stand by the British Empire, condemns its actions, and understands that what the regime enforced was abhorrent.\r\n\r\nMillions of people in the UK (and around the world) have ancestors who were negatively affected by the Empire, and it is an insult to them and their families for respectable awards to recognise the British Empire in the 21st century.",
        "background": "The British Empire ended years ago, and was a regime used to oppress millions of people over several centuries. By congratulating people with awards that have 'British Empire' in the name, it continues to glorify an oppressive regime which should be left firmly in the past.",
