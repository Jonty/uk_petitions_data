The work is no longer the best reflection of their skills and work on pre-covid 19! \r\n\r\nStudents are not only getting less access to support, they are being set more work with smaller deadlines and no mental health breaks. This is a lack of routine and is not only going to prevent them from getting best results but could harm their mental health in the future from being stressed and very anxious.",
