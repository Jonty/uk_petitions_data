The work is no longer the best reflection of their skills and work on pre-covid 19! \r\n\r\nStudents are not only getting less access to support, they are being set more work with smaller deadlines and no mental health breaks. This is a lack of routine and is not only going to prevent them from getting best results but could harm their mental health in the future from being stressed and very anxious.",

While they are working in the comfort of their own home, they are lacking motivation and become threateningly stressed due to the deadlines and extra work being set. Because of this, the work is not a reflection of the students",
