It\u2019s time similar legislation was introduced in England.\r\n \r\nWe believe the Government is not doing enough to act against the effects of the climate emergency. They need to act now.\r\n \r\nThe Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 requires public bodies in Wales to think about the long-term impact of their decisions, to work better with people, communities and each other, and to prevent persistent problems such as poverty, health inequalities and climate change. We want to see similar legislation introduced in England.\r\n",
