        "additional_details": "The current housing crisis and worsening climate crisis are both problems facing us currently. The movement for low impact and sustainable dwellings, like those allowed by the Welsh one planet development policy and Scottish Crofting Commission are helping to reduce both of these issues. The current, outdated legislation in England makes it difficult to build low impact dwellings with sustainable materials, ultimately resulting in environmental damage and a potentiation of the housing crisis.",
        "background": "Update planning laws to allow for environmentally friendly, low impact and sustainable homes to be built in England more easily, thus letting people live with less impact on the environment. This has been done with the one planet development policy in Wales and the crofting legislation in Scotland.",
