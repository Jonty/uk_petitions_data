        "additional_details": "The Government or Parliament should increase the under 18's minimum wage to 80% of the national living wage because, under 18's in the workforce in the same position as an adult are doing the same work as an 23+ year old who is receiving just shy of twice the pay of an under 18. \r\n\r\nCompanies start charing adult prices at age 16.\r\nThe rise in inflation and cost of living has increased the costs for everybody.\r\nUnder 18's in parts of the country also work to help provide for their families.",
        "background": "The under 18's minimum wage should be raised to 80% of the national living wage.\r\n\r\nWhen under 18's are eligible to start working at around age 16, they are typically expected to start to cover some of their own expenses in life, such as clothing, entertainment and transportation, with adult prices.",
