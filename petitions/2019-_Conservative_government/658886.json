        "additional_details": "While I support environmentally-friendly measures such as banning disposable vapes, imposing extra taxation on all vaping products beyond VAT is not the solution. I wholeheartedly agree that vaping should not be promoted among children or non-smokers.\r\nAccording to Public Health England (PHE), e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking traditional cigarettes  (E-cigarettes: an evidence update)\r\nIt's important to remember that people are quitting smoking with the aid of vapes.",
        "background": "I am one of the many who have successfully quit smoking, thanks to eCigarettes. On January 2nd, 2018, I smoked my last cigarette and I haven't looked back since.\r\n\r\nI urge our lawmakers not to punish those who have found a safer alternative in their fight against nicotine addiction!",
