        "additional_details": "There are two tests for the coronavirus that is causing COVID-19: An antigen test that detects an active infection, and an antibody test that determines if someone has had an infection in the past and is now immune. There is a high number of people infected without any clinical signs. We petition the government to urgently extend both tests and make them available to the public, to allow people to return to work, thereby lessening the detrimental effect on the economy and people's mental health.",
        "background": "Government to prioritise validation and use of antigen and antibody tests for Sars-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, to make them available to the public. This would reduce new infections and deaths associated with the virus, bring the British people back into work, and protect lives and our economy.",
