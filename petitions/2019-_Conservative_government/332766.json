        "action": "Ensure the reciprocal EHIC remains for UK citizens after the Brexit transition",
        "additional_details": "As Europeans, we are closely connected and our regular, often extended travel requires easy, instant access to local healthcare. Delivering it without the EHIC is wasteful, stressful and cumbersome with many insurmountable hurdles, such as obtaining immediate reports from our overstretched GPs before insurers will authorise healthcare. During the Covid-19 pandemic the EHIC is an essential element for anyone booking safe European travel. Other non-EU countries are part of the scheme. Why not UK?",
        "background": "Without EHIC access to European healthcare will be inefficient, costlier all round and lose lives. Buying travel insurance with chronic health conditions or in older age can be unaffordable and unobtainable and fail to provide immediate access to healthcare. Travel will be prevented for many people.",
