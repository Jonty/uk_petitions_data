        "additional_details": "For far too long now we have all been bombarded with telephone calls, emails and messages that are sent from fraudsters in attempts to defraud the public out of money or supply personal details that can lead to financial loss. The network providers must be forced to invest heavily in stopping this as they can through the use of algorithms that identify multiple applications for numbers or numbers that do not correlate to the origin of the call, email or text. They will act if they have to pay.",

Emails and texts that contain links, or phone numbers that lead a victim into parting with personal details are too common.",
