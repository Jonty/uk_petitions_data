Removing this support is unsafe for patient care and pressuring people to return to work\u2026\u201d. If staff don\u2019t return to work, they are now losing their jobs.\r\nSupporting recuperation of experienced NHS staff from Long Covid will deliver a long-term return, protecting careers, ensuring the NHS have the experience on hand to deliver services safely in years to come.",
        "background": "I call upon the government to fully re-instate funding to all NHS staff  and care workers suffering from Long COVID. These are the heroes and heroines of the pandemic. The least we can do is pay them their full salary until they fully recover. They deserve it.",
