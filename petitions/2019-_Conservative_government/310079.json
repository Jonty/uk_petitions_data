        "additional_details": "When dealing with possible cases of COVID-19 the government guidelines state that 'fluid repellent surgical face masks are recommended and, if available, disposable plastic apron and disposable eye protection (such as face visor or goggles) should be worn'. With a large number of officers now sick or self-isolating due to COVID-19 it is essential we protect the remaining staff. We ask the government to provide the necessary protective equipment to prevent more officers contracting COVID-19.",

We want the government to provide officers with appropriate personal protective equipment to allow them to assist people with COVID-19 without putting themselves at unnecessary risk.",
