        "additional_details": "The Pandemic has massively affected the economy. Finding a job before COVID was already difficult but now, businesses are closing and with redundancies becoming more frequent, the life of a university graduate has been made much harder. 83% of university students are predicted to not pay off their debt at the end of the 30 year period. With COVID, the number will increase. Graduates may struggle to survive because they will have little income for basic necessities such as food and shelter.",
        "background": "The Government takes 9% of graduate\u2019s annual income to pay off student debt over a 30 year period. Due to COVID, the fee for university isn't justified and the percentage taken from student income should be reduced to a maximum of 5%.",
