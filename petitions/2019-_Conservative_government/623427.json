        "additional_details": "Rates are now only slightly higher than minimum wage. Someone earning the median UK salary looses at least \u00a3360 from their take-home pay for 2 weeks of service IF they are called to serve each day. They loose more if they are stood down. Someone earning \u00a345,000 looses more than \u00a3700, or 25%, of their monthly net income.\r\n\r\nJurers should not be asked to subsidise justice.",

Jury service is an essential and important part of life in a democracy, but compensation rates for jurors who are self employed or who's employer does not cover their lost wages have not increased since 2010.",
