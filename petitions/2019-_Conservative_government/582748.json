        "additional_details": "The government has claimed that almost \u00a34.4 billion will be invested to create prison places and support victims to help combat the effects of the pandemic. Yet face-to-face encounters with ex-offenders and hearing anecdotes from incarcerated prisoners give a different story. Counselling and improved conditions are needed as men are suffering in silence with no support. These men will one day have to integrate back into society with the burden of trauma, at the hands of the Government.",
        "background": "Many male prisoners have been living in conditions that are inhumane; 23 hours in cells with poor ventilation and hygiene. Prisoners are treated as if they are less deserving of fundamental human rights, which can lead to a decline in mental health. Prisoners need rehabilitation, not neglect.",
