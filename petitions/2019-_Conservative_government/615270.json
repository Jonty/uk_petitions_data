        "additional_details": "The present General Permitted Development Orders don't even allow many campsites to open for the duration of the school summer holidays. A longer open period will allow many more people to enjoy holidaying in the UK, will increase the viability of temporary campsites, and should significantly reduce holiday carbon emissions.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to allow camping on agricultural land for 56 days instead of the current 28 days permitted. Camping is a great way to holiday in the UK. It is low cost, enables interaction with nature, and is very low carbon compared to other holiday types.",
