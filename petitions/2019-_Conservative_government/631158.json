        "action": "Increase the amount of gender neutral restrooms in public spaces.",
        "additional_details": "In many public spaces in the UK such as schools, those in the LGBTQ+ community - particularly transgender youth - may not feel safe in gendered bathrooms for many reasons, and some do not feel safe sharing bathrooms with LGBTQ+ people. However, having self contained bathrooms would combat this, as well as being useful for people with young children or disabilities. By doing this, we would create a safer environment for LGBTQ+ people in public spaces, and promote equality for all.",
        "background": "I am asking the Government to require all new buildings to have gender neutral bathrooms as self contained units - to promote safety and security for all - where possible. These would preferably be accessible for people with disabilities and include a baby changing table.",
