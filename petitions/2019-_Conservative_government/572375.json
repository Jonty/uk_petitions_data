        "additional_details": "Police Officers all over the country are working tirelessly to protect our communities. They come face to face with members of the public every single day, putting their lives on the line so we can safely live ours. Police Officers are unable to socially distance when carrying out everyday duties whilst dealing with the public due to the high demands and emergency situations they are faced with. Prioritising Police Officers for the vaccine would protect them, their families and the population.",
        "background": "I would like the government to consider all Police Officers in England as a \u201chigh priority group\u201d for the Covid-19 vaccine. Please allow our front line Police Officers the opportunity to have the vaccine sooner rather than later down the line.",
