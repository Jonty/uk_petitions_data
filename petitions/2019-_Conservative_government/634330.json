By providing more acceptable methods of Voter ID for young people, this will reduce the prohibitive effect of not having the correct Voter ID on election day.

For example, a Freedom Pass is an acceptable form of ID, whereas a Young Person's Bus Pass is not. We want Young Person's Bus Passes to be accepted as ID. ",
