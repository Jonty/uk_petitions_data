        "additional_details": "Most skin cancers are caused by exposure to the sun. There are 16,000 new cases of melanoma diagnosed each year across the UK, with 2,300 people dying. 90% of cases of melanoma could be prevented by staying safe in the sun. That is why the NHS advises people to use sunscreen that is SPF 30 or above with at least a 4 star UVA protection rating.",
        "background": "Sunscreen that meets NHS guidance is preventative healthcare. Yet while other healthcare products, such as paracetamol, are not subject to VAT, sunscreen is taxed.\r\n\r\nThe UK government should therefore remove VAT on sunscreen products of SPF 30 or above with at least a 4 star UVA protection rating.",
