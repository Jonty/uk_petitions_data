        "action": "Prevent midterm telephone & broadband price rises on contracts above 12 months.",
        "additional_details": "It is my belief that the government have a duty to protect customers from unfair contracts and needless profiteering and trapping customers into long contracts and where they can apply a price rise of the magnitude that we have seen in 2023, where inflation has been excessively high. If customers were on 12 month contracts then the time they can then swap providers, or make an informed decision is smaller.",
        "background": "Prevent mobile, telephone & broadband telecommunication providers from applying midterm price rises on contracts above 12 months. High inflation in 2023 means millions of customers are stuck on 18, 24 or 36 month contracts and have to suffer inflationary price rises for much longer than required.",
