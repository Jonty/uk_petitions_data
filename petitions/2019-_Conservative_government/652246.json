        "additional_details": "In 2022 people nearing retirement suffered catastrophic losses as a result of such strategies.  Marketing material by pension providers described 'lifestyling' investment strategies that involved moving money to \u2018lower-risk\u2019 funds. This often meant investment in long term gilts which were regarded as lower risk. We do not believe the consequences were appropriately risk-assessed. We think that the government and regulators should hold pension providers to account.",
