We have found that support from establishments is voluntary and we have to build relationships with owners/chefs in order to ensure she is safe. If a listed allergen, outlets will need to clearly label products, make staff aware of requirements, and avoid cross-contamination. \r\n\r\nWe've had restaurants accidentally contaminate food despite warning them and this results in anaphylaxis meaning emergency treatment. Alternatively restaurants will change their opinion of whether to serve us or not. Please help!\r\n\r\nQuick Guide from Allergy UK - https://www.allergyuk.org/assets/000/001/548/Oral_Allergy_Syndrome_original.pdf",

Support for other allergies is inconsistent and can put the sufferer in a life-threatening position requiring emergency medical attention. This petition is to extend the recognition to others.",
