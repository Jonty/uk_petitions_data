        "additional_details": "British insects and pollinators are already in a terrible condition due to habitat loss and pesticide use. Pollinators are a vital keystone species and should be protected for both biodiversity and their enormous economic value to the British \u00a3100billion food industry. Use of these pesticides can also adversely impact wildflowers, birds, mammals and aquatic invertebrates. \r\nThis decision is environmentally regressive and bordering on offensive as we were explicitly promised this wouldn\u2019t happen.",
        "background": "The U.K. government explicitly promised that in the wake of Brexit that they would maintain the EU ban on pesticides (neonicotinoids) known to kill bees. We\u2019re meagre weeks into January and this promise has already been broken. Please revoke this decision and ban these pesticides.",
