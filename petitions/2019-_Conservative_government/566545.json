        "action": "Make sanitary products free and more accessible for those under 30.",
        "additional_details": "I would like the government to make sanitary products free, because I believe that they can help to solve the crisis of period poverty, and help young women to feel like their problems are being listened to. It can make these items accessible to people who are homeless and people that simply can\u2019t afford this necessity. This will help to brighten the future of the next generation and to normalise periods, so women can feel more comfortable In their own bodies and not be ashamed of being female.",
        "background": "Sanitary products should become free to those under 30 years-old. Many people can\u2019t afford to buy sanitary products, and by making them free, we are making them more accessible to women. Period poverty is a widespread problem and if sanitary products are free, we can help millions of young women.",
