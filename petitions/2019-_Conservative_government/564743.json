        "additional_details": "In 1958 Thalidomide, was a drug given to pregnant women in the UK to rid them of nausea. The risk was unknown even with the available study data at that time. Thalidomide later was found to cause birth defects, including malformations. We must ensure no repeat cases occur, especially with vaccines. Manufactures must be held accountable for all potential wrongdoings, the public deserve atleast their current level of health. If a product is good to sell it cannot be sold with legal indemnity.",
        "background": "If a vaccine is supposed to help 1% of the population at risk, but carries risks equal to or higher than 1% the vaccine is irrational to give out. Irrational products mean the manufacturer may ask for indemnity from liability, the government must not roll out these vaccines to the public.",
