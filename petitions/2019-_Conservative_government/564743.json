        "additional_details": "In 1958 Thalidomide, was a drug given to pregnant women in the UK to rid them of nausea. The risk was unknown even with the available study data at that time. Thalidomide later was found to cause birth defects, including malformations. We must ensure no repeat cases occur, especially with vaccines. Manufactures must be held accountable for all potential wrongdoings, the public deserve at least their current level of health. If a product is good to sell it cannot be sold with legal indemnity.",
        "background": "The potential long-term risks of a vaccine cannot be known until after they are rolled out, and these could even outweigh the benefits of vaccination, so vaccines should only be permitted where the manufacturer retains liability for any adverse consequences that may result from its use.",
