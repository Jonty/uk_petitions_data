        "additional_details": "In the 2019 General Election for  voters who wished to remain in the EU or to leave there were many instances where voters wishing to support their parties had opposite or different preferences from them over Brexit.Some voters put aside their EU choice to help their parties win.Others deserted their parties purely to vote for the party that would guarantee taking them out of EU.This distorted both Brexit & Party votes. It should invalidate both the GE and the vote on Brexit.We need Brxt Refrndm",
        "background": "It's impossible to accurately measure how many voters in a General Election who vote for the party they wish to win share the party's declared preference over our membership of the EU. Parliament should not allow votes on Brexit within a GE, only via a Referendum.",
