Historic wars and invasions in Europe are all consequences of previous events. Slavery, freedom, the emancipation of women, the industrial revolution and worker rights are all points on the timeline of our history. It is vital that every school child has a keen understanding of our past so they can find their place in  the present and help to build a better future.",

Diminishing our past only reduces our ability to shape our future. Our history needs to be celebrated and taught to all not a few.",
