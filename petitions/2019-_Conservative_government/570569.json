        "additional_details": "On the 4th of January Boris Johnson announced the 3rd national lockdown. This had to include schools, given the severity of the situation. In this announcement Mr Johnson said \"It is not possible or fair for exams to go ahead this year as normal.\" The national, externally set exams proposed by Gavin Williamson in his letter to Ofqual would be just as unfair as the exams they replace. This unfairness creates stress and is inequitable. The mental health of exam years will suffer drastically.",
        "background": "The Government must not use externally set \"mini\" exams to assess pupils who were due to sit GCSEs and A-Levels in 2021. The Government has already cancelled externally set exams this year as they would be unfair and now they are suggesting replacing them with other externally set exams.",
