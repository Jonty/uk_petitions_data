They may even experience consciousness, and at least some of them are self-aware.\r\n Yet, they are exploited, abused and killed for \u201csport\u201d, flesh, dairy, eggs, fur, skins, wool and mistreated by sick individuals. For too long have animal abusers been allowed to get off lightly. All sentient animals deserve the same legal protection as humans!",

With exceptions, nonhuman animals think and feel, in manners that are at least somewhat similar to how humans think and feel. Yet, they are often treated abysmally. They are even considered to be mere property, not persons.",
