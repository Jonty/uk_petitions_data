There has been a reported increase in incidents between horse riders and dog owners. We think the current law doesn\u2019t cover the issue properly and needs updating to be clearer and ensure safety for all using the countryside.\r\n \r\nWe want:\r\n \r\n1) Clear and concise legislation specifically about horse and riders to be implemented into the Dangerous Dogs Act.\r\n2) Penalties for the dog owners proportionate to the severity of the incident. \r\n3) Leash laws for bridleways and byways.\r\n",
