To reduce health conditions associated with poor diet, including diabetes, heart disease, depression, poor mobility and multiple conditions which start from our earliest eating habits. The evidence already links poor diet with poor health outcomes. Why are we still allowing schools to serve unhealthy food to children as young as 4 years old. We can stop the health crisis now.",

Processed foods are contributing to obesity and multiple other poor health outcomes for children. Around 1 in 5 people are obese. It often starts at school.",
