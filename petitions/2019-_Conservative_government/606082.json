        "additional_details": "The government want to encourage more people to become HGV drivers which would put more lorries on the roads. The parking facilities that exist currently are woefully inadequate with some areas having nowhere within a reasonable distance from delivery points. Existing drivers are being forced to park in unsafe areas by the sides of roads where they risk theft of loads or damage to vehicles. Knowing there is somewhere safe to park nearby would help to encourage new drivers and greatly help existing drivers.",
