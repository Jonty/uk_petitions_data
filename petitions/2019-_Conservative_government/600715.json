        "additional_details": "The Government is duty-bound to help preserve the planet. If taxes help materialise this crucial aim, then the Government should consider this route. Government, with Parliament's approval, is able to create new taxes. I am therefore advocating a meat tax - something the government could perfectly legitimately create - as one step *of many* to reduce the UK's damage to the planet we all call home. This may appear radical (I'd dispute that), but strong actions are needed. That's undeniable.",
        "background": "Meat, particularly red meat, is proven to be a particularly pernicious contributor to the climate emergency. It is, in essence, harmful to the world. The UK rightly taxes cigarettes for they, too, cause harm. The tax system is a good way, I believe, of disincentivising. Let's stop encouraging meat.",
