Factors such as seat height and firmness, as well as mostly male crash-test dummies that don\u2019t account for female muscle mass distribution, bone density, and pregnancy play a significant role in this.\r\nAs a result, in a car crash a woman is:\r\n\u2022 47% more likely to be seriously injured.\r\n\u2022 17% more likely to die.\r\nIn a society that strives for equality, this is unacceptable.",
        "background": "The UK is currently adhering to UNECE safety standards. While we would still have to maintain these, our withdrawal from the EU offers an opportunity for the UK to introduce higher standards, meaning men and women will be equally protected in the case of a car accident.",
