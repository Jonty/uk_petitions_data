        "additional_details": "Currently we needed to stockpile 6 packs of 16 tablets to have enough to last just one person long enough to get through 14 days, the length of time days people with Covid19 are required to self-isolate.\r\n\r\nThe 1998 research that reduced the supply of these tablets was well meaning. In reality, anyone who wants to overdose on Paracetamol can find a way to access it. But when you have Covid19 and suffer the associated flu symptoms like muscle pain, high temperatures and fever, a pack size of 16 tablets lasts one person 48 hours and self isolation makes replenishing supplies extremely difficult. Chemists can sell packs of 32 but most people shop in shops and can only buy packs of 16.",
