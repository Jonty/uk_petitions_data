Asking the restaurant if they had any antihistamine in their 1st Aid kit which is not a required item, they didn\u2019t, but luckily for us one of the waiters gave us 1 of his. An ambulance was called to attend my husband &  the tablet brought us time for the ambulance to take my husband to hospital for further treatment. \r\nWithout the tablet being given, the outcome could have been very tragic for us all. \r\nHaving these tablets in a 1st Aid kits can potentially save a life.",
