        "additional_details": "If there is no Duty on motor fuels prices should fall to a more realistic level. This should in turn reduce the costs of other goods and services because transport costs will be reduced. The price of fuel has an impact on almost everything. Removing duty on motor fuel should help the country flourish again, and the economy should benefit from more people having more money to spend on other things.",
