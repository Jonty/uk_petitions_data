        "additional_details": "Diet products should not be advertised or promoted by celebrities online, many of whom have a predominantly young audience.\r\n\r\nCelebrities and diet companies profit from other peoples\u2019 insecurities and eating disorders.\r\n\r\nProducts are easily accessed/ordered online by young people in society.\r\n\r\nBy banning the advertisement of these products and controlling the sale of them, we can help protect the 1.25 million people in the UK who have an eating disorder and deter anybody else from developing one.",
        "background": "The Government should introduce laws for diet products, similar to the Tobacco Advertising Act, banning the advertising and promotion of them, including celebrity endorsement on social media. The sale of diet products to minors should also be banned, and sellers required to verify the age of buyers.",
