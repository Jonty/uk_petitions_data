        "additional_details": "A woman I know has lost 10/11st from being morbidly obese. She now has heavy excess skin causing bruising, sores, infections, strain on her body and other issues and is her having to pay \u00a39500-\u00a311500 purely to get the skin removed when I think this should be part of the NHS, because she has actually worked hard and made a lifestyle change, rather than taking the easy way out and having a gastric band. What\u2019s the point in people changing their lives, if they can\u2019t receive the help they deserve.",
        "background": "I want the Government to make a difference in the NHS, and allow that people who go through extreme weightloss by working hard and changing their life, to get skin removal surgery without the endless paying out. To get it on the NHS because the excess skin is causing physical and mental suffering.",
