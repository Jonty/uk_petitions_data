        "additional_details": "Waiver all fees for the final term, for university students in Private Renting. I would like the government to consider this option as Landlords are unwilling to hear our plea amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Universities have suspended all face to face classes as a result of COVID-19, leaving students with alternative to return home for safety and reduced risk of contamination from other housemates.",
        "background": "Due to COVID-19 pandemic, UK Universities have given students the option of release on their third-term rent accommodation contracts. Therefore, students will no longer be obligated to pay their third-term rental fees. This same option should be applied to students in the private rental sector.",
