The \u00a31750 is a very expensive option for most of us who are civil servants or work within the healthcare, giving back to the nation. We have also comply with the rules and we should not be penalised, for few mishaps, caused by others. \r\n\r\nThose who are vaccinated should have some concession, as we cannot suffer because of other people",
