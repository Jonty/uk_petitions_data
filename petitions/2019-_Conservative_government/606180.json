        "action": "Introduce a regulator for private landlords and reduce and caps for rents.",
        "additional_details": "With increased homelessness and limited availability of social/council housing, the Government has a duty of care to regulate private landlords and reduce and limit rents. Extortionate rent prices are making it impossible for people to rent homes, with rents often increasing each year or every six months making it unaffordable, with limited protections for tenants. The salaries are not raising every six months or annually but unfortunately rents are. This has to change.",
        "background": "As there is a housing crisis and the stock of social housing is depleted there is more of a need for private renting. This has made private renting a lucrative business for private landlords. This all needs to be regulated and rents capped using the existing fair rents scheme.",
