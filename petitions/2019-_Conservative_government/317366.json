        "action": "Restoration of HMS Victory to seaworthy condition",
        "additional_details": "Victory is in need of repair essentially because no ship was designed to be in drydock for this length of time. Her rigging is being restored, and her masts replaced with fibreglass replicas. \r\n\r\nThe American USS Constitution, despite being laid down nearly 50 years after HMS Victory, is the oldest commissioned naval vessel still afloat. This is an insult to the British sea-faring tradition. We should make HMS Victory seaworthy again and rally around her in these gloomy and divisive times.",
        "background": "HMS Victory will finish undergoing her \u00a335,000,000 restoration project in drydock at Portsmouth in the year 2023, the greatest repair in Victory's history. We should sieze this chance to make this 254 year old first rate ship of the line seaworthy again.",
