        "additional_details": "The NHS was formed on the 5th July 1948 and was born out of a long-held ideal that good healthcare should be available to all, regardless of wealth. Since then it has continued to deliver exceptional care to all. Through the NHS there has been many amazing accomplishments. I don't think the NHS gets the recognition it deserves and the sacrifices that many nurses, doctors, health care professionals make. Even more so from the covid19 pandemic. That's why it's important to have an official NHS day",
        "background": "Since the NHS formed it has accomplished amazing things. I think its extremely important to recognise, remember and celebrate that. That's why I think we should have an official NHS day. To show our appreciation and celebrate the NHS for its history and sacrifices health care professionals have made",
