        "additional_details": "Planting one tree for each life lost would bring about a major new forestation project (at least sq. 20km), in keeping with the 'green recovery' many are hoping to see, whilst commemorating each individual victim. The forest would allow visitors to pay their respects and enjoy the outdoors in a way we were, at times, unable to during the pandemic.",
        "background": "At an appropriate time, a new National Forest would be a living memorial to the many thousands of victims of Covid-19 in the UK and a lasting tribute to the heroism displayed by NHS and other caregivers at this time. One tree planted for each victim lost would represent a major forestation project.",
