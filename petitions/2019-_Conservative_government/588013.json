Sometimes this mean being on a hold for 30 minutes. You have to do this for every time you want to book your bike on to a train.\r\n\r\nFurther to this, there are usually only 3 spaces for bicycles per train. \r\n\r\nWe are so far behind other European countries on this regard, holland and Germany have entire carriages just for bicycles.",

Now that the government is forming \"Great British Railways\", force train companies to make it easier to book bikes onto trains. To ensure people don't have to use taxis. As well as this, make more space available for bicycles per train.",
