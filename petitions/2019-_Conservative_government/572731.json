        "additional_details": "A few days ago, I sadly lost my grandad to Covid.  It was unexpected and he did everything he could do to stop the spread.  He didn\u2019t go out and could only have been infected through food deliveries.  The constant reminder of what my family. as well as the thousands of people who are going through the same as myself, is extremely upsetting.  There are also arguments that the Government\u2019s mixed messages have also lead to this spread and is seen as guilt tripping and insensitive.",
        "background": "I would like the new covid-19 government advert to be taken down permanently, or aired less due to the upset it has caused to those who have lost loved ones and those who suffered with the illness.  It is not respectful and only gives us a constant reminder on what we have lost.",
