        "additional_details": "We are taught about different cultures in a degrading way, as countries that were colonized and enslaved. In light of the BLM, to combat racism we need to provide education, to allow interest and understanding of cultures, to humanize other cultures and empower people of colour. \r\n\r\nOften racism stems from ignorance, but the solution isn't just to teach about why it is bad, but get to the root cause and show that there is more to each culture, this will teach appreciation for diversity.",
        "background": "The government should make it compulsory in schools to learn about different cultures outside of British history, colonial history and black slavery. We should cover cultural traditions around the world and a brief look at each cultures' history to pique interest and create better understanding.",
