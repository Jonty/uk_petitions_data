Inaction on this matter is going to cause global devastation of crops, record breaking droughts year on year which will eventually lead to mass migrations of refugees. To have a chance to prevent this, we need to switch to greener energy solutions, one of which being Hydrogen Fuel Cell vehicles which have been thoroughly safety tested.",

Reducing the number fossil fuel powered cars on the road will reduce our CO\u00b2 emissions to help the UK meet our climate targets.",
