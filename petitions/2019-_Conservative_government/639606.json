        "action": "End one- or two-word judgements to summarise an Ofsted Inspection Report",
        "additional_details": "At present, all schools in England are graded by Ofsted with a one- or two-word judgement. The idea that a single word or phrase can sum up everything a school has to offer is utterly ridiculous.  Of course, all parents want to know that the school their child attends is providing the best quality of education possible but if there are issues within a school these need to be identified and communicated precisely not reduced to a single word that implies overall success or overall failure.",
        "background": "The Commons Education Select Committee has decided to hold an inquiry into the effectiveness of Ofsted.  They are now gathering evidence and anyone can take part in this process.  This petition will be submitted as evidence of the nation\u2019s rejection of single word judgements.",
