This has resulted in an increase in insurance premiums for the next 5 years, which was the required length of time to report all accidents (claim and non-claim, fault and no-fault). I believe this is unfair, as it is causing a financial loss which cannot be claimed, and is putting a non-fault victim in a depreciated financial position.",
