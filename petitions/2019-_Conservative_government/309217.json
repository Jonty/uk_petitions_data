Decisions about prosecuting public servants for criminal offences would be a matter for the police and Crown Prosecution Service, and decisions about taking civil action against public servants would be a private matter for any individuals who wanted to bring such action.\r\n\r\nSome public servants are subject to additional codes, such as the Civil Service code, which the Government is responsible for enforcing. If you want the Government to publish details of cases where public servants are found to be in breach of the Civil Service code, you could start a new petition calling for this."
