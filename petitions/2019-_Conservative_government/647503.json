        "additional_details": "This was formally applied to help combat the rising obesity rates. However, we believe the policy has neglected the rising rates of eating disorders. I feel instead the law should be changed to optional menus where people can choose whether or not to have calories displayed. A survey by Beat (a UK eating disorder charity) in August 2022 found that 98% of people affected by eating disorders feel calories on menus will negatively impact them.",
        "background": "The Government should change legislation introduced in April 2022, which requires calorie information to be displayed on menus and food labels in restaurants, takeaways and cafes. This should instead be replaced with optional viewing, to prevent negative impact on people with eating disorders.",
