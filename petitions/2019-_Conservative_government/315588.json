        "additional_details": "The nation has become focussed on retail frenzy, and we need to bring back an element of peace to people\u2019s lives. Those working in retail are pushed into working Sundays and along with the rest of us, deserve a day of peace and relaxation. \r\n\r\nThe recent lockdown shows that we\u2019re able to survive with only essential shops, so let\u2019s make Sundays a day of rest for everyone. There would be less traffic on the roads, less environmental impact and an improved quality of life.",
        "background": "With the current lockdown, Sundays have become peaceful again, as opposed to the retail frenzy they were. The Government should consider restricting Sunday opening to small shops only.",
