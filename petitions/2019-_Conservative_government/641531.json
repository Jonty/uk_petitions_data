        "additional_details": "We believe police often fail to fulfil a duty of care towards members of the public, and creating a statutory duty of care which is equal to their knowledge, skills and ability would ensure they can be held accountable for failures. We also believe that the police are not always sufficiently transparent, and that a duty of candour is needed to ensure that complaints are handled fairly, and failings cannot be covered up.",
        "background": "The Government should introduce legislation to create statutory duties of care and candour for the police to members of the public. Currently, there is not a specific statutory duty of care or candour that the police owe towards individual members of the public. We believe this should change.",
