        "additional_details": "Sites such as Viagogo and Stubhub have had numerous chances to put settings in place like other companies such as Twickets to ensure sellers cannot resell for more than face value and nothing is being done about it. \r\nFor example, N-Dubz tickets were being listed for prices between \u00a3150 - \u00a31200 on Viagogo and \u00a3100 - \u00a3600 on Stubhub despite costing \u00a340-\u00a350 originally. \r\nNot only is this wrong, it also means many miss out events because these overpriced tickets are the only ones left up for sale.",
        "background": "We need a blanket ban on ticket resales above face value, meaning resale companies will be required to set price limits on resales like some ticket companies such as Ticketmaster and Twickets currently do. \r\nFailing this, any site which allow tickets to be listed above face value need to be removed.",
