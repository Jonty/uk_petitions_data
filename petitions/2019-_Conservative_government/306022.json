        "background": "Appeals from the PM for people to shop responsibly and not to stockpile seem to have made little impact on panic buying. Measures offered by several supermarkets, e.g. allowing elderly people to shop for the first hour of opening, are failing because the supermarkets cannot regulate them.",
