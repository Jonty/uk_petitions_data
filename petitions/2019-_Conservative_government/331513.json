        "action": "Revoke the legislation which makes the wearing of face masks compulsory",
        "additional_details": "In only March, Professor Chris Witty, the government\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, told U.K. citizens that wearing a face mask had \u201calmost no effect on reducing the risk of contracting the illness\u201d.  He went on to say \u201cwearing a mask if you don\u2019t have an infection reduces the risk almost not at all. So we do not advise that\u201d.  Therefore, we believe that making face masks compulsory is not based on sound scientific evidence and will have a significant negative impact on people\u2019s mental health.",
        "background": "We believe, given the controversial and conflicting scientific evidence regarding the usefulness of face masks, that it is an infringement on our liberties to be forced to wear one in public.  Whilst we have no issue with them being encouraged, making it a legal requirement is unjustified.",
