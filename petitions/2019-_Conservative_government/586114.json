        "additional_details": "On 26 January 2021, the Government responded to a previous petition to say that GCSE/A-Level exams would be cancelled in favour of teacher assessments this year.  Despite this, pupils are neverthess sitting exams in 2021 anyway.  These exams include actual questions and mark schemes used in 'past papers' and, therefore, cheating is endemic and widespread.  These questions should be withdrawn/disallowed, in favour of genuine teacher assessments, as the Government already promised us in January.",
        "background": "The Government should ensure that all questions from 'past papers' (including those sat in September 2020) are withdrawn/disallowed from 2021 GCSE/A-Level assessments, with immediate effect.",
