        "additional_details": "Research has found that one in seven species in the UK face extinction, and over 40% of species have experienced decline since 1970.\r\n\r\nA full public inquiry could establish the extent to which current laws provide adequate protections for UK species, and the effectiveness of Natural England and Defra, and whether any reforms to current laws and the Government\u2019s wider approach to protecting biodiversity are needed.",
        "background": "We need the Government to hold a public inquiry into why so many native species are struggling to survive and why so many are on the verge of extinction, which should result in reform of environmental laws and the Government\u2019s approach to protecting biodiversity.",
