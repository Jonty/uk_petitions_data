In the first three months of the pilot, 670 appointments were held with 483 patients. Of these, only 19 patients were referred on to more in-depth mental health support.\r\n \r\nHaving a Mental Health Nurse in these settings should help improve support for patients with mental health issues, and improve GP availability for other matters.\r\n",
