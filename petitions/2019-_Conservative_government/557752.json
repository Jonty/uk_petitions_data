        "additional_details": "They\u2019re dangerous and risk harm to those using them & others, they can be highly distressing to many people and animals. The loud bang can cause severe upset in those individuals suffering from PTSD, especially when they associate the bang with gunfire. In relation to pets, it can cause emotional distress that makes it impossible for them to settle. I also know of peoples dogs whom have passed away from a heart attack because of fireworks. Not to mention, they also cause a lot of air pollution.",
