The advent of Covid 19 has highlighted the dangers and shortcomings this division has caused. Providing Care Homes and Carers who work in clients own homes with the correct equipment and clothing has proved extremely challenging with dire consequences. It is obviously the cost of amalgamation which has perpetuated this division. With shortcomings starkly obvious now is the time for Government to take action and rectify the anomaly.",
