        "additional_details": "Many self-employed workers have had their livelihoods utterly destroyed by the coronavirus outbreak and the emergency provisions put in place to deal with it. Arts and events have been heavily hit; whether or not an industry is deemed viable by the government, those depending on it still need to survive. If the \u00a312 billion wasted on failed test-and-trace had been split instead among the self-employed, each worker would have received around \u00a32500. Money is there; it should go to help the public.",
        "background": "The third Self-Employment Support Scheme grant has been announced, but only at 20% of average earnings; this is nowhere near enough to live on for many who have had work disappear, such as those in events. Support is there for PAYE workers; the government should equally help self-employed taxpayers.",
