Those with an autoimmune disease and a life goal to work with the men and women in the Armed Forces are unable to join due to the restrictions set upon them, even if they are receiving effective treatment for this condition.\r\n \r\nThe Government should review the medical policy on fitness to serve and allow these people to enlist and serve their country in the Armed Forces.\r\n",
        "background": "Currently most people with autoimmune diseases are classed as unfit to serve in the Armed Forces. I would like to Government to review this policy so that people can serve if multiple doctors believe they are fit enough, or if their condition is being effectively treated.",
