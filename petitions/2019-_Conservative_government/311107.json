        "additional_details": "This is a time affecting many people, and the financial strain on students is greater than usual. Paying for empty housing is an expensive cost that many cannot afford. \r\nWhilst some accommodations/universities have already taken these steps and allowed students to terminate their contracts if they wish to do so, the majority still have not and will not do so unless the Government instructs it.",

Students should be given the option to terminate their tenancies for the third term without payment of rent and refunds made for those that have already paid.
