        "additional_details": "Trees store carbon and give us oxygen, vital for life. \r\nThey provide habitat for wildlife and support biodiversity. \r\nIn urban areas they reduce noise and capture pollutants from the air we breathe. They provide soil stability and reduce stormwater runoff, crucial for flood management. Trees provide shelter from wind and sun, and actively cool the surrounding air as well as enhancing our lives, giving us a sense of beauty and well being.\r\n\r\nThe right time to plant a tree is many decades ago.",
        "background": "We need protection of all mature trees, as afforded to those in conservation areas, ensured in response to the Government declared Climate Emergency 1st May 2019. Mature trees are being removed without environmentally commensurate replacement, and with the life sustained by the tree already lost.",
