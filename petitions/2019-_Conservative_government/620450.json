        "action": "Introduce taxes on aviation kerosene",
        "additional_details": "During a cost of living crisis, it makes no fiscal or moral sense for aviation fuel to be exempt from tax. Yet air travel operators are in a privileged position. The argument is made even stronger by the current climate emergency, with viable green air travel options decades away. Taxing airline fuel could therefore have the additional benefit of helping curb current growth in the sector to help meet the Government\u2019s own ambitious emissions targets.",
        "background": "In keeping with its own levelling-up agenda, the UK Government should legislate for the immediate introduction of VAT and a fuel duty on aviation kerosene. UK motorists pay almost 50% tax for every litre of fuel they buy, while jet kerosene remains completely untaxed.",
