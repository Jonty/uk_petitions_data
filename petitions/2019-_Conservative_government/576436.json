        "additional_details": "Some students have be affected more than others due to disadvantaged backgrounds and a lack of technology to access the remote learning. Assessments wont be a true reflection of a students grade due to the simple fact we have missed so much education. Going ahead with \u201cmini assessments\u201d adds to our stress and mental health problems. This is not a fair way to assess students as some find learning harder than other and the time of school has made it so much harder.",
