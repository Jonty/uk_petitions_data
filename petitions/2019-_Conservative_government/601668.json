This could have been as simple as someone spilling some and the rain creating a puddle and her drinking from that puddle.\r\n \r\nThe next morning she had lost the use of her back legs, dragging them and couldn't hold herself up She had acute kidney failure and the kindest thing to do was to put her to sleep.\r\n \r\nAnimals need immediate treatment to survive poisoning by toxic antifreeze, and this is often not possible.",
