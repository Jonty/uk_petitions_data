        "additional_details": "It is widely acknowledged that the Uyghur people are being oppressed in China. Since 2017, there have been many reports of the \u201ccultural genocide\u201d of Uyghur, including detention in \"re-education\" camps, systematic restrictions on Uyghur culture, and the use of forced labour.\r\n \r\nThe Government should intervene because there are clear human rights violations and the oppression of the Uyghur Muslims must not continue. Signing this petition could help the Uyghur people in China and stop what appears to be a \"cultural genocide\".",
        "background": "We want the UK Government to negotiate with the Chinese government to secure the release of Uyghur people held in so-called \u201cre-education\u201d camps. The UK Government must also ban any companies operating in the UK who are found to have used or profited from forced labour of the Uyghur people",
