Where are one parent who earns over \u00a350000 pays tax on this benefit and earners over \u00a360000 the benefit is stopped. This current system does not take into account partners earning. For some household their income is only \u00a350k-\u00a360k this is unfair that they lose this benefit or receive and un-welcome tax bill which they have to pay.",
