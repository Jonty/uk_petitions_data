        "additional_details": "Hailsham High Street was closed for eighteen months in order to facilitate updating the High Street. The works were not carried out properly and had to altered yet again. This disruption destroyed passing trade in the town centre which has never recovered. Several shops and business chose to close or relocate out of the town centre. To restrict transport through the High Street after the difficulties of lockdown will be the final nail in the coffin of the few remaining businesses.",
        "background": "Covid 19 physical distancing measures will remove all parking in the High Street in Hailsham. This will damage the few existing/successful businesses in the High Street and prevent access to the town centre for those who need access. The planned measures for Hailsham High Street must be abandoned.",
