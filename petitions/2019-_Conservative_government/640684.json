        "additional_details": "We believe recent decisions by the Bank of England do not adequately account for the current cost of living crisis faced by families across the UK. Households are already struggling to meet their basic needs, with minimal or no disposable income. Increased rates will force many families into unmanageable debt, exacerbating their financial hardship and compromising their overall well-being. We urge you to consider the gravity of the situation and take the steps set out in this petition, to help address these concerns.",
