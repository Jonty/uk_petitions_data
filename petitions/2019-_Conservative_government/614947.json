        "action": "Remove the act/legislation/law /protocol of deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda",
        "additional_details": "This action must be undone. It is ill advised and clearly comes from a person who has not faced adversity. Gangs in Africa will traffic the people back to Europe. They will end up in the UK because we no longer belong to the EU meaning they are not concerned about our borders. An MP who believes this is a solution to the migrant crisis has spent too little time in the real world. It's messy dirty and unfair out here, often because of the Tories! Sweeping humans under the carpet will not work.",
        "background": "This move will inevitably cost the UK more, but above all will further traumatise vunlerable people and fund illegal people trafficking. The UK people demonstrated their compassion for asylum seekers by opening their own homes to house Ukrainian refugees.",
