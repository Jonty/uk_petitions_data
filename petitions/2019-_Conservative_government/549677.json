        "additional_details": "People with coeliac disease are not allowed to join the army in the UK. There is no real heath reason why people with coeliac disease shouldn\u2019t join the army. People with coeliac disease are in perfect health as long as their dietary requirements are met. Because the army are supplying Halal, vegetarian and vegan food I do not see why the army can\u2019t provide gluten free food for people who have coeliac disease when people who choose to eat vegetarian, vegan and Halal food are being catered for.",
        "background": "Currently you cannot join any British Armed Forces with Coeliac Disease as it may affect operational ability. Vegetarian/ Halal diets are provided- but no GF. Coeliacs can be asymptomatic and with a GF diet would be an asset to the Armed Forces. Refusal to supply a Gluten Free diet is discriminatory",
