        "additional_details": "Completely ban the sale of used power tools at car boot sales and markets. By not doing so we believe the Government is allowing these tool thieves a platform to sell these tools for quick money. By not doing so we believe the Government is putting more pressure on the police department who receive calls all across the country about tool theft. Insurance companies are suffering because of this crime too. Trades people across the country are struggling to work and feed their families.  This needs to end. We want there to be a \u00a310,000 fine for selling used power tools at a car boot sale or market, and for organisers of car boot sales or markets where power tools are sold. Make it hard for these tool thieves.",
        "background": "We think car boot sales and markets are a major reason for tool theft from vans. Many tradespeople have their van broken into and have their tools stolen, which can deprive them of their livelihood. Replacing tools is not cheap, and we want the Government to take action to tackle tool theft.",
