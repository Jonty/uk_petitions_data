I do not agree with this increase and believe that the tax increase should be applied to people and companies with an annual turnover of more than \u00a3 30,000. The government cannot force people who cannot afford another car to pay a tax increase. A car after 2010 is just a dream for many of them. Many people work hard for \u00a3 200 weekly. They own a car between 2002 and 2003 and will have to pay an increased tax? From \u00a3 200 weekly? What about if they have a child or two? What will they eat if they raise taxes again and again?",
