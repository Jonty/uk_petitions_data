This debilitating disease fluctuates between flare ups and remission. Since my first symptoms appeared in August 2021, including blood in my stool, I have had to pay for 3 different medications - which didn\u2019t have a positive impact on my illness.\r\n\r\nThose with Crohn\u2019s and colitis are at greater risk of developing bowel cancer. I ask does it need to reach that point for me to seek free prescriptions?",
