        "additional_details": "This follows the House of Commons declaration of a climate change emergency, in May 2019. It seems that the government has yet to declare a Climate Emergency as such however, or even a Crisis.\r\n\r\nA UK National Unity government was last formed when the we faced an existential crisis, during wartime. We may well be facing much greater threats now: food, water, shelter, flooding, heat waves, and severe winter weather etc. Possibly even complete economic and social collapse.",
        "background": "I want the government to form a National Unity government composed of MPs from all parties, plus independents. The Climate Emergency has to be addressed by us all, working together. \r\n\r\nOur government has to be non-partisan, to help ensure that effective solutions can be implemented.",
