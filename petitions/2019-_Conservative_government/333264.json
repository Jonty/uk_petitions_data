        "additional_details": "Although meant with good intentions, I do believe that expecting people who are already at a higher bmi than would be healthy, to drastically change there ways because a number is printed on a menu is extremely reductionist, and only focuses on obesity. Where as for example people with restrictive type eating disorders will be majorly effected by such requirements and will both hinder recovery & make others vulnerable to such illnesses. There for a holistic approach would be more appropriate.",
