        "additional_details": "We face high numbers of pets being stolen for cruel purposes & puppy farms that result in high deaths of dogs that otherwise could have lived long & healthy lives. It can cost as little as \u00a320 to have a dog cremated with a pet crematorium/burial company. The complete lack of law & regulations in the crem/burial industry creates a risk-free & cheap way for criminals to get rid of evidence with no worry of traceability & can result in loving owners never knowing what has happened to their family dog.",

Make it legal requirement to contact the registered owner if this does not match.",
