        "action": "Abolish compulsory jury service",
        "additional_details": "We believe compelling individuals without their explicit consent infringes on their rights. The obligation to serve on a jury is imposed without voluntary agreement, disrupting personal and professional lives. We consider that this lack of consent challenges the democratic principle that citizens should have a say in the responsibilities imposed on them. If jurors are grappling with anger, stress, or personal concerns such as lack of childcare or financial hardship, it could impact their ability to make unbiased decisions.",
        "background": "I advocate for abolishing compulsory jury service due to its potential impact on individuals' lives, causing disruptions, financial strain, and therefore potentially compromising the fairness of trials.",
