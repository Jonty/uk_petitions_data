It can cost as little as \u00a320 to have a dog cremated with a pet crematorium/burial company. The complete lack of law & regulations in the crem/burial industry creates a risk free & cheap way for criminals to get rid of evidence with no worry of traceability & results in loving owners never knowing what has happened to their family dog.",

Make it legal requirement to contact the registered owner if this information does not match",

The title of your petition only refers to crematoriums, and it's not clear if you want this requirement to be imposed for just crematoriums, or for any business that is involved in the euthanasia, cremation or burial of a pet.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
