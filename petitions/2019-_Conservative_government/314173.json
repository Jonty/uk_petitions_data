        "additional_details": "We are all rightly proud of the NHS and our teachers, supermarket workers, delivery workers, freight drivers, police, fire and other front line emergency services.\r\nA fitting thank you from the government would be the write off of the tuition fee costs involved in allowing these people to qualify to do their roles.\r\nThis should include NHS professionals and teachers where it was necessary to obtain that qualification to perform their role and in the case of drivers, should include training fees.",
        "background": "Last week, Matthew Hancock wrote off NHS debt to allow NHS trusts to get on with building capacity to cope with the Covid-19 crisis. \r\nI ask the government to write off tuition fee debt for those working in all NHS professions and those working in the teaching profession & others on the front line",
