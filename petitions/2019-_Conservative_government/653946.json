        "additional_details": "These utterly vile individuals have no right to breathe the same air as their victims, who either suffer for the rest of their lives or are no longer breathing. These reprehensible criminals are enjoying the safety of a prison, funded by taxpayers. Do you want to pay for rapists to live? Capital punishment is the only way forward when it comes to addressing these crimes.",
        "background": "We believe that the current criminal justice system implemented in the UK is too weak and lenient on the most serious crimes. We advocate for the imposition of the death penalty for individuals convicted of heinous offenses such as rape, pedophilia, domestic abuse, murder, and child molestation.",
