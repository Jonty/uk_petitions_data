        "action": "For every UK person vaccinated against Covid19, vaccinate a poor person",
        "additional_details": "The UK Government spends a tiny amount (0.7%) on overseas aid but has recently cut this by \u00a34billion (to 0.5%). This goes against what people voted for in the Conservative election manifesto pledge and also against UK law. A global pandemic is not the time to turn our back on the world's poorest people. I urge our Government to be courageous by offering payment for a person in the world's poorest countries to be vaccinated for every lucky person who is freely vaccinated in the UK. We are one.",
        "background": "Covid19 has affected the whole world, both rich and poor. A vaccine offers a solution, bringing our lives back to normal. But this should be for everyone not just a lucky few in wealthy countries. Join us and ask the UK government, for every UK person vaccinated, to pay for a poor person too.",
