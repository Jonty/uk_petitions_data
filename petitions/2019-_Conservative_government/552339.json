        "additional_details": "This roundabout is used by many drivers AND pedestrians, it is near to 2 Primary Schools, 2 Nurseries, and just metres from a play park and a bus stop. \r\nCurrently there are not enough safety crossings in place here, given the amount of young children and general pedestrians in this area.\r\nI feel very strongly about this, as while heavily pregnant I was walking my 3 year old to nursery, and we were nearly involved in a serious accident with a speeding car coming over the roundabout.",
        "background": "A zebra crossing to be installed where safe by the roundabout opposite The Dick Whittington Pub Prestwick Rd. \r\nMore road safety signs, road markings, or anything to raise driver awareness, and ensure drivers slow down on the approach to this roundabout.",
