        "action": "Remove Nigeria from the UK Covid travel red list",
        "additional_details": "I am sad and of the view that the decison to include Nigeria on the red list is a systematic abuse of the African people simply because Nigeria was one of the first countries in the world that introduced drastic measures to combact the spread of Covid19 and other variants. The government announced that from 4am on Tuesday 7 December 2021 anyone wishing to come to the UK will need to show a negative pre departure test (LFD or PCR) and this was a measure first introduced in Nigeria since 2020.",
        "background": "The government added Nigeria to the list of covid restricted countries following 21 cases of Omicron reported in England and was allegedly traced to Nigeria without any form of evidence. Nigeria is currently one of the No.1 safest countries in the world today because of its approach against covid19.",
