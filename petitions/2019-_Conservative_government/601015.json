        "action": "Abolish the whipping system in parliament",
        "additional_details": "The current system is broken as rather than MPs being able to truly vote on articles/legislation for the benefit of their constituency, they vote only as instructed. So, rather than having a system that allows constituents to vote for and appoint effective MPs, it's a system that only ensures that the ruling party maintains power over the House of Commons. Essentially the whip is undemocratic. Party unity should be established through shared understanding, not a fear of the whip being removed.",
        "background": "This petition proposes that the whipping system should be abolished in parliament and in place all MPs should be allowed a 'free vote' on all matters. MPs should be able to vote freely and not coerced into voting one way or another.",
