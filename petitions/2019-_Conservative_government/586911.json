        "additional_details": "Usually, exam boards mark exams and they pay teachers to mark them: \u00a3500 - \u00a31000 per batch. Currently, teachers are marking, moderating and grading exams/assessments in school because of Covid. Therefore, it stands to reason that teachers should be paid for the work they are doing on behalf of exam boards and the government. Please see the this Examiner recruitment page for further information on how exam marking is completed and paid for:\r\nhttps://www.aqa.org.uk/join-us/become-an-examiner",
        "background": "Transfer the money paid to the exam boards, for marking exams, to teachers who are actually doing the work. As a teacher, I am marking, moderating and recording the results for 64 english exams. This is extra work, on top of my normal workload, for which I am receiving no extra pay.",
