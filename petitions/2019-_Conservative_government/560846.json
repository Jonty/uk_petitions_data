        "background": "In the last few years alone \"fake news\" has influenced elections, led to violence, and has caused mental distress to countless people. With Coronavirus, this has become literally life or death. Being able to critically evaluate the information we consume is integral in the age of social media.",

We could only accept a petition requesting this for England, as education is a devolved responsibility in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland."
