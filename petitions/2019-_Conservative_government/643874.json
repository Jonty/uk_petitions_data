Children in most circumstances can't pay the fines, and with the increased financial stresses families are facing, we are concerned that these fines risk the child being unfairly disciplined as a result, or having to leave grassroots sport.\r\n\r\nSimply we need the Government to ban sporting authorities from issuing fines to children.\r\n\r\nThere is so much money in football, we believe these fines are unfair and unnecessary.\r\n",
        "background": "We are concerned these penalties are causing children to stop playing as they or their parents can't afford the additional costs.\r\n\r\n",
