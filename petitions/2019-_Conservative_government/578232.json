No government should waste time or energy on a \u2018wildcat referendum\u2019 which would only cause confusion, waste tax payers money and create discourse amongst our citizens.",
        "background": "The Scotland act (1998) clearly classifies the Union as a reserved matter (something only Westminster can legislate on), but there is confusion around if this includes referendums on the union. To clear up any confusion it should be made explicitly clear that referendums need Westminster\u2019s consent.",
