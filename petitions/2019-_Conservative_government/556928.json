        "additional_details": "The majority of students were sent to University in September, and began a mixture of online/in person lectures. However, the majority of courses include in person lectures once a week, or not at all. Due to COVID-19, most or all of the university facilities aren't accessible anymore. Due to local lockdowns and restrictions, students have been confined to their accommodations and can only mix with their flat. This is a very daunting experience for many students, resulting in poor mental health.",
        "background": "The Government needs to force universities to reduce the \u00a39250 fee that students pay. Due to COVID-19, students have received a much poorer standard of learning than previous years, however, are being charged the same. The neglect on this years students is clear as their voices are not being heard.",
