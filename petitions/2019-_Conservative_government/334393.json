        "additional_details": "In the Summer, drivers are operating in 38C (or more) cabs with no air conditioning and only an open window or warm air blowing into a glass and plastic cab. This causes the risk of drowsiness or even fainting, making safe driving impossible. Similarly, in Winter, it's difficult to drive when fingers, hands and feet have become numb. Although modern buses are often equipped with air conditioning, some bus operators disconnect them due to higher fuel consumption when it's switched on.",
        "background": "Either force bus operators to provide working air conditioning where fitted or the right for a driver to refuse to drive if the temperature rises above a legal limit. Similarly, the right for a driver to refuse to drive if the temperature falls below a legal limit.",
