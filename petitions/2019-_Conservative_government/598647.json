        "additional_details": "During the Brexit leave campaign it was implied that the VAT on domestic fuel would be removed once we had left the EC, this has not yet happened. With respect to domestic oil, the price has doubled within the past year, similar rises with electricity and gas prices have been capped, protecting the consumer. Similar protection is needed for domestic oil consumers.",
