        "additional_details": "People are being arrested simply for their beliefs and opinions. This is injustice and is damaging to society. There can never be a line between 'hate speech' and free speech. By implementing hate speech, the most sacred and basic human right is violated; the right to think and speak freely without consequences (aside from blatant threats).\r\n\r\nThe UK is a western, modern nation. We are not North Korea, people deserve these rights. Therefore, we propose the repealing of all hate speech laws.",
        "background": "I have witnessed multiple people being either fined or imprisoned for expressing their 'hateful' opinions, which is, mind you, not extreme.\r\n\r\nFeelings should not override and be held above the right to speak freely. This is an issue that has haunted the UK for too long and it must come to an end.",
