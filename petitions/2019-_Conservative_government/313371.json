        "additional_details": "The government should do this as it would allow schools to get predicted grades as the exam season in year 12 was essential for getting an idea of the ability of a student and predicting them with the right grade. It would also allow students to upgrade their applications as this is the time that students would usually venture out, finding things to do so they stood out from others.",
        "background": "Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, students aren't able to get their predicted grades and aren't able to volunteer as this is the time that most students would volunteer. It would take a toll on schools as they will struggle to cope with their desired course calendar if there'd been no virus",
