        "additional_details": "Without the support of an IMHA informal patients sometimes have no one to speak for them or help them be involved in their treatment and care plan. This is essential if they are to avoid relapse once they return to the community. Too many people are deprived of a voice. Failure to give all mental health patients a voice can leave them isolated & desperate, which can lead to their mental health deteriorating further.",
        "background": "Provide funding so that all informal patients can have access to IMHA. Being in a mental health hospital can be confusing & distressing. IMHAs can help people get their opinions heard and make sure they know their rights under the law. IMHAs make a big difference to people and can help save lives.",
