        "additional_details": "I want this matter to be discussed in Parliament as Rishi Sunak has called our industry \"unskilled\" but also has labelled that we are \"non essential\" to the economy when our industry is worth on average \u00a33 trillion pounds. He has recently stated that he thinks it would be wise for our industry to \"retrain\" to find better jobs? I paid over \u00a375,000 to train as a dancer and worked tirelessly for 5years of my life, it is not as simple as just to, retrain. More needs to be done.",
