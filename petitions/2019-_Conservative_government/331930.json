        "additional_details": "Many students are made to feel out of place in school sport, and cannot express their true selves when forced to do a sport just because of their gender. It also causes inequality as from day one students are defined by their gender, which can knock some people\u2019s self-confidence. It is archaic that this still happens, and should not be allowed.",

This should help tackle sexism and increase participation.",
