        "additional_details": "To decide if it will be possible to allocate a minimum percentage of the budget and start a project of saving and supporting our places of worship for all faiths in UK. Many have little or no financial support during these unprecedented times and we all need to have the certainty that we can continue to have a place to pray and grow spiritually now and after the pandemic. We hope that most of us will realise that places where we connect to God are as important as those where we heal ourselves.",
        "background": "To look into our petition request and decide if the mental and spiritual health is as important as the physical health, especially now. As we all must save and support the NHS, we must also save and support our churches and places of worship, where we can connect to God and heal our minds and souls.",
