        "additional_details": "Furthermore, just under half (49 per cent) of 1000 healthcare workers surveyed stated that they had felt that they were understaffed and could not provide the level of care needed. Another shocking survey reveals that 2/3 of the 1000 healthcare workers reported being \"mentally exhausted\" at least once a week and five per cent, the equivalent of 80,000 staff, said they had thought about suicide and self-harm weekly or more.",
        "background": "Over the past 10 years pay for many NHS staff has fallen by 19 per cent. A 15% pay rise or \u00a33,000 is affordable and will go someway to undoing the damage done, especially since the 1% pay rise wouldn't even be able to improve the salaries due to inflation.",
