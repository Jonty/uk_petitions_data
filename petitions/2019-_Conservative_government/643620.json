        "additional_details": "There are many sectors of the economy responsible for greenhouse gas production. Taxing polluting raw materials could provide a simple solution to reducing greenhouse gas production in all sectors. Profits from the taxes could be used to fund sustainability projects, and provide subsidies to reduce the impact on consumers.\r\n \r\nFor example:\r\nIf it is fossil fuels, you can tax coal, oil and gas\r\nIf it is concrete, you can tax cement\r\nIf it is land use, you can tax the purpose that the land is used for",

Taxing polluting raw materials could be an effective tool in fighting climate change. Doing this at the source will drive market change to seek less polluting, more sustainable alternatives.",
