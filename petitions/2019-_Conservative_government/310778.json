        "additional_details": "i want to do it to get the governments backing on making companies aware they need to realise just hope big of a deal a persons health is right now and that staff being told they can work should be rewarded for the risks they are having to make so a company can still basically make a profit selling tea bags they are thinking too much about profit then health and it is disgusting to think that while head office staff would be at home the people that work in the shops are at risk",
        "background": "i feel that retail workers aren't be praised enough for putting the health of themselves at risk for shops to be open for example my shop is giving 10% extra per hour it makes me feel that companies small or big chains are still only interested in one thing profit and the staff not treated fair",
