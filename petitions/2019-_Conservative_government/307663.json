        "additional_details": "There are nearly five million self-employed people in the work force or 16% of total workforce. Since many are in the sectors affected either by the COVID-19 virus or HMG order to close businesses, it is only fair to extend the same help promised employees of such businesses. This is especially so since the self-employed have fewer rights and benefits available to them than employees.",
        "background": "HM Government can use HMRC's Self Assessment returns of the self-employed to issue tax refunds based on 80% of average annual fees past three years. Refunds are to be given to those in sectors (hospitality,travel,entertainment etc.) directly affected either by COVID-19 virus or HMG order to close.",
