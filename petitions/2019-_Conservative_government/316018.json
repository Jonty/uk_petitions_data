        "action": "Stop The Royal Mail from profiteering from the Covid 19 crisis",
        "additional_details": "I feel the charge to businesses, during the current crisis, is excessive. The businesses have been forced to close in order to protect the public and the NHS. \r\n\r\nMany businesses, especially shops, have shutters etc which protect the premises, but also prevent pist from being able to be delivered. \r\n\r\nI would like the Government to speak with the Royal Mail and encourage them remove the charge for the delivery, until such time as businesses are allowed to operate normally once again",
        "background": "The Royal Mail is refusing to hand over business mail stored at it's delivery offices and is forcing them to take out a redirection, at the cost of \u00a3216. This is blatant profiteering from the current crisis.\r\n\r\nMany currently closed businesses do not have any way for post to be delivered.",
