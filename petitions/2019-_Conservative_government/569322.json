This rule also was not made clear on the news. Learner drivers need practice in their own time and vehicle in order to pass a test. Lessons alone are not efficient.",
        "background": "Lockdown rules say that learner drivers are not allowed to drive in their own vehicle at all in England but in Scotland and Wales they are allowed with a member of their household or support bubble for essential journey (eg work, education).",
