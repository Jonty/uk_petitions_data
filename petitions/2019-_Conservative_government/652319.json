        "additional_details": "As residents of Warrington we want a deduction to our council tax payments as many of us are suffering because of the Warrington bin strikes.  We are paying a percentage of council tax for our rubbish to be removed yet many of us are having to pay for skips and trips to the recycling centres using our fuel for this which again is more funds out of our pockets. It\u2019s now going into December strikes with November and October already having strikes and no bins collected. It\u2019s absolutely disgusting.",
        "background": "As residents of Warrington we want a deduction to our council tax payments due to bin strikes affecting us through October, November and going into December. Rubbish mounting up outside, rats, spending money for skips and fuel trips to the recycling centre. Something needs to be done about this.",
