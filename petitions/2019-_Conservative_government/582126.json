        "additional_details": "Many children with special needs, especially autistic children, need to go to school for their mental and physical well-being. Staying at home for prolonged period of times can disrupt their routine and cause enormous distress, especially if they are not verbal and don't understand what's happening, and can also mean a lack of the mental stimulation they need to feel happy and be able to regulate their emotions for the rest of the day and night. School holidays can be a nightmare for families with children with special needs.",
        "background": "The Government should ensure that children with special needs are able to attend school during holidays. The loss of schooling during holidays can adversely affect children and parents, which can be extremely unfair to the children with special needs and their families.",
