        "additional_details": "The Pfizer vaccine has been approved in the UK for 12-18 year olds, but it is not being yet being offered to this age group. According to a study by Imperial College London (source: https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/89629), children and teens are 5 times more likely to test positive for the delta variant, which now makes up over 90% of all Covid-19 cases in the UK. This is a virus that is increasingly affecting young people, who must not be forgotten about by the government. Take action now.",
        "background": "Now that all adults are being offered the vaccine, most youth have so far remained unvaccinated, and unsurprisingly, the delta variant seems to disproportionately affect youth (likely as they are unvaccinated), significantly more than adults. The UK Government must take action to address this.",
