        "additional_details": "PIMS-TS (also known as MISC outside the UK) is hard to diagnose as its symptoms are multiple and mimic other conditions. It is essential that all UK parents are able to easily access symptom information online, so that they can make sense of these diverse symptoms and seek prompt medical assistance. As PIMS-TS is so closely linked to Covid and shares some of its symptoms, symptom information should be placed next to Covid symptoms on the NHS website.",

It is an acute illness and requires prompt diagnosis to avoid long term complications. Government symptom information is essential to achieve this.",
