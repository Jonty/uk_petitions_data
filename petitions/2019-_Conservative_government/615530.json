        "additional_details": "Because students mental health is deteriorating with school let alone homework as well. Also there isn\u2019t enough time for out of school hobbies and relaxation time. An average school gives 10 pieces of homework out each week, 1 per lesson, that means 10 hours of homework as well as an additional 6 hours of school. An average teenager needs at least 8-10 hours of sleep. So say a student gets 2 pieces of homework per day. That\u2019s 6 hours at school. 2-4 hours of work depending on the work set. 3 hours for eating and 10 for sleep that only leaves 1 hour for out of school clubs",
