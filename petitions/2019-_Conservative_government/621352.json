        "action": "Allow energy bills to be paid as part of salary sacrifice, saving Tax & NI",
        "additional_details": "The government rebate is welcome but due to the huge scale of the energy price rises it will help but (\u00a366 a month, vs a monthly bill of \u00a3600+) will still fall well short of helping families through this winter. With salary sacrifice families have the chance to save huge amounts of tax and national insurance and reduce the level of energy debt they will be in by Feb / March next year. This unfortunately is a decision that cannot wait or be discussed in 6 months time.",
        "background": "With prices getting incredibly high for electricity bills, can the government look to enable paying energy bills via a salary sacrifice scheme. You can currently lease an electric car, buy a bike, contribute to pension and pay for child care through a salary sacrifice scheme.",
