There are currently no legal restrictions on services or venues members of the public, including children, can access based on their vaccination status. It is therefore not clear what it is you want this pass to be used for.\r\n\r\nIn any case, while entry to EU countries based on someone's recovery status is permitted, the current NHS Covid pass does not recognise a person's recovery status, no matter their age. This means the NHS Covid Pass would need to be expanded to include recovery status before children could be included. We already have a petition open which is calling for this to happen, and which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\n'Recognise people who recently recovered from COVID in the domestic COVID Pass': https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/603682\r\n"
