Therefore, I can only deduce that suspected cancer patients and their families are not a priority which is unacceptable morally, ethically and medically. Cancer patients need early diagnosis in order to save lives as for some suspected cancer patients time is their enemy. Some suspected cancer patients do not have the luxury of time. Therefore, time is of the essence.",
