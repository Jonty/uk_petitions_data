        "additional_details": "I believe no child should be consuming fizzy soft drinks under the age of 6. I believe this could help the Government save money as a lot of children need dental care for damaged teeth at a young age. There should be clear labelling of age restrictions on all cans and bottles.",
        "background": "I want all fizzy drinks to have an age restriction of 6 or older. These drinks shouldn't be sold to children any younger, and it should be illegal to give fizzy drinks to a child under the age of 6. This is because these drinks are often harmful to teeth and wider health.",
