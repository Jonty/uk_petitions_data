Encourage healthy eating and reduce landfill by banning the shrink wrapped cucumbers, the packets of tomatoes and netted oranges.",
        "background": "It is unacceptable to have to put plastic straight into the bin after a purchase of fresh vegetables and fruit. They either need to be packaged in recyclable materials or not at all. Reduce landfill and incentivise research into greener alternatives to single use plastic.",
