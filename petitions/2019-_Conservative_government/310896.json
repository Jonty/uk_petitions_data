        "additional_details": "The UK government has set out a \u00a3350Bn fund to be distributed in\r\nloans, grants and financial aid.\r\nUnfortunately company directors and shareholders receiving a dividend have seen little protection in this crises.\r\n\r\nThe UK population is around 70 million, as opposed to distributing the allocated funds in various different ways, give a \u00a31000.00 cash grant to each citizen regardless of circumstances, this would save the government around \u00a3140Bn in expenditure leaving them room to loan out the rest.",
        "background": "Introduce a grant of \u00a31000.00 per person, per month for the next 3 months, disregarding income or age. This covers the entire population through this crises.\r\n\r\nScrap the new policies for the COVID-19 pandemic:\r\nJob retention scheme\r\nSelf Employment aid\r\nand replace it with this new grant.",
