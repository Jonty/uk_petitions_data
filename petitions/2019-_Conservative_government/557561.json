        "additional_details": "Scotland tier 4 allows for weddings to go ahead with 5 or less guests. If a small socially distant wedding is possible, why should this not be allowed to take place?\r\n\r\nHere many couples have already rearranged their wedding once, and suffered significant emotional and financial turmoil because of this.\r\nFurthermore, many couples want simply to just be married now. Some for very necessary legal reasons.\r\n\r\nThis will also help maintain some much needed money in the wedding industry.",
        "background": "I propose that weddings/civil partnerships be allowed to go ahead with either just the couple themselves or less than 5 guests, where social distancing is possible.",
