        "additional_details": "Early medical abortion is very safe when a woman less than 10 weeks pregnant takes two tablets to induce miscarriage. COVID-19 will make accessing abortion clinics harder because of self-isolation, social distancing, reduced transport and/or caring responsibilities. Delays make the process of medical abortion less safe because it is riskier later in pregnancy and could result in some women having to have a more invasive procedure instead. If the crisis lasts the predicted 12 weeks, 14,000 women already pregnant will struggle to access safe care - as well as those who become pregnant during this time. \r\n\r\nElizabeth Chloe Romanis, Jordan Parsons and Dr Nathan Hodson\r\nhttps://blogs.bmj.com/bmjsrh/2020/03/21/covid-19-abortion/",
        "background": "Abortion providers should be permitted to consult about treatment remotely and arrange for both abortion medications to be delivered to women to take at home during the coronavirus crisis. Remote abortion care is currently unlawful in England, but is already legally provided in other countries.",
