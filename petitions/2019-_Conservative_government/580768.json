        "additional_details": "The multiple benefits of going into school in PE kit, on days when a child has a PE lesson, outweigh any desire to cling to tradition. Let\u2019s support this simple way to; gain teaching time that is lost when children change at the beginning and end of every PE lesson, reduce lost property, help students with additional needs, save parents\u2019 time & money, reduce battles & discomfort over daily full uniform, and do away with the anxiety & embarrassment many face over public changing.",
        "background": "As a response to Covid, many UK schools have had students wear school PE kit, rather than full uniform, on days when they have PE. An obvious break, from the traditional way that UK schools have approached dress, it has proven popular with staff, parents & students alike, for a variety of reasons.",
