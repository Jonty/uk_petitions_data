        "additional_details": "Parents of lockdown babies currently have access to very little support during lockdowns. Continual sleep deprivation with no relief is unsustainable. With the new restrictions in the North West, what little support we had has been removed. The long term impact of this on the family and baby could be severe, including missed medical issues, increased risk of postnatal depression, and increases in neglect/abuse. It takes a village to raise a child, and new parents are being asked to do it alone.",
        "background": "All parents of babies under 1yr should be able to form a support bubble. This would mean parents would have clear guidance on who can help with caring for their child and this help would be more protected during local lockdowns.\r\nThe safe reopening of healthy baby clinics should be a priority.",
