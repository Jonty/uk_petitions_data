        "action": "Force Universities to Reimburse Students Loosing Contact Hours Due to Strikes",
        "additional_details": "Each year, university students pay over \u00a39,000 to study in university for an undergraduate degree. Based on 10 contact hours a week over a teaching year of 42 weeks, this is \u00a322 an hour for lectures. The universities are less affected by strike action compared to students, as they still receive out tuition payments and don't pay striking teachers either. Forcing universities to actually face a loss of some kind is more likely to make them listen to teaching unions and make fair compromises.",
        "background": "The Government should make a law that universities have to reimburse students a portion of their tuition fee when contact hours are missed due to strike action or action just short of a strike.",
