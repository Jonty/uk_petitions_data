We want to the right to be able to raise our families and contribute to the UK like everyone else. The proposals will split families, separate loved ones and deprive children of one of their parents. The new proposals are such a big increase it makes the dream of family life that is often taken for granted impossible for so many.",
        "background": "Don't increase the financial requirement for UK citizens to bring their spouses to the UK. The proposals would see an increase in April 2024 from 18,600 to 38,700 pounds in terms of income. For the savings only route this would mean an increase from 62,500 to around 112,000 pounds held for 6 months",
