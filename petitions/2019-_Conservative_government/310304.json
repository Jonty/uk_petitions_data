        "additional_details": "We want the Government to divert businesses to make visors, FFP3 respirator masks, full-arm disposable gowns, shoe covers, long arm gloves, and disposable hair hoods for all NHS staff at risk. This includes GPs seeing \u2018suspected\u2019 cases of coronavirus, instead of a surgical mask, short gloves and an apron.\r\n\r\nMedical staff are hugely at risk, ie 13% of severe infection cases involve them, with many deaths. Doctors say they feel like \u2018cannon fodder\u2019. Doctors groups eg BMA are calling for this.",
        "background": "The W.H.O., who are experienced in epidemics, and recommends full PPE, and do not advise the inadequate UK recommendations. This misguided UK advice must change and correct equipment made and delivered very rapidly.",
