Zoos also make money now to see them through the quieter winter months - how can they do this?\r\nMost animals in zoos are classed as endangered or critically endangered, and they also help conservation efforts around the world - we run the risk of losing many animals without urgent help!",
        "background": "Pay for food and vet care needed for zoos, wildlife parks and aquariums during the coronavirus outbreak, as zoos have very little income presently (during what should be there peak operating months).\r\nZoos need urgent help now to help with funding, rather than having to rely on public donations!",
