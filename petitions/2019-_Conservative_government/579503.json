        "action": "Make public sexual harassment a criminal offense in the UK",
        "additional_details": "The recent statistic by UN Women UK released a shocking statistic that 97% of women have been sexually harassed. This study included public harassment, and is the most common form. Outlining how severe even this form of harassment is by enforcing law against it will not only help people to feel comfortable opening up about their experience, but will also act as a deterrent or realisation for those who deem it ok to verbally harass people publicly.",
        "background": "Verbal harassment of a sexual nature in public is largely too common and helps to breed an acception of even more severe forms of sexual harassment, which are already deemed a criminal offense. Making sure people know the reality of their actions have is the first step in creating a safer society",
