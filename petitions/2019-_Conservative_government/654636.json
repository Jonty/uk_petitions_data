People weren't able to see dying relatives, go to funerals, go to weddings, see family, yet some ministers and officials appeared to behave in complete disregard to the rules. We believe they all need to go, regardless of level or position.",

We believe it would be hypocritical for such people to be allowed to remain in post.",
