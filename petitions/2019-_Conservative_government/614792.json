For the child I pay maintenance to, relative incomes of the receiving parent are not taken into consideration. For the child I receive maintenance for, because of the non-resident father's circumstances, I do not receive payments. \r\n \r\nI believe this is unfair, and that the rules for child maintenance payments should be reformed, so that relative incomes of paying and receiving parents, and maintenance cases for all children involved can be taken into account side by side.
