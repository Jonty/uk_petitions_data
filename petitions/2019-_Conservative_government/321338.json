        "action": "Make VAT zero rated on takeaway (all) food & ticket sales in hospitality sector.",
        "additional_details": "During the Covid 19 crisis many pubs, clubs, music venues & restaurants are now dependent on takeaway food sales as they are unable to open. Not paying VAT on takeaway (all food) will give the sector a significant financial boost.\r\n\r\nReducing VAT to zero rated on ticket sales for a period of 24 months minimum (from 16/03/2020 when lock down began)will provide another significant help to keep venues open when during this period audiences may be reluctant to come to events due to lack of confidence.",
        "background": "Currently VAT regulations state that hot food has 20% VAT but cold food consumed off premises is zero rated. Venues are also struggling with ticket sales for events - making takeaway (all) food & ticket sales zero rated will provide great assistance and is one action to prevent businesses closing",
