        "action": "Scrap the sale of new electric vehicles by 2030",
        "additional_details": "Electric cars rising in popularity means more people are using electricity which can mean more strain on the national grid and demand rising means that cars may fail to charge if there is a lack of electricity on the national grid. If electric cars are not banned by 2030 then the national grid could come to a point where they are not able to supply electricity to other facilities, for example hospitals may fail to take care of patients if there are digital errors as population is rising.",
        "background": "I want the government to scrap the sales of new electric vehicles by 2030, because UK has been warned that the peak demand could be as much 8GW by 2030 which could put a huge amount of strain on the national grid which could have disastrous consequences by 2030.",
