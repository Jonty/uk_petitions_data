        "additional_details": "In a study conducted by UN Women UK, it was found that 97% of women aged 18-24 have been sexually harassed in a public space. A further 96% of these women said that they did not report their experience as they did not believe it would change anything. \r\n\r\nMoreover, this starts young, with plan international UK reporting that more than 1 in 3 girls in the UK have faced unwanted sexual attention while wearing their school uniform in public.",
        "background": "Women and girls do not feel safe in this \"developed\" nation and the fact that sexual harassment is not yet a crime enables the behaviour that we deeply fear. \r\n\r\nWe demand for specific laws to be put in place to criminalise public sexual harassment.",
