Many haven\u2019t seen close family or friends for many months on end.\r\n \r\nCoronavirus has had an unprecedented impact on pubs in Britain. The British Beer and Pub Association estimates that the industry lost over \u00a3100m each month of lockdown. Hundreds of thousands of staff were placed on the government\u2019s job retention scheme.",
