        "additional_details": "Our poor planet is already drowning and slowly being poisoned from all the waste, plastic and rubbish, that we, as humans are not taking enough responsibility for. It is important that we stop producing things without considering future generations. From food packaging, materials for clothes and cleaning products, items we consume in mass numbers are slowly killing the natural world around us. If we do not make these changes now, we may not have a future our children can thrive in.",

We want laws and regulations to protect our planet, and to protect us now and in the future.",
