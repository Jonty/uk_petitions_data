        "additional_details": "We think the bill ignores the causes of homelessness, which can include: trauma, complex mental/physical health needs, limited housing stock and cuts to public services. Instead, rough sleepers could face being repeatedly moved along, or even prison and/or a \u00a32.5K fine. We believe this is impractical and inhumane.\r\n\r\nMany antisocial behaviours are already illegal and have nothing to do with homelessness.",
        "background": "We want sections of the proposed Criminal Justice Bill that relate to \"nuisance\" begging and \"nuisance\" rough sleeping removed. We believe the proposed legislation is overly punitive and impractical, and risks further marginalising an incredibly vulnerable group of people.",
