It is the peak of the growing season for flowers, plants and vegetables and the garden centres will soon have their stock completely ruined.  They are really only plant supermarkets - they can handle shoppers in the same way supermarkets are currently doing. Many are small single site companies and they will go out of business if they can't sell their stock.",
