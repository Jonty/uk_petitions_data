Our best protection is to keep ourselves fit and healthy so we can protect the NHS by not demanding further services and save those that really desperately needed. \r\nDaily exercise is an absolutely important element of this. So is to be able to support the ones who cannot fully function on their own.\r\nSupport bubbles are also essential in challenging times.",
