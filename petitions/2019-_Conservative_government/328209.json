        "additional_details": "30 hours funded childcare is only available when both parents are in paid employment; students do not qualify. Students are led to believe they will get help with childcare costs through the Childcare Grant but many are not eligible. Student nurses and midwives have to work part time when they already work exceptionally hard on a demanding course, with an extended academic calendar, fewer holiday days and long shifts, so this extra pressure is an injustice.",
        "background": "Student nurses and midwives do not qualify for 30 hours funded childcare and may get no financial support from the Childcare Grant. This presents an enormous barrier for parents, particularly women, who want to enter the healthcare profession and impacts the future workforce of the NHS.",
