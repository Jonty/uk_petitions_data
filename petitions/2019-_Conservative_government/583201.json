        "additional_details": "Pregnant women have long been advised by the RCOG that their health risk increases in third trimester. Now that the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines have been approved for pregnant women, they should be offered the vaccine regardless of their age group as all pregnant women have to attend various appointments in higher risk hospital environments. This should be extended to birth partners at the same time, to both protect the mother and ensure that they do not risk missing a crucial life event.",
        "background": "The approved vaccines should be offered to pregnant women AND their birth partner regardless of age or health status. As lockdown eases, the potential risk of a birth partner catching Covid-19 and therefore missing the birth of a child increases: The impact of this could be irreversibly devastating.",
