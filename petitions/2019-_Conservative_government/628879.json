        "additional_details": "While the eligibility criteria for the pilot of the new local electric vehicle infrastructure funding requires local authorities to be planning an electric vehicle charging infrastructure project that will provide an improvement in accessible EV charging provision that would not otherwise be met by current or planned EV chargepoint infrastructure, there is no specific requirement for a proportion of charges to be for disabled spaces. We want councils to have to plan for a set percentage of charging points to be for disabled spaces to be eligible to apply for this funding.",

I think there should be a requirement for a certain percentage of the points to be for disabled spaces.",
