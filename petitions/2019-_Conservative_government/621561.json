        "additional_details": "When imposing a tax on society the Government rightly considers whether a tax is regressive. Absolute fairness is difficult to achieve but generally the tax system is based around equity where possible. This regard to fairness should apply to standing charges.\r\n\r\nThe Government, through Parliament, legislate in many areas to ensure that companies attain standards which are held to be acceptable. For example, in regard to public health or safety. We believe action is needed to abolish standing charges.",
