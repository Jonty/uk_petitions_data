        "additional_details": "The legitimacy of the 2016 Brexit referendum has been in doubt ever since the result was announced, if not before.\r\n\r\nIt has been reported that Conservative Party donors stand to benefit financially from a no-deal Brexit, and therefore, for the purposes of transparency, and the acceptance of the referendum result, an independent inquiry must be launched.\r\n\r\nIn summary, all Britons will be affected by Brexit, and the public is entitled to certainty as regards the result.",

This should assess whether Russia interfered in this democratic exercise, and also assess the legality of Cambridge Analytica's involvement/actions pertaining to the 2016 referendum.",
