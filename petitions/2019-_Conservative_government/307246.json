        "additional_details": "There are 6 million self-employed workers in the UK. Many are already experiencing the economic impact through illness, self-isolation, cancelled work or increased childcare demands.\r\n\r\nNorway is compensating self-employed people who have lost work with 80% of their average income over the last 3 years. A similar system should be implemented here for workers not covered by the CJRS.\r\n\r\nUniversal Credit excludes many workers, so support should be made available through another mechanism.",
        "background": "The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme excludes many workers, including the self-employed, gig economy workers and, potentially, those on zero-hour contracts.\r\n\r\nThe discrepancy between the support for employees and other workers is significant and arbitrary: all workers should be treated equally.",
