        "action": "Reinstate capital punishment for sound minded murders of children and vulnerable",
        "additional_details": "Because if the Government doesn\u2019t, the incomprehensible crime will continue, incarcerated vigilantes will continue to inflict further punishment to these types of offenders as a result of common unsatisfactory justice. This imposes further punishment on the lesser offender who inflicts his/her own carriage of justice. In turn, the Taxpayers and Government make increased contributions to the imprisonment of all offenders involved for an even longer duration.",
        "background": "Global warming, population and unfair justice need contributory solutions. Imposing the death sentence to those of sound mind who act on the intent to maliciously kill a child and/or vulnerable adult, beyond all reasonable doubt would bring a fair carriage of justice and contribute to a safer world.",
