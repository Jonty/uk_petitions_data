        "additional_details": "Households will have already noticed an increase in their energy bills over the last few months due to staying home and working from home because of Covid. We would like the government to offer assistance to all households responsible for gas, electric and water payments by paying a reasonable sum of money towards each bill paid directly to their provider. This in order to reduce the number of people falling behind on their payments due to the increased usage they will experience.",
        "background": "We would like the government to pay towards the winter energy bills (Gas, Electric, Water) of households who will have a greater increase of use due to staying home and working from home because of the Covid Pandemic. Much like the American \u2018Stimulus cheques\u2019 but paid direct to energy providers.",
