        "additional_details": "Animals like mink, raccoons and foxes are cruelly caged and then killed by gassing, poisoning or are even skinned alive to become someone\u2019s fur coat, or trim on someone\u2019s hat or jacket. Wild animals like lynx, coyotes and foxes are cruelly trapped and killed.\r\n Fur farming was banned in 2000. However, fur trapping and the import of fur is still legal. This means that animals still suffer horrifically, notably in China, only for their fur to be sold here. Fur trapping is also cruel and dangerous.",
        "background": "Animals suffer horrific cruelty and violent and cruel killing in the fur trade, all so that some people can wear their skins and have their pelts. The UK calls itself a nation of animal lovers; it\u2019s time to start acting like it!",
