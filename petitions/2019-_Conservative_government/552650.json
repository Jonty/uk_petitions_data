        "additional_details": "We are faced with a climate emergency and plastic is playing a huge role in this. We can all do personal things to help change this, but unless large corporations are encouraged to source alternatives to plastic, the change will not be fast enough to reduce the impacts of global warming and the millions of plastic items that end up in our seas each year. \r\nThis tax, just like the charge on carrier bags to the public, could fast track us into the change needed to help solve our climate crisis.",
        "background": "I would like the government to impose a tax on plastic packaging for all industries.\r\nIf companies are actively discouraged from using plastic packaging it will encourage them to source sustainable and eco friendly alternatives, something that they are not currently doing with any urgency.",
