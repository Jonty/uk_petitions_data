        "action": "Provide all children in England with free school meals",
        "additional_details": "Over the next years there will be a soaring number of families who cannot put food on the table for their children. The recession, levels of unemployment coupled with the cost of living crisis means families will not be able to afford to pay for their childrens school meals or provide them with nutritious lunch boxes. An article in The Observer today noted that a child was \u2018pretending to eat out of\u2019 an empty lunch box because they did not qualify for free school meals and had no food at home.",
        "background": "In light of the current recession and cost of living crisis, there is no reason why all children should not be provided free school meals at a time where families will struggle to feed their children at home; pay for their school meals and provide extra food for lunch boxes.",
