        "additional_details": "Properties that can qualify for any public money via Govt grants for the installation of ASHPs must have a physically tested air tightness of max 5 m3 /hr/m2 @ 50 pa and have an underfloor heating system in all the living areas.  This provision will limit the type of properties that qualify for grants for the installation of ASHP to those where the anticipated benefits of ASHP in terms of reducing CO2 will be delivered.  This will ensure value for money for taxpayers and home owners alike.",
