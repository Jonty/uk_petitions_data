        "additional_details": "The NGO said Japan's plans to release the water showed the government \"once again failed the people of Fukushima\". To not make an objection to this decision would fail, not only the people of the UK, but the entirety of living species. We urge parliament to:\r\n\r\n1. Initiate parliamentary discussions surrounding what can be done to prevent these plans from going forward.\r\n\r\n2. In the meantime, ministers should consider, and encourage Japan to follow, an alternative plan to manage its chemical waste.",
        "background": "Japan recently approved a plan to discharge over 1 million tonnes of radioactive waste from the Fukushima nuclear plant into the sea, starting in September 2022. As a decision that risks contaminating collective resource, we insist that parliament makes a formal objection to the Japanese Government.",
