        "additional_details": "Last week in U.S.A., the U.S. House of Representatives passed the PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act, a move that will fund service dogs for veterans diagnosed with Post-traumatic Stress (P.T.S.D.).\r\nI believe the Government should do the same in this country, not just for P.T.S.D., but for all mental health issues, the transition from military to civilian can cause severe stress and lead to a mental health condition.",
        "background": "I believe the Government should do everything in their power to look after our armed forces veterans.  \r\nA lot of veterans struggle with their mental health and with social isolation, a mental health assistance dog can totally turn their life around in a way no medication can.",
