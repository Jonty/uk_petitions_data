        "additional_details": "I believe the Government should introduce a National Jewish History Month in order to grow awareness of the history of Anglo-Jewish relations and increased understanding of the persecution that Jews have faced both historically and in the modern day. When looking over the other 'National History Months' there are some things being celebrated/ commemorated by the British Government that are of far less importance than Jewish history (most notably 'National Smile Month' and 'Dry January').",
        "background": "A National Jewish History Month, held in August (when no other 'National History Months' exist), should be created. The introduced month would require no significant Government spending, only some minor spending on a publicity campaign to help raise awareness.",
