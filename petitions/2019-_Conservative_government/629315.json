        "additional_details": "All students in full or part-time education should receive a free bus pass to enable them to manage living costs on very low disposable incomes. They are aspirational in choosing to study and will enter the workforce contributing to society by paying taxes and NI. Many students do not have wealthy enough parents to top up their low \u2018loan\u2019 incomes and rely on public transport to be able to attend their places of study. The majority do not have their own cars or other means of transport.",
        "background": "Most students, especially those living away from home and in full time education at university, are living on very little income.  As pensioners in this country receive a free bus pass, many of whom have much higher disposable incomes, it would seem fair and right that students receive this too.",
