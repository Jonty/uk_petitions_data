        "additional_details": "If zoos are forced to close there may be nowhere to rehouse the animals since all zoos are in the same position. Some zoos have set up charity funding pages, but with many people on reduced incomes (or zero income for many self-employed) while they self-isolate there is little hope of all zoos recouping the sort of money they need, even to keep a skeleton staff on to feed and care for the animals. Only a significant grant from government can prevent a disaster.",
        "background": "Zoos, aquariums, and similar organisations across the country carry out all sorts of conservation work, animal rescue, and public education. At the start of the season most rely on visitors (who now won't come) to cover annual costs, yet those costs do not stop while they are closed. They need help.",
