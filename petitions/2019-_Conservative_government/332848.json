That the Tories make good on their promises to boost local authority funding.\r\nSocial workers need to be recognised and acknowledged, it's no way to reward those who've been at the forefront of fighting this pandemic.\r\nThe prime ministers speech and all government coverage of key workers completely excluded a profession that makes a vital contribution to our country.",

They are frontline safeguarding children and adults at the forefront of fighting this pandemic in tireless efforts and vital contribution. They need be recognised and get a pay rise out of this as well.",
