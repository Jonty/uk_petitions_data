        "action": "Remove the cap on tax-free childcare",
        "additional_details": "Everyone is aware that the cost of living is rocketing. Our economic system is now geared towards having both parents in work simply to pay the bills, particularly in areas with high housing costs. A lot of parents already have no choice but to sacrifice time with their young children. We have some of the most expensive childcare in Europe. Please help working families by removing the \u00a3500 cap to allow tax free childcare on the full nursery bill.",
        "background": "Working parents currently qualify for tax-free childcare up to \u00a3500 per quarter. The average cost of full-time childcare for a child up to the age of 2 is in excess of \u00a314,000 per year and more in some areas. Nursery prices are rising meaning this now covers only around 3 days.",
