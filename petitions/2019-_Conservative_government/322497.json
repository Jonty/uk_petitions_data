        "additional_details": "We need to regulate this industry so unqualified people aren't able to risk the publics health and safety any longer. Barbers should at least have an NVQ level 2 in Barbering and be able to apply for a license to work with all the correct insurance policies.\r\nIn doing this, this industry will be taken more seriously for people who share the passion. I do believe its a diserable and easy way for money laundering. It's all wrong and we've all had enough.",
        "background": "Anyone can open a Barbershop, you don't need any qualifications. This has caused our streets to be filled with cash only Barbershops with unqualified people cutting and shaving. With no practical education in Barbering also, they aren't adhering to cross infection control putting customers at risk.",
