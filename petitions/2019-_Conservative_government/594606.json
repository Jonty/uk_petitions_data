The appeals system is really inflexible, and a universal remedy is required.",
        "background": "Ofqual has acknowledged that most grades are reliable to \u201cone grade either way\u201d, so some Grade Bs in History A-Level could\u2019ve been a Grade A or Grade C. We don\u2019t distrust our teachers but given recent events believe that some allowances should be made for this year.",
