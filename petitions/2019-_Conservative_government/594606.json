        "additional_details": "After all the uncertainty and flaws within the system, it can only be just that all GCSE, AS and some A-Level grades (those that are under UCAS predictions) are raised by one grade, to ensure that no student is blighted any further by the unjust procedures this year. The appeals system is really inflexible, and a universal remedy is required.",
        "background": "Ofqual has acknowledged that most grades are reliable to \u201cone grade either way\u201d, so some Grade Bs in History A-Level could\u2019ve been a Grade A or Grade C. We don\u2019t distrust our teachers but given recent events believe that some allowances should be made for this year.",
