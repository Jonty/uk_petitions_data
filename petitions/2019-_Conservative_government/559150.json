Having colleagues aware could help an ASD employee to feel more welcome and valued in the workplace.",
        "background": "I am asking for it to become a requirement for employers to educate employees about hidden disabilities, especially autism. There is often education surrounding discrimination in the workplace and mental health issues but disability awareness seems to just get brushed under the carpet.",
