        "additional_details": "A 125 is great for younger people however to have that as the only option for a CBT rider is nonsensical. The expected decline after the law change in 1983 never happened as 250s are still being made to this day but only for A2 riders which rarely ever opt for this option for being such a small displacement.\r\n\r\nA 250 should become the next progression for CBT riders post 19 years old as an improvement to their work commuter or recreational ride.\r\n\r\nThe CBT should also see an extension to 4 years.",
        "background": "I would like for government/parliament to reinstate 250cc bikes to come back on L plates after removing the right in 1983 and also increase the period of the CBT to last 4 years instead of 2.",
