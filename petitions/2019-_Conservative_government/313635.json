        "additional_details": "A study found that 10 per cent of infections are transmitted by pre-symptomatic people who only display symptoms later. Those infected shed large amounts of the virus before their symptoms appear, whilst people remain contagious even after they start to feel better. At the same time many NHS and care home staff remain in isolation with minor symptoms, unsure whether they have the virus or not. This causes unnecessary absences and puts extra pressure on health and social care services.",
        "background": "All NHS and care staff should be tested to ensure virus infected staff are isolated and the healthy can immediately return to work. All hospital patients and care home residents should be tested to enable the isolation of those infected, so as to protect staff and fellow patients.",
