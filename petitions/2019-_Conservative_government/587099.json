        "additional_details": "As of before allow people to travel to Zimbabwe, to stay in line with safety allow people once back from Zimbabwe to self isolate in their homes and not in the hotels which is too expensive and if you want people to stay in hotels reduce that amount to normal hotel prices which is around \u00a329-\u00a335 a day. Please may you review this and please consider our case as many people have lost loved ones all around the world due to covid and have not had the opportunity to see them. Please remove Zimbabwe from the red list and let us travel.",
        "background": "Zimbabwe has no covid cases and no new ones however it is still on the red list due to being neighbouring countries with South Africa, a country which once had many covid cases however has none. We want to see loved ones who have passed away, loved ones who are still alive, attend family weddings.",
