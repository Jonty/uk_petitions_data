This can put the young person in danger, and we want the Government to make sure they have easy access to advice and support.\r\n \r\nIt is estimated that over 120,000 children and young people are homeless. Every year 100,000 children and young people go missing or run way from home and nearly 100 teenagers are made homeless each day in the UK as a result to alcohol abuse.\r\n",
