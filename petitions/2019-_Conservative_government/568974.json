School children obtained GCSEs based on teacher assessments, but these were not available for home educated children.\r\n\r\nExams have been cancelled again in 2021 as school children have missed around 10 months of education.\r\n\r\nHome educated children have not had the same disruption to their learning. They have continued lessons.\r\n\r\nSchool educated peers will receive grades this year, whilst home educated children will be unable - for the second year running - to obtain theirs.",
