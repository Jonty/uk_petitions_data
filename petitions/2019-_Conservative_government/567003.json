Finally our assessments were booked for Jan/ Feb 2021, but due to new lockdown, this has been cancelled again. Exams are cancelled again for 2021, but no mention of apprenticeships. We feel failed by government as we are all working as fully trained staff stuck on apprentice wages as we are unable to obtain the qualification.",
