All mesh victims should be eligible including those who have had rectopexy, hernia, Sacrocolpopexy and vaginal mesh. I need compensation so I don\u2019t end up in poverty through no fault of my own. I want to work & enjoy my life. This mesh was allowed to be implanted into humans seemingly without sufficient testing & it\u2019s not fit for purpose. Compensation for a life of pain & suffering, which will only get worse as time goes by.",

I can\u2019t work due to the crippling pain from a piece of mesh that was fitted inside me. \u201cFirst Do No Harm\u201d but I am harmed & trusted that this product was safe, and it wasn\u2019t.",
