Now the people must come together to support the creation of the \"Nightingale Army\" of trained staff to help support the NHS in time of crises. The NHS is there to serve the daily needs of the Country but is not able to cope with the unprecedented demands and risks during these uncertain times. 500,000 volunteered to help in a matter of days, \u00a31 extra on a ticket is worth paying to be prepared!",
