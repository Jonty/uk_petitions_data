FFP2's offer a sensible solution meaning the NHS would be able to get back to full operational capacity.\r\n\r\nSAGE statistics (10/9/20) show FFP2's reduce penetration by contaminants to just <0.01%, as opposed to cloth masks which have a penetration rate of 97%.\r\n\r\nProvision of FFP2s must be free as 42% of disabled people live in Poverty (Scope, 02/21).",
