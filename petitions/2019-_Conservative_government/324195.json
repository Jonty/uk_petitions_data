        "additional_details": "The way we treat minorities in this country needs to change. A poll carried out by the Independent found that 43% of British people are proud of Britain's history of colonialism. Once we acknowledge the role Britain has played in disrupting the development of countless countries across history can we begin to understand the ways in which white supremacy dictates the prejudices plaguing our society today. The Germans teach their youth about the darker side of their history, and so should we.",
        "background": "Schools in UK rarely teach their pupils about colonialism, politicianry and civil rights. Many people in the UK still do not know about how our nation impacted the Mau Mau uprising, the Bengal famine and other tragedies. This should be taught at schools the same way pupils are taught about Henry VIII.",
