Early studies from Wuhan suggest our current PPE guidance is inadequate, we need to wear full PPE for all inpatients. Staff are recycling PPE because they have no choice, there isn\u2019t enough! We are on the verge of catastrophe!",

Reallocate unused PPE sitting in businesses, factories, dental surgeries, research labs, military supplies immediately. Who will care for the sick if the carers are sick?",
