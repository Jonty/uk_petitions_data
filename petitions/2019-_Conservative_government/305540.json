        "additional_details": "By closing stores and do deliveries there won't be a crowd of people gathered in one place and you would know who and how much they have ordered delivery this way people can't take more than the limited items and will help prevent people from getting the covid 19 virus and it will avoid further spread which will also allow nurses and doctors having enough NHS staff to look after patients and be able to treat them in a more relaxed environment and prevent them from risk of dying or anyone else.",
        "background": "this way we are limiting the items and allow other housholdes to have thier fair share of that item as well as knowning when they are finishing them if they bought them today. So they can't bulk order of one item. This way we are also preventing spread of covid 19 as well as rising number of death.",
