        "additional_details": "NHS shift workers come to work at all hours of the day. Public transport is not always available and it can sometimes be unsafe when leaving work late at night. Therefore, it can be unavoidable that some staff need to park at work. Making them pay to continue to provide the  work they do feels wrong. They have helped Britain through this pandemic and so we feel as a thank you to them, the government should scrap parking charges entirely.",
