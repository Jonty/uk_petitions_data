        "additional_details": "To relax restrictions at this stage only for those that are double vaccinated is age discrimination and would be difficult to argue in a court. The vast majority of those that are still not double vaccinated still are so because of their age, not choice. Once the whole population has been vaccinated fully it would make sense to lift restrictions for those people, but there are still questions over how low the age will go for vaccinating, does that mean a family can no longer go on holiday together. All along the line has been \u2018we are all in this together\u2019 and lifting restriction for some who are the beneficiaries of everyone\u2019s sacrifice is just wrong.",
        "background": "Any travel rules and restrictions should continue to apply to all and be science led. When the time comes to remove restrictions it should apply to all age groups rather than effectively opening up restrictions for the older generations.",
