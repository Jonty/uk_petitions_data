        "additional_details": "Currently those with diabetes are not automatically considered a priority need for housing. They can be expected to manage their diabetes whilst being homeless. This includes managing their insulin if prescribed whilst being street homeless, even if they do not have access to a fridge for storage of insulin. Their health could deteriorate more quickly due to not being able to access cooking facilities to manage their diet and this can lead to serious complications.",
        "background": "I wish the Government to change legislation to ensure anyone with diabetes is automatically considered a priority for temporary accommodation to start with, and that they are assisted with their housing requirements.",
