        "additional_details": "Currently, energy companies display their prices based on an annual, quarterly or monthly tarrif which is generated on a estimate of household usage from a previous year. This is misleading as the tariff offered nearly always rises and it is my belief that this is used to alure initial customer uptake. Customers should be able look at what the energy company will charge them per unit of energy so they can work out if the cost per unit is cheaper between different energy companies.",
        "background": "Give OFCOM more powers to force energy companies to show prices they will charge customers per unit of energy, generating more competition and customers making an informed choice about the energy they use and pay for. Currently, estimated annual and monthly tariffs mask the true cost to the consumer",
