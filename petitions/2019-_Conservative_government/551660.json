        "additional_details": "Waive fines & punishments for parents wanting to keep their children off school during the second wave of coronavirus - which would be in the best interest of children, families, and for the safety of the wider community. We appreciate that school is important for children, & that socially this could have an impact, we would more than anything like them to be attending normally, but these are not normal times - & therefore, we ask that exceptions be made.",
        "background": "Currently, parents are getting penalised for wishing to keep their children off school during the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic in the form of fines, & other punishments.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a parents prerogative to decide if school is safe for their child- this has been taken away in lieu of saving the economy",
