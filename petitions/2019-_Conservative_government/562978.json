        "additional_details": "The Government have said that baby classes are essential and can run during all lockdown Tiers. However Lincolnshire councils have kept village halls closed where most classes are held. They have said they are not classes as 'essential services'. It is very isolating for mums with newborns at the moment and just having an hour out of the house to do a class makes all the difference. You have kept gyms open for mental wellbeing, new mums should have the same access through baby classes.",
        "background": "I would like the government to tell the local authorities to allow baby classes to be run in village halls. They were all made covid secure before the last lockdown so there should be no reason why they can't go ahead in any tiers.",
