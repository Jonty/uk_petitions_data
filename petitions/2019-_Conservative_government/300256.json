        "additional_details": "Human Trafficking is a vital topic that every person should be made aware of. However many fail to know what human trafficking is and identifying the signs of it. In the UK there are more than 4000 victims, many of whom are young people. Ensuring that schools are obliged to teach such topics could potentially decrease the number of victims in the future and many can avoid getting into potential situations. We strongly want the Government to implement human trafficking into the curriculum.",
        "background": "We would like Human Trafficking to be introduced to the national curriculum for secondary schools. We want to raise more awareness of the topic, as the questionnaires and interviews we have conducted support the lack of knowledge students have of Human Trafficking.",
