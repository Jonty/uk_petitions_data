Then we come out into the working world and are shown that we can be treated better in Tesco, Aldi or any other standard non skilled job and are continuing to be paid more than us and that includes many more benefits. \r\nThere is no incentive to want to work within general practice/specialist practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe want general Dental Nurses to be recognised the same as any other NHS Nurse/Dental Nurse/Dentist/DCP and be given the same benefits.",

We still have to pay ARF, Indemnity, CPD yearly & get no NHS benefit.",
