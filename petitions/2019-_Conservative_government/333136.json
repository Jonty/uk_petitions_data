        "additional_details": "We have a once in a lifetime opportunity to increase cycling in the UK and improve the health of the nation. One of the ways of making it more accessible to all people would be to remove VAT from cycling related products. The current Cycle to Work Scheme only benefits those who work, and higher rate taxpayers even more. Not all employers offer it. Removing VAT would be cheap and simple to administer, and would instantly ensure bikes are more affordable to everybody, not just those who work.",
