You are protecting the kids, families and staff off these educational institutions but there is no protection for childcare. Childcare is NON ESSENTIAL, it is a choice, and there seems to be no concern from the government about those staff members, families or children catching the virus and spreading it or their mental health. It is unfair for them to remain open when all other education is closed!",
