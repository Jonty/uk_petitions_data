        "additional_details": "People are suffering. Going bankrupt- stuck in flats they have out grown and unable to sell or remortgage against the property they own. Essentially this is the biggest fraud to have happened and in plain sight. You need to help the owners of these flats - enable them to sell their flats or fix the cladding problem yourself, or order the construction workers to replace the cladding with immediate effect. This has been 3 years of hell. Enough is enough.",
        "background": "There are 2 options - either government relax the fire safety rules on high rise buildings and cladding safety (which will enable banks to lend against them) or the government needs to pay (get the construction company to pay) to replace cladding on these buildings ASAP to stop more people suffering",
