        "additional_details": "Schools will offer a 'blended' provision of smaller classes and directed home or independent learning. This means a change in lunch provision, stationery and staffing. Government needs to direct budget changes to provide connectivity and hardware for vulnerable and poor students. This cannot be driven at a local level as it requires culture change and positive, proactive resourcing. Schools are ready to deliver; students at home need to be ready, resourced and connected.",
        "background": "Schools have had to quickly establish a successful infrastructure of online provision. During this time all schools have uncovered a stark fact. Poorer households cannot afford the connectivity to access this new learning. Without broadband for all we are locking the school gates to the poorer kids.",
