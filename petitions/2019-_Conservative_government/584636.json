        "additional_details": "I regularly witness drivers either holding a phone to their ear while driving, or looking down at their laps while they are texting and driving. This behaviour is now commonplace and the likelihood of being caught is low. 6 points and a \u00a3200 fine is an insufficient deterrent and does not reflect risks posed to other road users, with cyclist, motor-cyclist and pedestrians being particularly vulnerable. Penalties should attract similar penalties to those risk that apply to drunk-drivers.",
