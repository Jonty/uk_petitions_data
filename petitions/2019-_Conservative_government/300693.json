This will be a health and safety measure to safeguard the public from being self abused  by smart machines and in turn preventing the public to be abused due to the misusage of smart devices by untrained and unlicensed users.\r\nThis would become a milestone of a potential big reform of future educational system.\r\n\r\nFor more details please refer to the following reference \r\nhttp://chng.it/F9RkVLNS",
