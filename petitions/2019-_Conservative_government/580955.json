Not to mention a complete waste of taxpayer's funding. \r\n\r\nToo much damage has been caused to innocent civilians through the use of animals in the police force. To enslave an animal and use it to intimidate people or as a weapon, is not morally justified.\r\n\r\nPlease help to stop the abusive use of animals, as a form of intimidation and weapon. ",
