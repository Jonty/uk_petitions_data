        "action": "Pause Ofsted inspections and reform how school performance is evaluated",
        "additional_details": "The Beyond Ofsted inquiry has provided us with fully researched and tangible recommendations for the future of school inspections - change that could transform education in England and the lives of students, teachers and leaders.\r\n \r\nFor significant reform to happen, we believe a pause in routine inspections must happen so that government and key stakeholders can work together on delivering the inquiry's recommendations.\r\n \r\nThis can be a pivotal moment in education if teachers and parents get behind the inquiry's findings. We have an opportunity here for real change!\r\n",
        "background": "This petition is calling for routine Ofsted inspections to be paused so that the recommendations of the Beyond Ofsted inquiry can be implemented, moving to a system of self-evaluation by schools, supported by external school improvement partners, and a more limited role for Ofsted.",
