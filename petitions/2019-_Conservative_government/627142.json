        "additional_details": "The NHS facilitated nearly 4,400 transplants in 21/22. Those patients require medication to prevent rejection/complications to survive. Certain  medical conditions needing continuous dressings, life-long medication to manage (diabetes, epilepsy) make a person eligible for free prescriptions, but not being a transplant patient. No clear rationale is given as to why transplant is not included; impact of not taking required medication would put further strain on NHS services and can be severe, with this population.",
        "background": "Transplant patients need to take several medications daily, for the rest of their lives. Transplant patients are not on the list of people eligible for free prescriptions, despite the life-saving nature of the treatment required to maintain health and functioning of patients.",
