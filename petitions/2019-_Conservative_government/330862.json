        "additional_details": "Millions are out-of-work or in insecure jobs, struggling to feed and clothe their families and pay for basics. For hard-working, low-income families, a meal out is a luxury many can't afford - even at half-price. Rishi Sunak had a chance to level-up Britain by giving every household a voucher to spend that would bring welcome relief to all. Instead he created a gimmick that favours those with disposable income, and in doing so, left those hardest hit by the crisis out in the cold again.",
        "background": "Funding a \u00a3500 voucher to every adult and a \u00a3250 voucher to every child could help safeguard millions of jobs and provide our high streets, hospitality sector and the arts with the vital cash injection that is desperately needed to save businesses from collapse and prevent mass unemployment.",
