        "additional_details": "Millions are out-of-work or in insecure jobs, struggling to feed and clothe their families and pay for basics. For hard-working, low-income families, a meal out is a luxury many can't afford - even at half-price. Rishi Sunak had a chance to level-up Britain by giving every household a voucher to spend that would bring welcome relief to all. Instead he created a gimmick that favours those with disposable income, and in doing so, left those hardest hit by the crisis out in the cold again.",
