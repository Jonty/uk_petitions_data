        "additional_details": "The API developed by Apple and Google ensures the app uses a decentralised approach and does not store our data on a server, along with being more robust and causing less battery drain on our devices. Help us to join Germany and a majority of other countries around the world in protecting user privacy by adopting a decentralised approach to this app. A centralised approach is an unnecessary cyber security risk and will deter a large number of users from downloading the app.",
        "background": "The NHS contact tracing app being developed will not use Apple and Google\u2019s system and will therefore collect highly sensitive data and store it on a server instead of on our devices. This opens up our personal data to risk of attack or misuse.",
