        "action": "Make public sexual harassment a criminal offence in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "It should not be the sole responsibility of women to protect themselves from harassment. All these years of the victim blaming approach - solely blaming the harassment on women's choice of dress or physical appearance - does not reduce the numbers, but in fact encourages these criminal actions as there is no fear of consequences. With the use of legal action we can show those who harass that women will no longer take this sitting down, and force these criminals to learn.",
        "background": "Sexual harassment is not an offence in its own right under UK law. Research finds that 97% of women in the UK have been sexually harassed aged 18-24, with a further 96% percent not reporting due to lack of consiquences. Sexual harassment should therefore be put into legal consideration",
