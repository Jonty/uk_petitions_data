        "additional_details": "I want the parliament or government to pass this bill. Same sex couples who want to have children should have the chance to have children. Same sex couples should have a free round of IVF on the NHS as it is not physically possible for them to have a child. This is the same as a straight couple not being able to have children and it's easier for them to get a free IVF on the NHS.",
        "background": "We want to make sure that same sex couples can receive a free round of IVF on the NHS. At the moment, same sex couples usually have to pay for IVF and are unable to pay for surrogacy as it is illegal in the UK. ",
