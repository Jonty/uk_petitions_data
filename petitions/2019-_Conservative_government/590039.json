        "additional_details": "Many 17 year olds are going to university in September and do not turn 18 until august. This means that there is very little time for them to have received a coronavirus vaccine prior to them starting at university. As a result, they may not have had time to develop a significant enough immune response to prevent them catching and spreading the virus. This could lead to large outbreaks in universities and surrounding areas. \r\nThe mental well-being of 16-17 year olds has been seriously impacted by the effects of lockdowns on socialising which can help prevent a deterioration in mental well-being. By vaccinating this age group individuals will be able to socialise more safely and their well-being will improve.",
        "background": "Ask all 16-17 year olds to get their covid vaccine in the same way the government has for all other eligible age groups.",
