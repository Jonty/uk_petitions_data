        "additional_details": "Provided the Government provides additional funding, young people, aged 18-24, with the most employment barriers will have increased chances to develop their skills and experience under the scheme. National unemployment rates should decrease, and an often overlooked group will have increased prospects in the workplace. If the Government isn't willing to help them, then how can they help themselves?",
        "background": "The Government should extend the Kickstart Scheme jobs for young, disadvantaged unemployed people, who have three or more barriers to work. These barriers can include homelessness, being on the Autistic spectrum, Mental Health issues and more. These individuals need the most support.",
