        "additional_details": "Between the years 2010 and 2020 the average base salary of an MP increased by \u00a316,194.00. \r\n\r\nThe result was by April 2020 the average MP salary was \u00a381,932.00, this is over double the national average. This is not including expenses and income from other investments and businesses. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.theipsa.org.uk/mps-pay-and-pensions\r\n\r\nIf MPs are true leaders, they will correct this wrong and ensure going forward the IPSA improves their controls. So no increase is greater than other public sectors",
        "background": "Every year our public sectors such as the our amazing NHS, schools and the police force see their salaries stagnate. The pay rises when given are always small and still mean a reduction in salary in relation to inflation. \r\n\r\nWhat we need is for MPs to not get preferential treatment around pay rises",
