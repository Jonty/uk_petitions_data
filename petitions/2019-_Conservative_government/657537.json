        "additional_details": "The Government\u2019s report - Assessing Risk of Harm to Children and Parents in Private Law Children Cases \u2013 highlights that submissions from mothers and support organisations indicated that they felt that the court\u2019s approach to allegations of domestic abuse and counter allegations of \"parental alienation\" was sexist and discriminatory. \r\n\r\nWe believe that there is a misguided and damaging practice within Cafcass that identifies \u201calienating behaviours\u201d when domestic abuse is reported and a child is in any way reluctant to see one parent. Children can be at risk following domestic violence and as the Government report recommended, the presumption of parental involvement should be reviewed urgently in order to address its detrimental effects.",
