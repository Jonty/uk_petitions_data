        "additional_details": "Turkish Cypriots still feel let down by the British Government from the effects of war in 1964 and this has had a lasting affect on relations. Turkish Cypriots feel ostracized and trapped, unable to visit their loved ones. With direct flights available for Greek Cypriots this is causing political tension between two communities already struggling to move forward. Discrimination is not OK and Turkish British Citizens want change! Please help us visit our family!",
        "background": "There is no way to travel directly from England to Northern Cyprus. There are no direct flights from any UK airport, meaning a change over in Turkey or a flight to South Cyprus and then a lengthy trip over the Greek border. Turkish Cypriots are desperate to visit family",
