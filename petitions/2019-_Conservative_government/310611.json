All major parties say they are committed to the NHS, so let\u2019s agree a fair funding formula giving a permanent, predictable funding for the NHS..\r\nI call on the government to then take politics out of the service, not allow it to be used as a political football and hand it over to managers and health professionals to run our National Health Service for the benefit of the people.",
