Travel like this is does not change a person's care or mobility needs. Disabled people shouldn't have to answer personal.and intrusive questions to get permission to travel just because they receive PIP. Non-disabled people recieving tax credits only notify travel abroad of over 8 weeks. This is less favourable treatment of disabled people and possibly discriminatory.",
        "background": "The requirement to notify a change of circumstances for travel abroad for people receiving Personal Independence Payment claimants has changed from four weeks to any travel. Any change of circumstances can lead to a loss or reduction of PIP. We want this change reversed immediately.",
