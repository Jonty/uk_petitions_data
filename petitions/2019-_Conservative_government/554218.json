        "additional_details": "I feel they are in the highest power and therefore should help us out and postpone the prelims for s3s to help us prepare as these predict our futures and this year they were used for the exams that couldn\u2019t be taken so if we don\u2019t do well on the prelims because we didn\u2019t have enough time to prepare our results will be awful therefore this is a desperate plead from me and others to postpone them.",
        "background": "Due to recent circumstances of online learning and being off school. It was very hard learning online and I\u2019m not ready for the prelims and I\u2019m sure others feel the same but even though they aren\u2019t exams I\u2019d still like to take them seriously and need more time to prepare for them.",
