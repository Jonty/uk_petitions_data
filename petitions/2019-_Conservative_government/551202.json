        "additional_details": "The legal definition of a public nuisance offense includes reference to someone committing an act \u201cnot warranted by law\u201d. Suicide has been decriminalised in this country since 1961 so these charges are both not warranted and potentially harmful to the individuals who desperately need support.",
        "background": "We are calling on the government to amend the law which allows police to charge people who attempt suicide with public nuisance. We believe anyone who attempts suicide should not be facing a public nuisance charge but should instead be offered the appropriate mental health interventions and support.",
