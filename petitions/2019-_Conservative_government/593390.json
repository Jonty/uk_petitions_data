It is all well and good to have the latest tech, but without sufficient manpower, vehicles, warships etc, the advantage is small. Wherever weakness lies the enemy will attack. We need an armed forces that while efficient is also significantly more substantial in size & strength.",

As it stands the Armed Forces are repeatedly cut back to levels not seen for centuries. Putting UK Security at dire risk.",
