        "action": "Educate school staff on ADHD and provide more support for children with ADHD.",
        "additional_details": "Children with ADHD spend so much of their childhood in detention, isolation, excluded or suspended because of their behaviour. These children need support to develop in the areas they struggle with. These children leave school with poor self esteem and mental health issues because of how they're treated. If more help and support was offered, these children could gain the skills to lead successful lives. They are seen as the 'naughty' child when they are simply just struggling.",
        "background": "Primary & secondary school staff are poorly educated on ADHD. Most teachers receive very little training and children suffer as a result of this. School staff need training on how to help and support children with ADHD. This would help them succeed at school, instead of being excessively punished.",
