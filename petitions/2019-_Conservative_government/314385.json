        "additional_details": "The bailout of the banks in 2008 has decimated the UK public purse. COVID 19 will again place a huge burden on the nation's finances. This time the UK, it's people, it's NHS must not suffer further cuts and austerity bailing out companies that have not contributed to the very pot they seek assistance from. The government must take a hard stand and if such companies fail, then so be it. We must enforce our taxation fairly and universally going forward so we can rebuild and preserve the country.",
        "background": "The UK tax payer should not bailout companies that have avoided paying tax in the UK on goods and services provided in the UK. \r\nCompanies that avoid contributing  to the UK public purse through aggressive tax planning, tax havens and shell companies should not benefit from UK tax payer assistance.",
