        "additional_details": "Its causing a huge money loss for small businesses struggling to get by during the pandemic. It does not make sense to open gardens that are already following the regulations around social distancing, 6people per table etc. All groups visiting these establishments are already travelling together, sitting together, eating together. If one of them has corona all of them have it. Hookahs provided come with disposable pipes and mouth pieces for each individual which makes it safe to smoke shisha.",
        "background": "Revisit the regulations regarding serving tobacco/hookah. Shisha should be allowed to be served in gardens as there is ventilation and an open space.",
