The Government advises people in tier 3 to avoid travelling outside of your area, including for overnight stays other than where necessary. There is no legal restriction on travelling within your area. Accommodation providers and campsites have to close, with some exemptions.\r\n\r\nNo public attendance at spectator sport is allowed within tier 3.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. We could accept a petition calling for accommodation providers such as campsites and caravan parks to remain open in tier 3, if that is what you would like to see happen."
