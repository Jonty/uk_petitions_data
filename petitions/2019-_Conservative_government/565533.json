However it has been rearranged since August 202 all the way through to January 2021. Now we are in Tier 4 I have no chance of passing my test any time soon and I need to pass if I want to drive to get to my hospital placement and university. The same goes for my friend who has had 7 tests now and had a test rearranged every month. We need the tests so we can pass so we can drive and be safer",
        "background": "Driving lessons and driving tests have been cancelled and postponed for all of 2020. I understand the risk of lessons and tests but as I have already taken tests and failed I need to do my test again and I need to drive to get to work instead of public transport",
