If there are no regrets, what do we actually learn?\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation is key here, warts n all.\r\n\r\nIf anyone is trying to rewrite history or delete it then we are no longer a democratic nation.",
        "background": "Historical statues and monuments are part of British history and heritage, good and bad.\r\n\r\nTo remove these is a denial of our history. Air brushing over history has never resulted in anything positive, it creates confusion which potentially leads to more problems than the monument represents.",
