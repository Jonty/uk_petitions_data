These chemicals are inhaled daily by non-smokers against their will as they walk amongst smokers on the streets. Thousands of people who inhale second hand smoke will die of heart problems or lung cancer. Is it fair that someone else's decision may shorten one's life? Not only does smoking kill people who do not choose to smoke, they are terrible for the environment and unsightly littered all over the street floor.",
