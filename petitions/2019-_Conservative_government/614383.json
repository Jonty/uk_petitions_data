        "action": "Stop schools banning skirts because of male teachers.",
        "additional_details": "My belief (and the laws views) are that any teacher who thinks looking at a pupil (of any gender) inappropriately is breaching a position of trust, and should not be working around minors at all. Any male teachers who do look at or touch minors inappropriately,are classed as peadophiles, and should be dealt with in accordance with the law.\r\nWhat the schools are doing, is promoting a \u201cpeadophile culture\u201d, and \u201cnormalising\u201d that kind of behaviour.",
        "background": "So I have started this petition in the hope that we all can fight together for female students to still be allowed to wear skirts without fear of becoming the victims of predatory teachers, and bullying into subjection by the institutional sexism in schools.",
