        "additional_details": "Although the government\u2019s proposal on the 2nd July suggests changes may be made to certain exams, subjects such as English, Maths and Science are supposedly going to be examined in the same way as usual. This places students who may face difficulties in these subjects at a disadvantage, alongside those who\u2019ve taken these at A Level. Ofqual have also considered pushing exams back a few weeks more than usual, yet this won\u2019t equate to the amount of school time missed by year 10/12 students.",
        "background": "COVID-19 has left year 10/12 students with less classroom time, yet most subjects will be examined against the same level of content. It is vital that the government reduce content across all subjects to account for the time that students have missed, giving them fair results in light of COVID-19.",
