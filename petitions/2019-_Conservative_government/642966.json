        "action": "Ban school uniforms in the uk",
        "additional_details": "The reason for this is because most counties around the world especially Europe allow students to go to school in their own clothes. \r\nIt would make students feel more free in their own clothes and more comfortable. I also believe that the intelligence of students would increase and bad behaviour would decrease especially in the summer because why would you wanna be stuck in hot and sweaty uniform. Obviously have some dress coding in the summer but i really think it would help with mental health.",
        "background": "I would like for the Government to ban school uniforms across the whole uk because i believe it would make students happier and help with increasing behaviour and understanding in school.",
