Energy prices have increased hugely. Fuel, food, water, costs, and National Insurance contributions are increasing. My husband and I both work full time, but we are only just managing - let alone low income families. National minimum wages do not reflect the cost of living.\r\n \r\nMany people will suffer severely unless this is addressed urgently. Please take the actions requested to address increased costs of living.\r\n",
