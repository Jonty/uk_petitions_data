Lumping them together under one category does not help to distinguish which particular groups are disadvantaged or advantaged in differing situations.\r\n \r\nEach group has a different lived experience and a one size fits all approach masks inequalities that exist for the different groups.\r\n \r\nDescribing each group individually would be fairer and allow for a more targeted approach in order to address inequality.\r\n",

Minority groups should have their own individual categorisation agreed through consultation with the groups concerned.",
