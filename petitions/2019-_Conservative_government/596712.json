        "action": "Put warning labels on food products to combat waste and climate change",
        "additional_details": "Alongside the immediate effect of warning labels lowering unsustainably high demand for these products, this legislation would also contribute to creating a more conscientious mindset around collective resources. As a society, we eat meat too much, we waste around 30% of food, and we use too much packaging.\r\n\r\nSure, individuals can financially afford to be wasteful or over-indulgent, but it doesn't mean we can collectively afford it in the long-term. Future wars will hurt us if we don't act.",
        "background": "We should take a stronger stance against key day-to-day contributors to climate change, such as food waste, high meat consumption and single-use plastic. By reminding people constantly, we will be treating climate change and unsustainable lifestyle as seriously as we treated smoking.",
