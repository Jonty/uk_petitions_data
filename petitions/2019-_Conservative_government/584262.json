        "additional_details": "A study conducted by Stanford university found that 56% of students consider homework is a primary source of stress and that too much homework could result in the following: lack of sleep, headaches, exhaustion, and finally weight loss.\r\n\r\nArticle 31 of The UN Convention On The Rights of The Child states that \"Every child has the right to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities.\" Homework deprives young people of this essential right and therefore should be abolished.",
        "background": "The use of homework in schools is draconian and was originally implemented as a punishment, making misbehaving children do their missed work at home.\r\n\r\nWith modern society's greater knowledge of mental health, we should no longer allow homework as it causes stress in all students.",
