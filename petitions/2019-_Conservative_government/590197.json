        "additional_details": "For the rental trial places by gov there is not\r\nProblem as soon as it\u2019s benefits the gov receiving money and as on the private scooters they can\u2019t charge them so they are seizing them i think this is a completely a joke and no sense private no but rental yes i think the gov should regularise them same as e bike such speed control, getting all protective equipment while riding ect..\r\nAlso driving a e scooter it\u2019s a green solution against the global pollution problem that caused more deaths by time",
        "background": "Right now it\u2019s illegal ride an e scooter on uk but during the pandemic the number of the e scooters in uk has increased. I know there\u2019s some people who use them without responsibility and that\u2019s why the gov should place rules like using helmet getting right light to get visible for other drivers",
