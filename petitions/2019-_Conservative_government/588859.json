        "additional_details": "I feel that the denial was political point scoring by the cuirrent Prime Minister and id being used as political leverage to manipulate and in some sense threaten the speaker of the house.\r\n\r\nJohn Becow was never proven to be biased, the allegations are unsubstatiated and he has defended himself, successfully, many times.",
        "background": "Despite the convention that former Speakers of the House of Commons are elevated to membership of the House of Lords, Bercow was denied a peerage by the Prime Minister. He has become the first ex-Speaker since the retirement of Arthur Onslow in 1761 to not have been made the offer of, a peerage.",
