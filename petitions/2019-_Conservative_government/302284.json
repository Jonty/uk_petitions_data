The economy is pivotal to the UK, but relief is needed for people as well as businesses.\r\n\r\nTrialling a Universal Basic Income for all residents would give home and food security, allowing people to make the right decisions for their families and wider society, whilst also keeping money flowing through the economy.\r\n\r\nDoing this will reduce pressures caused by acts of desperation.",
