For example, we could accept a petition calling on the Government to bar anyone the Committee on Standards has found to be in breach of the Code of Conduct for MPs from being appointed the House of Lords, if that's what you want to happen.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about the House of Commons Code of Conduct and Guide to Rules here: https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/commons/hoc-code-of-conduct/"
