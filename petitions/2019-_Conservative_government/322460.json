I can arrange help, but this will put at least an hour both ways on my journey time, I have also arranged travel, in the past, but no help was available at either station, so I had to wait for someone to help me. This discriminates against people with mobility difficulties as I can't travel as and when I want.",

Only a minority of train stations are fully accessible, and too many still do not have step-free access. I and other people with mobility difficulties want to be able to use the whole network.",
