        "additional_details": "I had Polio as a child and I am 69 now so I have to walk with a crutch these days, I have a stair lift at home, I also use a scooter. I can arrange help, but this will put at least an hour both ways on my journey time, I have also arranged travel, in the past, but no help was available at either station, so I had to wait for someone to help me. This discriminates against people with mobility difficulties as I can't travel as and when I want.",
        "background": "The Government should require all train stations and trains to have step-free access. Only a minority of train stations are fully accessible, and too many still do not have step-free access. I and other people with mobility difficulties want to be able to use the whole network.",
