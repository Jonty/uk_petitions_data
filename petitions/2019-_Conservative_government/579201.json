The fact this is a legal requirement it could also act as a deterant to both theives and people purchasing that do not have the proper paperwork.\r\n\r\nAlso I think that the government in addition to this should consider making it a legal requirment for dogs or cats to only be sold with the correct microchip transfer papers either.",
