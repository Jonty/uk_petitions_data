Lorry drivers are left without basic amenities, often for days, and this is no longer acceptable. \r\n\r\nWhenever there are issues with Channel crossings, the disruption caused to Kent residents is significant, and the lorry drivers parked up are left treated like animals",
        "background": "To permanently deal with the significant problems caused (to residents and to the drivers themselves) by lorries being parked on the M20, I propose that land is allocated and at least one fit for purpose large (or ideally 2 or 3 smaller) truck stops offering proper facilities are built in Kent",

In any case, the provision of facilities such as truck stops is a matter for landowners and providers, rather than for the Government to provide. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.
