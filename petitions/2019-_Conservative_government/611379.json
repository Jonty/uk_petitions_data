Many of us just walk my and sometimes drop a \u00a35 note on the floor and don't bother to pick it up but that \u00a35 could give a homeless person food and drink for a day or two and can make a big difference. Many people are too selfish to do anything and hog the money to themselves but that is not fair for those without homes.",
