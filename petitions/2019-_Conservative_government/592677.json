        "additional_details": "Parliament should let unvaccinated individuals show a recent negative PCR test upon entering social venues, so they are able to continue life with a degree of normality. With this rule being executed, a percentage of our nation will be forced to make an irrational decision. Statistics show that even with being double vaccinated, one is still susceptible to the virus and are contagious.",
        "background": "The government should allow people who aren\u2019t vaccinated the rights to socialise at their free will. By implementing a COVID passport in bars/clubs and restaurants, the government are segregating a population of individuals who are exercising their freedom to remain vaccine free.",
