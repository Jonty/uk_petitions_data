These experts are called \"witnesses\" and they help MPs to gain a deeper understanding of the topic.\nThe Committee will then consider all the evidence it has taken and publish a report of its findings with recommendations to the Government on any changes that might be needed.\nFor more information about the inquiry, visit the Committee's inquiry page (https://committees.parliament.uk/work/7140/nhs-dentistry/).\nWhat is the Health and Social Care Committee?\nThe Health and Social Care Committee is a cross-party group of MPs that conduct inquiries into issues in Health and Social Care in the UK.\nFind out more about the Committee on their website (https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/81/health-and-social-care-committee/)\nFollow the committee on Twitter for updates on its work (https://twitter.com/CommonsHealth)\nThe Health and Social Care Committee is a select committee. \nFind out how select committees work (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_2RDuDs44c)\nGet involved in the work of the UK Parliament\nSign up to the Your UK Parliament newsletter (https://parliament.us16.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=3ad7e4c57a864f07e4db008c4&id=26d0645ea9) for the latest information on how to get involved and make a difference.\n",
