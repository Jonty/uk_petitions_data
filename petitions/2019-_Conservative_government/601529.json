        "additional_details": "MPs maintain that their 'second jobs' gain them 'valuable insights' into business and other topics. That may be so but, if they are earning money for a 'second job' they should not need their full salary as an MP. Like Universal Credit, their payment comes from the taxpayer, and the extra income should be treated in the same way as a Universal Credit claimant is.",
        "background": "At present, Universal Credit claimants have their benefit reduced by 63p for every \u00a31 they earn. MPs with 'second jobs' should have their salary reduced on the same basis - 63p for every \u00a31 they earn outside Parliament.",
