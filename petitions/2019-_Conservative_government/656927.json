        "additional_details": "Legalizing CBD flower in the UK could have several potential benefits. For one, it would provide consumers with more options for accessing CBD, which is known for its potential therapeutic properties. It could also create economic opportunities, such as job creation and tax revenue, within the CBD industry. Additionally, legalisation could help regulate the quality and safety of CBD flower products, ensuring that consumers have access to reliable and properly labeled products.",
        "background": "CBD flower is illegal in the UK due to its association with cannabis. However, it has minimal THC levels, making it non-intoxicating. Legalization would ensure consumer safety and access to natural remedies while unlocking economic opportunities. Let's advocate for positive change together!",
