        "additional_details": "Because I think students are put under so much stress to achieve the grade 4 and the government do not understand the effort behind that students apply to this. For example students applying for apprenticeships who work so much to get the apprenticeship to then be denied because they have such a petty grade of a 3+ in English, pass is a 4.\r\nThis needs to change as it is unfair on the students who aren't allowed to pursue a career because of a grade boundary that is set to high for most careers.",
        "background": "I would like the government to consider the requirements to leave school and the grades to do so. For example if someone is wanting to go into engineering, why is a grade 4 in English language so necessary. It is so un needed as long as the student can provide basic writing worth a grade 2.",
