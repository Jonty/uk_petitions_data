        "additional_details": "Symptoms of hip dysplasia can often present later in the child\u2019s life, and could mean that the child has to undergo invasive surgeries, sometimes multiple times. These surgeries can be very invasive and could be avoided if picked up by an ultrasound at birth. Sometimes the surgeries are unsuccessful resulting in the child being likely to struggle when they are older. Surgeries can cost the NHS a lot of money and could be avoided if more money was put into preventative care. ",
