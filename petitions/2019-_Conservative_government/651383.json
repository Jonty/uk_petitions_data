The petition calls for a substantial legal overhaul, proposing a minimum double-figure imprisonment for car theft and bogus insurance claims. The current legal framework inadequately addresses car theft, offering a mere 6-month maximum sentence if the case is heard in a magistrates' court and often resorting to lenient Community Orders.",
