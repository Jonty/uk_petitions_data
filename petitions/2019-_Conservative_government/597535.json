        "additional_details": "I want the sentencing guidelines for sex offenders  to be reviewed and for the sentence to be increased significantly. These children are the next generation, they are the future and they should be protected at all costs! I want more done to track and trace the download of child pornography and the arrest rates increased. When a offender abuses a child just once thier whole life is ruined they will battle severely with mental health if they are strong enough to even continue living",
        "background": "The conviction sentences for sex offenders is not long enough. Short sentences mean the offender is released to do the same thing again. One offence can ruin a child\u2019s life so why should the offender be able to be released to start theirs again and potentially abuse more victims",
