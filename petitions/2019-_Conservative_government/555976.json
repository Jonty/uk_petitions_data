        "action": "Turn entry hill golf course into a mountain bike park(bath, north eats Somerset)",
        "additional_details": "This addition to bath would be very popular amongst the young, and would likely improve livelihoods. I\u2019m in my last year of GCSE\u2019s, and building/riding at park just down the road would mean the world to m! I\u2019m sure the park would get a lot of positive feedback, both from riders and builders alike.",
        "background": "Entry hill golf course, in the recent years has lost value and publicity and is significantly less popular than it used to be. There\u2019s been talk of turning it into a mountain bike park, since it\u2019s on the perfect hill, but it\u2019s all talk. I, for one, would be happy to volunteer, as would others!",
