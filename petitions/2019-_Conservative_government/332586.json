        "action": "Change the agreed pay rise deal for nurses and health care workers in the NHS.",
        "additional_details": "It is the nurses and healthcare workers who are always on the front line delivering care. We as a team keep the NHS running smoothly despite the hardships faced every day. In light of the pandemic, it is evident that the nurses and healthcare workers put their lives and that of their families at risk. We were the ones sitting with patients who were dying, holding their hands because loved ones were not allowed to visit and helping those who recovered mentally, physically and emotionally.",
        "background": "NHS nurses and healthcare workers deserve a substantial pay rise and not just a token one in light of the pandemic. It seems a lot of other professions have been recognised, but not the workers on the real frontline who put their lives and their families lives in danger every time they go to work.",
