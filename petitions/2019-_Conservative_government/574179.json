        "additional_details": "The government has closed the industries of virtually all the categories of people who make up the customer base of dry cleaners. The industry has seen an unsustainable drop in demand of up to 95%\r\nAs dry cleaners are classed as ' essential' because of the misunderstanding of the difference between dry cleaners and laundrettes, they are not LEGALLY being forced to close or restrict their operations. \r\nSo despite the huge reduction in demand they can't access funding available to other businesses.",
        "background": "Allow dry cleaners to access funding, rather than be forced to stay open with no demand for their services. Government has artificially reduced demand by up to 95%, closing hospitality trade, drastically reducing the scale of weddings and funerals and strongly advising people to work from home.",
