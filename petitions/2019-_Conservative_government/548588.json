A child should not be made to feel guilty for their body - especially when their health is partially their parents responsibility. Compulsory weighing of children in primary school could trigger things such as body dysmorphia and obsessive calorie counting.\r\n\r\nIm sure it would be much better for there be a few more overweight children than a generation of kids who develop an eating disorder because of terrible government strategies.",
