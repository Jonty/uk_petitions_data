        "additional_details": "Access to reconstruction surgery and psychosexual therapy for FGM survivors is routine in Europe (e.g. Germany, France, Switzerland, Spain), and is available in Africa & USA. In the UK no such services exist. This can have a negative impact on FGM survivors, and affect their quality of life and mental health. The NHS provides gender reassignment surgery and post-cancer vulva reconstruction yet does not provide patient choice for FGM survivors. We must resolve this glaring health inequity now!",
