        "additional_details": "How can students be expected to sit exams  when they've not had anywhere near enough teaching time? They have already missed too much. The government cannot expect students to be prepared to sit exams when some of them have been at home more than they have been in school. It's unfair to put students under this amount of extra pressure. Not only is the pressure of exams negatively affecting student's mental health, but also the worry of bringing the new strain of the virus home to their families.",
        "background": "The new strain of the virus is not only a risk for the children in schools, but for the families they could bring it home to. Why is it alright to risk the health of students, teachers and their families unnecessarily? Schools need to close and as a result of this closure, exams need to be cancelled",
