        "additional_details": "Changes need to be made to make the  child support payment system fairer for fathers In cases such as a change of circumstances- switching job roles and salaries. The current system whereby earnings must be less by 25% or more, is unsatisfactory as a calculating tool, since any change to earnings affects outgoings.  Basing the current years payments on last year\u2019s earnings is not ethical if the income is lower even by a small amount then the payments should be in line with ANY changes to income.",
        "background": "The csa will only adjust payments where there is a drop of 25% or more to a mans earnings.",
