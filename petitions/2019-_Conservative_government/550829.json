        "additional_details": "I have three grandchildren in London and wasn\u2019t able to see them or help during lockdown. The new rule means I am back in the same position and can\u2019t support them by having them to visit me in Yorkshire.  By adopting Scotland\u2019s rule of 6 so many families will not suffer just because their offspring have more than 2 children.  My daughter\u2019s 3 children includes twins and she really needs family to help out.  This is especially important in holiday times like half term and Christmas",
        "background": "Many families have more than 2 grandchildren and can\u2019t meet up under the new rule of 6!  This will impact upon the mental health of the country and the economy.  If the government changes the rule to the same as that of Scotland it would really help and be more fair to families in England.",
