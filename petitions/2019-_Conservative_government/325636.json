        "additional_details": "The UK's diversity is attributable to its role as a colonial power. Unpicking how and why race was constructed would support a sophisticated national discussion about race issues now. The Windrush scandal demonstrates that people and institutions need more education about the history of the UK and its relationship with the rest of the world. Some might assume that difficult conversations with schoolchildren will make them ashamed of the UK\u2019s past but Germany and Japan have shown differently.",
        "background": "All of us in the UK have been directly or indirectly affected by the UK's role in colonialism and politicianry. Huge progress could be made in race relations if students were taught this from early youth (key stage 3 and 4) in an objective way.",
