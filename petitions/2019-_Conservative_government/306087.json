        "action": "Requisition and nationalise all private hospitals and specialist clinics",
        "additional_details": "The NHS is rapidly becoming overwhelmed, there is a growing shortage of staff and equipment. It is immoral for private hospitals and clinics to make profits from the coronavirus at the time when the death toll is rapidly rising and the country's economy is wrecked. Healthcare professionals in the private sector were often trained by the NHS, we need them back there now. This is not a time for a two-tier healthcare system.",
        "background": "Immediately requisition and nationalise private hospitals and specialist clinics so they support the efforts against coronavirus and also cannot make money from this crisis. Get the private frontline health staff back in the NHS where they are urgently most needed.",
