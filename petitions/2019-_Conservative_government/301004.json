It is not the choice of a teenager to take these exams. \r\n\r\nDoes the government believe it acceptable to make families have to choose between food or education? Students may fail GCSEs due to lack of textbooks. A person\u2019s opportunities should not be lost due to a lack of money. This could be an enormous factor to the cycle of poverty. It is not a child\u2019s choice to go through these stressful exams in the first place. Why put on extra stress?
