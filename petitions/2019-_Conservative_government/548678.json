        "additional_details": "Many pupils across the country feel let down or angry at the government\u2019s decisions regarding the way grades will be calculated. We understand the government\u2019s intention, however the consequence may be a generation of pupils disillusioned and unmotivated by the education system, forced to question themselves and their self worth, and identity based off exam grades they did not earn and that don\u2019t reflect their abilities. We ask the government to take responsibility for this and provide funding to schools for counsellors and other mental health support.",
        "background": "We would like the DfE to provide additional funding to schools specifically for the purpose of supporting pupils from years 10 to 13 that have been impacted by the government\u2019s changes to exams. The Government must take responsibility for the impact their decisions will have on pupil mental health.",
