        "additional_details": "This is a country wide issue and a country wide response is required to ensure everyone is treated fairly. In normal circumstances patients might forego TV knowing that they will receive visitors. At this time, that is not possible. Given the restrictions on visiting, surely it\u2019s reasonable to allow patients free access to media, news, and some social respite.",
        "background": "Please fund hospitals to provide free TV access to patients during the coronavirus lockdown. Visiting is either restricted or completely not allowed meaning many patients are feeling extremely isolated. The cost of TV can be \u00a310 per day - much more than many can afford.",
