        "additional_details": "Having to state your ethnicity, sexual preference or religion sets you apart from others and it makes it seem as if workplaces will only hire a certain ethnicity or preference or religion to fit guidelines to appear as \u201cdiverse\u201d. Anyone with a skill set or degree in the said department should be able to apply without this additional information and they should be hired solely based on experience or how well they present themselves.",
        "background": "To remove the ethnicity, sexuality and religion section on job applications and also applications for university and schools. Although it is optional, it seems discriminatory as it separates black and ethnic minorities also people with other sexual preferences than heterosexual and religions.",
