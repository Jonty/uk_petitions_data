        "action": "Strongly encourage the energy companies to significantly reduce fuel tariffs.",
        "additional_details": "Millions of people are following government advice and are staying at home. Many of these people will have lost a significant amount of income, particularly the self employed, and this will last for several months. Energy bills are already a burden for many people whilst at the same time the energy companies make very healthy profits and through this unprecedended situation will make much higher profits in the future. If people stay at home they will use more energy. Tariffs need to be reduced.",
        "background": "I want the government through Ofgem to force the energy companies to significantly lower domestic fuel prices for several months. I want this to be a reduction in tariffs not a deferment of payment as many people are going to struggle financial for a long time.",
