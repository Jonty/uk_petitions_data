If a parent receives a pay increase, why can\u2019t that parent decide how they would like to use that money when buying for their children? \r\nAlso if a receiving parent was getting \u00a3100 a month for a child, why do they suddenly receive more if the paying parent gets paid more? If it has to be worked out on wages, there needs to be a fairer way or a cap on how much a child costs.",
        "background": "I don\u2019t believe that the cost of looking after a child fluctuates depending on how much a person is paid. Therefore there should be a fixed weekly amount that a child\u2019s upkeep costs to work out what should be paid. E.g. A child costs \u00a3200 pm, so paying parent sends receiving parent \u00a3100 pm.",
