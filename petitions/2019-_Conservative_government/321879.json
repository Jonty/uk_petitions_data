Yet, their dedication to their jobs and their hard work has been particularly seen in current pandemic. Caring is thought to be low skill job, yet unrecognised, these dedicated people make others feel comfortable, happy and safe. By ensuring  their salaries start on minimums \u00a312 per hour would cut the need for carers to work in number of jobs and  would also cut the unnecessary risks of spreading the virus.",
