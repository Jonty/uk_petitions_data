        "additional_details": "In 2015 it was made law in the UK that large retailers could charge 5p for the requirement of plastic bags. Climate change and the impact of single use plastics is a topic which is always on the public agenda for discussion in the UK. We would like to see a progressive approach to the law in this area and therefore we would like to gain support for a charge for all single use plastics.",
        "background": "Single use plastic, particularly in the food industry, is having a detrimental impact on the environment. Parliament should make a law that requires businesses to charge for these products if customers require single use plastic products (such as plastic straws) made from non-biodegradable material.",
