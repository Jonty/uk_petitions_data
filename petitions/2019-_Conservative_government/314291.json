(As those who are ignorant will just continue being so)\r\n2: Those of us who doesn't have supplements or a garden will be deprived of exercise, fresh air and access to free vitamin D. These are critical things for a functioning immune system. Make the current restrictions enforceable instead.",

If exercise is banned, then everyone will be deprived of fresh air, exercise and access to natural vitamin D.",
