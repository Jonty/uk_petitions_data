        "additional_details": "Access to essential items has become uneven in recent days as people buy up large stocks of toilet roll, pasta and sanitary products. Supermarkets have said this is unnecessary as supply lines remain open and show no signs of being restricted. Sensible people and the vulnerable are at risk of not being able to access essential items due to the selfish tendencies of a few. This needs to be stopped.",
