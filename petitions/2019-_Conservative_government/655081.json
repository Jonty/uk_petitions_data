We think there are a lot of inadequate enclosures available for sale in pet stores, and that new legislation is needed to improve animals' lives.\r\n \r\nThe Government should look at resources produced by animal welfare groups for guidance to make standards for enclosure sizes appropriate for each animal. Animals such as; Hamsters, Gerbils, Guinea Pigs, Rats, Mice and Rabbits.",
