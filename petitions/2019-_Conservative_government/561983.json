        "additional_details": "Lancaster and morecambe share the same NHS grouping with barrow and Cumbria with the Morecambe bay trust. So why are we separated when it comes to covid19 tiering. Many local business\u2019 will suffer as a result of this decision and it is not fair. The government need to reevaluate on how lancaster and Morecambe district is rated and ensure it is done fairly and correctly given the statistics for our area.",
        "background": "In relation to covid19 we should consider Lancaster and Morecambe as Cumbria, Barrow in Furness. Lancaster has under 100 COVID19 cases in over 100,000 persons. I believe it is unfair for Lancaster to be sanctioned by the same covid19 tier as Lancashire as a whole when the stats simply do not add up.",
