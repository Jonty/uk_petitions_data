        "additional_details": "The UK government has to protect festivals or they won\u2019t happen. Over three quarters (76 percent) of the remaining festivals could also cancel if action is not taken.\r\n\r\nPaul Reed (Chief Executive Officer of the Association of Independent Festivals)\r\n\u201cIf the road map progresses as planned, an insurance scheme won\u2019t cost the government anything,\u201d he said, pointing to the fact that if everything is ok then there will be no cancelled events to insure.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt feels like the ask is for the government to back their own road map by sharing some of the risks.\u201d",
        "background": "The youth have been forgotten in these COVID times and this summer could provide the release and freedom we so desperately need. In the Netherlands and Germany, governments have created cancellation insurance funds that grant festivals the secure backing they need to be able to go ahead.",
