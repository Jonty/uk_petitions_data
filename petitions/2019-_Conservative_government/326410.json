        "additional_details": "Research shows that BAME and working-class students are routinely given lower grades because of bias. Also, most students only start working hard before exams,\u00a0meaning predicted grades do not account for true ability.\u00a0GCSEs and A-levels are crucial to students\u2019 future success and life opportunities.\u00a0This pandemic has already brought our society to its knees.\u00a0It is our duty to ensure it does not now\u00a0become a life sentence for our\u00a0nation\u2019s most vulnerable.",
        "background": "Most students don\u2019t work as hard during the year as they do for exams. Furthermore, disadvantaged and minority students are systematically predicted lower grades. Basing this year\u2019s exam results only on subjective teachers\u2019 assessments will lead to gross injustice against these students.",
