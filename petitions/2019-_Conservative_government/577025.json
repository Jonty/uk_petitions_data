        "additional_details": "Our society is struggling via last year with covid. Certification is a tool that we can use in order to return to normality. Like rapid test it's a tool that can give access to normal life. Some people claim that by giving a certification the government would discriminate those who have not done it but what is happening is the opposite. The government discriminates those who have already done it. Vaccination is not mandatory I agree with that but everyone should take what he is entitled to.",
        "background": "I would like the government provide certifications to those who have done the vaccine. By not giving certifications the government discriminates those who have done the vaccine by favoring those who have not done it. Everyone must take what he is entitled to.",
