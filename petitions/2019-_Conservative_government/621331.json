In their report, MPs called on the Government to restrict the amount of plastic that can be exported from the UK. They also called on the Government to step up the enforcement of existing rules to prevent criminal gangs illegally exporting and dumping UK-produced waste.\u00a0\nRead the Committee's report reducing plastic waste (https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/31509/documents/176742/default/)\nRead a press release about the report (https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/52/environment-food-and-rural-affairs-committee/news/174191/mps-call-for-ban-on-all-plastic-waste-exports/)\nThe report follows a series of evidence sessions earlier this year, where the Committee questions representatives from charities, environmental campaigners and commercial trade experts. At these sessions the Committee explored:\nwhether the Government\u2019s current ambitions to reduce plastic waste were enough\nhow alternatives to plastic consumption can be identified and supported\nhow England's current plastic exports impact other countries.\nFind out more about the Committee's inquiry into plastic waste (https://committees.parliament.uk/work/1391/plastic-waste/) and read oral evidence from the Committee's inquiry (https://committees.parliament.uk/work/1391/plastic-waste/publications/).\nWhat is the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee?\u00a0\nThe Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee is a cross-party group of backbench MPs that scrutinises the administration, spending and policy of the Government\u2019s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.\u00a0\nFind out more about the Committee (https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/365/business-energy-and-industrial-strategy-committee/)\nFollow the Committee on Twitter (https://twitter.com/CommonsEFRA) for updates on its work.\n\u00a0\nThe Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee is a select committee.
