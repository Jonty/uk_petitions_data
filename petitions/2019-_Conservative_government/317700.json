        "additional_details": "I was working in the Alps for a UK company and paying UK tax and national insurance through PAYE. My contract was from December 2019 to April 2019, this contract was cut short and I was paid up to March 22nd. I am now unemployed, and unable to take up my planned employment in different hotel for the summer season because that hotel is also closed. Exclusion from the furlough scheme leaves me without income, even though I was in full time employment during March.",
        "background": "I was working in a hotel for the winter season when the lockdown started. I was fired along with all the other staff just before the furlough scheme was announced. My employer states that the furlough scheme is not for workers on fixed term contracts so will not re-employ me and pay me 80%.",
