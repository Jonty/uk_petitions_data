Ensuring that facts presented to Parliament are correct, false or debatable means that greater public trust can be put in parliamentary decisions and debates. \r\n\r\nResistance to this scrutiny would be counter to our democratic process. Having an a-political service of fact checking is centred on how our country makes informed decisions based on facts and data.",

As social media companies are taking sizeable steps to validate claims and highlight inconsistencies, it feels appropriate to ensure our parliamentary debates receive similar scrutiny.",
