        "additional_details": "All external and internal assessments should be cancelled this year due to the unfair distribution of learning and the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.Students from underprivileged backgrounds are unable to access the same resources as others.It's unfair for these tests to decide an entire grade as students haven't learnt enough for a true reflection of their potential.We believe that it's time to put trust in teachers who have monitored our progression and understand our knowledge.",
        "background": "Following the Covid-19 pandemic, I believe that too much learning has been disrupted in the last 2 academic years. Students are progressing at different rates so these exams would be unfair to those who have been disadvantaged during the pandemic. There have not been equal opportunities for students",
