        "additional_details": "The Liz Truss Government was unelected and unwanted. Voted in by a tiny fraction of the population as part of a Conservative Leadership Contest on the departure of the criminally negligent, and outright criminal, Boris Johnson.\r\n\r\nWith Truss' departure, there can be ZERO suggestion of a mandate from the electorate, and any Tory Cabinet, cobbled together from the shrapnel, would be an even greater degradation of our pitiful shadow of Democracy.\r\n\r\nA General Election is critical. Now.",
        "background": "As of this moment, if a GE were held, most Tories would lose their seats according to various polls. The Government can no longer argue that they hold a mandate from the British Public, a General Election is an urgent necessity if we are to maintain even a facade of Democracy.",
