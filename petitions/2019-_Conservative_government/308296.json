        "additional_details": "As many will be out of work due to closures of businesses over the coming weeks and months, the govt. have said they will pay  80% of the wages to those who are effectively out of work during this time. Considering the current circumstances, including isolation and pub/theatre/club closures etc, we are likely to spend much less. Lets give 5% to our hard working NHS, risking their lives to save ours and our loved ones during this pandemic.",
        "background": "As the government pledge to pay the 'out of work' 80% of their wage during this coronavirus pandemic, they should instead consider paying 75% of the wage and putting the other 5% into our heroic NHS.",
