        "additional_details": "Research conducted by the RAC as far back as 2019 determined that an extremely high percentage of drivers are continually adversely affected by vehicle headlight glare. The governments own figures say that headlight glare is a contributing factor in hundreds of road traffic accidents every year.\r\nPublic opinion seems to indicate that the issue of headlight glare is getting worse and we believe there is a strong case for unilateral decision making without the need for international agreement.",
        "background": "To deal urgently with the issue of modern high intensity vehicle headlights and the negative impact this has on road safety. To canvas the opinions of road safety experts and motoring organisations as well as the motoring public. Judgements should be made on a unilateral basis.",
