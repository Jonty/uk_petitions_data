        "additional_details": "We think the government should do this as it is proof of misogyny in the entertainment industry. Women\u2019s nipples have been overly sexualised for decades. If you watch a television program and a topless man is in the shot his nipples will not be censored, but if a women is topless in the shot her nipples (which are the exact same body part) will be censored. This has lead us to believe that it is not the nipple people find offensive it is the breast itself (which is barely ever censored).",
        "background": "We think the government should stop censoring Women\u2019s nipples on the television and social media as Men\u2019s nipples are not censored on the television and on social media. I think that either the government should stop censoring nipples completely or sensor both genders nipples.",
