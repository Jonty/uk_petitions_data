        "additional_details": "Family planning clearly improves the rights and outcomes for women and girls' around the world. The absolute sum of the \u00a3130m represents a very small percentage of government expenditure and works out at \u00a3520 to save a life based on the UN estimate that the money could help save 250,000 deaths. That modest sum for a life does not even include all the other deaths and reduced life chances that will result from the unintended pregnancies and unsafe abortions. ",
        "background": "The Government has reportedly cut funding for global family planning from \u00a3154m to \u00a323m. A UN source estimates the lost \u00a3130m would have helped prevent about 250,000 maternal and child deaths, 14.6 million unintended pregnancies and 4.3 million unsafe abortions. These cuts should be reversed.",
