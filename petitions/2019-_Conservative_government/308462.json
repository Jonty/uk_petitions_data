        "additional_details": "The UK Gov't should implement a stringent review of every company that applies for financial support.\r\n\r\nThis review should focus on the financial conduct of each company - in particular whether the company has paid or intends to pay a significant dividend to shareholders whilst aware of the COVID-19 crisis.\r\n\r\nGov't financial assistance should be denied to companies who continue to pay millions to shareholders. Our public funds must not be syphoned off to enrich the few while the many are in need.",
        "background": "Our public funds will be stretched beyond breaking point over the coming months. The NHS and ordinary working people will be in desperate need of support. We must avoid a scenario where this money is instead used to bail out large corporations who have paid millions in dividends out to shareholders",
