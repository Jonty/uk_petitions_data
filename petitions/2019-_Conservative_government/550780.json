        "additional_details": "As a driver in London i come across a lot of cyclists on a daily basis who seem to have no accountability for their actions on the roads and just ride off after clipping wing mirrors, scratching paint work, pulling out in front of other vehicles, even hitting pedestrians etc. They are not traceable through dash cam footage because there is no reg to identify the bike unlike a motorised vehicle and even if you could identify them, they have no insurance to cover costs of any damage they make.",
