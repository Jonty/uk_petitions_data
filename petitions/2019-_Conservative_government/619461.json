        "additional_details": "From my own previous experience I recently lost my partner due to him having a cardiac arrest. He was aged 31, fit and healthy and has left a 1 year old son behind. If my partner Osahon had had this heart check he would have known there was a problem with his heart and the probability is that he\u2019d still be here alive with us, instead of going to play football that night. I want the government to make these screenings available to all those who want it, to prevent tragedies like this one from happening to someone else and their family.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to fund yearly heart screenings for all young people who would like to have their hearts checked for all abnormalities and unknown genetic problems. People should be entitled to have a yearly check to ensure their main organ in the body is working fully and is healthy.",
