        "action": "Provide Covid-19 financial support to small limited company owners and directors",
        "additional_details": "These owners and directors often do not qualify for the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme leaving a substantial impact on their income. We propose that the government introduce a similar scheme that will provide essential financial support, offering grants of 80% of declared profits from the most recent corporation tax return. This shall be capped at a maximum value of \u00a37500 PER COMPANY for a 3 month period, and shall be used solely for the payment of dividends.",
        "background": "Owners and Directors of small limited companies often rely on dividends to make up much of their income. These dividends are dependant on the success and profitability of their businesses. This has been significantly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, with many no longer able to receive this income.",
