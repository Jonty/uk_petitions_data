I believe employers should look at the experience and qualifications a person has rather than their age. It is not fair that you can get paid less due to your age. It is age discrimination.",
        "background": "I want the minimum wage to be made equal for all ages. The minimum wage is currently less for adults aged 18-22 years of age no matter what experience you have. This means workers aged under 23 can be paid less than older staff, even if they have more experience and qualifications.",
