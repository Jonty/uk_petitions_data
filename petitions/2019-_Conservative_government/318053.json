        "additional_details": "We hereby call upon the UK Government to take steps towards ending the COVID-19 lockdown.\r\n\r\nWe accept that COVID-19 poses a serious risk to a proportion of the population, and therefore believe that the Government should continue to recommend that those at risk remain indoors- if in doubt, don\u2019t go out.\r\n\r\nHowever, a long term lockdown may cause more deaths than the virus itself due to depression, cancelled treatments and unemployment.\r\n\r\nPlease protect our well being as well as our health.",
        "background": "Begin a transition to end the COVID-19 lockdown as soon as new daily cases consistently drop- maintaining it for too long will destroy the economy and may possibly cause more deaths than the virus itself.",
