        "additional_details": "I feel this is a breach of citizen's privacy and a betrayal of trust. In an age of data protection for a Government agency to sell motorists' personal information, acquired through compulsory licensing (a driver's licence) is highly questionable.\r\n \r\nThis practice enables an unscrupulous private parking industry, which although has accreditation is still able to buy motorist's personal information from our own Government in order to issue highly unreasonable fines in the guise of an invoice.",
        "background": "The Government should prevent all private parking companies (regardless of any form of accreditation) being able to acquire or buy UK motorist's personal information, such as name and address, from the DVLA for the purposes of sending any form of invoice or fine.",
