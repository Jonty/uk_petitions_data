        "additional_details": "We would like there to be a maximum tasks amount that can be set. I suggest 7 a week. Students shouldn\u2019t be spending all their free time on homework. They need to socialise, discover hobbies and have a childhood. Homework takes time for those things away from students, which can affect their opportunities for development. The constant stress from school to stay on top of work can put children off wanting to learn, which they should want to. The desire to learn is vital for children for their creativity and health.",
        "background": "There should a limit on how many pieces of homework a student can be set, not how many hours because it\u2019s different for individuals on how long it takes them. We believe the current burden of homework can have a significant impact on a student's mental health.",
