However, without alternative text to describe images for visually impaired people, and subtitles on videos for those who are deaf, this content is not accessible to everyone. These accessibility tools are easily useable and built-in to primary social media platforms; they should be used by all our democratic representatives.",

For visually impaired people, this content is inaccessible. The government must ensure that all content it and its Ministers produce is fully accessible to everyone.",
