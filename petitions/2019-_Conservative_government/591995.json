My Son cannot have the help he urgently needs currently under the NHS and the support that should be offered. CAMHS and SFEDS have openly agreed that currently they are failing my son and many  individuals that require immediate mental health support, I am having to go privately to obtain this, which I cannot afford,  or he would not be helped and is at severe risk .",
        "background": "The mental health services are not operational, young children are being refused mental health treatment as CAMHS are at crisis level and rejecting mental health assessments,  that would save lives, due to lack of funding and staffing issues, my Son is one of them .",
