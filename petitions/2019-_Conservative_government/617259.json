        "additional_details": "The 5p per litre cut announced in the Chancellor\u2019s Spring Statement that did nothing to support struggling individuals and businesses with the cost of living crisis. It has, rather unwittingly, increased profit margins for retailers! In reality, when it costs over \u00a390 for just 50 litres of diesel - \u00a32.50 cut does very little\u2026. Especially when  the RAC estimate that currently 55% (or approximately \u00a350!) of the cost is from fuel tax and VAT. VAT alone benefits the Treasury by around 30p per litre.",
        "background": "VAT on petrol and diesel should be temporarily removed and a regulator put in place to prevent profiteering by fuel suppliers and retailers. Petrol is now an average of \u00a31.70.4 a litre and diesel costs more than \u00a31.81.4 - all-time highs for both fuels.",
