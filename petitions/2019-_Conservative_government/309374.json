Despite this, aspiring nurses still signed up for courses knowing they would be left with mountains of debt.\r\n\r\nThe very same students found out last year that they are going to miss out on the new \u00a35000 a year Nursing grants that start September 2020.\r\n\r\nNow in the 3rd year of their degree, they are being asked to opt in to a placement to help with the shortage of nurses during the COVID-19 crisis.",

These students are the ones who fell into the 2016-2019 funding hole that has left them with mountains of student debt. Those who opt in to helping should have their student debt wiped.",
