Like many people, I depend greatly on the use of public libraries but that is no longer an option so we are forced to complete these assignments/assessments with little to no help or support. This is a very difficult situation for students who not as fortunate to have equipment or technology to complete their work. Removing exams/online assessments would elevate the stress, that not only less fortunate students are experiencing but what most students are experiencing on a day to day basis.",

Those in their final year could be assessed in another way, best advised by their respective schools but also not as tasking.",
