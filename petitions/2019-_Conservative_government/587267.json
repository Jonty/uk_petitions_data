        "additional_details": "I would like the government to go ahead with my idea as it is unfair to the current Year 11's as they were supposed to be the only exemptions to the 'normal' GCSE examinations. The current Year 11's were most affected by this pandemic in an academic point of view as at that point the current Year 10's would have chosen courses for GCSE's or about to choose their options. From what I have found out the current year 9's & 10's have or will be able to cover all the content needed at the rate they need to with the adequate revision time.",
