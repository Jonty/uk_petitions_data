Polls now suggest that a majority of UK voters feel the decision to leave was a mistake, and that this is steadily increasing every year.\r\n \r\nGiven that the blue passport represents a change of which most holders may now disapprove, we believe that forcing this colour on them is the action of an unrepresentative state.\r\n \r\nReverting to burgundy is not the same as rejoining the EU. However, it would acknowledge the will of the people and geographic reality.\u201d\r\n",
