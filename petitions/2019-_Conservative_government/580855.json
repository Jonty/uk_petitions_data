I\u2019m sure there are many others who are also going through this and I\u2019m sure for even longer so I propose that the government allow the reunification of partners/families as a legal reason to travel during this current lockdown.To be fined \u00a35,000 to travel is ridiculous when you are just trying to see the person you love so help make a change!",

Many have been separated from their partners or family so the government needs to revise rules on \u2018essential travel\u2019 + allow \u2018reunification with partners/family members\u2019 as a legal reason to travel",
