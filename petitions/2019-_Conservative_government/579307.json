This advice has also been supported by the UK's four Chief Medical Officers. \r\n\r\nAny changes to the planned timing of second doses for specific groups would be a decision for the NHS, the JCVI and the Chief Medical Officers, who are operationally independent of the UK Government, so we cannot accept petitions calling for actions that these bodies are responsible for."
