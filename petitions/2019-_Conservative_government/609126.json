        "action": "Offer tuition-fee refunds to students impacted by the pandemic",
        "additional_details": "We know that universities profited handsomely from the pandemic. They received over \u00a3115 million in taxpayer money through the government's furlough programme, and have amassed an operating surplus of over \u00a32.2 billion. \r\n\r\nMany students had large parts of their degrees cancelled or moved online as a result of the pandemic. They received only a fraction of the educational experience their fees entitled them to. \r\n\r\nUniversities claims of financial distress have proved to be demonstrably false.",
        "background": "Government must force universities to compensate students who have not received a fair deal on fees through a tuition-fee rebate. Students who had their degrees negatively impacted by the pandemic are entitled to money back, but universities will not give it. Government must compel them to do so.",
