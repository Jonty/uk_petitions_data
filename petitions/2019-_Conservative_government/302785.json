        "background": "The Immigration Health Surcharge will go up from 400 pounds to over 600 pounds. This is paid by foreign born workers in the UK who also pay tax and NI.  It includes doctors and nurses who are on the front line against coronavirus. It is wrong they pay twice for the healthcare you only pay for once.",
