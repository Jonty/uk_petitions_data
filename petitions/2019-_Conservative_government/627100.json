        "additional_details": "A Petitions Committee inquiry in 2019 concluded that it would not be appropriate for the Government to entirely ban the public use of fireworks. Whilst some reasons that they have given are understandable, we believe private displays in built up areas cause an unacceptable disturbance to neighbours and also danger to life.\r\n \r\nWe are calling for the Government to ban all private displays after 8pm, and the use of rockets in built up areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are calling for the government to ban private displays after 8pm and the use of rockets in built up areas.",
        "background": "Current laws dictate that it\u2019s illegal for anyone to set off fireworks between 11pm and 7am, except on certain occasions. We want the Government to ban all private firework displays after 8pm, and the use of rockets in built up areas, due to the negative impact on those living in close proximity.",
