        "additional_details": "All other government support during this crisis is non means tested. That means that some people are eligible for up to \u00a32500 a month whilst their partner can earn an unlimited amount. Universal Credit is based on household income and those who have a parter who works are often entitled to nothing. Suspend means testing and allow all unemployed people access to universal credit regardless of the total household income.",
        "background": "Temporarily suspend means testing for universal credit to protect people from hardship during the coronavirus crisis. \r\nMany newly self employed people are ineligible for government support and are forced to turn to universal credit but by having a working partner they are often entitled to nothing.",
