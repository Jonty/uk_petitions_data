The requirement to memorise quotations for English Literature qualifications reduces contradicts the purpose of a GCSE english exam, by making the exam a memory test, rather than a focus on detailed analysis of texts. As the equations have been given for Maths and Physics, additional assistance should be given for English to ensure parity between subjects.",
