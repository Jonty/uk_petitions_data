        "additional_details": "After rescuing a friends pony that she gifted to a non-profit that was really operating as a riding school without a license or insurance, we want this to be taken seriously. He has suffered terrible abuse at the hands of this place, he is skin & bones covered in scars full of worms. The yard he came from had no grazing at all, his stable had no bedding it was covered in urine & faeces.\r\n\r\nThis place was a registered centre for the pony club and no one had checked it.",
        "background": "We want the government to increase regulations to protect horses and ponies from abuse, poor housing and care. The licensing framework for livery yards should be amended so that stables must be checked annually by local authorities. This could include spot checks and visits from vets.",
