In America aneurysm awareness month is September and it\u2019s a pretty big deal over there, you\u2019re encouraged to have scans. Symptoms and signs are all over the place. I didn\u2019t even know there was symptoms until now after I\u2019ve lost a loved one.\r\n\r\nThere needs to be more awareness and more training for GPs!\r\n",
