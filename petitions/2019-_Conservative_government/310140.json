        "additional_details": "We need to encourage and support the healthcare workers who not only risk their lives but help save others and charging them to have studied to enable them to do this seems morally wrong. As a country we are short of a variety of specific skills and again to encourage studying in chosen areas we need to offer free study to increase numbers of skilled essential workers, scientists engineers etc.. This policy could be flexible depending on who is identified as required by Gov over the coming years",
