        "additional_details": "Many homes already stuck in limbo or have returned to market with deposits or fees lost, the current extension does not fix the issues due to low building stock with many house builders brought on by Covid-19 ilness and slower movement of stock. Allowing existing applications to complete regardless of the deadline date will fix this issue for hundreds of thousands of home purchases, which was brought on by the government. It's a good boost for the economy so let active application complete!",

Individual families are losing their dream or first home purchases and this needs changing before more families are impacted by the broader deadline date.",
