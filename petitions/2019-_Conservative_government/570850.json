        "additional_details": "The Government has limited Child Tax Credits and Universal Credit payments to 2 children, but it is not possible for women to secure sterilisation on demand to prevent potentially unwanted pregnancies. As no contraceptive provides 100% protection, we should have the option of choosing sterilization if we know we do not want any more children without any barriers. This is our right to choose what we want.",
        "background": "I'm 22 & have 3 kids and have had 2 miscarriages. I asked to be sterilized and was told I wasn't eligible as I am under 25 and have no medical need. This is unfair, and the Government should provide funding to make female sterilisation available on demand to all women aged 16 and over.",
