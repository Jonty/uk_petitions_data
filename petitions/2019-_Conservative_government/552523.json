        "action": "Revoke the 10pm curfew applied to bars, pubs and restaurants",
        "additional_details": "The 10pm curfew is an arbitrary measure based, not on data or research. Hospitality is statistically proven as a low transmission sector. The curfew encourages COVID transmission by putting everyone out of controlled spaces and into uncontrolled public ones all at the exact same time. The 8pm sitting that generates 30% of revenue for most restaurants is effectively wiped out for no good reason. It is clear the 10pm time is arbitrary. At the very least 11pm would allow staggered departure times.",
        "background": "Revoke the 10pm curfew or at least push it back to midnight to allow the staggered release of guests into public places and reinstate the loss of 30% of turnover caused the limits placed on 8pm-9pm guests by the forced eviction at 10pm",
