        "action": "Ban the use of horses within the Police Force",
        "additional_details": "The use of horses in protests is solely to intimidate protesters. Rather than easing tension, which is what the police force should aim to be doing, the presence of horses inflames tension, causing increased panic to the protesters and horses alike. At the Black Lives Matter protest in London, this increased upheaval caused a horse to bolt and knock down a protester, which could have been fatal.\r\n \r\nHorses have no place in 21st century policing. Sign this petition and put an end to this practice.",
        "background": "Horses are gentle creatures who are known to be spooked easily \u2013 they do not belong in a protest. It is unconscionable for an innocent animal to be harmed in these completely human-created situations.",
