        "additional_details": "Under the old state pension, women could claim a pension based on the contributions of a husband, ex-husband or late husband. DWP has acknowledged that in some cases this did not work and women are being underpaid, and is checking to find these women and compensate them. But others may be missing out, including widows, certain older married women and the over 80s. DWP must check their entitlements and provide compensation for any underpayment, rather than wait for them to claim, one-by-one.",
