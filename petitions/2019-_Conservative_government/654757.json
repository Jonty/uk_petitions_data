        "additional_details": "In other countries, such as France and Spain there is a duty to rescue others. In France, under Article 223-6, those who fail to assist a person in danger is liable within the criminal courts and can be held accountable. In Spain, under Article 195, it is a criminal offence for a citizen to fail to provide or seek help to anyone in need so long as it does not endanger them. We think a duty to rescue should be enacted into the English and Welsh legal system.",
        "background": "There is currently no statutory duty to rescue someone in need. Someone could openly watch an individual drown or be in serious peril, such as suffering an overdose or heart attack, and do nothing.",
