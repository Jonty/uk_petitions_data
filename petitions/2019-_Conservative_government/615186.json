        "additional_details": "The practice of withholding the salary from advertisements is problematic and it too often wastes substantial time and effort of job seekers. Each application can take many hours and if the pay on offer is not suitable for the candidate in the first place then these are wasted hours. Until the Government legislates to enforce employers to include a salary range for each role advertised far too many will not include this vital information and continue to use vague terms like \u2018competitive\u2019.",
        "background": "The pay one receives for working is one of the most important factors when applying for any job.\r\nGovernment should legislate so that job adverts must include a salary range, so as to inform applicants & prevent candidates wasting time on applying for roles beneath their salary expectations & needs.",
