        "additional_details": "Child Poverty Action Group (CAPG) found in 2020 that up to age 18, the cost of raising a child as a single parent costs \u00a3185,000 with housing and childcare. Those with parental responsibility who do not share day to day costs/care of the child must be made to contribute an adequate minimum amount towards that. \u00a37 per week is not an adequate minimum amount.\r\n \r\nThis change to \u00a321.15 per week, rather than \u00a37, should create wider opportunities for physical and emotional development.",
        "background": "The current \"flat\" rate of Child Maintenance is \u00a37 per week for non-resident parents earning \u00a37 to \u00a3100, or getting benefits. We believe too many paying parents are allowed to pay minimal amounts due to flimsy & inadequate child maintenance formulas & inaccurate assessments on affordability.",
