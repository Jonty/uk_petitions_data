        "additional_details": "Charges placed on small business owners and residents through congestion charges, ulez charges, fees for charging electric vehicles and the cost of upgrade grades after grants have been issued are more than can be reasonably afford. This pats low income families at risk of debt, or being unable to feed their family, and puts small businesses at risk of collapse.  This in turn increases the number of people reliant on government support.",

Put the responsibility of reducing emissions on councils in the form of making all public transport within cities clean via the use of clean energy vehicles.",
