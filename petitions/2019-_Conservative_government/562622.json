The government has a duty to protect these people, in the same way that people are protected legally against discrimination on grounds of colour, race, disability or religion. There is a real risk that organisations such as airlines, airports, cinemas, sports & music stadiums may decide not to allow non-vaccinated individuals to use their services. LEGISLATE NOW",

It is critical that people are allowed to make decisions about whether to be vaccinated or not. Organisations should not be allowed to discriminate.",
