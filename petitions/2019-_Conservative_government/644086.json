I also have to prove I earn over the \u00a318600 threshold, which means I'll need to return to the UK without my wife until I have evidence that I've earned over this threshold for six months. \r\n\r\nI understand the above rules for newlyweds but not serious married couples where there is clear evidence of a durable and genuine marriage",
