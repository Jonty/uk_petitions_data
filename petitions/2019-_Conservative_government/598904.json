We could accept a petition calling for people who have recovered from Covid-19 to be exempted from this requirement. We could also accept a petition calling for the Government to make people who have recovered from Covid-19 eligible for the NHS Covid-19 pass, if that's what you want to happen.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
