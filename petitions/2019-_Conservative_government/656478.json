        "additional_details": "We believe current rules for home fee status are unfair, particularly as they apply retrospectively to the children of people who had already applied for visas to come to the UK. We aim for these children to qualify for home fee status, if not this will mean they face higher fees that could prevent these children, who already are on the path to becoming UK citizens from receiving further education. This could jeopardize their education despite meeting the UK residency and study criteria.",
        "background": "We want children of Turkish workers/businesspersons to be entitled to home fee status for higher education if they arrived in the UK after 31 December 2020 due to pandemic-related delays by the Home Office, provided that the visa to enter the UK was applied for before that date.",
