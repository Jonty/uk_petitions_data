        "additional_details": "Hiding carrier bags from sight in stores could have the same effect as removing cigarettes from sight, reducing the demand from consumers to acquire a carrier bag to help shopping when perhaps they do not really require one. This could dramatically reduce plastic usage and help put humanity back on track to control Climate Change.",
        "background": "Carrier bag sales have fallen dramatically in recent years, but wastage continues while the world is at a pivotal moment in the fight against Climate Change, and we should do all we can to deter demand from overusing plastic items, i.e. carrier bags, through the hiding of bags from sight in stores.",
