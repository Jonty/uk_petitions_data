If someone has maltreated a pet animal - a living breathing sentient being that feels pain and emotion as much as any human - then they have abused that privilege and must not be given a second chance. It is often said by psychologists that the best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and animals deserve protection from people that are bound to repeat the abuse.\r\n\r\nA mandatory lifetime ban will also end inconsistencies in this area of sentencing.",
