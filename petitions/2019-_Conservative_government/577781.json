        "additional_details": "Furloughed workers are paid throughout the months of February, March and April, while the self-employed are expected to have savings to cover this period while unable to work. The announcement of grant details is a month too late to cover the intended period, and it is set to be almost 2 months before crucial help is available. The government could help immediately; there is no excuse for leaving people without the means to provide for themselves and their families during a nationwide lockdown.",
        "background": "Enable the self-employed to claim the fourth grant now; the money is meant to cover a 3-month period which will be almost over by the time any money is available. Millions of self-employed are unable to work or earn their usual income; they need support now and it is being unreasonably delayed.",
