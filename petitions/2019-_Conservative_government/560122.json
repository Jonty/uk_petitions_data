        "additional_details": "The legalisation on cropping will help as many dogs are being unprofessionally cropped this is extremely dangerous as a dog could develop an infection and won\u2019t be able to receive proper veterinary care for it. Done for looks or not at least it will be done properly where the dogs can seek medical attention if ever needed. This is also very beneficial to working dogs which are more prone to blistering their ears than pets are. Even if you do not agree with cropping this will help so many dogs.",
