        "action": "Stop the commissioning of a \u00a3200 million royal yacht",
        "additional_details": "When the UK tax payer is about to feel the economic toll of Covid, austerity is at an all time high and many families are experiencing poverty, it is grotesque to see that there is an intention to commission a royal yacht at such a time. Insensitive, out of touch and outright wrong.\r\nAfter clapping for the NHS and denying a pay rise due to a lack of funds, it is incredibly hurtful to read of a \u00a3200 million vanity project. Those in poverty similarly would never forgive such an act.",
        "background": "Prevent commissioning of a royal yacht until such a time where it is a reasonable expense. This would at the very least be when the Covid expenditure has been recovered. I would also put forward that the priority for the rational human being would be paying the NHS fairly and ending child poverty.",
