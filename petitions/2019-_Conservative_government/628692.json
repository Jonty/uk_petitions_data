Discounting homes for people over 60 and endlessly building retirement homes steals the chance of getting a house for young Devionians and Cornish people who want to stay in their home counties. Most of the over 60s own houses that are not \"first home\" suitable and often are from other regions so do not free up homes for people in their 20s and 30s who actually need somewhere to live.",
