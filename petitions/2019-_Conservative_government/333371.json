        "additional_details": "Due to COVID-19 we are given limited \u2018in university\u2019 contact hours and more of the curriculum is taught online therefore, as students, we are struggling to understand how spending the same amount of money as those who were able to get a full education when we\u2019re so limited, is fair. For some degrees a certain amount of practical elements are required which can no longer be carried out, yet, for a limited level of teaching we are still required to still give a large sum of money.",
        "background": "As students, we wish government or parliament to lower the tuition for current students or those who are about to join university whilst the pandemic is widely effecting our ability to learn and conduct research or practical elements of our degree, which for some, is highly important.",
