        "additional_details": "Currently in this country a government does not represent the majority of voters. At the last general election the Conservatives won with 44% of the electorate voting for them, taking away the voice of the majority. It's time to move to proportional representation so that each vote matters regardless of where in the UK someone might live and tactical voting can finally become a thing of the past.",
        "background": "I want parliament to amend the UK system to ensure that every voice in this country is heard when electing our government.",
