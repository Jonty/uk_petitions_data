        "additional_details": "5,583 suicides were registered in 2021 in England and Wales. 4.4 per cent of suicides in the UK take place on the railway. There needs to be a big push for these platform screens. Because of the funding required to put the PSDs in place, the decision will have to be made by our government. \r\n\r\nThese screens will not only help to prevent attempted railway suicides but also prevent the trauma experienced by train drivers, railway staff, passengers and families. This will not eradicate all suicides but it will be a huge, important start.",
        "background": "Mental health and suicide prevention needs more action. We should have platform screen doors in every train station. Suicides are becoming more and more prevalent and we need to do more as a society to make sure that preventatives are put in place.",
