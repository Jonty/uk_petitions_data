For people who have purchased a new build house (pre Ombudsman) and where the developer is not investigating properly or fixing issues, we believe legal action should not be required on the home owner\u2019s part to force the builder to do the right thing. If after a period of years action isn\u2019t done by the builder, the regulatory and monitoring body should ensure the owner has the option to sell the house back at market value to the developer. If a help to buy loan has been used, we think the developer should be required to give the owner the amount of their loan as compensation, so they can buy something else like for like. \r\n \r\n",
