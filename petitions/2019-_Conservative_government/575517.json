        "action": "Suspend No Recourse to Public Funds visa conditions",
        "additional_details": "No recourse to public funds (NRPF) has long pushed working families into poverty, unsustainable debt and homelessness. With no access to the public safety net, many more families are at risk of destitution, particularly with rising job losses. Greater risk of destitution causes increased financial pressure on Local Authorities who must respond to requests for destitution support.  \r\n\r\nSuspending NRPF is vital to contain COVID-19, prevent hardship, and release pressure on Local Authorities.",
        "background": "Call on the Government to urgently suspend No Recourse to Public Funds visa conditions so that migrants and their families are protected from the health and financial impacts of Covid-19. More support is needed for those who live and work in the UK, to ensure they can access the public safety net.",
