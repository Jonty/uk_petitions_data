        "additional_details": "The \u00a3450k LISA house price cap hasn\u2019t changed since April 2017, despite house prices soaring.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, other government-backed first-time buyer schemes have been introduced with far higher price caps (the Help to Buy price cap in London is \u00a3600k) \u2013 causing a severe dislocation. \r\n\r\nThis makes the already near-impossible task of buying a home in London even harder.",
        "background": "LISAs encourage people to save for their first home, worth less than \u00a3450k, by offering a 25% government bonus. But the average London house price is \u00a3507k \u2013 well above the cap. \r\n\r\nTherefore, many looking to buy a home are forced to forego their bonus and pay an additional 6.25% penalty charge.",
