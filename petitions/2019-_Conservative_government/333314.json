Eating disorders are amongst the most deadly mental illnesses. \r\n\r\nThis will not \"empower adults and children to live healthier lives\", but on the contrary make problem of eating disorders worse.",
        "background": "The government should not make calorie counts on menus mandatory in all chain restaurants, takeaways, and caf\u00e9s with over 250 employees as proposed in a new attempt to lower levels of obesity in the UK.",
