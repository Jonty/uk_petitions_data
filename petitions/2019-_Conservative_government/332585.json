        "additional_details": "I believe every person, regardless of their background, should be able to further themselves within education and go on to study a Masters. However under the current set up, students miss out on essential funding needed for tuition fees. Those who are unable to source funding from family are faced with the possibility of taking out bank loans to fund their course. Student Finance England currently funds fully for Undergraduate courses, why not Postgraduate?",
        "background": "As a student in England if you would like to study for a MA or MSc, you can apply for up to \u00a311,222 in loans. Courses over 1 year leave students wondering where the rest of the funding will come from. I believe this system needs to be changed to allow more equal funding for courses over 1 year.",
