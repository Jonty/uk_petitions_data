        "action": "Extend the 30 free hours and tax free childcare schemes to include NHS students",
        "additional_details": "It is know that many areas of the NHS are understaffed. Many who long to pursue the professions are either prevented from or penalised for doing so by childcare costs. Giving up paid employment to study the required courses means individuals are no longer elibible to the financial support. The NHS provides a \u00a32000 grant for parents but this often doesnt cover one month fees. The goverment can support parents to access education and NHS careers by accepting their unpaid work as employment.",
        "background": "To be eligible for support from the childcare schemes parents are required to work 16 hours on minimum wage, excluding those completing unpaid work. Students on NHS based courses (i.e. nursing and midwifery) work 37+hrs a week, more than 50% of the year and should be elibible for the same support.",
