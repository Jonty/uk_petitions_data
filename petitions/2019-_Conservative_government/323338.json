The prison sentences abusers get is nothing compared to the lifelong trauma they inflict on their victims. I would like more funding to go to charities that help the victims of sexual abuse however I don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough. We need to set a standard. We need to protect our children and ourselves. The people in charge need speak for the millions of people who feel this way.",

I think the prison sentences and punishments for crimes like these as too soft and more needs to be done in terms of deterring this sort of crime.",
