        "additional_details": "By extending the furlough to end of March 2021 it would allow:\r\nBusiness to hold out through winter trading should a second national/local lockdown become necessary.\r\nKeep people who need to shield financially safe who may not be able to look for alternative employment otherwise. \r\nAbsorb potential financial damage to business given the uncertainty over the brexit deal or no deal scenario. \r\nAllow businesses, if have to close, to reopen in spring offsetting job losses, economic and industry damages.",
        "background": "Many businesses are facing uncertainty as a result of covid-19 and many more are still struggling to reopen. With no cure, yet, looking to be viable & with the country officially in economic recession, many businesses & workers will be worried about their future especially coming up to Christmas.",
