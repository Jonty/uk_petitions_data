        "additional_details": "It's clear the Electoral Commission is no longer value for money to the UK taxpayer. At the very least, there must be an investigation by Parliament, debating future reform, replacement or complete abolition of this quango.\r\n\r\nIndividual members of the Electoral Commission have been publicly identified as being too closely connected to certain activities and political ideologies, losing public confidence in their decision making process.",
        "background": "The electoral commission has frequently shown bias against certain groups and campaigners for leaving the EU. From unreasonable accusations and investigations against members of the various Leave campaigns to raids on the offices of The Brexit party during the EU elections in 2019.",
