        "additional_details": "Shortening the summer holidays isn\u2019t fair on students and teachers. We\u2019ve gone through so much this year and we deserve a longer break! It will take a toll on our mental health. Also, families may have made alternative arrangements like holidays for the dates that\u2019s the term will be extended to so it\u2019s not fair on them loosing that! Also, students won\u2019t want to work in the summer, so they won\u2019t learn anything anyways. We want to have fun! We need quality not quantity! No wonder unions disagree.",
        "background": "The government could resist the whole year as we haven\u2019t even learned anything from all the distribution during COVID! Alternatively, the government could extend the school day. I think something good needs to be done or teachers are just going to strike.",
