        "additional_details": "Many elderly patients feel prisoned in care homes and are left unable to understand why their partners or children stopped visiting them whilst their families watch their loved ones suffer in despair and are unable to access them.  This has to change.  A single family member can easily be nominated a key worker and be treated exactly the same as care home staff.  They can get tested regularly, just like the rest of the staff. Otherwise the government will do more harm than Covid will do",
        "background": "Restrictions to access to loved ones in care homes is doing more damage than the potential Covid risk they are designed to protect from. Gov should allow a single family member regular access to loved ones by designating them as key workers in care homes and provide them weekly testing.",
