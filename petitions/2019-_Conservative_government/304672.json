It would be in the government interest that any issues during this pandemic did not negatively affect peoples and business's ability to borrow over the next 6 years.",
        "background": "This pandemic could stretch the government, people's and business's finances to the limit. The government needs to ensure that any late or missed payments over this period do not register on credit files and therefore do not ruin people's ability to borrow for the next 6 years.",
