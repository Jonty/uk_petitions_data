        "action": "Repeal the UK Devolution bill, get rid of the money pit satellite parliaments",
        "additional_details": "The constant SNP calls for independence have been refused by the Scottish people repeatedly, Scotland would not last without English money and stands no chance of joining the EU so lets end the game and repeal the act, the government has the majority lets use it to the UK's advantage. N.I. would be a special case for some kind of N.I. administration due to its unique border with the EU.",
        "background": "We need to rescind/repeal the Devolution bill, get rid of the satellite parliaments that serve no real purpose apart from lip service to the likes of the SNP but cost the UK dearly, it could almost be an EU plan to split the Union and then England in to 9 districts/regions with elected mayors",
