        "additional_details": "Pupils have been given 2 weeks of revision in the Easter holidays to recap 2 years worth of syllabus, while being in lockdown for half of that education. This in turn has given them an extraordinary amount of stress and anxiety, along with the stress from the lockdown and pandemic as a whole, this has decayed with pupils mental health. This puts the students at a huge disadvantage compared previous years and will most likely have a negative affect on their exams results.",
        "background": "Currently, pupils have been told that they have to take up to 30 assessments even though pupils were promised their PPG's as their final grades in the prior lockdown months.",
