        "action": "End EU Trade Talks if negotiations fail to progress by June and plan exit on WTO",
        "additional_details": "There is no reason why negotiations cannot continue between the UK and EU through the use of videoconferencing. The EU is facing recession and is appears to be prolonging talks as long as possible. The post-pandemic period will be dominated by reviving the economy, rebuilding the NHS, driving unemployment down, and regaining a handle on public finances. The UK needs to exit talks as soon as it is clear that a \u2018Canada-Style\u2019  FT deal is not on offer.",
        "background": "If the PM and his team fails to negotiate a \u2018Canada-Style\u2019 free trade deal with the EU by the end of June 2020, that covers fishing, transport, law enforcement and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, transport and energy then the UK should begin immediate preparations to trade on WTO Terms.",
