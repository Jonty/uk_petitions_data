Having advertisements in zoos and wildlife organisations that insinuates adoption is a product and a finical transaction is harmful. I have spoken to many people who have stated how these advertisements have triggered emotional upset and confusion for them as adoptees. Organisations have accepted this as an issue but we still see no change.",

Adoption is complex and not a product",
