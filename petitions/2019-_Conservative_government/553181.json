        "additional_details": "This could improve learning and information retention, and also help with the current covid-19 pandemic by reducing time spent at school.\r\n \r\nAnother reason that this change could improve learning, is that countless studies tell us that teenagers biologically have to sleep later, and sleep more. With the current school opening time, students can get less sleep than they need, which can affect how well they can learn.",
        "background": "Scientific research shows that this time in the day is optimal time for students to learn new content. 2pm - 4pm is one of the least effective times, and that can be up to a third of an average school day.",
