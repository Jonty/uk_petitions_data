Teacher predictions have been proven to be overwhelmingly inaccurate, and it would be an injustice to continue awarding grades based on teacher predictions. We propose that previously taken GCSE results are used to predict the A-Level results as they were the last formal exams taken and would lead to more accurate grading.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\nhttps://www.tes.com/news/five-out-six-level-grade-predictions-teachers-are-wrong-study-shows",
        "background": "Last year we saw many students receive less than optimal grading as exams were cancelled. This year we want the government to use each student's past GCSE results when predicting A-Level results as teachers' predictions can be bias and my not reflect the students ability.",
