It is painful to see that people doing the same are put in barracks and military camps that, in so many ways, exacerbate their suffering. All due to the conditions at the barracks and the COVID outbreaks in a place where it is impossible to socially distance.",

We are calling for the government to immediately STOP using these barracks/camps and place asylum seekers in safer, more humane accommodation.",
