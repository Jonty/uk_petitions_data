People already facing a tough time are facing further uncertainty when they fall sick through no fault of their own. It is further exacerbated by the cost of living crisis where costs have risen exponentially. SSP has not risen adequately and needs to be linked to the National Living Wage, and paid from the first day of sickness.",
