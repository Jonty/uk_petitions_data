Drivers are already putting themselves at risk driving between different counties when the UK was in tiers. \r\n\r\nBy delaying drivers being vaccinated this puts more pressure on the driver workforce and ultimately puts more risk to essential goods including food and medication reaching the nation including the elderly and the vulnerable.",
