        "action": "Introduce a compulsory 10% levy on Greyhound Racing profit from bookmakers.",
        "additional_details": "The reason we need this levy is because we want our greyhounds to have the best care possible throughout its whole life and the current 0.6% voluntary levy no where near funds the sport properly. The levy should be used to build vet practices on the site of stadiums to offer the best care possible when they get injured. We should improve racing kennels and make them better than boarding kennels in comfort for the dogs and with better facilities. We also need more funding for when they retire.",
        "background": "Greyhound Racing is a great sport in the United Kingdom but it has been severely underfunded for years. We are asking for a Compulsory 10% levy on the profits bookmakers make from our sport, like the Horse Racing industry has had for years.",
