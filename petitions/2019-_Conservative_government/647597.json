        "action": "Preserve Personal Freedoms: Oppose Further Restrictions on Tobacco Sales",
        "additional_details": "The proposed restrictions on tobacco sales is a stark move towards a nanny state, coercing citizens into a state-dictated lifestyle, undermining our democratic values of personal freedom and choice. Such measures not only infringe on individual liberties but also set a dangerous precedent for governmental overreach. It's imperative that our government resists such overreaches and upholds the principles of personal responsibility and free will that our democracy is built upon.",
        "background": "Sunak's proposal to incrementally ban tobacco sales is an assault on individual freedoms. This plan not only sets a dangerous precedent of state control over personal choices but also aligns the UK with global authoritarian trends. We urge the UK government to reject this overreaching proposal.",
