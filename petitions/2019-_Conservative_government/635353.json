It wastes time during the session, and makes it difficult for the public listening to follow discussion. Importantly, we believe it treats the general public with contempt; a significant lack of respect is shown to the seriousness of topics discussed.\r\n \r\nFor example, on 22/03/2023, there was jeering while discussing crime, violent crime and burglary conviction rates.\r\n",
