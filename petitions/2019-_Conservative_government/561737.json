        "additional_details": "Make unpaid trial shifts illegal. It is slave labour that someone has to partake in unpaid work in order to be offered a job at a facility they applied for. There is a reason that probation periods exist. \r\nIf companies want trial shifts, they have to pay the individual. There needs to be a law that enforces this.",
        "background": "Employers use trial shifts as a way to see if a new employee would like to work for the company, however, employers can use this to their advantage and get slave labour from an individual for a 7 hour shift unpaid. It shouldn\u2019t be allowed to happen. Trial shifts should be paid.",
