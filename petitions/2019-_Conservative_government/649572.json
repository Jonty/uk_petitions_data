        "additional_details": "The land and buildings already purchased for HS2 is to be sold in a 'fire sale' at a potential loss to the taxpayer of \u00a3100 million.\r\n\r\nBut the existing West Coast main line still suffers from chronic overcrowding at various 'pinch points'. A new line - which does not have to be a super-expensive 'High Speed' one - would increase capacity and allow better, more frequent and more reliable commuter and freight trains, taking more polluting cars and lorries off the road.",
        "background": "The Government is poised to sell off land already purchased for HS2 within weeks to prevent future administrations from reversing the decision to cancel HS2 north of Birmingham. This should be put on hold for at least 5 years to allow for a full review and a possible rethink.",
