        "additional_details": "We believe fining without giving drivers a suitable opportunity to pay parking fees is predatory. These fines are often more than 700% of the original charge.\r\nWhere no onsite payment facility (e.g. ticket machines or a ticket barrier) exists, parking operators should be required to issue a written reminder to pay a parking fee, prior to being able to issue a fine. This would help protect individuals for whom English is not a primary language, and those without internet access.\r\n",
        "background": "ANPR systems are often used to issue parking fines for non-payment of parking fees. Charging for parking with no onsite payment provision relies on people noticing, reading and understanding signage, which is normally only in English, having internet access and remembering to pay.",
