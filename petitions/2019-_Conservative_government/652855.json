        "additional_details": "If someone doesn\u2019t have a surviving partner then their child or children will be entitled to inherit the whole estate, and will also be entitled to apply to administer the estate of the deceased. If any child or children are a minor at the time their parent dies then their parent or guardian is responsible for administration of the estate, for the use and benefit of the child. We want this to change, so that in these cases it is the parents of the deceased who are entitled to administer the estate. We believe this would better reflect familial bonds, and in many cases the personal desires of the deceased.",
