        "additional_details": "With housing, food and bills all costing the average student significantly more, one in four students has taken on new debt to fix the widening chasm between their income and expenses. Whilst the government has dedicated additional funds to hardship funding, universities are overwhelmed with demand for support (see https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/oct/20/universities-double-or-triple-student-hardship-funds-in-face-of-soaring-need). Survival should not be the sole focus at university.",
        "background": "From April 2023, both benefits and the state pension will increase by 10.1% - in line with inflation. In contrast, SFE has only increased the maintenance loan provision and the postgraduate loan by 2.8%. This is estimated by Save the Student to leave students \u00a31500 worse off a year.",
