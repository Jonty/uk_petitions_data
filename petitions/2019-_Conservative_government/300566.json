        "additional_details": "We ask the government to consider that higher education is the key for our nation\u2019s future. We need all our young people to be given the same opportunities to access higher education. This should also apply to those already at University as many are struggling. We appeal to others to support this petition",
        "background": "University fees are rising more and more, \u00a39250 for university fees is too high and the stress of being in debt is what puts individuals off applying for degrees. Now that grants have been removed it makes it difficult for family's who need financial support but can't get that anymore",
