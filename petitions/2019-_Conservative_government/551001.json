Currently companies aren't responsible for recycling or disposing the waste they produce, which ends its life in landfill. They should be required to design for a full circle product lifecycle which includes reuse, recycle and disposal. The current system requires citizens to be responsible for recycling, which is hard to enforce and not possible for anything other than common household goods.",
