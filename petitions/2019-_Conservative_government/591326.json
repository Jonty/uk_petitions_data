        "additional_details": "A single vaccine dose has been proved to provide a good protection against covid, especially amongst the younger population. As the single-jabbed population is significantly younger than the average population, this one jab combined with the pre-departure and on-arrival test is a sufficient protection. The younger population shouldn't be discrimated against, and should be granted the same rights to travel as everyone else.",
        "background": "The government is considering a change of rules regarding international travel for fully vaccinated people. However, as not everyone has been invited to receive a second jab, the government should treat single- and double-jabbed individuals alike with respect to international travel.",
