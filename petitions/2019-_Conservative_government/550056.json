        "additional_details": "The economy has dropped 20% and it\u2019s one of the toughest times to find a job right now. Especially when you are in full time education. The maintenance loan does not even take into account that in parts of the U.K. where living costs are higher, salaries tend to be so too. Some students loans aren\u2019t even enough to cover the cost of their accommodation. Students may have to rely on food banks to eat. Allow students to claim for benefits such as universal credit or provide another form of support.",
        "background": "A maintenance loan alone is usually not enough to live on. Some students receive less than 4k a year. Provide students extra financial support or raise the maintenance loan. Due to covid-19 it\u2019s near impossible to find a part time job right now and parents are struggling to support their kids.",
