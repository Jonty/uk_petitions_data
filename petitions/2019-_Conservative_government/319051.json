        "additional_details": "Public Sector Key Workers (NHS - Drs, Nurses, Allied Health Professionals, Porters, etc - Police, Armed Forces, Prison Service, Fire Fighters, Civil Servants) contribute selflessly, e.g. during COVID 19.  In the last 10 Yrs, average pay rises for the public sector were typically below inflation.  MP basic salary increased from approx. \u00a365K to \u00a382K over the last 10 Yrs.  Parity, automatically adopting independent pay review recommendations for public sector key workers, would be real applause.",
        "background": "The Govt must ensure Public Sector Key Workers a rewarding pay rise this year, taking account of years of below inflation pay rises and legislate so that the annual pay rise recommendations of the independent pay review bodies are automatically enacted, in the same way that MP\u2019s pay rises are.",
