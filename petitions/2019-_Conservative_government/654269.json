        "additional_details": "GPs have minimal to no training in menopause. Half of their patients will go through menopause and turn to them for help. As it stands, too many women are being turned away, told they need psychological and/or psychiatric help. Put on antidepressants and sent away. These do not help replace depleted hormones. Therefore, every GP should go through mandatory menopause training so more women are given the help and support they need.",
