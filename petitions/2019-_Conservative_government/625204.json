We would like the government to ask two questions: Firstly, should the UK government abandon the 2030 and 2050 targets and Secondly, should we abandon ICE cars in favour of EVs",
        "background": "The matter of 2030 and 2050 should not be resolved by ANY UK government, this is something that affects everybody in all walks of life and we the people should have a say on the matter especially as NO major party differs on what is frankly a lie.",
