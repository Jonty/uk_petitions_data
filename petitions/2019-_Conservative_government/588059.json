        "additional_details": "Those WASPI (Women Against State Pension Inequality) women who expected to receive their pension at 60 and had to wait until 66 should receive compensation equivalent to the \u2018lost\u2019 pension. \r\n\r\nIn 1995, women who were born in the 50s had their retirement age increased from 60 to 65, to take effect between 2010 and 2020, later brought forward to 2018. This change meant those who had already retired when the changes took effect lost out on several years of pension earnings, and were forced to wait longer, with no opportunity to receive a pay-out that they fully deserved. The failures of successive governments to fully compensate and support these women is despicable.",
        "background": "It is time for the Government to do the right thing and provide women affected by 1995 and 2011 Pension Acts who have not yet reached the new state pension age with a non-means-tested bridging pension. ",
