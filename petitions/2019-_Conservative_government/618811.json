This is not acceptable; potentially innocent defendants and victims have their cases postponed; often waiting years for a sexual offence trial. The stress of this delay can cause victims to withdraw from the legal process, which they had to enter through no fault of their own. These strikes will only make this worse. We need the government to do more to help clear the backlog of cases.",
