        "additional_details": "Tattoo studios are one of the most clinical environments. We always wear PPE Even before the pandemic. They have to hold a licence from the local council showing we are following clinical guidelines. We use disinfectant before and after all clients anyway and studios are deep cleaned each day. This is all before coronavirus even became an issue. All artists wear PPE when tattooing also. Opening a pub with a public toilet is most definitely a bigger risk to spread the disease then a tattoo studio",
