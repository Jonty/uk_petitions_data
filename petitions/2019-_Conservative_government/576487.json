Your petition refers to a \"Nuremberg type body\", but it is not clear what this means. Furthermore, it is already against the law for people to be required to undergo medical treatment, including vaccinations. The Coronavirus Act 2020 has not changed this.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, we could accept a petition calling for a public inquiry into the Covid-19 vaccine programme, to explore the issues you set out in your petition.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petition, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nDo not rollout Covid-19 vaccine passports: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/569957"
