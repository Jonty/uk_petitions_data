        "additional_details": "We disagree with the previous view that an extension will cause a safety risk. So, request this is reconsidered for these reasons:\r\n1. Learners are continually reviewing road rules during lessons which is observed during practical tests, negating a safety risk from extending the dates\r\n2. The DVSA is unable to deliver timeous test appointments, and suspended appointments for a considerable period during lockdown, the service for which the certification is valid has therefore not been provided",
        "background": "The validity of pass certificates for theory tests across the UK have been void for long periods over the past 17 months. There is a huge backlog for rescheduling theory tests and booking driving tests. \r\nTo allow the system to catch up, we request that all test expiry dates be extended by 6 months.",
