        "additional_details": "Loud fireworks are currently being used by anyone who purchases them in built-up areas. These are not only being used on Bonfire night or NYE but throughout the year. Loud noises affect not only animals but also those suffering with PTSD with suffering being caused for many people each year. Those needing to sleep due to work shift patters and those with small children also suffer. Perhaps consider quiet fireworks having tax-relief to promote their use should people wish to have home displays.",
