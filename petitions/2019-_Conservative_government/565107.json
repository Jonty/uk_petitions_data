This is so off putting to farmers that we barely grow 900 hectares of hemp.\r\n \r\nHemp contains some THC, and the % is subject to the weather, and this should be factored into rules limiting the allowable % of THC in hemp.",
        "background": "1. Allow farmers to process CBD oil from the hemp plants flower and leaf\r\n2. Reclassify hemp as a crop and allow a free market on hemp products and production\r\n3. Get rid of the licenses currently needed to grow hemp\r\n4. Consider the restrictions on THC levels dependant on weather",
