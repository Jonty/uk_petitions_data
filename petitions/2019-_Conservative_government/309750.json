        "action": "Close down all non-critical construction sites amid the nConv-19 pandemic.",
        "additional_details": "UK is observing social distancing, schools and places where people gather are shut down. While construction sites, bringing together hundreds of workers remain open. Currently, workers are to wash their hands and self-isolate if they have symptoms. This approach isn't sufficient to prevent nConv from spreading as it can be passed-on during the incubation period or by asymptomatic carriers. Thus, common sense dictates that construction sites should also be put on-hold to suppress the pandemic.",
        "background": "It is the governments reasonability to protect us in the wake of the nConv pandemic. Thus, this petition asks the government to implement a lock-down of non-critical construction sites as a way to fulfil its obligation towards the people of the UK. Help to those affected should also be offered.",
