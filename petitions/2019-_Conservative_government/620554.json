        "additional_details": "Spiking is on the rise.\r\n \r\nThe people who carry them out are persistent and creative. When people started using covers for drinks they moved to needles and have begun injecting people in clubs and bars with god knows what in the hope of taking advantage of them later.\r\n \r\nThis issue could continue to grow and become more serious. A minimum sentence for spikers could help prevent this.",
