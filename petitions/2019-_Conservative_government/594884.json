        "additional_details": "Our war memorials need no explaining. But \"Retain and Explain\" is unwittingly facilitating a politically driven rewrite of our history, giving editorial control to politicians and activists. No one owns the \"correct\" interpretation of history and no one should be able to imprint theirs on our public spaces. Interpretation should be kept flexible, with debate encouraged via books, articles and essays. Controlling history is not the job of politicians. Leave the public to make their own minds up.",
        "background": "Councils like Newcastle are now reviewing war memorials and adding plaques to \"reinterpret\" them. It\u2019s clear they can't be trusted to keep their politics out of our memorials. The Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government must step in and stop them adding boards or plaques to our statues.",
