        "action": "Temporary reduction in state pension age to allow over 60s the option to retire.",
        "additional_details": "To temporarily reduce the age a person can claim their pension, even by a couple of years is a practical and sincere way to drastically help in the effort against Covid19 by giving the more vulnerable over 60s an option to retire early should they wish to. This will also free up thousands of jobs for those who are now out of work due to the economic turmoil caused by Covid19. If done tactfully this investment could solve multiple issues.",
        "background": "To reduce the age people can claim their stare pension to 60, under emergency measures, giving the vulnerable a financially viable option to retire early and shelter from Covid19.  This will have an added bonus of creating vacancies to get thousands of younger people back into work after job losses.",
