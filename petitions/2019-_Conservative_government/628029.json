        "additional_details": "Currently, if a person makes an offer on my property for sale, and I accept it, the buyer can pull out of the sale for any reason. Depending of the amount of time elapsed, I would have instructed solicitors who would have done background work and prepared legal documents. In the event of my buyer pulling out, I am financially responsible for all of the costs incurred by my solicitor up to that point. This is unjust. This situation does not happen with Scottish law.",
        "background": "Current laws surrounding the sale and purchase of domestic properties are old and unsuitable for the 21st. century housing market. They are unfair, and allow for buyers to 'pull out' of a purchase without penalty, costing sellers thousands of pounds in fees, which they will have to pay again.",
