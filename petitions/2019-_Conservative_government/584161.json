        "additional_details": "A Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) is a formal conservation designation that describes an area that\u2019s of particular interest to science due to the rare species of fauna or flora it contains. \r\n\r\nSSSIs often contain important habitats such as grasslands, parkland and woodland. Some even contain ancient woodland and ancient trees. In other words, these areas have high conservation value and need to be protected.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of other sites where people can walk their dogs. Not SSSIs.",
        "background": "SSSIs have been left reeling from the damage caused by an increased number of visitors to them as a result of lockdown restrictions being eased, combined with warmer weather. Ground nesting birds and rare plants have been disturbed and trampled by dogs, while the sites are littered with dog mess.",
