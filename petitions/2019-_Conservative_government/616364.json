But instead give them a \u2018period day\u2019 where if a woman starts her period and is in unbearable pain the company can let her go home with a \u2018period day\u2019 and not to worry about going home and losing her job.\r\nSuffering with unbearable period pains where it comes to the point you can hardly walk is an illness and can\u2019t be helped companies need to recognise it\u2019s a condition",

This lead me unable to do the work.Women don\u2019t get taken seriously when they tell their employer that their in pain due to their period&need to go home",
