        "additional_details": "The price of diesel and petrol is at an 8-year-high. While the people are accepting the conversion to electric vehicles, the anticipated 30% + rise in fuel costs along with the price of new electric vehicles is a strain for the UK public. We believe people may understand to a degree the need for tax following the pandemic however prices of \u00a31.50 or more per litre will cancel out any understanding. The Government has the ability to sacrifice some revenue to appease the British public.",
