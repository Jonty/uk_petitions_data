        "additional_details": "This man did so much for the war effort that he deserves to be awarded this medal even posthumously. We the undersigned agree with the late King George VI in his assessment that Paddy should receive this award, regardless of any reasons why he was never awarded it in the first place. \r\n\r\nThis government has a chance to rectify the error made years ago by awarding this long overdue medal now, so that his family and the whole of the British Isles can share in their admiration for what he did.",
        "background": "The Irishman, Robert Blair \u201cPaddy\u201d Mayne must rank among the most courageous and significant heroes of the Second World War. Yet he has never been awarded the VC. \r\n\r\nEven King George at the time could not understand why this was the case and it was downgraded to a DSO.",
