        "additional_details": "The government has clearly failed in every aspect of their preparation and response to Covid19. They have consistently u-turned on every scientific advice they initially proposed, the British public have been disappointingly let down by their leaders. The generations to come are going to severely be affected throughout their lives due to the incompetent actions of ministers, the government has continuously maintained that they managed this crisis successfully, which is delusional.",
        "background": "The government and parliament should investigate into why there was so many mass failings into how they responded and prepared for Covid 19 costing more then 27000+ lives and counting. According to the scientific advice 20,000 deaths would have been a good outcome, who made these bad decisions?",
