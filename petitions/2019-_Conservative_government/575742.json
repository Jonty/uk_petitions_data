        "additional_details": "People with other lifelong conditions receive joined-up healthcare provision and a clear care pathway, so why not adults with cerebral palsy?  \r\n\r\nSimply adopting the NICE guidelines would be life-changing for 130,000 UK adults with CP and, it\u2019s estimated, would boost the economy to the tune of \u00a3422mn by helping people stay healthy and stay in work.\r\n\r\nWe just want Care Parity for CP. \r\n\r\nPlease sign the petition and convince the government to do the right thing.",
        "background": "When people living with cerebral palsy reach 18, the joined-up healthcare they've received stops. This is wrong.\r\n\r\nWe want the government to adopt the NICE guidelines so when people with CP become adults, their care doesn't \u2018fall off a cliff\u2019. They are being treated like Second Class Citizens.",
