        "additional_details": "As we all know, Coronavirus is getting much worse and hospitals are overwhelmed by the volume of expected cases, so paramedics are sometimes made to wait outside the hospital in the back of an ambulance for up to 6 hours with potentially infected patients. They then go to other emergency jobs and home to their families at the end of their shifts putting everyone at risk. Why is this not as important as care homes which are so contained and still not allowing visitors in for extra safety?",
        "background": "Save our frontline heroes and prioritise them for the Coronavirus vaccine. On a daily basis, paramedics travel from home to home saving the lives of people all over the country so why is it that they aren\u2019t in the top of the list for the vaccine?",
