        "additional_details": "In dark times people need something to lift their spirits, something to look forward to and create a sense of togetherness. Sport is a powerful vehicle that can achieve that while giving the nation a sense of normality and enjoyment in one of our favourite past times safely, from home. The events can be a platform to share positive endeavours, like the achievements of Captain Tom and others raising money, and most importantly celebrate the people who gave their lives for our nation together.",
        "background": "We would like government to allow the conclusion of the Premier League's football season. In signing this petition, we recognise the risks associated with mass gatherings and will do our part to prevent further infections by staying home to watch the matches aired and not congregate with other fans.",
