        "additional_details": "If schools are closed less people will die and the disease wont spread as much. Education will always be there however people only live once, so would it be smart to risk your life for something which can be redone however much times you want? Many children live with elderly which puts not just them in risk way but puts there career in risk way. The onely logical response is to close schoool until this virus is tooken care of.",
        "background": "We want the goverment to leave schools closed till the end of they year. We want this to happen becuase covid-19 has become a big thing killing over 1000 people each day. By allowing the students to go school you are putting them into risk and danger.",
