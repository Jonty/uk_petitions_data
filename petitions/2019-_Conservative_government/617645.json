        "additional_details": "In 2019 the Prime Minister committed to accepting all Grenfell Inquiry recommendations. In order to safeguard the lives of Disabled people, it is vital that the PEEPs recommendation is implemented.\r\n\r\n40% of Disabled residents died in the fire. No residents had evacuation plans in place. Fire safety experts support the implementation of PEEPs. Most evacuation plans are simple and cost free. An evacuation aid may be needed but the cost of this is proportionate to the cost of a life.",
        "background": "Implement the Grenfell Tower Inquiry (Phase 1) recommendation to put a legal obligation on building owners and managers to implement Personal Emergency Evacuation Plans (PEEPs) for Disabled residents who cannot self-evacuate due to reasons such as mobility or cognition.",
