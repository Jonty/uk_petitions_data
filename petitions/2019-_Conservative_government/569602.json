NHS staff were consented for the vaccination on this basis but now the second dose interval has been delayed until 12 weeks - this is now \u201coff license\u201d. For the general population who can shield and distance this may be appropriate but NHS staff who must walk towards the risk for the benefit of others are at disproportionate risk. Using NHS staff to shore up the presentation of this policy is an abuse.",
