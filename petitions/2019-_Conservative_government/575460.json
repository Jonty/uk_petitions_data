        "additional_details": "Many chronic asthmatics have found the last year to be challenging, dealing with the anxiety of catching Covid-19, a severe acute respiratory disease. Now, just a few short weeks away from being eligible to receive the vaccine, this has been taken away by the announcement on 15th February.\r\n\r\nThis means asthmatics who need to take daily steroid medication via an inhaler who are under 50 will now have to wait until the autumn for any degree of protection, putting them at unnecessary risk",
        "background": "Asthmatics needing daily inhaled steroids should be included in priority 6 (16-65 year olds in an at risk group) to protect them from Covid-19. On 15 Feb, the Government said only asthmatics on oral/liquid steroids or who\u2019ve had emergency hospital admission for asthma will be eligible in priority 6",
