        "action": "Close non-essential shops and takeaways during lockdown.",
        "additional_details": "The Government should close all unessential stores for example Starbucks etc. To protect the public and staff. Staff should receive furlough pay so they can stay at home and follow the lockdown rules as well as the customers.\r\nDoing this should contribute to the decrease of the infection rate and keep employees and customers safe. Meaning non essential shops can reopen sooner when it is safe to do so.",
        "background": "Some non-essential businesses are still open putting staff members and customers at risk of catching and potentially spreading the virus. \r\nEven with PPE and social distancing measures in place the volume of customers is dangerous and it encourages people to break lockdown rules.",
