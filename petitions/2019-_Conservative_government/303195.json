        "additional_details": "I have personal experiences with LGBT+phobia and most of these interactions have been out of ignorance. However, as an LGBT+ person, I have felt alienated due to these treatments. Introducing this education can help dismantle stereotypes, raise awareness and acceptance for different people on the LGBT+ spectrum and can help LGBT+ students feel safer and more accepted in schools. The government should consult LGBT+ people and groups in order to correctly implement this into the curriculum.",
        "background": "February is the UK's month for LGBT+ history, and yet barely anything is heard about. Students in LGBT+ minorities must be protected from discriminatory harassment and one measure that can be taken to prevent this discrimination is to educate others out of ignorance and introduce LGBT+ education.",
