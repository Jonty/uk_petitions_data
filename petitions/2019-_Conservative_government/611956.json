        "additional_details": "There could be some issues about support for Ukraine, in the light of the invasion by Russia, perhaps. However, rumours/speculation about Ukraine or its leaders might not be warranted - that might be pure Russian propaganda. So, this proposal is a much more general one. A new law should be framed in a very general way, to try to ensure that the UK will not unwittingly support people who do not warrant it. Basic checks on, e.g. women\u2019s rights, racism and LGBT equality will eliminate most risk.",
        "background": "Before offering any form of military support -  whether direct engagement of military personnel, or weapons/equipment, or consultancy or provision of tactical data - the government must make enquiries about the group to whom support is offered. Support for general equality and rule of law required.",
