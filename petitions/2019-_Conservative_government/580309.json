        "action": "Make sexual education compulsory up to 18, including focuses on consent",
        "additional_details": "When 97% of women have experienced sexual harassment of one form or another, it is clear that the problem is systemic. It is therefore crucial to educate young people - particularly males - about the meaning of consent and general sexual awareness. As a student, I had very few lessons about consent, none of which were at an relevant time or presented as serious. It is vital that students learn about consent as soon as possible and have it ingrained into them in order to avoid reaching 98%.",
        "background": "I would like it to be made compulsory, that sexual education is taught in secondary schools right from year 7 to the end of year 13 (e.g. one hour a fortnight). Additionally, in these a great focus should be placed on the meaning of consent and providing details about support networks available.",
