        "additional_details": "The Warnock Report (1978) introduced 'special educational needs' to identify a child needing extra or different support. In 2014 the SEND Code of Practice introduced major reform which aimed to be less confrontational, raise aspirations and fully involve children & families. However, in continuing to use the outdated term 'SEND', members of the Birmingham Youth Forum believe they are negatively discriminated against and not treated equally in relation to their additional educational needs.",
        "background": "The Birmingham Youth Forum propose that the use of \u201cSpecial Educational Needs\u201d in the Children & Families Act (2014) and Code of Practice (2015) is outdated. It does not accurately describe provision that many children need. It should be replaced with the more appropriate term \u201cadditional needs\u201d.",
