        "additional_details": "We believe the frequency of digital ads has become overwhelming, particularly impacting children's online experiences. Excessive advertising can disrupt learning and recreational activities and contribute to unhealthy consumer habits. By limiting ad frequency on platforms used by children, the Government can help safeguard their online experiences, promoting healthier digital habits and ensuring a safer and more balanced online environment for our youngest digital citizens.",
        "background": "We call for legislation limiting the frequency of adverts on digital platforms commonly used by children. There should be mandated minimum intervals between ads and a cap on total ad time per hour, to protect children from excessive commercial exposure.",
