        "additional_details": "Saving Freeview will prevent millions of older people being excluded from public information and entertainment, and thus increased loneliness and depression. Relying on internet-based TV and radio would be less reliable and more costly. People are already abandoning streaming services because of the cost -of-living crisis. However, there is a danger that streaming services will be given priority, squeezing out Freeview. ",
        "background": "Digital and Terrestrial TV (Freeview) and Radio is only secure for about ten years, despite millions relying on it to keep in touch. At the 2023 World Radio Communication Conference, the UK must argue for a longer life for Freeview and a 'no change' position in the frequency allocated to it.",
