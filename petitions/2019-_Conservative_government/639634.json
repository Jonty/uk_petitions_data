        "additional_details": "Section 5 of this Act makes it an offence to use threatening or abusive words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour, within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby. We want this repealed, as it is based on the potential to cause offence.\r\n \r\nSection 4a of this Act makes it an offence to, with intent to cause a person harassment, alarm or distress, use threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour that causes another person harassment, alarm or distress. We want this amended so that on duty police officers cannot be treated as victims of this offence.\r\n \r\nThis Act should also be amended to include a definition of \"abusive or insulting\" words, so that it is clear when someone should be arrested.\r\n",
        "background": "We believe the current offences set out in the Public Order Act 1986 allow the unfair arrest of people by the police for saying things that are likely to cause offence, or that offend on duty police officers rather than members of the public. We want this legislation amended to protect free speech.",
