Therefore our future generation will endure the depletion of their mental health, hence causing them to confide within unnecessary, illegal doings (I.e drugs). Sooner or later, the current government will be bereaved and it will be left to the current schooling generation to manage the country. If only a minimal number of students can handle the real life issues, the country would lose all wealth.",

Not just a matter in PSHE lessons of which is briefly\r\ncovered. An example of a topic within the subject would be managing financial issues.",
