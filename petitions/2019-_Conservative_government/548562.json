        "additional_details": "We should be able to go for walks, swim, picnic and exercise, without having to encounter used face coverings that not only make the immediate area unpleasant, but could potentially cause harm, both to people as well as wildlife.\r\nI feel that a fine should be imposed on people caught discarding their face coverings in this way. Fines should be fixed penalties, say \u00a3100, doubling each time, up to a maximum, of say, \u00a33200, every time a person is in breach of this rule.",
        "background": "Since the mandating of face covers, it has become apparent that some people are discarding their face coverings in an anti social manner. I have visited beaches, forests, parks and many other areas, both urban and rural, and have been disgusted at the total disrespect shown to the environment.",
