        "additional_details": "British theatre is a world-renowned cultural and economic force. It forms part of the fabric of British life. From school trips, to Shakespeare in the West End, to the yearly family pantomime outing in the village hall, theatres nationwide attract annual audiences of 34 million. Where would we be without it? \r\n\r\nTo protect the industry, the furlough and self-employed schemes must be extended for as long as required. We need the UK government to act now to save theatre from its final curtain.",
        "background": "Theatres all over Britain are on the verge of total collapse. Whilst other industries are gradually able to reopen with social distancing, theatres cannot. When furlough support ends, the theatre industry will fold. We must act now by petitioning the government for longer term support.",
