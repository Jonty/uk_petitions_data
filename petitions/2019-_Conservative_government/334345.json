        "additional_details": "The people of Lebanon do not have confidence in their institutions to deliver justice. The Lebanese judiciary is mired in allegations of corruption and incompetence, as evidenced by various international organisations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. There is a risk that the investigation conducted by the authorities leads to the scapegoating of lower ranking employees without bringing those actually responsible to justice.",
        "background": "We call on the UK government to push for the establishment of an international investigation into the Beirut Port blast of the 4th of August 2020 that claimed the lives of around 200 people. This can be done via a UN Security Council which the UK could propose as a permanent member.",
