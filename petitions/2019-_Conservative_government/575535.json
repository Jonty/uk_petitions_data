        "additional_details": "People with asthma severe enough to be on inhaled steroids and/or prescription anti-histamines and immune suppressants (Montelukast etc) are already recognised as a vulnerable group and have been advised by the NHS to be especially careful. This also leads to increased mental health issues especially anxiety. 2-3 million vulnerable severe asthmatics have been removed from the priority 6 group and it is a fine line between a particular doctor prescribing oral steroids or alternative measures.",
        "background": "Severe asthma suffers who are already accepted as vulnerable and take inhaled steroids, but are not on oral steroids and shielding, have just been removed from Priority group 6 for the covid-19 vaccine. Covid-19 is a respiratory condition and covid-19 is a respiratory disease.",
