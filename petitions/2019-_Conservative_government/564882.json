        "additional_details": "There are two key reasons why such a licence should be introduced.\r\n \r\nThe first is to help curb trolling and troll behaviour amongst social media platforms, by enabling action to be taken against holders of accounts engaged in such activity.\r\n \r\nThe second is to allow authorities to quickly contact those in need of assistance whether it be domestic issues or mental health.\r\n \r\nNot establishing protections such as this will mean that troll activity goes unaddressed and many may not receive the support they need.",
        "background": "The Government should create social media licences that must be required to create an account on social media platforms.\r\n \r\nThe licence would contain some basic user information that can be retrieved by the relevant authorities in a case deemed as an emergency.",
