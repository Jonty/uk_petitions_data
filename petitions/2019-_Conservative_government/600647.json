We need to stop the sale of fireworks to control the bangs and displays to just organised larger displays when we know they timings. We can then take our pets away from the area whilst they go off. Or make sure our animal or pet is comfortable and feels safe. My dog had a 3 hour panic attack tonight and it\u2019s just not fair on them.",
