        "additional_details": "Heating and hot water account for 20% of UK greenhouse gas emissions.  Low carbon heating and home insulation can minimise this, but are too expensive for many people.  \r\n\r\nAt current installation rates it will take 700 years to reach every UK home.  Demand for these grants has already outstripped installer capacity, but potential new installers are finding it difficult to justify training costs for returns over just 6 months.  \r\n\r\nThis scheme must be extended to grow jobs and help the climate.",
        "background": "This scheme was introduced to boost the post-COVID economy and combat climate change but it only runs from October 2020 to March 2021, severely limiting who benefits.  We call on the government to extend the Green Homes scheme for 5 years or until 90% of homes have low carbon heating.",
