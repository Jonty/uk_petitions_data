        "additional_details": "Above-inflation pay rises have been announced for teachers, doctors, police, prison officers, National Crime Agency staff, members of the judiciary, armed forces and senior civil servants while nurses and healthcare assistants will receive nothing. \r\nWhile all are deserving, it is incredibly upsetting that nursing and care staff apparently don't count.\r\nWe shouldn't have to explain why they deserve the same recognition, it should go without saying.",
        "background": "After months of putting their own lives on the line to save those suffering from COVID-19 (including our Prime Minister), the exclusion of nursing and care staff is nothing short of an insult. It shows a blatant disregard for the vital work they do every day. Please raise their pay.",
