        "additional_details": "While the national curriculum aims to teach pupils 'how Britain has influenced and been influenced by the wider world\u2019, there is still much omitted from Britain\u2019s colonial history.\r\n\r\nBy making the teaching of these past injustices mandatory in secondary schools we can change attitudes towards Black, Asian, and minority ethnic groups. We believe this will greatly contribute to effectively preventing the continuance of systematic racism, laying a firm foundation for an anti-racist society.",
        "background": "We wish to include specific historical events caused in part by actions of the British Empire (1600s-1997) in the national curriculum, for example, slave ownership and trade, famine in British territories resulting the death of millions, and violent reaction to uprisings against British authority.",
