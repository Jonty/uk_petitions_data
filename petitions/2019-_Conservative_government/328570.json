        "additional_details": "Many women seldom get the medical attention they require, or frequently have their symptoms miscalculated.\r\n\r\nDue to personal experience, we are aware that the average time taken for a full diagnosis for endometriosis is 7 1/2 years in the UK.\r\n\r\nA cure for these conditions has not yet been found.\r\nIt is important to us to start a conversation, to hopefully achieve funding to eventually find a cure for these conditions, or find more legitimate ways of treating symptoms.",
        "background": "Endometriosis and PCOS are two gynaecological conditions which both affect 10% of women worldwide, but both are, in terms of research and funding, incredibly under prioritised. This petition is calling for more funding, to enable for new, extensive and thorough  research into female health issues.",
