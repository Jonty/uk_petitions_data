        "additional_details": "I believe there is a national crisis regarding SEND school places. SEND education needs more funding so that local authorities are able to build more specialist SEND schools. There are so many families nationally with children that have no specialist SEND schools locally. This isn\u2019t something new, This is a crisis that\u2019s been going on for many years & there\u2019s not enough funding in many areas. I believe that the Government need to look into this and make more funds available to help with SEND Education, so families that have children with special needs/disabilities are able to get a specialist school setting for their children they deserve without having to fight for a place.",
