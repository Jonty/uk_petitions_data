        "action": "Introduce mandatory education on politics to the secondary curriculum.",
        "additional_details": "Given the current, very turbulent state of politics, both in the UK and out, I feel that young people should be educated on the political world at large. This should include the systems both in the UK and globally and their respective political processes; and how politicians garner support, from whom and why. Educating young people on these matters could, in my opinion, lessen the division we see in modern politics, and should seek to create a less hostile environment for discussion.",
        "background": "The Government should introduce politics education to the secondary curriculum, with it being treated in much the same way as Religious Education, so that young people have a firm understanding of how the country is run, by whom and in which ways the public influence the decision making process.",
