        "additional_details": "UK citizens living and working in Qatar need to be able to visit their families and friends in UK without having to complete the mandatory hotel quarantine provided they have received both doses of the vaccine. Qatar airways has offered to fly fully vaccinated flights which was rejected by UK government and in addition Hamad International Airport (Doha) has taken every precaution to ensure all available safety measures are available at the airport including huge investment in new safety tech",
        "background": "UK citizens living and working in Qatar are issued 30 calendar days vacation from their employer. Mandatory hotel quarantine for 10 days uses up 1/3 of our allocated vacation days. As Qatar has one of the lowest C-19 death rates in the world and low daily cases it should be on the green list",
