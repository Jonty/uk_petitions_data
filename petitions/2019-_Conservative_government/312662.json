        "action": "Extend the Job Retention Scheme to UK citizens employed by overseas companies",
        "additional_details": "The Government should extend the blanket of the Job Retention Scheme and cover all UK citizens, regardless of where their employer is based. These individuals that are missed by the scheme contribute to society and should be eligible for the governments help in these difficult times. One key example of this shortfall in the scheme is oil and gas workers. Many of these key workers, as outlined by the Government, are not eligible as many are employees of international companies based out with the UK.",
        "background": "I believe the Job Retention Scheme set out by the Government does not go far enough to cover all UK citizens. In the current policy a UK citizen who contributes Tax and NI through PAYE in the UK and is placed on furlough by his overseas employer, is not eligible for help under the scheme.",
