I\u2019m asking that you give small businesses the opportunity to grow without the worry about having to register for VAT.\r\n\r\nCurrently the VAT threshold is \u00a385k. For a small business with only 5/6 employees, \u00a385k is not a lot at all, especially when it is based on turnover & not profit.\r\n\r\nI want this changing so it is based on profit & not turnover.\r\n\r\nThis is the biggest worry for small business owners.\r\n\r\nPlease help.",
