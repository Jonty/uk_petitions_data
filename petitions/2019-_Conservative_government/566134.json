        "additional_details": "Many children and students have missed a significant amount of education in 2020, leaving many lacking the confidence to perform to the best of their abilities, in particular, students who face exams in 2021. Whilst parents understand the need to protect their children and the wider community from the spread of Covid19, they also feel strongly that education has suffered as a result. In the name of fairness all students should be put back one year to allow the opportunity to recover lost work.",
        "background": "Due to reduced education in 2020 as a result of Covid19, all schools and universities should be put back one academic year.",
