        "additional_details": "A \u2018Castle Doctrine\u2019 designates a person's place of residence as a place in which he or she enjoys protection from illegal trespassing and violent attack. It should give that person the legal right to use deadly force to defend that place and any other innocent persons legally inside it, from violent attack or an intrusion which may lead to violent attack. Use of force which actually results in the death of an intruder should be classed as self-defence under this Castle Doctrine. The Castle Doctrine would give homeowners a clear legal definition of what is acceptable, and would surely swing the legal balance to favour the homeowner rather than the criminal.",
        "background": "The UK Government should introduce a \u2018Castle Doctrine\u2019 law which gives homeowners the guarantee they will not be prosecuted or subject to civil action for using any force up to and including deadly force to protect themselves, their loved ones or their property from illegal trespass.",
