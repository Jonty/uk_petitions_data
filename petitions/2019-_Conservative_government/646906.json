        "additional_details": "The Government has already reneged on its manifesto when it legislated to increase state pensions by less than the triple lock in April 2022.\r\n \r\nThe triple lock does not mean that pensioners' total incomes are increasing in real terms. It only applies to state pensions. Many workplace pension increases are capped at 2.5% or 5%. Annuities and Pension Protection Fund compensation are frozen for many.\r\n \r\nThe triple lock helps keep pensioners' total incomes from falling too far below inflation.",
        "background": "The Conservative party's manifesto promised to keep the triple lock. This increases state pension by the highest of inflation, wage growth or 2.5%. Headline wage growth was 8.5% in May to July 2023, but there is speculation that Government might use a lower figure. The full increase should apply.",
