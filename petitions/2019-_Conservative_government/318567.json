I would like this to start at least by August.\r\n\r\nMany brides have spent endless time on planning their big special day and spent a large amount of money. Letting weddings go ahead will bring joy and happiness to those whose day is upcoming. Many brides have had to postpone their wedding due to covid19 and i think by letting weddings and their reception night do go ahead with limited amount of people of 120 would bring a lot of happiness and it would be a lifting spirit and encourage people that we are going in the right direction",
