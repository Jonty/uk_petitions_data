        "additional_details": "Many of oversea students have missed the hiring season in the spring due to COVID, coupled with the current dismal job market, it is much harder for us to land a job within 4 months. And our transport options to get home are restricted as flights are drastically reduced. It is also not safe to take long haul flights. \r\nWith a 3-month visa extension till the end of April, International graduates can either continue the job searching or plan our trips home with less anxiety and greater safety.",
        "background": "Due to the COVID outbreak, many oversea students have suffered disruptions in their studies and careers, and experienced mental distress in the face of bleak career prospects and an uncertain future. We request the government to extend our visa by three months as a humanitarian gesture.",
