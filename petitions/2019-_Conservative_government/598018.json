        "additional_details": "We have seen first hand and through the research that we have done how the stress of exams harm our peers and the wider student community. We believe the standard of education they get isn't as effective due to the fact that teachers are pressured to focus on attaining the highest exam results possible rather than giving their students a well rounded and happy education. The welbeing of students often gets forgotten during exam years and schools are not equipped to offer them with the help that they need.",
        "background": "Review the way we approach standardised testing in England and remove exams for young students and let their everyday work and their teachers determine their grades and measure their progress. This should not only reduce stress but make it easier for teachers to spot weaknesses and help to fix them.",
