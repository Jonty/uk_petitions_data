Schools and other educational settings are now being opened up more widely, but if you want the Government to explicitly add youth workers to the list of workers who are entitled to access schools or educational settings during the outbreak you could start a petition about this.\r\n\r\nIf you want the Government to take some other action in respect of youth workers, you could start a petition about this, but would need to be clear exactly what action you want the Government to take."
