        "action": "Increase the UK Category B driving licence Maximum Authorised Mass to 4,500Kg",
        "additional_details": "Many modern vehicles have lower payloads than older vehicles, because of new safety and emission requirements. An increase in MAM for Category B could lead to fewer vehicles on the road and increase productivity. It could also reduce Category C applications for drivers who have no intention of operating a lorry.",
        "background": "The Government should increase the MAM on a Category B driving licence to 4,500Kg. I believe the Department for Transport's proposal to raise the MAM for alternatively-fuelled vehicles is too complicated and will lead to anomalies & confusion for drivers with Category B entitlement.",
