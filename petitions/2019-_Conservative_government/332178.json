It is very easy for someone to say the can\u2019t wear any sort of covering and not been challenged. For the safety of people, a system needs to be put in place to prevent accusations of discrimination. We are in the middle of a pandemic and this virus does not discriminate. With shielding being paused, these measures need tighter guidelines to protect everyone.",
        "background": "Due to the number of people claiming they can\u2019t use a face covering, the government should issue an official exemption based on individual medical evidence. Having spent the last 4 months shielding, it is important that as many people are using face coverings and social distancing whilst we are out.",
