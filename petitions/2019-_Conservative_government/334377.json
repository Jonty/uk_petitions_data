        "additional_details": "The performing arts have suffered hugely as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Socially-distanced audiences are not a viable business model for many theatres - who face massive loss of income. \r\n\r\nMany theatres have cancelled their pantomime, which generates a large proportion of their annual income. \r\n\r\nBy launching a subsidised ticket scheme on Monday-Wednesday performances, the Government could both kickstart the theatre sector but also boost economic activity in towns across the UK.",
        "background": "We\u2019re calling on Government to launch a \u201cVisit a Theatre, To Help Out\u201d scheme similar to the initiative that has helped the hospitality sector. By subsidising theatre tickets when social-distancing restrictions are relaxed, the Govt could kickstart the theatre sector and boost recovery.",
