        "additional_details": "The UK is thought to have more than one million potholes. Councils sometimes claim to not have enough funding to meet the repair demand. Roads can be left in a dangerous condition posing a high risk to network users, and impacting on our quality of life. I think the government needs to plug the funding gap and at the same time hold the council's to account by implementing strict repair targets that result in financial penalties, by way of a rebate to tax payers if they are not met.",
        "background": "I want the government to increase funding to local councils for pothole repairs. I also want the government to put in place strict repair targets that if councils fail to meet then council tax payers will be entitled to a rebate.",
