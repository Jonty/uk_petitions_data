        "additional_details": "The American Bully was recognised as a breed by the US United Kennel Club in 2013.\r\nThe org calls it a \u201cnatural extension\u201d of the American Pit Bull Terrier that\u2019s been crossbred with breeds including the American Bulldog, English Bulldog and Olde English Bulldogge.\r\n\r\nIn May 2023, Jonathan Hogg was killed by an XL Bully. Weeks before, baby Tillie Mai Fox was attacked and almost killed by an American Bully. \r\n\r\n60% of the dog-related deaths in the UK last year were caused by bully/bully crosses.",
        "background": "The current list of UK banned dogs does not currently include bully or bully cross breeds, which are increasingly involved in fatal or near fatal attacks on people. \r\nThe Government should review dog attack statistics associated with this breed, and take action to prevent further death or injuries.",
