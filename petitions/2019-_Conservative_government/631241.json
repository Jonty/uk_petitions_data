Too many people have little to no experience outside of highly polluted walkways and paths, with little to no opportunity to see the beauty of the night sky. Many children have not seen the night sky in absence of light pollution before. The recent overturning of the right to roam on Dartmoor in favour of the privileged is unfair, and will only reduce these opportunities.",
