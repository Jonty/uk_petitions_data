        "additional_details": "Its goal is to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.\r\n \r\nI am asking the Government to pull out of this agreement.\r\n \r\nI believe the government has been spending too much money on providing cleaner energy, which is a problem when the national deficit is too high. An example is subsidies to those building wind turbines. I believe this Paris agreement is influencing road taxes for car users as the Government tries to meet its climate goals. Also, businesses may face higher taxes, later on, to pay back the national deficit. I believe that to improve our economy and financial well-being we need to pull out of the Paris agreement.",
