I shared the story with our online following only to receive an overwhelming amount of responses sharing the same experiences. \r\nOff leash dogs should not be allowed to approach on leash dogs - in any area.\r\nOwners should respect another owners request to keep dogs away and leash them.  \r\nIntroduce muzzle requirements where applicable.",

We need to create safe, considerate and respectful environments for our dogs and owners. \r\nTo reduce to attacks, unsafe interactions, stressful and triggering scenarios for our dogs. Those in training, reactive, rescued and puppy\u2019s deserve this.",
