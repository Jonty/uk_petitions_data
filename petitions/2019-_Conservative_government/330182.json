        "additional_details": "After Cecil the lion was killed in 2015, there was a push in the UK to take a stance on trophy hunting. Five years on and no action has been taken.\r\n\r\nIn 2019, the government explored plans to implement a ban on trophy hunting imports. The ban has yet to come about. \r\n\r\nThe number of lions in Africa has decreased from over 200,000 to less than 15,000 over the past 50 years. Australia, France and the Netherlands have already banned lion trophy imports; the UK should follow suit with a blanket ban.",
        "background": "The government need to implement an immediate ban on trophy hunting imports and exports to and from the UK. \r\n\r\nThis is to protect both endangered species and other animals which are hunted abroad for human entertainment. It is a commitment to discourage the cruel culture of hunting.",
