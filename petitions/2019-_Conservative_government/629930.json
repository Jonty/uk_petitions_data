        "additional_details": "It is sensible to plan for the future and support NHS long term. With Health and First Aid being part of the curriculum this could cover a wide range of topics. How to support your own mental health, sexual health and basic first aid. What sort of problems require ambulances or would be better to drive yourself to an urgent treatment centre. PHSCE doesn\u2019t adequately cover this in a useful way. Children should be able to visit 999 call centre or ambulance station or GP surgery to learn more.",
        "background": "To help people to be more independent and lower the strain on the NHS. It would be useful for everyone to have a basic first aid understanding, when they need to see GP or Pharmacy for their problem or when they need to visit A&E. Most importantly everyone should know how to do CPR.",
