        "additional_details": "If legal requirements to self-isolate end many people are unlikely to isolate for seven days voluntarily, and work may not accept testing positive for covid as a reason for absence anymore. People may also be more likely to meet others whilst infectious. Covid spreads easily and many with cancer, diabetes, immune disorders and the elderly will still be at risk if they are infected. Long covid is already devastating and if adequate precautions are not taken could affect far more people.",
