        "additional_details": "This will be the only census released for the next 30 years. 1931 documents were destroyed in a fire & there was no census taken in 1941 so the next census release will not be till 2051. Due to the Covid 19 lockdown many millions of people are isolating at home and need things to occupy themselves. Releasing the 1921 census after exactly 100 years, not 100 years & 7 months would give many people a lot of pleasure searching for thier ancestor histories.",
        "background": "The 1921 census was taken on 19th June 1921. 100 years is over on 20th June 2021 so people should not have to wait a further 7 months for the release.",
