With Education loans to pay back to banks and able to survive in UK without any help is not an ideal situation. Universities have moved to Online studies but it is not what a Student have paid for.\r\nGovt must intervene to provide some support to International students as well and direct all universities to atleast refund 25% of fees.",
        "background": "Education ministry must reduce Bachelors and Master's fees starting Jan 2020 intake for all International students. International students pay double the fee of what UK/EU students pay. It is not fair to International students who do not have any access to work/govt. support during this pandemic.",
