        "additional_details": "The reason why I would like this to be put to Government is because of the risk it could pose to Autistics health.\r\nIt is also goes against all logic to anyone who has any understanding of Autism to assume that Autism is curable.\r\nIt is also offensive and highly ableistic for people to believe that curing Autism is a good idea.",
        "background": "Under current law people can promote and sell cures for Autism. This is not only dangerous as many are selling bleach as a method, but it is false there is enough evidence to prove that Autism can't be cured. I would like for there to be a law put in place which prevents people from selling cures.",
