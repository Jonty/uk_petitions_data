All three countries of the subcontinent are on similar levels of infection cases. Bangladesh and Pakistan went on the red list a month before India. And now India comes off it and the other two nations are still on the red list even though the rate of infections is either lower (Pakistan) or similar (Bangladesh) The government needs to be fair and treat all nations with equal respect and fairness.",
        "background": "Get Bangladesh off the red list. Bangladesh went onto the red list a month before India did even though the latter had exponential rates. India has now come down to the amber list. Do the same for Bangladesh. Infections and deaths are on par in both countries.",
