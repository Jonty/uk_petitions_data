        "additional_details": "Thousands of people are suffering from dental problems that could have been prevented or treated if they had access to free dental care. A poll by YouGov of 1,723 adults in England found almost 23 per cent report delaying or going without NHS dental treatment due to the cost. Some 38 per cent of people polled said dentistry should be fully funded by the Government through general taxation, effectively free at the point of delivery.\r\n \r\nResearch has shown that poor oral health can lead to other serious health issues such as heart disease and diabetes. Free dental care could save the NHS money by reducing these issues and other dental issues.\r\n \r\n",
        "background": "Dental treatment is an essential aspect of healthcare that should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial status. Unfortunately, in England, dental treatment is not free for most people and this has led to a situation where many individuals are unable to access the care they need.",
