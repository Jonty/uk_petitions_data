        "additional_details": "The effects of a 1 year ban can make you dependent on others, affect your employment, and place great stress on your family life. It could also place you in financial debt as well as costing the government in benefits if it affects your career. I believe a 1 year ban demoralises you and makes you feel like a criminal. Law abiding drivers suffering from medical conditions consider the safety of others. Please sign this petition to reduce 1 year bans on reapplying for your license down to 3 months.",
        "background": "Drivers in the UK who have medical conditions are expected to inform the DVLA and may have to surrender their driving license for up to 1 year. I believe surrendering your license for 1 year is outdated, and people should be allowed to reapply for their license after three months.",
