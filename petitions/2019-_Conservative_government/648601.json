        "additional_details": "Successive governments have acknowledged the cruel, inhumane and degrading nature of the IPP. There is cross-party support to see IPPs resentenced. The United Nations has recently joined the growing list of supporters. The number of IPP-related suicides increases year-on-year. The number of IPP recalls is increasing. Mental health deterioration among IPPs is increasing. IPP families are breaking down. Ministers need to give the courts the necessary resentencing powers.",
        "background": "As a criminal sanction, Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP) failed. The IPP has been described as inhumane, and as a form of psychological torture. It was poorly drafted and poorly implemented. In 2012, the IPP was abolished. Regretfully, this was not retroactive.",
