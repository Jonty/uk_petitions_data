        "additional_details": "The government should be holding children back a year after the amount of school time these children have missed!! Most of us are struggling being teachers at home. With all the time the children have missed in the last year and still with no end in sight it would make a tremendous amount of sense if you could put all children back a year. For example if your child is in year one now he/she should stay in year one when the children return in September for a new school year!!",
        "background": "Due to Coronavirus the entire country's children have missed roughly six months of school and the days are still adding up with no end in sight!! I would propose that we hold back ALL school children back a year!!",
