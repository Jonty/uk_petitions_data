        "additional_details": "Family visas enable families with foreign members to stay together in the UK, including spouses, parents, children and dependents.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Migration Observatory, the planned surge in income required (more than doubling) will prevent a large portion of family visa applications from being possible, tearing families apart, while hitting lower earners, such as young people, the most. \r\n\r\nFamily visas make up a smaller portion of UK immigration, so these plans are disproportionate and cruel.",
        "background": "Abandon plans to increase the minimum income requirement for family visas; keep it at \u00a318,600 per annum, while abandoning the plans to raise it to \u00a338,600 per annum.\r\n\r\nAct leniently, by ideally freezing the income requirement or otherwise simply adjusting it according to inflation.",
