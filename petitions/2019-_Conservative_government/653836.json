        "additional_details": "LBHF's claim that this is the only way to fund the schools' redevelopment is flawed in many ways. Its own professional study declares the Avonmore plan \"technically unviable\".\r\n\r\nLBHF has not consulted adequately on the disposal of the land and the negative impacts of its repurposing on the whole local community. Its claims of \u2018overwhelming support\u2019 are based on a tiny, one-sided sample. LBHF has ignored petitions and independent surveys showing strong objections from hundreds of local residents.",
        "background": "We call on the Secretary of State for Education to uphold S.77 of the School Standards and Framework Act (which prevents the \u201cdisposal of school playing fields\u201d) so LBHF cannot implement its plans to build high-density housing on the playgrounds of Avonmore Primary and Flora Gardens schools.",
