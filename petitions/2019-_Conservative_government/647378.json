        "additional_details": "I think along with many others that the new British standard educational system is not suitable for our children and young ones. Me and many others think our children will be better of and relieved that they won't have that much stress on their hands in the future. We all want the best for our children and this new system is not it. It is much easier and much more understandable that we have our A levels and T levels separate so that our children can focus more an the things that matter. Thanks",
