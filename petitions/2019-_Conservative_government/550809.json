        "action": "Amend the Internal Market Bill to align it with the EU Withdrawal Agreement",
        "additional_details": "Parliament has passed legislation putting into domestic law the UK's withdrawal from the EU. This withdrawal agreement has been jointly ratified by the EU and the UK and as such is an international agreement to which the UK is a signatory. This week, the Government admitted that its proposed Internal Market Bill would breach the withdrawal agreement. In order to uphold our international commitments, Parliament should amend the Internal Market bill to align it with the withdrawal agreement.",
        "background": "The Government's proposed internal market bill contravenes the EU withdrawal agreement and needs to be amended in order to avoid a scenario in which the UK is in breach of its international commitments. If Parliament cannot amend the bill, it should vote it down.",
