        "additional_details": "Under current regulations, Carer's Allowance is only accessible for individuals who are not in full-time education. Under normal circumstances, many of these students would be living away from their family house. However, after COVID-19, many students are staying at their family homes, with many taking up caring responsibilities for their relatives, without much financial support. This can have a significant impact on them being able to physically and financially support their ailing loved ones.",
