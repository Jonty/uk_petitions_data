        "action": "Uphold current legal protections for transgender individuals and under 18s",
        "additional_details": "The statement regarding the GRA consultation that Liz Truss is prioritising protecting single sex spaces is concerning. The right for trans people to access single sex spaces of their choice has been law for 10 years. The treatment of under 18s is complex but ultimately comes down to a matter of medical ethics, making bodily autonomy central and the matter should be independent of discussions of legal recognition to which the GRA reforms relate.",
        "background": "In light of recent statements by Liz Truss the Government should confirm that the current rights of transgender citizens to access public life will be upheld and that the bodily autonomy of under 18's seeking transition related healthcare will be upheld.",
