        "action": "Ban the use of netting as a deterrent for birds",
        "additional_details": "In many towns and cities buildings and bridges have netting on them to prevent birds nesting or perching. This netting can deteriorate and birds can become trapped and die. It is illegal to cause animal suffering under the Animal Welfare Act 2006, yet use of this netting can mean birds suffer time and again. We want the Government to ban netting as a deterrent use on building and bridges and anywhere else it may be used in this capacity.",
        "background": "Many birds get tangled up and caught in netting that is used as a deterrent on buildings and bridges. These birds can die a slow, long death of their injuries or from starvation. We want netting banned as a deterrent.",
