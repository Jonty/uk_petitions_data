        "additional_details": "Since the Paris Agreement, fossil fuel projects accounted for 96% of overseas energy investment. This annual spending of \u00a30.85B almost equals that promised in the \u201cTen Point Plan\u201d (the Government\u2019s  key climate strategy) and this investment must stop now. Strong international policy is desperately needed and we implore the Government to accelerate it\u2019s commitments.\r\n\r\nGovernment Announcement: shorturl.at/mMU48\r\nProjects in consideration: shorturl.at/csA36\r\nVideo on climate finance: shorturl.at/cqS67",
        "background": "The Government announced a much needed ban on overseas fossil fuel investment to take effect in July. However, this date must be brought forward to halt the 17 projects poised for approval before then. If just one goes ahead, it would be equivalent to producing the CO2 of 500,000 cars each year.",
