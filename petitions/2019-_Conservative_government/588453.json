They deserve to be free from sexual harrassment and abuse, whether its rumour, name calling or physical assault. Regardless of whether boy or girl, age or race, should feel empowered to report abuse whether during school, outside school or at home. The only way to do this is to educate our children properly.

Teach them respect, equality and to support each other in standing against unacceptable behaviour  and sexual harassment.",
