        "additional_details": "At the 2005 General Election, the All Women Shortlists helped to increase the number of female MPs in Parliament to 128. This was possible thanks to The Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002 that was extended until 2030 by the Equality Act 2010.\r\nAmending the Equality Act 2010, or any other act of parliament to allow political parties to select candidates based on skin colour is thus bound to also increase representation of Black, Asian and other people of colour in British politics.",
        "background": "Recent protests in the UK and around the world are happening because discrimination and acts of injustice based on skin colour are not new.\r\nTrue changes will only happen when the parliament and councils are a true reflection of the diversity in the UK",
