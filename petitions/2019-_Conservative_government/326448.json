        "additional_details": "Our educational structure focused only on a one-sided narrative in regards to slavery. This is creating a culture of victimhood in some communities which is used as an excuse to commit violence, riot and false claims. It's imperative that African and Arab slavery, and African Barbary history, is taught in all schools. The foundation of slavery was created by African kings, a fact often ignored. In 1833 Britain used 40% of its entire budget to buy freedom for white slaves from Barbary pirates.",
