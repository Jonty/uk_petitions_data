        "additional_details": "Year 12 students are at a crucial point in their education, studying for A-Level exams which will determine their futures. Yet, Year 12 have not been given the same level of guidance and certainty as Year 11 and 13 students, and have been completely left out of government schemes such as the Oak National Academy. Students are struggling to study for life-changing exams where, in many cases, online resources are not adequate. The government must act to support Year 12 during this crucial time.",
        "background": "We want the Government to provide specific guidance to Year 12 students, and how their education and progression to higher education/apprenticeships will be impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. There is also a need for government-approved online resources which support the A-Level curriculum.",
