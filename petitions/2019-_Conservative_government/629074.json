Although the Mayor was democratically elected  by a majority of the population we believe it is cavalier of him to seek an opinion of his electorate and then to ignore that decision by citing potential health benefits which have little  scientific evidence but is seen as a fund-raising  opportunity.",
        "background": "to restore the democratic rights of the population of Greater London by requiring the Mayor of London to hold a binding referendum on the possibility of enlarging the Ultra Low Emission Zone in a timely manner before any further activity is considered in implementing his unilateral decision",
