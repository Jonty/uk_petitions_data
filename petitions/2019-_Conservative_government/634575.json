        "additional_details": "Children must learn about the truth behind the meat industry and how their dietary choices affect animal welfare and the environment. The industry often hides the pain and fear animals experience before ending up on our plates. In the UK, almost 1,000,000 pigs are slaughtered each month, and reducing meat consumption can greatly help in mitigating climate change. Sign the petition to empower children with knowledge and compassion, so they can make informed choices for a better future.",
        "background": "We demand that primary schools be required to teach students about the process of animal slaughter. They need to understand the realities of the meat industry, which can help them make informed dietary choices, and hopefully reduce meat consumption, and improve animal welfare and the environment.",
