It is not fair that foreign students cannot access the NHS LSF because they are not eligible for student finance. We want foreign students who have been residing in the UK for over 5 years to be able to access the NHS LSF bursary just because they do not qualify for student loans. Please make a change and help us have a smooth journey as students.",

We believe this is not fair as foreign students have the same amount of placement hours in the NHS as students who do qualify for support.",
