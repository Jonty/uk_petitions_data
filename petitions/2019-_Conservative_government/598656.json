If we could create a more compassionate world, starting with the next generation, abuse & neglect could end by prevention. As an animal lover I can't just sit back & watch the shelters get full up & animals being hurt or even just left at home while owners go away on holiday. It's all neglect & disgraceful in the modern world. It needs to end now. Thank you.",
        "background": "It's shocking that people still don't know how to treat animals & are lacking basic knowledge of their needs. Children from Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) and up need to be educated properly & regularly from a young age on the cost, time & effort involved in caring for pets. ",
