        "action": "Reduce the university tuition fee for the current academic year, 2020/21",
        "additional_details": "Many universities are now delivering all teaching virtually, with severely limited access to facilities and required resources. Online courses traditionally cost less than on-campus courses (see Open University course fees, http://www.open.ac.uk/courses/fees-and-funding) and with the current \u00a39,250 fees already deemed too high, the case to reduce fees for the academic year 2020/21 should be strongly considered.",
        "background": "We are calling on the government to work with universities to significantly reduce tuition fees for the academic year 2020/21. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, students are not receiving the equivalent value or quality of tuition that they have paid for in previous years.",
