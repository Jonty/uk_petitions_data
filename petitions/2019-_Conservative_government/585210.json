Corrosive substances are easy to conceal/mask and can go under the radar in police searches.\r\n \r\nThe aim of this torture method is to maim or kill, and the consequences survivors deal with are severely debilitating. This can include blindness, respiratory issues, burns, scars, societal judgement, occupational loss, psychological problems and more.",
