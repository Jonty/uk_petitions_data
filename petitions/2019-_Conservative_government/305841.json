        "action": "Remove restrictions on TV Licensing of live TV during Coronavirus crisis",
        "additional_details": "The restrictions on Live TV broadcasts are understandable in normal circumstances. However, given that the Government is making daily announcements, it is important for the information to be available without filter.\r\n\r\nAll households should have access to this information, and removing the restrictions on Live TV are critical to this.",
        "background": "Considering that HM Government has decided to delay the end of free TV Licenses for the over 75s due to the COVID-19 Crisis, they should also extend this to all households so that they can be informed of current plans directly. For current licence-payers, their fees should be temporarily waived.",
