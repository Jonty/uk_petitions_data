However, the UK continues to be \u2018complicit in committing war crimes in Yemen by selling weapons and providing support to the Saudi led coalition which is using the deliberate starvation of civilians as a tactic of warfare\u2019 according to a 2019 UN report. Unicef has declared the Yemen famine as the largest humanitarian crisis in the world, with over 80% of the population requiring humanitarian assistance.",
        "background": "With COVID-19 further crippling Yemen, our government must act decisively and stop our complicity by ending supplying arms to Saudi Arabia to avoid further bloodshed. \r\n\r\nGermany has suspended arms sales, now Britain must do the same.",
