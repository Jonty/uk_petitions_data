        "additional_details": "If the Government went ahead with this plan, it could harm so many people in the UK struggling with an eating disorder, or even push other people into adopting eating disorder behaviours. It is engraining the idea into British society that your worth is in how many calories you intake, and how much you weigh- which is not true. By putting this information on restaurant menu\u2019s it can effect people outside of restaurants and these ideals could seep into our everyday lives, creating an even more unsafe and unhealthy environment for the already 1.25 million British people with eating disorders. But these numbers can only increase if this insensitive policy is put in place.",
        "background": "We would like the UK Government to not put calories on menus, as they mentioned in \u2018Tackling obesity: empowering adults and children to live healthier lives\u2019. It encourages restrictive eating & puts in place a dangerous narrative that eating less/cutting calories is healthy for you-which it is not.",
