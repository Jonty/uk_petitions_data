        "additional_details": "It is inappropriate for a former PM who has not served five years in office to be eligible to claim the full allowance of up to \u00a3115,000 per year. For example, a PM who has only served 44 days in office (at the point of resignation intent) can currently reclaim up to \u00a3115,000 of taxpayers money.",
        "background": "The Government should look to introduce rules on the amount a PM is allowed to claim from PDCA. The amount they can claim should be based on the length of service, 5 years or more they would be entitled to the full amount, any less than 5 years then the amount should decrease on a sliding scale.",
