        "additional_details": "The current rules for weddings allow guests to enjoy a wedding breakfast seated with no masks however they cannot watch the wedding ceremony with no masks. If these guests were to sit in the ceremony with the same people as they would be for the meal I do not see why they cannot sit in the ceremony without a mask. They can be worn for entering and exiting but should be allowed to be removed once seated in the same way that they would be for a meal or a restaurant environment.",
