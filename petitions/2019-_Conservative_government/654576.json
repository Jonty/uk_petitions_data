        "action": "Increase the maximum assisted speed for e-bikes from 15.5 mph to 20 mph",
        "additional_details": "We believe a maximum assisted speed of 20 mph offers a more natural and comfortable riding pace, and would better enable e-bike users to fully utilize their gears and the bike's potential, and enhance the riding experience. A higher speed limit could also reduce the inclination to illegally modify e-bikes to bypass the current restrictive limit. The change aims to improve safety, efficiency, and enjoyment for e-bike users, fostering a modern approach to transportation.",
        "background": "We want the Government to increase permissible maximum assisted speed for e-bikes to 20 mph. The current limit of 15.5 mph (25 kmph) is restrictive compared to those set in some other countries, including the USA, Canada, New Zealand and Brazil.",
