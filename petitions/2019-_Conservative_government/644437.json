        "additional_details": "In the last 12 months multiple unions have carried out strikes, which I believe are using children's education as a weapon to achieve their members' aims. This will continue unless the Government decisively acts to prevent a child's education from being used by any side in any dispute as leverage to achieve their particular aims. Both the direct withdrawal of teaching and the withdrawal of ancillary services that prevent children from being able to attend school should be made illegal.",
        "background": "I am concerned that children are being used as pawns by unions in payment disputes. The Government should impose limits on strikes to prevent union activity that directly or indirectly impacts, delays, diminishes or interferes with the provision of education.",
