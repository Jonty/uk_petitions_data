        "additional_details": "The heightened anxiety levels, insecurity and sense of powerlessness brought on by CV-19 pose a tangible threat to the mental health of many children. \r\n\r\nThe pandemic is worsening the condition of many with pre-existing mental health needs (YoungMinds research) and could unfortunately lead to mental health issues for many hitherto unaffected.\r\n\r\nThey are in their emotionally formative years and may be most negatively affected by the necessary adaptations they are now having to make.",
        "background": "The Government needs to launch a national campaign to acknowledge and address the impact of CV-19 on children. It should produce better online resources providing key guidance and support and also increase awareness & funding for the expert charities already equipped to advise and support children.",
