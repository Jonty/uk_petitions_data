        "additional_details": "Prisoners are dying and suffering without much help. Unable to see their family for nearly a year. Enhanced/well behaved prisoners should come out temporarily. It\u2019s a lockdown, everyone is indoors except key workers. It\u2019s fair to see prisoners who are well behaved; we should all come together in this hard time. Coronavirus cases have increased and many have died or may die. It\u2019s only fair to see families get together please. This is my message to everyone out there to help families.",
