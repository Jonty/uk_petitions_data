        "action": "Raise the Carers Allowance to a proper wage amount",
        "additional_details": "Carers in the U.K. provide a vital role to the community and our Carers Allowance is considered a taxable income by the government. The Government should not expect a carer to make a decision between caring for a disabled individual and being poor or working. Parents with disabled children have even harder decisions to make and many children require 24 hour care. According to the government guidelines a 40 hour week and higher is full time. Carers work 7 days a week, 24 hours a day.",
        "background": "Raise Carers allowance to 70 hours a week at the current minimum wage per hour at the NLW NMW guidelines as specified by the Government from 1 April 2020 as a normal working citizen allowing carers the ability to be able to stay home and take care of individuals on a one-one basis.",
