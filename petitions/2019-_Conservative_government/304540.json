        "additional_details": "This will only mitigate some of the losses incurred through this emergency, but it should allow businesses to reopen after the pandemic has passed. Our tertiary sector is crucial to this countries economy, and provides millions of jobs. If they are supported they will be able to pay their workers sick leave, helping them to self-isolate, therefore flattening the curve and slowing pressure on the NHS. It must be stipulated that businesses support their staff during this time.",
        "background": "Issue a compulsory order of closure so that businesses can claim through their insurance due to infection concerns. Allow this to be backdated so that already closed venues are not prevented from claiming. Those who cannot claim must be supported directly by the government.",
