        "additional_details": "Neonicotinoids pose a significant environmental risk, particularly to bees and other pollinators.\r\n\r\nA third of the UK bee population is thought to have vanished in a decade, yet up to three-quarters of crop species are pollinated by bees, studies show. \r\n\r\nA 2017 study of 33 oilseed rape sites in the UK, Germany and Hungary found a link between higher levels of neonicotinoid residues and lower bee reproduction, with fewer queens in bumblebee hives and fewer egg cells in solitary bee nests.",
        "background": "Environment secretary George Eustice has agreed to let a product containing the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam to treat sugar beet seed this year in an effort to protect the crop from a virus. This will be devastating for our bee population. Ban the production and usage of all Neonicotinoid pesticides.",
