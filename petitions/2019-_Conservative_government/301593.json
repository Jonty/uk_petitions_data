Italian doctors have said to \u2018not be afraid of massively strict measures to keep people safe\u2019.\r\n\r\nThe world heath organisation has criticised most governments around the world for not taking enough drastic action. This pandemic is stoppable given the correct severity, type and sophistication  of action. \r\n\r\nI believe the government\u2019s actions are extremely inadequate.",

This involves copying Korea and China\u2019s drastic attempts - as they work.\r\nSuch attempts are:\r\n1. All citizens given ffp3 face masks \r\n2. Lockdowns\r\n3. Mega rapid testing",
