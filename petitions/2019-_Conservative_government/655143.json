        "additional_details": "One survey found that 1 in 7 grandparents are prevented from seeing their grandchildren. Although if mediation fails, a Child Arrangement Order can be sought, the adversarial court process can be expensive and traumatic to vulnerable grandparents. Many grandparents describe this lack of contact as a \u201cliving bereavement\u201d. Attempts to change the law have so far failed. I think the current system neglects the rights of both grandparents and grandchildren. Grandparents have a huge amount to give, and their contribution to children's happiness and well-being requires recognition.",
        "background": "UK grandparents have no automatic right of contact with their grandchildren. They can lose contact with a grandchild if the parents split up or for other reasons. I run a support group for affected grandparents and would like there to be a parliamentary debate to find a better solution.",
