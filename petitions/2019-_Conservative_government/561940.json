        "action": "Revise process for EU citizens to get a British Passport after 10 yrs in the UK",
        "additional_details": "By having the fees for this test at the current price it allows a classist advantage to those better off, as well as a strain on those who will go onto and currently benefit our country and economy, as \u00a31300 is a sum that few will be able to afford before the age of 30. Especially in these current times. On top of this the test that accompanies the process is unnecessarily hard and irreverent to current life in the UK - which the majority of British adults would not be able to pass.",
        "background": "I would like the government to revise the current laws regarding fees and tests facing EU citizens applying for a passport, who have lived the majority of their lives in the UK. As a student I currently do not have the funds to go through this process, despite having lived in the UK for 12 years.",

The above petition calls for EU nationals to be automatically given British citizenship after 6 years, would mean these citizens do not need to pay the application fees to become a British citizen.\r\n\r\nIf you would like the Government to take a different action you could start a new petition stating exactly what changes you want the Government to make to current immigration arrangements for EU nationals."
