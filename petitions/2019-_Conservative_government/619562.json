Quick calculation is directly proportional to the minimum wage, this amount should be 25632.377 there you got explaniation how I calculate this: (16000 / 5.93 = 2698.145) so (2698.145 * 9.5 = 25632.377). So in 2022 should be 26k to correspond min wage.",

It should increase with the National living wage and backdated 5 years to be fair as that should be included when introduced scheme.",
