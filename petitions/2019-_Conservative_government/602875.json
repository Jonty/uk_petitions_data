        "additional_details": "England currently has fewer bank holidays than Scotland and Northern Ireland. The signing of the Magna Carta by King John in 1215 deserves to be commemorated as it is credited by many as being the origin of our democracy and rule of law. An extra bank holiday on this day would also be a fantastic opportunity for families and communities to spend much needed time together after the challenges faced by the nation during the past two years.",
