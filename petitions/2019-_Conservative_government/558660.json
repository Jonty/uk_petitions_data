        "additional_details": "Hospices across England are losing money again, and during the second lockdown had to close charity shops that had only recently reopened. Households across the country are unable to donate as they could before the pandemic. As a result, hospices are having to make redundancies, and furlough staff, meaning they are unable to provide essential palliative care to the community. They urgently require emergency funding to ensure these essential services can continue, and prevent closures.",
