Under the current system every organisation creates their own job application format. To complete several applications all with different layouts is time consuming, difficult, and unnecessary. A standardised format would not only be more efficient, but also allow people to find fulfilling employment quicker.",

This would make applying for jobs simpler, quicker, and more accessible. Guidance and assistance to jobseekers could also be simplified should this be implemented.",
