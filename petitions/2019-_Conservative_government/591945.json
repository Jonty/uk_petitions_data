        "additional_details": "Recently there has been a massive increase in the incidence of spam texts, including scams purporting to be delivery companies and malicious web links. The problem of nuisance calls is similar, persisting despite the use of the TPS and similar. Even for those who do not fall victim to these scams, there is undue stress caused by receipt of multiple messages and calls per day. More needs to be done to protect everyday people by placing the onus on cellular carriers to verify user identities.",
