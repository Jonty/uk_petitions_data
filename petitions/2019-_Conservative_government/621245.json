U.K graduate starting salary U.K is \u00a330,000 with a loan of \u00a345,000. \r\n\r\nIf salary increases by 5.5% each year, at age 40, they'll be earning \u00a378,644 P.A. and will have paid \u00a333,264 towards the loan. \r\n\r\nThe value of the loan at 5.58% interest (10 year RPI avg. + 3%)? \u00a379,676. They still have 10 years until it's written off.\r\n\r\nWhen the loan is closed, the total contribution will be \u00a3103,587 age 51. \r\n\r\nAt a fair, 1.5% interest rate the avg. grad will clear their loan having paid \u00a358,186 age 45.",
        "background": "Due to the radical interest rates applied, the interest accrued is drastically outpacing repayments leading to loans becoming a life-long tax. As the loan grows, graduates will continue to pay a basic tax rate (>\u00a327,288) of 29% and a higher rate of 49% whilst making little to no impact on the loan.",
