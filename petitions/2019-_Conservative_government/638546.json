        "additional_details": "We believe a ban must be introduced ASAP to prevent a dangerous vaping culture. Australia banned them, we have to do the same. The sooner the better. Discarded vapes which damage the environment are left in parks, alleyways and on our streets. We believe many shops selling e-cigarettes are intentionally targeting children, selling vapes next to sweets and fizzy drinks, capitalising on their vulnerability and only caring about their profit margin.",
        "background": "We are worried about the impact of vaping, and in particular the number of young children getting addicted to vaping. Ban all e-cigarettes, to prevent future pressure on the NHS, negative impact on the environment and get a hold of this issue swiftly.",
