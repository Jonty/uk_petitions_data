        "action": "Remove Boris Johnson from the office of Prime Minister",
        "additional_details": "The British public, now more than ever, need a competent leader who stands for fairness, honesty and integrity.\r\nBoris Johnson has so far proved that he is unfit to lead this country and the electorate deserves better. \r\nThis petition will hopefully send a message to those at the top that Boris Johnson has passed his sell-by-date. He embarrasses us as a nation and he does not display the characteristics or actions of a decent Brit. His removal is necessary for the progress of the country.",
        "background": "UK Parliament need to hear the British public \u2013 we want change.\r\nWhether it be calling for a vote of no confidence, or whether there is any other Parliamentary intervention that will see the UK rid of our current Prime Minister, MPs need to act now in the interest of all their constituents.",
