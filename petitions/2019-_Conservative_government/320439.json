        "additional_details": "I\u2019m calling on the UK Government to reassure parents and guardians by not re-opening schools until September 2020\r\n\r\nThe UK now has the highest death toll in Europe.\u00a0It is too early to return children to schools. It seems it could pose risks not only to children but also teachers and those they live with - grandparents, parents and those underlying health conditions.\r\n\r\nSo far there has been little assurance of what measures will be made to protect people and manage these risks.",
        "background": "Close schools until September 2020 to redyce the risk and prevent a second wave. Social distancing is impossible in schools, staff should be provided with adequate PPE. We do not want schools to reopen until the risk has subsided as it poses a risk to vulnerable people pupils and staff may live with",
