To change her surname back to her maiden name she can give her marriage certificate and the final order to organisations such as DVLC to do this.\r\n\r\nA woman who is still married can only change her surname by deed poll and must attach a permission letter from her spouse stating they have no objection. This allows a spouse to control an ex-partner. This disproportionately affects women.",
