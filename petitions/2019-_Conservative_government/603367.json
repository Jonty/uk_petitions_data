        "additional_details": "We request a renegotiation of the terms of the SSC to echo that of the USA, Canada and several other EU countries in which Foreign workers in Korea  collect their pension as a lump-sum when they leave Korea.\r\nCurrently 45 countries have established mutual agreements with Korea that allow their citizens to do this however the UK does not.\r\nThis leaves citizens across several sectors short changed despite years of work and with, therefore less incentive to return to the UK work pool to start again.",
        "background": "Presently, British citizens living and working in South Korea are subject to the pension laws of the country however due to the current Social Security Convention that has been negotiated with the UK government these citizens are not entitled to their pension should they return to The UK.",
