Right now, our families are putting their lives in danger every day. \r\n\r\nI have spoken to children and families of key workers, we feel that the right way to support NHS Healthcare workers is to increase their salary and we are asking Boris to take it a step further by implementing a Permanent Basic Income of \u00a32500.00 P/M for home and food expenses. Improving their quality of life would inherently improve ours.",
        "background": "We want to feel like our parents and families are valued. For many years I have watched my mum give her life to the NHS, every year, underpaid, this is the story for many NHS workers. \r\nPermanent Basic Income ensures those who are on the frontline can provide care without financial stress.",
