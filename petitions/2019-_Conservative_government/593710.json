        "additional_details": "Currently the Government are considering excluding Uni students from aspects of Uni life, such as accommodation and live lectures unless they have 2 jabs.\r\nBut currently it is impossible for most 17 year olds to get a jab before they turn 18.\r\nThis means that it will be impossible for anyone turning 18 in late July or August to get 2 jabs in time for Uni.\r\nIf restrictions are introduced in September,  they need to be based on 1 jab,  or potentially 2 jabs if introduced in early November.",
        "background": "If rules regarding COVID vaccinations for University students are introduced, the government must ensure that students who are currently 17 have time to meet the new rules.    Currently they are only able to have 1 jab before Uni starts, and may need up to 6 weeks after Uni starts for their 2nd",
