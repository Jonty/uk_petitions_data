        "additional_details": "Driving instructors, lorry drivers and our key workers are the people who are having to fill up their vehicles twice, maybe even three times a week in order to work/get to work. The cost of a full tank for most small cars (1 or 2 litre engines) at the moment is around \u00a360-\u00a370, AT LEAST, which is the average amount for petrol cars, which is the cheaper option of the two fuels, so you can only imagine what a full tank of diesel would cost, especially on vehicles with bigger engines.",
        "background": "A discount for those who need the fuel to work. For example, a discount card which is presented at the pay point, with the vehicles registration number and/or company name, along with the drivers details. By doing this means the card can only be used by the owner of the working vehicle.",
