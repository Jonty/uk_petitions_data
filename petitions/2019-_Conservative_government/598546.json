        "additional_details": "NHS111 operates the same appointments system used by most GPs, with allocation being made at 8am on out of hours days, which means that unless your emergency has occurred before 8 am, you are unlikely to be seen. My 11 year old fell and lost a front tooth, because it was a Sunday we had to go through NHS111, no appointments were available and her tooth could not be saved. The pre-2017 system would have saved her tooth and the tax payer the additional costs for the years of orthodontics she faces",
        "background": "In 2017 control of out of hours dental emergencies was removed from local dental practices and handed to NHS111. According to the Commissioning Standard for Urgent Dental Care, the objective was to provide a \u2018high quality urgent dental care system responsive to local needs\u2019, this is not happening.",
