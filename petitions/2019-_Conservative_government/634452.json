        "additional_details": "According to the Office for National Statistics, in the year ending March 2021, there were 55,000 recorded offences of rape, with women accounting for almost 90% of victims. Additionally, there were an estimated 773,000 victims of sexual assault for the year ending March 2020, with women accounting for almost 80% of victims.\r\n \r\nWith the legalisation of pepper spray, we believe these numbers can be reduced drastically, and women can feel a lot safer walking home from work or a night out.",
        "background": "Pepper spray is a popular self-defence tool used around the world. However, in the UK, it is illegal to possess or use pepper spray, labelled a \"firearm\". If legalised, it can empower people to defend themselves against attackers, and could help provide opportunities to escape a dangerous situation.",
