Many tenants are facing a difficult time as they are either forced to leave work due to businesses shutting down or not being able to use DSS in order to pay rent to live. Landlords must not discriminate tenants who claim benefits during this difficult period and should see that by getting support from the government they are more likely in a better circumstance which will enable them to pay rent.",

Some are losing their jobs as businesses are facing difficulty in this harsh period, whilst some are working on reduced hours.",
