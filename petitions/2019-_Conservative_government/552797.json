        "additional_details": "At the moment those on benefits get greater support to get back into work and access specific training and work-based experience. Many parents especially women are left in an unemployment trap where there is no support to find work. The longer they are without work the worse the gap on the CV. What is worse these people are not on the unemployment statistics as unemployed. This needs to change.",
        "background": "The Government should stop the parent unemployment by ensuring that all parents, no matter if they claim benefits or not, can get support to get back into work. The DWP should be a point of support for anyone (not just those on benefits) wanting help to find secure paid and meaningful employment.",
