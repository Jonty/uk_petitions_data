It is unfair to stop tests that are only for 40 mins in a well cleansed car and both parties wearing face coverings but to allow schools with over 1000 people with no social distancing or face masks being worn to carry on! \r\nBy allowing tests to continue this stops a large sum of people from using public transport, such as school buses.",
