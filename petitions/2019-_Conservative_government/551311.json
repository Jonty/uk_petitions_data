        "additional_details": "We need multiple vaccines to meet global demand, and some epidemiologists are considering COVID-19 human challenge trials to quickly narrow the field of promising vaccine candidates. Over 1,400 Britons have already volunteered. \r\n\r\nIn the past, the government has provided funding for clinical trial centers during times of need. Today, the government should embrace the altruism of British volunteers and cement the UK\u2019s leadership in future medical research by doing the same.",
        "background": "The Government, through the NIHR, must ringfence funds to create a Challenge Study Center with sufficient biocontainment capacity to quarantine 100-200 volunteers in COVID-19 human challenge trials.",
