        "action": "Give NHS workers freedom to choose weather they are vaccainated or not",
        "additional_details": "Back in March 2020, NHS workers were working close to COVID or potentially COVID patients.  They had no preventative treatment, no vaccine or even PPE. Yet they dragged on everyday putting themselves at risk. I don't think they should be coersed into a new vaccine treatment program. It should be their choice. I feel April 2022 is still not long enough to understand how the virus and vaccine will behave, we still have alot to learn and it shouldn't be pushed on those that share a different view.",
        "background": "To allow NHS workers (nurses, doctors) to continue working without the new COVID vaccines or at least extend the mandate time to 2024 due to it still being new.",
