        "additional_details": "I am the mother of a serving Police Officer and I am aware of some of the calls my son has to attend as a front line Officer.  I was appalled to learn that the boys and girls who are putting their lives on the line for their country every shift they attend, were not even being considered as a priority for the Covid-19 vaccination.  The Officers are as much a priority as other emergency services due to the nature of their work.",
        "background": "Police Officers deal with the general public on a 24 hour, 7 days a week basis which leaves them highly exposed to contracting the coronavirus.  Apart from basic PPE, there is nothing to reduce the Officers risk of becoming infected.",
