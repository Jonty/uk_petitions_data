If we don't start to take steps now to mitigate these effects, life in the UK (particularly in the south) may be very uncomfortable. At the moment the focus seems to be on trying to reduce CO2 emissions enough to solve the problem. We believe this is insufficient, and a prudent government should plan in advance and not wait to the last minute.",
