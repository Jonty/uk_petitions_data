        "additional_details": "The  drop off charge is very high and its like penalty for the drivers who use the drop off point to drop the passenger , also drivers have to pay car park charge , where drivers are just entering car park to pick up and leaving car park, they are not technically parking there but still paying.  Drivers are helping Heathrow by bringing and taking passengers swiftly without causing much traffic , as we are in and out in few mins. so I believe charge should be removed completely for PCO/Mincab drivers.",
        "background": "I would like Government to debate and remove or reduce the Pickup and drop off charges for drivers paying at present at all UK airports.",
