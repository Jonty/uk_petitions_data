The Prime Minister has admitted that schools are a vector for transmission,  and until the Government can ensure through vaccinations this is no longer the case, they have a duty to safeguard lives and not put them in danger.",

Without doing so, staff and their families could be put at risk from infection and further unnecessary and needless deaths. Let alone the mental health risks, which have already been stretched to the maximum.",
