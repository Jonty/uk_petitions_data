Current events such as the Energy Crisis, the Food Crisis, and the Fuel Crisis, and past events such as the Withdrawal Agreement Crisis prove that. If the government is failing, the People should be able to recall it mid term rather than waiting two or three years for the next scheduled election or the Prime Minister\u2019s whim.",
