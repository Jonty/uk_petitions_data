        "action": "Keep the student loan repayment threshold at \u00a327,295 a year",
        "additional_details": "Students who have already graduated have signed a contract with student finance agreeing on the terms of repayment, if this were any other loan changing when its paid back would not be allowed - so why is this? Additionally this will worsen the financial position of many young people, it is already a struggle to get on the housing ladder, why would we want to make that harder? \r\n\r\nYoung people who have worked hard for their education should not be punished, especially after NI has also gone up.",
        "background": "Students over the past two years have been paying the same amount of money to universities for lectures online rather than actually attending a lecture, and for STEM students this also meant missing neccecary lab sessions. If the threshold lowers, we will be paying more for a lower quality education",
