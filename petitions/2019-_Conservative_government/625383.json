        "additional_details": "Studies have shown that long-term shift work can significantly reduce life expectancy and increase the likelihood of serious illness including cancer and heart disease. There are so many professions that we as a country rely upon such as nurses, police, firemen, factory workers and many more. The choice of not working night shifts isn't an option for many people carrying out these roles.",
        "background": "Reduce the state pension age of anyone who has worked night shifts as part of a shift pattern for 15 years or more continually. As people get older night shifts can become increasingly more difficult. The pressure on the NHS could also be reduced as a result if these pensioners are healthier.",
