Therefore, if companies have to make redundancies, I believe that people of all ages deserve the same entitlements to redundancy pay if they've been undertaking the same job for the same amount of years. 1.5 week\u2019s pay for all years served should be equal.\r\n \r\nCurrently people under the age of 22 are only entitled to half a week\u2019s pay for each year of service, and people aged 22 to 40 are only entitled to one week\u2019s pay for each year of service.\r\n",
