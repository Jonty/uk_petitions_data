The new regulations will make it impossible to place a puppy until they are around 4 months of age. Change at this time could adversely affect their development and the likelihood of qualification. Furthermore it could adversely affect the lives of guide dog owners, service users, fundraising and the number of dogs being trained/ qualifying annually adding to an already extensive waiting list.",
