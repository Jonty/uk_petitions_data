        "additional_details": "The River Avon and canal through Bath were once well stocked with pike and perch but are now regarded by many anglers as \u201cdead water\u201d, and the same is true of a stretch through Bradford on Avon to Avoncliff, also large stretches of the Bristol Avon.\r\n \r\nWe believe rules on removing these species from rivers and canals are too permissive, and that any removal of perch or pike should be made illegal. These fish play an important part in aquatic ecosystems and it\u2019s awful that this is being allowed to happen.\r\n",
        "background": "I\u2019d like to see it made illegal to take any perch or pike from a river or canal as stocks of these fish appear to be at a critical point in many places that were once healthy, species balanced waterways.",
