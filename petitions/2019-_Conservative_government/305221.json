        "additional_details": "Self employed, sole traders and sub contracted individuals are generally skilled workers. Skilled workers should not be treated differently from small businesses just because they do not pay business rates or other associated costs. If you are self employed and not working, this means no income and no bills being paid; the same outcome as is for small businesses. The Government are propping up businesses with grants/loans but nothing for self employed. ESA unfortunately does not cover a thing!",
        "background": "More fiscal support for self employed and sole traders during the COVID-19 pandemic. By this we mean introducing government loans and grants accessible for those that fall into the aforementioned categories. Currently, the only support would be to apply for ESA which would only pay \u00a380 per week.",
