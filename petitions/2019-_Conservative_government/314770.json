And they pay even more if they have to register specific skills such as being a District Nurse or to prescribe drugs. The more valuable services they provide, the more they pay. They receive nothing back for this and pay Union fees on top. It is just so they can do their jobs. No other public service has to pay for this. Police and fire fighters don't pay to register. Put that little bit of money back in our valuable nurses pockets!",
