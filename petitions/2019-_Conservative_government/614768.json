        "additional_details": "I want the Government to make IVF more accessible for all. If you can\u2019t have kids naturally you should be offered help, regardless if it\u2019s your first or second child. Couples are being penalised for having a medical issue that prevents them extending there family.\r\n \r\nOut of all infertility causes, secondary infertility makes up about 50 percent of all cases. More needs to be done.\r\n",
        "background": "NICE guidelines state if you are a woman aged under 40 you should be offered 3 full cycles of IVF if you have been trying for more than 2 years. Yet CCGs set their own criteria which means IVF is not offered to many couples, including where they or their partner already have a child.",
