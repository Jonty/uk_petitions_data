Most car parks have started putting up signs displaying NO Driving Tution or Learner Drivers not to use car park which in turn is putting instructors at potential risk of verbal and even physical abuse. As a result Instructors are unable to practice bay parking with learners. This is also unfair on the learner as they are unable to practice the manoeuvre prior to a test.",
