        "action": "Allow all university students to return for in-person teaching this summer term.",
        "additional_details": "Since the beginning of the pandemic, students across the UK have been repeatedly neglected by the government. The lack of communication has caused confusion and unnecessarily added to the toll the pandemic has had on students' mental health. With schools being reopened it only makes sense that universities should be allowed to recommence in-person teaching - especially since the student body has much less contact with the wider community than school children, who return home everyday.",
        "background": "We want all students, regardless of whether their course is considered 'practical', to be allowed to return for in person teaching at the start of the summer term.",
