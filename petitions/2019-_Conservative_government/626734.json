If the average citizen is doing better under this Govt then those managing that Govt deserve to be paid. However, if like current times the Govt has actively damaged the economy & the average UK citizen is worse off, then those MPs in Govt should also see a significant reduction in pay so they can understand what the rest of us are going through and take responsibility for their party's decisions & actions.",

You can find out more about this allowance here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-duty-cost-allowance/public-duty-costs-allowance-guidance\r\n\r\nUnder the Ministers\u2019 Pension Scheme Ministers, including from 2013 the Prime Minister, accrue a part of their pensionable salary in each year they are a contributing member of the scheme, and have a normal pension age linked to their State Pension age. You can find out more about this scheme here: https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn04586/\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petition, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nAbolish the Public Duties Cost Allowance (PDCA) for former Prime Ministers: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/625940"
