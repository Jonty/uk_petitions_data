The UK Government could lose billions of pounds because of such harsh and unwelcoming policies.\r\n \r\nThis country is facing a shortage of workers and this policy may mean that international students, who could contribute to the future workforce, choose to go to Australia, Canada, or New Zealand instead.\r\n \r\nThe Government should allow international students to bring their dependents on a student visa or when they get a graduate visa (Post-Study Work visa - PSW).\r\n",
