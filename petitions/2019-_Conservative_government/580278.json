I have had to see my cat in absolute agony, bleeding to death because nobody wanted to stop and help. It is disgusting how people can be left like this and it\u2019s effected my mental health massively. More need to be done about the killing of cats in Hull. This can\u2019t continue and you are letting it happen",
        "background": "It is absolutely disgusting how you have to report such things as a goat being hit by a car but not somebody\u2019s pet? Not a part of someone\u2019s family? They can be left at the side of the road to die? Absolutely disgraceful. All animals have a right and it should be law to report a cat.",
