Many of us are unsure what\u2019s going to happen each time there is an announcement as Boris Johnson has not yet directly addressed how we will be compensated or even how we will move forward. 1000\u2019s of students are all currently waiting for the same answer. What will happen with our tuition fees? How will we be reimbursed? Why am I currently paying for a full time course when really I\u2019m receiving the same tuition as a part time course?",
        "background": "During all recent announcements from the prime minster, Boris Johnson, has failed to mention if/how students will be refunded for not receiving full terms of education. Currently UK students are studying online meaning we are not getting full access to what we have paid for. Will we be refunded?",
