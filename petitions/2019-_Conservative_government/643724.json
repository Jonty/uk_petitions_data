They penalise students who have been ill through no fault of their own. Why punish that? \r\n \r\nI believe that they discourage schools from implementing tailored and effective support, replacing that with awards instead.\r\n \r\nThey could detrimentally impact SEND and disabled pupils (likely to have lower attendance) which I believe is discrimination against a protected group under the Equality Act.\r\n \r\nFinally, some research suggests that attendance awards are counter-productive!\r\n",
