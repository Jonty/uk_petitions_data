        "additional_details": "Did you know Roberto Nevilis invented homework as a punishment? Students hate homework, so why are we given it? We spend 6+ hours at school, only to go home and spend more hours doing homework! You may think i\u2019m just a student who doesn\u2019t want to do their maths homework, but homework causes stress and takes away from our free time. We only get 2 days off school a week, but have to use those days to finish the essay our English teacher made us write and more! Please take this into consideration.",
        "background": "They should ban homework, except if you didn\u2019t finish work in class as this seems fair. This doesn\u2019t mean give more work in class intentionally so students have homework.",
