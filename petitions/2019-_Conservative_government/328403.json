        "additional_details": "The Government has allowed leisure businesses to reopen from 4th July with social distancing requirements in place. Providing sports clubs can comply with the same requirements they should be allowed to reopen with limited capacities to allow them access to sources of income. Large scale protests have recently been held without emergency services being overwhelmed indicating the country is ready to start reopening the economy. Sports events should not be treated any differently.",
        "background": "Football, rugby, cricket and other sports clubs should be allowed to reopen to spectators, with reduced capacities, if they are able to prove they can comply with social distancing requirements. If other businesses are allowed to reopen, sports should not be discriminated against.",
