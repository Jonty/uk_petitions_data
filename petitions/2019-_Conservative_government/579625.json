        "action": "Restrict actions of police during peaceful protests, rather than expanding them.",
        "additional_details": "The police have demonstrated on the evening of 13th March 2021 that they already have too much freedom to restrain peaceful protesters. This act will allow them to do so even more freely. We cannot let this happen, and we need to keep government voting representative of the general public, rather than whipped into voting for a bill that will massively hinder our right to protest peacefully.",
        "background": "On the 16th of March 2021, Parliament will vote on the passing of The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill. If this is passed, it will hinder peaceful but effective protests from taking place. We believe this bill simply will not be representative of public opinion.",
