        "additional_details": "Councils charging parking for Blue badge holders are simply being greedy. There are nowhere near enough council supplied disabled parking spots, and now they are increasingly charging for there use. Many disabled people only travel when necessary, often only to shop or attend appointments, and they are now having their limited income reduced by these councils, especially with parking charges being so high.",
        "background": "Many Blue badge holders have restricted income due to their disabilitys. Many use the mobility part of any allowance they get to pay for their vehicle. They are often forced to park on double yellow lines to avoid paying for parking, increasing congestion in some areas.",
