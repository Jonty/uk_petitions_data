        "additional_details": "Now more than ever, adult smokers who are ready to switch and those who already have done so need continued access to quality vaping products and support that only specialist vape stores can provide. Considering the pressure that the NHS and local authorities are under, we cannot expect them to be able to provide stop smoking services to all who require them. Government must reconsider the classification of vape shops to ensure we are able to continue the great work in reducing smoking numbers.",
        "background": "Grant specialist vape stores essential retail status allowing them to operate in a safe and controlled manner and help prevent a reversal of the progress in reducing smoking numbers. The removal of access to these products and services could have a lasting effect in the public health of the nation.",
