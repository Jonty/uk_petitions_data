        "additional_details": ". In light of this view, I wholeheartedly believe that the significance of BSL is neglected and should therefore be taught in Secondary schools. With that being said, I have great confidence that learning Sign Language in schools will have a huge impact on communities and should in turn be as mandatory as learning an alternative language from the age 11, to allow them a superior opportunity at a more coordinated future, and with BSL being instructed in schools, this can play a big commitment to that.",
        "background": "I want the Government to introduce learning Sign Language to the education system, as I believe that learning Sign Language in Schools should be as compulsory as learning an additional language in School.",
