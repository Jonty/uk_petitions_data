Art and all its different mediums (moving image, still imagery, paintings, drawings, poetry, fashion and costume) should be accessible to all and I think it would do Mansfield good to have more arts and culture.",
        "background": "I would like the Mansfield District Council to build a new contemporary art gallery to attract new people and give creative people a place where they can go and relax and have their work exhibited. I would like to be the curator.",
