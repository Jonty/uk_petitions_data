However there is no regulation in order to keep these properties affordable for the majority of the country. \r\n\r\nThe Government needs to introduce a law in which prevents landlords from charging more than 15% over the LHA by creating a complete ban or significantly increasing taxes for the landlords that do charge over this.",
