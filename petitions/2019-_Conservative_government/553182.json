A floor which is as basic as four walls and a roof for a house to be complete is missing in the basic specifications. These builders demand extra money to put in a floor. Is this acceptable? Buying a house for most people is once in a lifetime dream. The government is trying to make housing affordable and on the other hand these developers are making it difficult.",
