        "additional_details": "It is the opinion of mine and many other that this current government resembles a parody of George Orwell\u2019s 1984, being both authoritarian and arguably highly ineffective. Not only are they clamping down on the right to protest, they have routinely failed to act timely in response to new strains of Covid, costing lives and damaging the economy. This government is unfit for purpose, I request that the government call for a general election, allowing the people of the UK to decide its fate.",
