        "additional_details": "University is an expensive experience for many students, some have worked hard, and or family and relatives have worked hard to fund their university learning, in which, is now and has previously for the last few months been completely online, and students are lacking the social and other skills that come with in person lectures and classes.",
        "background": "Possibly reduce the UK university fees during the time in the pandemic. It is a difficult time for everyone, but UK university students are not getting the same teaching experience as they would have done with face to face teaching, and is therefore unfair for them to be paying the same amount.",
