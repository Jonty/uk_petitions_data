        "additional_details": "Many pubs throughout England will have beer that is going to go off during lockdown. There is no difference between takeaway food and beer. We must support every business where possible during these very hard times. During the last lockdown my local brewery sold takeaways from their pub and it was extremely well organised so that everyone was protected. Our economy is going to take a long, long time to recover so we must support wherever we can and save jobs aswell as small businesses.",
