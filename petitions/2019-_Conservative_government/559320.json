        "additional_details": "Many of the problems with fireworks would be solved if they were silent.  This petition recognises the tradition of fireworks (eg Bonfire Night, weddings, Diwali), but seeks to minimize the impact on wildlife, farm animals, domestic pets, horses, and late night disturbance.",
        "background": "Legislate to make all fireworks silent.  Fireworks don't need to make loud noises to be enjoyed.  The natural \"whoosh\" of a rocket or Catherine Wheel is fine, but remove the artificial pop, bang, explosion from all fireworks sold in the UK.",
