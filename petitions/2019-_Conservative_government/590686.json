A 50cc bike has little to no power which gives the rider an almost scared feeling that The bike can\u2019t even keep up with traffic and is too slow to get from place to place effectively. Making it so a 16 year old can ride a 125cc won\u2019t only make them feel better and more comfortable, it\u2019ll make them feel safer and make roads safer for the bike riders due to the venerability of bikers.",
