        "additional_details": "A \u00a35,000 bursary should reduce the pressure on medical students (especially those from lower income households) and allow them to fully focus on their challenging degree, as well as help fund the cost of travel to and from clinical placements every day. Medicine has a reputation for being limited to those from wealthier backgrounds, however, with this help this stereotype could be broken.",
        "background": "After the past 2 years, the shortage of doctors in the NHS is more clear than ever. For this reason, Medical students should be entitled to the same \u00a35,000 annual bursary as nursing students, for each year of their course. This should incentivise more people to pursue a career in medicine.",
