        "additional_details": "A lot of the struggles people have day to day are not necessarily with their disorders but with the lack of understanding and judgement and lack of education from people around them.\r\n \r\nA lot of people do not know what to do or how to react to people with special needs or mental health disorders because they have no education or experience from a young age.\r\n \r\nI believe if we start education on the subject early we could really make a difference for everyone.",
        "background": "I would like it to be part of the national curriculum that all schools, primary and secondary, have to educate students about different types of special needs; including autism, Asperger's, ADHS and Down's syndrome, and also mental health disorders, so they can learn how to deal with these.",
