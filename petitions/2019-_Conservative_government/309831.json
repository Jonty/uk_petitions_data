        "additional_details": "A large number of the UK is now in lock down to protect the country and the most vulnerable from the Coronavirus outbreak. While this is the right thing to do, Many of us are still providing essential services to help protect and care for the residents of this country and putting ourselves and loved ones at risk of contracting this virus. All I suggest is that those who are providing a critical role in the COVID-19 response be compensated with a hazard pay scheme for being on the front lines.",
