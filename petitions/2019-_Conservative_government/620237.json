In many cases, someone can have a very mild case of Covid but the Long Covid which follows wipes them out. \r\n\r\nOnline forums to link up with fellow sufferers and rehabilitation clinics are all very well but they are not the solution.  Sufferers don't just need to manage their symptoms, they need to recover.  We need serious money for research and specialist medical professionals so that sufferers can be supported to the point where they have at least a reasonable and vastly improved quality of life.",
