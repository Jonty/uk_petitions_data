Many incidents of anti social behaviour and unwanted sexual attention occurs within this time frame. Victims who cannot remember the details of said journeys either due to inebriation or the brain's trauma response can go some way to feeling validated if there was a recording that could support any allegation made. The cameras would be an important deterrant for future incidents to occur.",
