Under Regulation 27 it is an offence to \u201cuse any lights in a way which would dazzle or cause discomfort to other road users, including pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders\u201d. This is repeated in Rule 114 of the Highway Code.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for changes to regulation of car headlights, but it would need to be clear what changes you want."
