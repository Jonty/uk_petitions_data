        "additional_details": "Many nurses and doctors have died of Covid. Salaries for nurses & doctors are poor and fail to recognise the sacrifices and their contributions as shown by their role in Covid-19 crisis. Clappings for NHS, little salary increases subsequently, have sapped their goodwill & moral.\r\n \r\nTwo thirds of doctors who responded to a recent survey said they expected to leave the NHS in the next three years. Hospitals are relying on agency staff, and the death in service benefits for NHS doctors and nurses fail to ensure financial wellbeing of their families in the event of death.",
