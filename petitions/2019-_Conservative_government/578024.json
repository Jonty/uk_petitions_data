        "additional_details": "First,  because a 1% rise is so insulting it will drive everyone who can afford it out of NHS.  And make them resent their work if they continue. A 10% bonus for this last year would do it. Pay in other countries very inviting. Second, because we need to keep NHS workers and encourage others to work in the professions, we need to raise the entry-level pay in particular.  For the higher paid, I think a better consultation about what, if anything, would keep them in the profession  in the UK.",
        "background": "There are two issues here: something special to compensate for NHS exceptional stressed working of the last year, far more than other key workers. The other is the continuing low basic pay at bottom of nursing profession.  There are huge gaps in numbers right across NHS.",
