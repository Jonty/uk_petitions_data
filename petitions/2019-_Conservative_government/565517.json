I believe because of a lockdown it has increased the stress rate and we have missed months of lesson time ,which gives us little time to pass due to no fault of our own. can we consider this and extend the time to ease not only the pressure of the learners but also the driving instructors, and to claim the time back that we have been deprived of . Please help us!!",
