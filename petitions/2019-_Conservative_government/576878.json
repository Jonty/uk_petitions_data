        "additional_details": "This lockdown has already affected everyone in our generation's mental health. Forcing us to go to school when others can celebrate the missed freedom is deterioating our motivation. Most of us will not even bother trying or turning up. While having a slight easing of restrictions was good last year, it still wasn't a rest from the surrounding due to COVID. Taking away this years summer which everyone has been anticipating is not going to help us with our schoolwork or mental health.",
        "background": "After nearly 2 years of COVID-19 affecting the UK and a total of 7 months of school closures many students are behind on learning. However the government are considering a temporary solution that will cause permanent damage to our generation's mental wellbeing and our memories of this year.",
