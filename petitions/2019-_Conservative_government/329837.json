Successive governments have failed to protect the interests of Black people by not implementing the recommendations of reviews which they set up, consigning black people in society to institutional racism; discrimination in the workplace; over representation in the criminal justice system; substandard dangerous housing; illegal deportation and the disproportionate impact of Covid 19. We want implementation of the recommendations by Government now",
