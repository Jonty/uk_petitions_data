        "action": "Remove exam fees for students retaking their A Level and GCSE exams in October",
        "additional_details": "Seeing as those from poorer socioeconomic backgrounds were mostly disadvantage from the government calculated grades, it is unfair and cruel to charge these students to take their exams. Most of these poorer students will be unable to pay to take their exams leading to an unfair bias due to their wealth. \r\nI urge the government to strip these fees to give these students a chance to be the best versions of themselves with a fair and equal start to their lives and careers.",
        "background": "Given the circumstances, students will be sitting their exams for the first time in October if they are unhappy with their exam results.\r\nSince they are sitting their exams for the first time, this should not count as an official resit and so they should not be made to pay to sit the exam.",
