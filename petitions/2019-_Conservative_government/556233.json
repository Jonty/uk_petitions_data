        "action": "Make firework manufacturers reduce the decibel level of fireworks",
        "additional_details": "For so many years parliament has ignored pleas for stricter laws on the public having easy access to fireworks & when they do finally address it they just say they will \"enforce\" existing laws. Instead of being so combative, work with manufacturers to reduce/remove the excessive bangs that simulate bombs exploding, the decibel level has increased in recent years. This way the public can enjoy private displays & the vulnerable arent being terrified in their own homes for 3 months of the year.",
        "background": "Take accountability for irresponsible people having such easy access to fireworks that reach upto 120db, who blatantly flout the law in which they can set off these fireworks with 0 consequence & work with the public/manufacturers to reduce the excessive & unnecessary decibel levels in fireworks.",
