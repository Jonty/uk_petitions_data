        "additional_details": "This practice is most prevalent in the buying and re-selling of event tickets but also has a significant impact on the sales of trainers/clothes and technology. The most recent case in point is the launch of the PlayStation 5 and X Box Series X consoles. Both pre-orders and launch day stock were sold out instantaneously and then thousands of listings appeared on eBay at over double the RRP. A reseller group claimed to have been able to secure 3500 of these.",
        "background": "I believe it to be an unfair and unjust practice that well funded groups/individuals can deplete the stock of a single item and make it unaffordable/unavailable to the average consumer. I believe the law around this practice needs to be reviewed and measures to prevent it need to be introduced.",
