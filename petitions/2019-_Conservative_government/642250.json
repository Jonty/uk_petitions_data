        "action": "Replace MP accommodation budget with sustainable barge residences on the Thames",
        "additional_details": "Centralised residences promote transparency, eliminate second home claims, ensure substantial savings of taxpayer money, and diminish the potential for misuse.\r\nLocalised residence cuts MPs' travel, aligned with the UK's requirement to reach net zero emissions by 2050.\r\nA barge in Dorset had been used for oil and gas workers, and use of similar vessels has been used for Ukrainian refugees in Glasgow and Edinburgh. If it\u2019s good enough for all those people, then it should be good enough for MPs.",
        "background": "Public funds supporting second homes for MPs costs the British taxpayer, have fuelled past scandals, and perpetuate environmental concerns due to carbon emissions from commuting. We advocate that MPs reside in barge accommodations on the Thames during their tenure in Westminster.",
