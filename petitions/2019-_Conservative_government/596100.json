Your petition calls for the Government to help fund the cost, but it's not clear if you want this to be on the same basis as university degrees (through students loans), through grants, or some other system.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petition, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nMake student loans available for commercial pilot training: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/594048\r\n\r\nIf you want the Government to take an action different to the above petition you could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
