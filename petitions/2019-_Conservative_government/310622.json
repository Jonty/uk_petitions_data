        "additional_details": "We ask that the government offer comparable support to small business owners, who at the moment have been offered no grants personally. These businesses contribute widely to society yet despite having to support families and prop up their businesses which the government has forced to close are to receive no help personally. It seems only right that owners of small limited companies should receive 80% of their salary and dividends up to \u00a350,000 in line with self employed workers",
        "background": "Support for the employed and self employed affected by Covid-19 has been unveiled entitling those affected to 80% pay. Owners of small Limited companies paid a small salary through PAYE and the remainder of their pay through dividends are being unfairly penalised with these proposals.",
