        "additional_details": "Whilst this petition recognises the importance of keeping businesses afloat both during and after the COVID19 pandemic, taxpayers\u2019 money should not be used to subsidise firms which already operate in a way which reduces paying taxation which helps to fund vital services, from the NHS to local councils.\r\nThe government\u2019s first duty of care is to its citizens. However organisations which do not pay UK corporation tax should be allowed access to loans which will assist paying staff and UK firms.",
        "background": "The government should decline to provide bailouts to firms which do not pay UK corporation tax.\r\nThe only exception should be loans used explicitly for paying wages and salaries of UK-domiciled employees, and for settling accounts with other firms which do pay UK corporation tax",
