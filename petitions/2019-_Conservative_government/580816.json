        "additional_details": "Diversity and Inclusion plays a huge part in promoting kindness, education, empathy and more understanding between us as humans. We are all unique individuals with different backgrounds, skin tones, religious beliefs, cultural practices and nationalities. We owe it to our future generation of leaders to emphasize the importance of this as much as possible. At such an impressionable age it is crucial that we support young people in battling xenophobia, overcoming stereotypes and racist views.",
        "background": "We would like the government and parliament to put more of an emphasis on ethnic minorities, cultural inclusion and raising awareness of diversity within our society into secondary school curriculum.",
