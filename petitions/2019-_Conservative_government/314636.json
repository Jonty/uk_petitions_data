The current starting salary of nurses (band 1-2) is \u00a318k, which is insulting considering they risk their lives to save ours. We would like our government to properly value our nurses and show them respect.",
        "background": "Healthcare workers and nurses, in particular, have risked their own lives and those of their families to save ours. We owe it to them to make sure they are properly compensated for their selfless hard work. No nurse should have to worry about making ends meet for their family whilst saving others.",
