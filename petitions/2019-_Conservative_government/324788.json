They shouldnt be mandatory on transport , more so because you dont need to wear them in terminals. They arent a proven way of protection and its not fair to force everyone to wear one. If they dont want to they shouldnt have to. Preventing someone from travelling which could impact them greatly is unfair just for not wearing a mask.",
