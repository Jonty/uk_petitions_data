        "additional_details": "All our lives we are taught consistently about 'Stranger Danger' and how we must not talk to anybody that we do not know or trust. But what if a person you did know and trust was abusing you? Who do you tell? what do you do? Research shows that over 90% of sexual abuse cases are done by a known person. Due to this, a high amount of children never speak up. We can teach children/Young people about positive relationships, that abuse can happen in any relationship, inappropriate touch and much more",
