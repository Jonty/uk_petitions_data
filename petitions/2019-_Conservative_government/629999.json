But what if a person you did know and trust was abusing you? Who do you tell? what do you do? Research shows that over 90% of sexual abuse cases are done by a known person. Due to this, a high amount of children never speak up. We can teach children/Young people about positive relationships, that abuse can happen in any relationship, inappropriate touch and much more",
