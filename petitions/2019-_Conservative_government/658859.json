Given the huge amounts of debt that many students are still expected to pay back for a reduced service. The Government should address this. They should create a Government-backed process where students can state their case that they received reduced contact hours during certain terms, which we believe breached the contracts students agree to that their fees were paying for a certain level of teaching and services.",
