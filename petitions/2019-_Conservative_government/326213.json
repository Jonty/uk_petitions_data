Much of today's racism is derived from a lack of knowledge and understanding by the general public. Groups such as the English Defence League and Britain First instigate and spread hate towards minority groups. Minority groups whose countries were invaded, families and communities ripped apart, natural riches stolen all while destroying their history and traditions.",
