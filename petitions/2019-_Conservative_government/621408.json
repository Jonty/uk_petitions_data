The new tax saving doesn't apply to renewable energy projects. The UK Government expects \u00a35 billion in tax revenue from the EPL. The 5 biggest oil companies shared profits of nearly $100bn in 1st 6 months of 2022. People need help this winter to afford fuel and food. The economy will need further support. \u00a35 billion additional tax revenue from the current EPL isn't enough.",

The investment allowance for investing in oil and gas extraction should be reduced to 25p for every \u00a31 spent.",
