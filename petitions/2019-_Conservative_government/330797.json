        "additional_details": "Through the pandemic, public transport staff have helped millions of people make essential journeys, in variable conditions & sometimes without PPE.\r\n\r\nThe government's only plan to honour them is a memorial at Victoria. This would symbolically recognise their contribution, but our public transport workers deserve more.\r\n\r\nFinancial compensation can't make up for loss of a loved one, but it can help with housing or childcare costs as families get back on their feet.",
        "background": "The government should guarantee compensation for public transport workers who don't receive a death-in-service benefit from their employer / receive one that's under \u00a360,000.\r\n\r\nThis should be extended to those whose loved ones have already died (54 as of 24th June) & put in place for future deaths.",
