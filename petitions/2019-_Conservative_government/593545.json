        "additional_details": "While supporting the UK, many key workers are currently separated from their immediate family members. In many cases, visiting them in their country of origin for short time means having to pay for quarantining in a hotel and make use of their entire annual leave, with no prospect of taking a break until allowances reset. They are not going on holiday abroad! They have rights to spend time with their loved ones as most in the UK do.",
        "background": "The UK Government should:\r\n- Remove cost of hotel quarantine for fully vaccinated key workers returning to the UK after visiting family members abroad; and\r\n- Allow employers to furlough them for 10 days so the time spent in quarantine is not deducted from their annual leave allowance.",
