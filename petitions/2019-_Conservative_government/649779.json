Both parents should have equal rights to pay and leave, so they can decide together how to share care for their child.",

Currently paternity leave is only one or two weeks at the lower of \u00a3172.48, or 90% of weekly earnings. Maternity leave is up to a year, with more generous pay entitlements for the first six weeks.",
