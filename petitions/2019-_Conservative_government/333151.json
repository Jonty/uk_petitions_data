The Government should prevent the airlines from discriminating against these disabled people through the charging for therapeutic oxygen, and force them to offer this free.",
        "background": "Many people with heart and lung diseases need therapeutic oxygen during flights, and have been charged for this by airlines they fly with. This is an unacceptable additional cost to be borne by those already disadvantaged. Airlines could easily provide these free of charge, but instead seek profit.",
