This is unfair that after the offer has been accepted and mortgage processes started taking place, someone can offer higher and the buyer can loose the property. We want the buying process to be fair both sides, for the seller and the buyer. Our aim is to make it illegal to gazump after the offer has been accepted on a property.",
        "background": "Gazumping is an unfair process where someone can make a higher offer for a house than (someone whose offer has already been accepted by the seller) and thus succeed in acquiring the property. After the offer is accepted, gazumping should not be legal.",
