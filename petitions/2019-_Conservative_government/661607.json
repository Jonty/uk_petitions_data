This could cover people who have vomiting syndrome, where this has a a \u2018substantial\u2019 and \u2018long-term\u2019 negative effect on their ability to do normal daily activities.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling on the Government to provide additional funding for research into vomiting syndrome, if that's something you'd like to happen."
