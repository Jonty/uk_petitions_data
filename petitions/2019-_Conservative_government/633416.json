        "additional_details": "At present energy companies are making billions and as we clearly saw today \u00a33.3 billion profit from one company alone - not all that profit is reinvested and bonuses for senior directors and CEOs do not represent the image of caring for either our environment or the public.\r\n \r\nCompanies are closing due to high energy bills, leading to unemployment and increasing the burden on the welfare state. People are having to make the choice of paying bills or buying food.",
