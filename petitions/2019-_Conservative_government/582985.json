        "additional_details": "When you pass your theory test, you must complete your practical within two years or you need to retake your theory, paying for a new test. There are many who have been unable to complete their driving tests or may not be able to complete them before their theory pass expiries, through no fault of their own.  Many test centres have not been taking tests for most of the past year, and now many who passed just before the pandemic hit are finding it impossible to book tests in time to avoid expiry.",
        "background": "Those who have a driving theory pass that will be expiring without passing their practical test should either have their pass extended, or not be liable to pay for another theory test to renew it. Many have been unable to take their practicals due to the pandemic and now are facing an unfair charge.",
