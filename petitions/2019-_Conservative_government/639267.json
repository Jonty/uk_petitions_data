        "additional_details": "Police Constables regularly abuse the Section 5 of Public Order Act offence to arrest people if they say a word they decide is \u201cabusive\u201d, such as a swear word. Cases in court have previously suggested that many swear words do not qualify as they\u2019re frequently used. Despite this, many officers persist. This is damaging to free speech as nobody should be arrested for using swear words or any other words, for emphasis or description. Amending this act as appropriate, would be a suitable response.",

I want the government to exempt on duty  officers from being a victim of this offence, and require a victim to approach police in order for an arrest to be made.",
