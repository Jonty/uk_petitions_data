        "additional_details": "A Cross-Party coalition/committee would allow for more consistent messaging to the nations from each party or country. Consistently experts and opposition have warned against government action and the appropriate response to issues have either come too late via 'U-turns' or not at all. Having a combined approach, any Covid response would be universally agreed upon and less prone to reversal later. Covid-19 is a bigger issue than party politics and it is time for the government to recognise this.",
        "background": "After the numerous instances of indecision, lack of clarity and 'u-turning' it is clear that there needs to be more a concise response to the virus. A cross-party coalition or committee of senior MP's from each party or experts to decide on actions or messaging in regards to Covid-19 guidance.",
