        "additional_details": "This system would provide scientists with a critical source of information to help protect the population and vulnerable people from the spread of Covid-19. It could capture postcode, age, symptoms, any large events recently attended and recent international travel. Of course, not all those self-isolating will have Covid-19, however using a system like this would enable patterns to be spotted early, local populations to be warned, and the economic impact to be estimated.",
        "background": "Covid-19 testing will now only be done for those admitted to hospital.  This will prioritise those most in need, but will significantly hamper awareness of how the virus is spreading. An online system for reporting self-isolation would enable valuable information about the virus to be gathered.",
