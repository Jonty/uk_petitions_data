The process to do so is arduous in comparison to our EU counterparts. For British Citizens, this is unfair and can be traumatic, particularly if their single / widowed parent is left alone in another country.\r\n\r\nPath to citizenship: Yes, 5 year route.\r\nRight to work: Yes, although not required for settlement. Financial requirement in the absence of work.\r\nPay NHS surcharge: Yes",
