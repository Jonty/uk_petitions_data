        "additional_details": "We think we need legislation to hold landowners to account to ensure large car parks are only used for their intended purpose and introduce serious legal recourse to drivers. We think local communities are having difficulty holding attendees to account and car park landowners should be required to install and maintain barriers and ANPR cameras. These are costly and often landowners don't want to spend on this. We also think offenders should be fined and have points added to their licences.",
        "background": "We have seen unauthorised car meets taking place in large car parks both in out of town retail parks and in retail parks that are adjacent to community housing. We think they are unsafe, cause noise pollution could pose a risk to safety.",
