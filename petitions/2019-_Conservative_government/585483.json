Everyone comments about how dangerous this motorway is especially in the rain and at night when there is no lighting. There is little to no drainage so water builds up and sits on the surface, there are potholes and general maintenance has been neglected. The road is seriously unsafe and life threatening in bad weather conditions and at night.",
