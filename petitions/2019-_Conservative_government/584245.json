        "action": "Change social media rules to stop MPs from removing questions and constituents.",
        "additional_details": "Change parliamentary rules to ensure that constituents are not blocked from their MP\u2019s public social media pages for having and voicing an opinion that is different from theirs or challenging them on their actions. Only allowing an echo chamber of reinforcing positive feedback misrepresents public opinion and actively diminishes transparency. Deleting constituent\u2019s posts should only be allowed for abusive language. Formal guidelines should be issued to MPs much like many other professions.",
        "background": "MPs tend to have a strong social media presence with their own professional pages and accounts. When many are challenged with a difficult but legitimate question they simply delete the question and block the constituent from posting. Silencing those who disagree is not compatible with democracy.",
