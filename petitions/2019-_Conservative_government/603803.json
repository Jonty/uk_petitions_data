        "additional_details": "The Government must support the events industry through the period of disruption resulting from the COVID outbreak, through to the return to normal operations for the sector once the outbreak is fully under control.\r\n\r\nWhether or not businesses are required to close by the Government, additional support must be provided to protect businesses from the financial impact of COVID.\r\n\r\nWithout additional financial support many businesses may not survive the disruption caused by the outbreak.",
        "background": "The events industry needs to know it is going to be supported through disruption caused by COVID, especially now the Omicron variant has led to mass cancellations. This must include payment breaks for repaying Government loans, the reinstatement of the furlough scheme, and additional funding grants.",
