We need to keep them safe from catching Coronavirus from other shoppers (who may not be showing any symptoms).\r\nIf an Intensive Care doctor or nurse catches Coronavirus at a supermarket and is then too sick to save our lives, then this is a preventable tragedy.\r\nI am an NHS GP. If I, and the two GPs that I work with get sick, then 8,000 patients will be without a service, putting more strain on hospitals.\r\nPLEASE ACT NOW TO SAVE LIVES.",

Ask them to offer home delivery to Intensive Care doctors, nurses and other key NHS staff who are in low numbers such as GPs and A&E staff. Sheild them from Coronavirus as much as possible.",
