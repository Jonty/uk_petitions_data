        "additional_details": "I want this because many teenagers are being put under pressure by the constant reminder of exams, when many teenagers feel stressed and anxious about having to take exams as they may not feel confident. This can lead students to not get the grade that they could have gotten if it was based on coursework. In exams some people can't concentrate as well as others so it puts an unfair advantage on the people who aren't confident with exams.",
