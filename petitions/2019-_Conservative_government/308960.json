        "additional_details": "We feel the NHS has enough pressure on it at this current time and the added pressure of wasted and unnecessary calls isn't helping at all. The fines would hopefully deter people from calling ambulances and turning up to hospital unless it is absolutely necessary and thus allow the NHS to try and keep on top of this epidemic and give the best possible care they can as they always do, without having to have their time wasted by these unnecessary wastes of NHS time.",
        "background": "A call for fines against people who waste the NHS's time during the Corona Virus outbreak such as dialling 999 for an ambulance for unnecessary reasons (such as having mild symptoms of Covid 19)  to help bring down the pressure on the NHS and self isolate as per the governments instructions",
