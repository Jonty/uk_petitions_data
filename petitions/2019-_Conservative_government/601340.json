        "additional_details": "The Football Offences Act should be amended to cover gestures in addition to chanting and to cover homophobic chanting and gestures specifically. It's 2021, it's ridiculous this isn't included.",
        "background": "Homophobic chanting is rife at football matches, and yet isn't specifically banned under the Football Offences Act. The Act also only prohibits chanting and not gestures, so racist gestures (like monkey impressions) are also not specifically prohibited under the Act. This needs to change.",
