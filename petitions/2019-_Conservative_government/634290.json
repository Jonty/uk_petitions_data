        "additional_details": "I\u2019d like government to issue a badge, similar to that of the disabled parking badges, to parents for the use in these spaces. If a car is then parked in a parent and child space without one of these, the appropriate fines be enforced. This will give parents with young babies and children the chance to make going to the shops that little bit less stressful, when sometimes all they want is some milk.",
        "background": "Since having my son, 8 months ago, there have been countless times in which people have parked in parent and child spaces that do not have any with them and has left me to park far from the store with a young baby. There appears to be no enforcement or care for those needing the spaces.",
