        "additional_details": "I think it is important the pupils get their voices heard. It is completely unfair for the government to cancel exams and give us a sigh of relief to then expect us to still sit external assessments. I understand they need to fair data for our grades however they can easily achieve this by coursework and mocks. Students across England have struggled significantly. We have hardly been in a classroom setting and yet we are expected to sit external assessments that we still haven't had clarity on.",
        "background": "We were told  that GCSE and A-levels 2021 have been CANCELLED. We are now being told we will sit external assessments from exam boards. This is horrible for us all. Our quality of learning since last year has been so poor, we have barely been in school. It is unfair to expect us to sit these exams.",
