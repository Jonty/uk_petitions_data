        "additional_details": "Royal visits to towns and cities around the UK usually cost the local council, police and other local public bodies thousands of pounds.\r\n\r\nResearch by Republic has shown cash-strapped local councils spend more than \u00a322m a year on royal visits.\r\n\r\nThe costs will vary depending on the royal involved, however a visit by the Queen to Leicester in 2012 was estimated to cost the local authorities more than \u00a3180,000.\r\n\r\nA recent YouGov poll showed that 57% of people believe these costs should be met by the royal family.",
        "background": "We want the government to ensure that, whenever a member of the royal family visits a town or city anywhere in the UK on official business or a public engagement, the full cost is met by the Royal Household. This would mean no local council, local police force or other public body would incur costs.",
