        "additional_details": "Increasing the curfew over this month will give the night time economy a fighting chance to survive. \r\n\r\nNew cases are likely to come from house parties and other illegal gatherings. Whilst you try to police these depending on location these are impossible and impractical to contain.\r\n\r\nAllow only the venues who meet certain Covid guidelines to open later until 1am to ensure they are Covid secure and safe.",
        "background": "Increase the curfew for one month in December by 3 hours. This will ensure people have safe Covid venues to visit as the alternatives are house parties which are not Covid secure and hard to police.",
