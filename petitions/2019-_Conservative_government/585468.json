        "additional_details": "For travellers who left the UK before the pandemic began and have been stranded in the country they visited because of restrictions in that country and restrictions on re entering the UK such as mandatory hotel quarantine packages costing \u00a31,750 and PCR testing of \u00a3164 - \u00a3200 for day 2 & 8. The cost is just too expensive for those who just want to return home to see their families they haven't seen in a year. Funding tests for low-middle income people can get them home and decrease added stress.",
        "background": "The cost of PCR testing for international travel in the UK is double that of testing in other European countries. With a PCR test now required on Day 2 after returning to the UK from even the lowest-risk countries, research highlights the disproportionate cost of PCR testing for travellers.",
