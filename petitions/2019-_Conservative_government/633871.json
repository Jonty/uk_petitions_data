Do an investigation into Racism & bullying in  all UK school's.\r\n\r\nBlack children face harsher punishments often for defending themselves against racist bullying, schools are not reporting or acting on racism that children face on a daily basis.

Historically there has been major concerns regarding racist discrimination in UK schools, in light of Child Q, Child A and many others that do not get publicity.
