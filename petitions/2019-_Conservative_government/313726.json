        "additional_details": "Unfortunately, some have lost their lives to save ours. The least we can do is to recognise their bravery, courage, and sacrifice, by giving the status of National Heroes.\r\nFor example, the Victoria Cross medal is awarded to members of the British Armed Forces. They are awarded to those members who show the \"most conspicuous bravery, or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice, or extreme devotion to duty in the presence of the enemy\". This is definitely shown in our NHS staff.",
        "background": "Many NHS staff are currently fighting on the front line against Coronavirus, and risking their lives every minute of every day to save lives and protect us. \r\nI believe this is a war against an invisible enemy, and our Doctors and Nurses are fighting to conquer it.",
