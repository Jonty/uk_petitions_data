        "additional_details": "The Sugary levy on soft drinks needs to be scrapped for people's benefits and also not everybody should be forced to have Sweeteners in their drinks, sugar is totally fine in moderation and it's ridiculous trying to find drinks nowadays without sweeteners, people want a freedom of choice again and the nanny state needs to stop, let the British public decide if they want a high sugary drink as treat now and again like we used to, lots of people are intolerant to Sweeteners including Stevia",
        "background": "Scrap the sugary levy on soft drinks that was introduced in 2018, it was supposed to reduce obesity however that didn't happen and the tax is just used for more government money and there no purpose why it should still exist, also the sugar levy has led to sweeteners ruining our favourite drinks.",
