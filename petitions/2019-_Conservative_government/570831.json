Landlords live from the rental income and we\u2019ve lost thousands. Grants should be given to landlords who have lost rental income, whether because of non-payment of rent, or because properties cannot be rented due to Covid-19 restrictions.",

The Government should provide landlords with a grant for loss of rental income caused by the pandemic as landlords are losing so much money.",
