This has made owning a pet/looking after a sick pet unaffordable to many people. I think that it has also resulted in a reduced standard of care. \r\n \r\nI want to remove the big corporations from our vets so that everyone can afford to look after their pets. I also want to ensure that improved standards of care are prioritised over targets for shareholder dividends.\r\n",
