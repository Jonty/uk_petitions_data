        "action": "Make ASD and ADHD prescriptions free for adults.",
        "additional_details": "This acknowledges the ADHD and ASD is a life long condition that affects adults as well as children. Providing free medication for them ensures that they can access much needed help for something that is pervasive and not a choice. Simply put it will address the imbalance and make the playing field more equal. There are already laws in place to prevent discrimination against people who are neurodiverse, it is a logical step therefore to make their prescriptions free.",
        "background": "Currently those diagnosed with lifelong conditions such as ADHD and those on the autistic spectrum have to pay for prescriptions. These medications are often not a choice, but a necessity. Please consider adding them to the existing medically exempt groups of illness and conditions.",
