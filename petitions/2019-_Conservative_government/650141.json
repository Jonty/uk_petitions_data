        "additional_details": "The police should not be allowed to use drones as a method of surveillance on the public. Mass surveillance is a step towards a police state and the use of drones will only accelerate the transformation of the UK from a liberal country which values personal freedom to a sectarianised society. The people of Britain have a deep-rooted belief in freedom of speech and internal freedom of movement, we do not want our every step to be monitored and documented through the use of drone technology.",
        "background": "The police should not be allowed to use drones as a form of surveillance. It is an infringement on our privacy and may lead to the termination of personal freedoms. The UK already has 8 CCTV cameras for every 100 people. Unless used to fight active crime, the police should not be using drones.",
