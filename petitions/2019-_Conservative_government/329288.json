        "additional_details": "Face coverings should be worn in all public places. It makes no sense for example that wearing a face covering when going to a cinema for 2hours or so is not mandatory but for a journey on public transport which is likely shorter in time is. Lockdown measures should be brought back until we see near to 100 cases per day across the UK or Make a law on mandatory use of face coverings! Wear a face covering! Save Lives! Bring back the economy!",
        "background": "There are many people who are asymptomatic with COVID-19 who have not been given tests and its impossible to test everyone. It is vital that the situation is under control. After all, health comes before anything else! We need to bring in a law whereby people have to wear face coverings.",
