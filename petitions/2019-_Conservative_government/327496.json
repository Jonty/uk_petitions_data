I am at the point where I want to apply for my recognition certificate.  However I am discouraged by the challenges that are presented under currents legislation. The fact that a group of people who may not even be trans can make that decision for me is terrifying and has caused me to doubt that I am trans enough to meet the ridge criteria laid out.",
        "background": "The Gender Recognition consultation was believed by so many that the barriers were going to be broken down and make gender affirmation easier.  The government have all the data so now it needs to be throughly assessed and changes made to the act.",
