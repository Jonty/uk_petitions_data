        "additional_details": "DVSA are unwilling to extend theory test expiry dates due to government laws stating that after 2 years an individual needs to retake their theory. However, due to the pandemic individuals have not been able to take their practical tests due to them all being canceled. Therefore, due to the pandemic, I strongly believe there should be an exemption in relation to the theory tests, for example, an extension for people who had their practical test booked which was then canceled.",
        "background": "I would like the government to extend the theory test expiry date so that individuals do not have to retake their theory tests in order to complete practical driving test, which was canceled by DVSA.",
