Choirs are not just important for wellbeing, our countries culture but they also contribute to the economy. Gyms are getting ready for a return in July but no guidance has been issued for choirs.",
        "background": "We need the government to show how we can restart singing together on an equal footing with opening theme parks, shopping and kicking a football around. It is imperative that we find a way for choirs in this country to resume as soon and as safely as we can.",
