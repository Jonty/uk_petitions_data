        "additional_details": "There is already a Private Members' Bill before Parliament calling for this to happen. If it passes it would see the introduction of statutory paid bereavement leave for all those who lose a close relative.\r\n\r\nWe support it, and if passed should help mitigate adverse long-term consequences for the mental & physical health of those bereaved & so also be beneficial to our wider society & economy.\r\n\r\nAs Patricia Gibson MP said, \u201crelying on an employer\u2019s goodwill to grant compassionate leave is unfair and clearly doesn\u2019t work, with the greatest impact being felt by those on low incomes\u201d.",
        "background": "The Government should extend the statutory two-week paid leave for parents who suffer a stillbirth or lose a child up to the age of 18 to all employees who suffer the loss of a close family member.",
