        "additional_details": "We believe making vaping more expensive to reduce vaping by children is just putting a plaster on the problem. Children should not be sold vape products and anyone selling to minors should be stopped. Trading standards have been given funds and a plan to stamp out rogue sellers. We feel the vape industry is being used to create tax money lost through tobacco cigarettes as people have stopped smoking. It\u2019s against the law to serve minors. We believe this is the issue, not price.",
        "background": "Smoking cessation products like the patches and gum are subject to 5% VAT. Vaping is a popular smoking cessation product but VAT is 20%. This isn't in line with other smoking cessation products. I want the Government to reduce VAT on smoking cessation products and not introduce a new duty on vaping.",
