        "additional_details": "This enables everyone to become more aware of deafness and treat those who use BSL (British Sign Language) equally and fairly. This needs to be taken more seriously and taken through parliament to be discussed. People are having to pay to learn it whereas other languages are open for young children to learn through school without any cost but sign language isn't available. There is a lack of knowledge about BSL and towards the deaf community. This needs to change.",
        "background": "To make sign language an optional subject course, like other languages are, within secondary schools and allow students to learn it in order to communicate with students who are deaf and hard of hearing.",
