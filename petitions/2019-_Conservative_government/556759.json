        "action": "Hold a referendum on creating a regional parliament for Northern England.",
        "additional_details": "The 'North-South' divide has been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, with the North being hit harder than the South. Opportunity is far more scarce in the North than the South; again exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. Health outcomes fare worse that the South Whilst the first trains and motorways in the UK were in the North, public transport seems to be on the brink of near collapse here. It is time for decision making to be made by local people who understand local peoples concerns.",
        "background": "For too long, governments of all differing political positions have promised Northern England a plethora and multitude of things to which they have failed to uphold. The UK government has been too London-centric for too long. It's time for government to be closer to the people it governs.",
