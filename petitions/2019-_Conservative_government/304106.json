        "additional_details": "Nobody chooses to be infected with illness, be it COVID-19 or any other. If workers have to miss working, due to their inability to do their work, or simply having to self-isolate to protect others, they should all be entitled to receive at least the national living wage, not the paltry current amount (\u00a394/week) that is barely 30% of that. We already have the NHS, public welfare, schools, emergency services etc. - we are a socialist country! Let's make this apply to statutory sick pay too.",
        "background": "The rate of statutory sick pay is just \u00a394/week, whereas the national living wage (at 35 hours/week) will be \u00a3305.20/week from 01/04/20. This is barely 30% of what a worker's income would normally need to be. With the COVID-19 pandemic spreading across the UK, this must be addressed immediately.",
