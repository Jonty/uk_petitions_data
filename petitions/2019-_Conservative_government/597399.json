        "additional_details": "The Government should immediately reduce the national speed limit to 60 MPH on motorways and dual carriageways for all vehicles. This modest reduction could make a worthwhile cut in CO2 emissions with the added benefit of reducing collisions and the stress of driving at relatively low cost. \r\nWe don\u2019t need to wait for any recommendations to come from the Glasgow COP26. We can do our bit now to avoid a climate emergency. Remind the Government that our planet needs urgent help now!",

The longer we leave reducing these emissions the more painful remedial measures will have to be, both in cost and impact on daily life.",
