        "additional_details": "Austerity, Brexit, mishandled pandemic behaviors, rocketing inflation, crumbling schools and an NHS on its knees are the results of out-of-touch officials who are more concerned with lining their own pockets and that of their friends and family than doing the right thing for those they serve.\r\n\r\nLeadership is non-existent and more akin to mismanagement of the country. We have no serious voice in the world community and a once great empire has no more influence than a minor third-world nation",
        "background": "I want the government to do the right thing and fall on its sword, resign itself and call a general election so the people of this once envied country can go to the polls and choose a leader, a voice and a change. \r\n\r\nAfter 13 years the bench has been used and whats left is not capable nor honorable",
