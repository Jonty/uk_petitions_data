However, due to all driving test centres being closed, the waiting time is likely to significantly increase. This will cause hardship to learners as they will have to wait for longer before being able to attempt a test. Most learners are also currently unable to  take driving lessons, and if they are unable to drive during the lockdown they may need to pay for unnecessary revision lessons.",
