        "additional_details": "Leaked reports show us that the government plans to reverse rights for transgender individuals in this country, despite 70% of people responding positively in favour of transgender rights in the Gender Recognition Act Consultation.\r\nRolling back these rights will lead to transgender people being forced to use the inappropriate facilities, become victims of sexual assault, and essentially be legislated out of existence. Transgender individuals are human beings and their right to safety is important",
        "background": "Cement the rights that transgender people already enjoy and that they have peacefully enjoyed for the last decade without significant abuse of the system. Make it illegal for rights of transgender individuals to be abolished or rolled back, and prevent humiliating and dangerous precedents being set.",
