They can cause injury, stress and upset. Alternative routes are not always available, therefore stiles are discriminatory, stopping users from accessing public areas, particularly on walks surrounding busy towns where people like to get fresh air and get active, fit and healthy. They can also be hard for dog walkers to negotiate.",
