        "action": "Immediately reduce the cost of vehicle insurance.",
        "additional_details": "The fact that the Government doesn't have it's own vehicle insurance for citizens, and losing out on that cash, means the private sector is overcharging as they see fit. This is leading to an inability for many citizens to pay for insurance, a legal requirement.",
        "background": "The government must intervene to reduce the high rate of car insurance in 2023. Many drivers are unable to afford new policies, some as high as 50% more than in 2022. This will lead to more driving without insurance just to get to work, go shopping etc.",
