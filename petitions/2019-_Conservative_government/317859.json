        "additional_details": "Staff recruitment and retention is so important for the health of the nation.  The NHS requires 5,000 new nurses every year and the government needs to provide incentives for people from overseas to come and work for the NHS and stay with the NHS through these difficult times.   We are asking NHS staff to work in challenging conditions with a risk of falling ill themselves.  It is only fair that the NHS surcharge is waived in recognition of their commitment and the risks they are taking.",
        "background": "A Surcharge of \u00a3624 is payable by all doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals for use of healthcare services.  A family of 4 will have to pay \u00a32500 per annum.   Let's scrap this unfair charge and show how much we appreciate the work they do.",
