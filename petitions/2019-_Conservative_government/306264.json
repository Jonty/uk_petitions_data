        "additional_details": "I believe what needs to happen is secure environments be created where the students sitting exams can do so with them being assessed and safe from the threat of Corona with everyone supporting them. The current way they wish to do it i believe is just impossible to be seen as fair even though the circumstances does make it somewhat understandable but these years of education they have been through can be questioned and the work they are set over the down period is pointless for them to do.",
        "background": "I believe unless they are sat fairness can never be achieved. People miss this chance to develop skills and experience for the future of their education. I believe having Year 11's and 13's go into secondary schools with teachers with them to sit the exams is the best way to still fix this crisis.",
