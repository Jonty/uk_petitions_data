The Government's guidance on disability under the Equality Act 2010 states that you\u2019re disabled if you have a physical or mental impairment that has a \u2018substantial\u2019 and \u2018long-term\u2019 negative effect on your ability to do normal daily activities:\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/definition-of-disability-under-equality-act-2010\r\n\r\nIt is therefore already the case that under the Equality Act, anyone with a physical or a mental condition which has a substantial and long-term impact on your ability to do normal day to day activities is protected under the disability protected characteristic.\r\n\r\nThe Personal Independence Payment is paid to people who have a health condition or disability which causes difficulties with daily living or getting around. PIP is paid based on the difficulties causes by a health condition or disability, but there are not particular conditions which result in PIP being paid. You can read more about eligibility for PIP here: https://www.gov.uk/pip/eligibility\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. "
