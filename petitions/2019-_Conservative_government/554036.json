        "additional_details": "There are hundreds/thousands of people struggling to survive, feed their families, keep their vehicles on the road (to commute to work), as well as maintain the roof over their heads with less than \u00a324,000 a year on minimum wage (working 40hrs+ a week). Something must change. Cases of Mental Health are increasing by the second - even before the outbreak of COVID 19. Now it is more vital than ever to support one another, as members of the human race. All working people deserve better pay too.",
        "background": "The current salary for an MP is \u00a381,932. MPs also receive expenses to assist them with staff costs, travel, food as well as the assurance of accommodation and having somewhere to live in London. In 2020 it has been proposed that their salary should rise to \u00a385,232. Which is a rise of just over 4%.",
