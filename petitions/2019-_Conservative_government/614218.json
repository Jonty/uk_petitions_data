        "action": "Ban conversion therapy for transgender people",
        "additional_details": "Transgender people face extreme amounts of discrimination in their day to day lives and this is partly due to a lack of legal protection. The government need to recognise transgender people's rights and ban conversion therapy for all. Transgender people are human beings and deserve the right to not live in fear of becoming a victim of conversion therapy.",
        "background": "The government have recently proposed plans to ban conversion therapy in the UK, but the proposition does not offer protection to transgender people. They deserve equal protection under law so I propose a blanket ban on conversion therapy for all people who fall under the LGBTQIA+ umbrella.",
