There is not unanimous support.\r\n\r\nSupport could be gauged by determining how many are prepared to pay for a service, and what value they place on it.\r\n \r\nA fully-costed and transparent target budget could be set 12 months in advance, and a 'crowdfunding' appeal launched to achieve that target.\r\n \r\nTracking against target would facilitate adjustment to resources in the case of shortfall or oversubscription.",
