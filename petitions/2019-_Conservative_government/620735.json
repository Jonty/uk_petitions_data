        "additional_details": "The dangerous dog act states that the dogo argentino is a fighting breed. This is incorrect, the dogo argentino was bred to hunt. They are very affectionate and friendly. They do have a high prey drive , but so do, Rottweilers, cane corsos, presa canario, Kurdish kangal, bully kutta. These breeds are legal in the UK, yet they have more attacks than the dogo argentino. It\u2019s unfair to have a breed banned without thorough research. \r\nThere are more show line dogo Argentinos bred than working line",
        "background": "To conduct specific research and consider the behaviour and temperament of the dogo argentino, the breed is misunderstood as a fighting dog, when in fact it is bred to hunt. There is Evidence of breeders on the net that show the breed is a lot less aggressive than other legal breeds in the uk.",
