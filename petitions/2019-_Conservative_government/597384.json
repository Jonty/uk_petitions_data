        "additional_details": "War Widows\u2019 pension is compensation for a life lost in the service of this country. Despite this, it was forfeited in the event of remarriage/cohabitation (with a member of the opposite sex). In 2015 legislation was reviewed; these pensions became payable for life. Approx 200 widows who had already surrendered theirs are being treated differently and unfairly compared to all other war widows. Please help our campaign to ensure that the sacrifice made by these men and their widows isn't forgotten",
        "background": "The War Widows\u2019 Association of Great Britain is demanding that the war widows pensions which were removed on remarriage or cohabitation are reinstated, giving them equal status with others who, following a change in legislation, can retain their pension for life.",
