Risks of transmission could be reduced through effective testing for business travellers. This should help mitigate some of the continuing negative impact on the economy, and protect companies and jobs.",
        "background": "The damage done to the economy by coronavirus is immense. The government\u2019s travel quarantine rules should be amended to allow all legitimate business travel to go ahead without a requirement for business travellers to self-isolate.",
