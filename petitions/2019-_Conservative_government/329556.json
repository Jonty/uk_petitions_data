        "additional_details": "2020 has been one of the most chaotic years of most of these teenagers, and parents, lives. There are millions of children living in the UK, and millions and millions of parents! If the UK government holds the youth accountable for these unprecedented items, you will (if not already) create mass outrage! No school is going to set a child up for something they cannot achieve, that would be senseless.Genuine A* students with top university offers face not getting their firmed place, this is the rest of their lives being played with like they are pawns in the government\u2019s game. This is the life they have worked hard for and deserve. This could have been you. This could be your children! This is the potential you will be stunting.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to understand the hardship these students facing GCSEs and A-Levels have confronted already! I would like them to abolish the 33% downgrade as it is unfair, illogical and counter-active. We call on Boris Johnson to intervene now and stop this.",
