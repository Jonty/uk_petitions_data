Crisis Teams often struggle to find beds for those who desperately need them.\r\n \r\nSadly, not every life can be saved. But we the undersigned believe that increased government funding for NHS mental health services - translating, importantly, to increased inpatient bed numbers - will make a profound difference.",
        "background": "Fourteen people died by suicide each day in 2021, and many more suffer mental ill health that is not successfully treated in the community. However, since 1987/88 the number of mental health beds in England has fallen by almost 75% to its current level of 17,610 in 2020/21. This is not acceptable.",
