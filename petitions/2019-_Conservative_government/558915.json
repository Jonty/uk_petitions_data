        "additional_details": "The British population has developed its democratic conventions over many centuries.  They have fought hard, suffered and died to end totalitarian and repressive rule by religion or state. The right to freedom of speech is sacrosanct and is now in great peril.  The British must have the right to express themselves freely and safely in the privacy of their own homes, a location naturally regarded as sacrosanct. This proposal breaches all the best traditions of freedom.",
        "background": "The government appears to be considering extending hate speech laws to the privacy of the home,  This is contrary to the principles of freedom of speech and thought that have been hard won rights in the UK.  Parliament must reject any such change.",
