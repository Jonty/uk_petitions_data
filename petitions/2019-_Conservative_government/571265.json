Parents cant teach them as they would learn in school and as a key worker who needs to work it is very hard juggling school live lessons with working and I am scared for my childrens future and believe they will be behind where they should be if schools do not reopen soon. Teachers deserve to go to their work place feeling safe and protected. Teachers should be considered important key workers like nhs and social care staff.",
