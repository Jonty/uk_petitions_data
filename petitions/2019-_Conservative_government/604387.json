It can also leave their child/children unable to be driven to school or other important appointments.\r\n \r\nYou can drive a car when you are 16 if you get, or have applied for, the enhanced rate of the mobility component of Personal Independence Payment. The proposal of this petition would help families where the disabled person is unable to drive, either permanently or occasionally.",
