It is not currently clear whether the product has nuts in it, therefore causing a reaction, or whether the product has been made in an environment where nuts are present. The difference is vital for allergy sufferers, as it eliminates the guesswork so often involved in food shopping with an allergy",
        "background": "Change the list of ingredients so manufacturers cannot write \u2018may contain nuts\u2019. For clarity for allergy sufferers, they must explicitly state whether nuts are used in the ingredients or whether the product has been made in a factory where nuts are used or where equipment may have been contaminated",

The Food Standards Agency has produced guidance for the industry on allergen control, which includes advice on how to decide if such advisory labelling is needed and the wording to be used.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petition, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nMake precautionary allergen labelling compulsory and more specific: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/304265"
