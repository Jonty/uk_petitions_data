        "additional_details": "It costs \u00a37 on peak and \u00a34.10 from Chesham to get to zone 1\r\n\r\nBut from Watford Junction it\u2019s \u00a310.50 on peak and \u00a37.60 off peak to get to zone 1\r\n\r\nSo it costs \u00a33.50 more to go from a station nearer London than from a station 15 miles away. This has got to change! Please sign and change this now!",
        "background": "We\u2019d like to change the zone that Watford Junction is in to become a numbered zone where the fare is less. Rickmansworth, Croxley, Chesham and Others are further away from London than Watford Junction, and it is unfair that the oyster zone is significantly higher for that station.",
