        "additional_details": "To protect the UK from future attacks, we already spend billions on a nuclear deterrent to deter nuclear attacks. We should have the best missile defence system in the world, at least as good as the Israeli Iron Dome system as the threat of attack in this fast changing world from missiles and drones is increasing and the world is becoming more unpredictable. These systems should include a mix of air defence systems (Lasers, Sky Sabre, rapid fire guns similar to C-RAM, radar, command and control)",
        "background": "Build an integrated defence system, the systems should include a mix of air defence systems (Lasers, Sky Sabre, rapid fire guns similar to C-RAM, radar, command and control) - We should be able to defence against a hundred's of incoming targets simultaneously. Protect UK home soil. God Bless the UK",
