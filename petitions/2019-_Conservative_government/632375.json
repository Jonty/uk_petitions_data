In 2022 many officers received below 5% a pay rise.\r\n \r\nIn some recent months more officers are leaving/retiring than are being recruited, and moral in many forces is extremely low. Some officers are now having to use food banks and seek financial support from relatives. Officers have stood by your side throughout Covid, and as other public sector roles strike. Enough is enough! Support the police as they do you.\r\n",
