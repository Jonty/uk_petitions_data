Many organisations will accept these as proof of a name change.\r\n \r\nA woman who is still married can only change her surname by deed poll and to enrol this with the courts must attach a permission letter from her spouse stating they have no objection. This can allow a spouse to control an ex-partner, and disproportionately affects women.\r\n",
