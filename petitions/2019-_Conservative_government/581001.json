The lack of impartiality is both embarrassment and does not reflect the views of a lot of people who are funding them.\r\n\r\nHaving a Live TV rule is restrictive and stops people watching other channels that in some instances they are paying for.\r\n\r\nThis is in effect a golden handcuffs deal that binds people to have a service that they neither use nor want.\r\nIn the digital age, having a licence should enable the BBC to turn on and off in the same way that other services do.",
