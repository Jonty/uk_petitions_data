However, being a foreign student from a country not on the UK\u2019s green-list means I\u2019d have to self-isolate upon arrival in order to start my first academic year at uni. The self-isolation costs are insane for a student who plans to live on a specific budget (up to 1500\u00a3 on just apartment. Moreover, the prohibited outdoors activities will have a serious negative impact on the well-being due to no exercise.",
        "background": "Allow students from another countries coming to the UK for studies (in September) to skip 14-days quarantine with a test as a viable alternative. The students coming to study in the UK undergo a serious procedure of receiving permissions to study, implying a smaller proportion of them than tourists",
