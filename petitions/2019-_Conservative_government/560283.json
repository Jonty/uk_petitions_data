        "additional_details": "War memorials (such as the Cenotaph) are not political objects and are sacred memorials, a permanent reminder of the sacrifice made by so many who have died in wars, to preserve the right to freedom and democracy of the people of the United Kingdom. These memorials are for our war dead and therefore must be respected and protected from any type of political protest.",
        "background": "I would like Parliament to debate this issue and put forward a bill to outlaw the use of all war memorials for protest purposes. The disrespectful use of war memorials that honour war dead, who died to allow us all to have a free democracy, should be an arrestable offence, punishable by jail.",
