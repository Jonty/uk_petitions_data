All dogs can attack and look violent not just one breed it\u2019s how they are brought up it\u2019s not the dogs fault it\u2019s the owners you can put bling on any dog but does that make them look viscous they are looking at it from the wrong end of the stick and we need to do something about it because the majority of the dogs are not violent or viscous",
