We have endured two national lockdowns, with the threat of more to come. If a lockdown worked - then why do we need another one? The residents of this once great nation have been treated like children, constantly told we have been 'misbehaving' or 'not sticking to the rules.' Government is meant to exist in order to serve the people. Enough is enough!",
