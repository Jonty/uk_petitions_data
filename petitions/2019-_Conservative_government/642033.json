        "additional_details": "There has been a steady rise in the number of women who are diagnosed with breast cancer after age 30, often after having children. Younger women are often diagnosed with a later stage due to lack of screening and although self-exams are promoted, gland cysts are common in younger women who may ignore lumps due to their frequent occurrence. Therefore, we believe a more comprehensive check (ie. a mammogram) should be more widely available. Screening should mean earlier diagnosis and treatment and a more successful outcome.",
        "background": "The infrastructure is already in place. Women have regular mammograms through the NHS from age 50. We want this to be accessible to women younger than this and should be available from age 30.",
