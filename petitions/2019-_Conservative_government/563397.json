We need to help the future generation instead of throwing some of them under the bus for something that wasnt their fault.\r\nWe should be guiding them. I believe that they have potential. The 2020 exams were cancelled because of those months and i think that the 2021 exams should be too because the kids could have missed some vital information over the past few months.",
        "background": "5 months of school have been missed and people who have gone from year 10 to year 11 have missed out 5 months of GCSE maths, which starts starting at year 7 and 5 months of every other subject, making the exams easier will not do because tge problem is that kids have missed 5 months worth of help",
