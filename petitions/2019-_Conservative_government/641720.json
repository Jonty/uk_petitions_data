This means that the person that tells the prettiest and best lies can be elected, and then when they fail to deliver, we are told we can vote them out. If they face criminal charges, elections will then be a matter of simply choosing the promises that you want to see, and you can have confidence they will be fulfilled, or the people elected will face prosecution.",
