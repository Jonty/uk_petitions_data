Many sellers are unscrupulous individuals trading animals which may have been stolen, bred in terrible conditions, too young to leave the parent or are reselling baby animals purely for profit. e.g. buying a kitten then selling it for a much higher price within days or weeks. Many animals are also falsely advertised as being particular breeds in order to inflate prices.",
