        "additional_details": "Social care is in crisis in this country, its time to stop talking about it and take action. Many of those who receive home help services do not meet the criteria for help from the local authorities, they are self funding and if  these services that are helping to keep them living independently at home for longer, out of hospital/home from hospital earlier are made VAT exempt they could be more affordable thus preventing or delaying the need for more intensive care services that are more costly.",
        "background": "I run a small home help company, it pains me to charge the elderly VAT on vital services. Given the current coronavirus crisis its immoral that the elderly have to pay VAT on home help services such as preparing meals, shopping, medication assistance, offering comfort, company and reassurance.",
