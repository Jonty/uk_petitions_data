        "additional_details": "Pets up to 9kg are allowed to travel to most countries inside airplanes, in their pet carrier, instead of with the luggage. However, they are not allowed on airplanes coming to the UK, regardless of their size.\r\nThis not only distresses the pets, but it risks their health and safety, having several cases of injured, sick, or even dead pets because of the conditions of the flight, as they are treated as luggage. It is extremely important to change the rules and stop that from happening.",
        "background": "Change the rules of animal travel so they can travel with their owners (with all the documentation and vaccines in order) inside airplanes instead of with luggage, as it is allowed in many other countries around the world, including most countries in the EU, South America, and the USA.",
