        "additional_details": "I tried to accelerate nothing happened. All I had was the momentum to get onto the hard shoulder then had to walk to the emergency phone box to call for help. If this had been a smart motorway would there have been enough momentum to get to a refuge bay or would I have been stranded on live motorway? Motorists need the hard shoulder for emergencies without them its like a deathtrap for those who break down refuge bays are not enough. Better to be late stuck in traffic than putting lives at risk.",
        "background": "Safety is more important than saving 10 minutes on a journey.  Many motorists have broken down on motorways and have needed the hard shoulder - including me.  I will share with you my own experience of this as an example.  I was driving on the motorway alone and I felt the car slowing down.",
