        "action": "Give all commonwealth veterans indefinite leave to remain in the UK",
        "additional_details": "It should be a natural, given right that service personnel from the commonwealth are given the freedoms of the country that they have served. Our government actively recruited them and many have served with distinction. Yet they are treated as illegal immigrants when it comes to nhs care and other support. It is only right and decent that the government uphold the Armed Forces Covenant and grant commonwealth Veterans indefinite leave to remain at the very least once they have been discharged",
        "background": "At present Armed Forces Commonwealth Veterans have to apply and pay for British Citizenship when leaving service, I believe that after a qualifying period that ALL Commonwealth Service personnel and their immediate families should receive automatic citizenship without the need to apply.",
