        "additional_details": "The Government has closed the Help to Buy ISA to new applicants. People who already have a Help to Buy ISA can still benefit from the 25% help from the Government, but the limits on property prices are more restrictive than those for other help to buy schemes (Help to Buy Equity Loan and Lifetime ISA).\r\n \r\nThis can mean that people are unable to benefit from their Help to Buy ISA, especially if they plan to buy in an area like Surrey or Kent, where property prices are way more expensive than other parts of the country.\r\n",
        "background": "The Government should set the maximum property prices for using a Help To Buy ISA to purchase a house at the same levels of Help to Buy Equity Loan for new-build homes and to at least \u00a3350k outside London and \u00a3550k in London for 'old build' homes.",
