        "additional_details": "Please give our children a chance at success and don\u2019t penalise them for situations beyond their control.\r\n \r\nY11 pupils had their education disrupted during Y8. Y7 was their last full year of teaching on-site. Now in Y11, with examinations imminent, teaching is being curtailed before these pivotal exams.\r\n \r\nAs well as all the turmoil, bereavements and SEMH issues navigated in light of Covid, I feel it highly unfair that they are expected to perform as if nothing out of the ordinary has happened. We now face lost teaching due to strikes and many families are experiencing trials and tribulations due to the mounting Cost of Living crisis.",
        "background": "We want the Government to work with Ofqual to ensure that students are graded as generously in 2023 as they were in 2022, to reflect the disruption caused by covid-19 and upcoming strikes.",
