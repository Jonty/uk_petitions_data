        "additional_details": "Following the Covid-19 pandemic, it has been difficult for young people to enter the labour market. Especially for those without institutional support, feedback on job applications is invaluable. Employers often avoid giving feedback because of the large volume of applications they receive, however writing 1-2 lines of feedback appears relatively insignificant compared to reading a 1-page cover letter and CV. This process will reduce discrimination by holding employers to account.",
        "background": "Employers should be required by law to provide feedback to everyone who applies for a job and gets rejected. This should only be limited to job advertisements published by employers, and not include speculative job applications or applications only consisting of a CV.",
