        "action": "2022 final examinations for school and college leavers should be cancelled.",
        "additional_details": "There must be parity for this year's school and college leavers with previous years. The current year 11 and year 13 pupils have also had their education severely impacted since March 2020 but are still expected to sit final examinations in the summer of 2022. Previous years have been exempt from these examinations. We are also now in the middle of a further surge of infections from Omicron which means additional disruptions. It is unfair if examinations are allowed to continue this year.",
        "background": "2022 secondary school and college Leavers should not have to take the summer examinations due to previous and continuing disruptions to their education from the Covid virus.  It is unfair for these examinations to take place when these children have already faced vast deficits in their education.",
