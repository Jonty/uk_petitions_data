        "action": "Make kidney immunosuppressant medications exempt from prescription charges.",
        "additional_details": "After a transplant, you will have to take immunosuppressant medications for the rest of your life.  For people needing several items, it's a huge financial burden.  People with some medical conditions such as cancer and diabetes, where people need medications to stay alive, qualify for free prescriptions.  Immunosuppressant medications are also keeping people alive, so why do kidney disease sufferers not qualify for free prescriptions?  This makes no sense, it is unfair and it needs to change.",
        "background": "Some people with chronic kidney disease who are on dialysis may qualify for free prescriptions, but those who have had a transplant do not.  Transplants are a treatment, not a cure.",
