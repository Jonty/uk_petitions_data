        "additional_details": "The current approach taken is short sighted and is leading to increasing infection risks rather than containing them by increasing the amount of illegal fly tipping occurring across the country, and by requiring households to retain more waste materials on the their premises for longer. The nature of a waste & recycling centres involve little person to person contact in comparison to other areas already designated as key services, and so there is no reason a well managed service cannot be run.",

We petition the government to re-designate waste & recycling service workers as key workers during the current crisis, such that local councils can then re-open services",
