        "action": "Seek mutual recognition of professional qualifications between EU & GB",
        "additional_details": "Without recognition of qualifications, visas may be impossible to obtain for many UK Nationals. The tourist industry for one will suffer as well as international British professionals. If the UK truly wants to be a world influence in the future then we must protect the recognition of our qualifications in the EU. If we remove British workers from EU countries and continue to make it difficult for European businesses to employ UK Nationals our Economy and Education System will diminish. Visas are key.",
        "background": "British people across Europe are being forced to retrain or completely leave their jobs due to the UK not making any deal with the EU on mutual recognition of professional qualifications. Many careers are being ruined because employers can no longer employ them or are too afraid of complications.",
