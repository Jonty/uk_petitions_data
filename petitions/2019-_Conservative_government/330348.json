        "additional_details": "With China's recent human rights abuses of uighur muslims, and authoritarian persecution of Hong Kong residents including the forceful removal of democratically elected officials, the international community has an obligation to protect Taiwanese citizens.\r\n\r\nIn an increasingly globalised world, where authoritarian means of governing and disinformation can spread its roots, the protection of democracy is paramount to every democratic country's own national security.",
        "background": "Recognise Taiwan as an independent country and ask other countries to do the same. Support Taiwan in maintaining independence from the People's Republic of China.\r\n\r\nTaiwan recently voted overwhelmingly for a pro-independence president, despite a Chinese state-sponsored misinformation campaign.",
