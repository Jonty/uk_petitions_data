If I had been tested earlier by diagnosis would likely have been far better, and the cost of my treatment lower.\r\n \r\nEarly screening should help identify cases earlier, and could save money overall.\r\n",

Too many people under 50 are being given terminal cancer diagnoses. If screening was offered earlier more cases could be caught earlier, saving more people.",
