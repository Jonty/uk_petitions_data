Missing family and friends is extremely hard. I am a student, who is in lockdown in uni halls. I haven\u2019t seen my partner in over a month. I am missing him immensely. I know I\u2019m not the only one in this situation. These lockdowns have already had quite the effect on mental health, with the government providing little support. Maybe this is a way to help some people.",
