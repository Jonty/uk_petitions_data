        "additional_details": "With the increase in cost of living and the current economic climate many young people aged 16-17 are unable to provide for themselves. At this age young people are becoming more independent, taking driving lessons, and having to pay increased prices on public transport. Young people aged 16-17 are entitled to a minimum wage of \u00a34.81 but 18-year-olds are entitled to at least \u00a36.83. Increasing the minimum wage for 16-17 year olds could encourage young people to seek out employment.",
