        "additional_details": "Pubs need all the support they can get. The government could support the industry (and protect an already under-threat British cultural icon) by allowing them to once again sell alcohol for consumption off the premises during lockdown. This wouldn't cost the treasury a penny but would likely increase tax revenue and safeguard pubs and the jobs they provide.",
        "background": "During the first national lockdown, many small independent pubs survived by selling beer to be consumed off the premises. This time the government have prevented them from doing so. This is inconsistent and unfair as off licences and supermarkets can still sell alcohol.",
