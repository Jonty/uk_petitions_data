        "additional_details": "I\u2019d like the Government to add fruit allergies to the list of allergens that food businesses must tell customers about, and list on food labels.\r\n\r\nFruit allergies can be as potentially lethal as a nut allergy. Fruit allergies are admittedly rare, but often food businesses are woefully uninformed unless explained to them, but when one slice of something could potentially kill someone it\u2019s much more in the forefront of your mind, no matter how rare in this country that may be.",
        "background": "Someone we know has a very serious fruit allergy. This was very hard for them when they were younger as many people didn\u2019t think it existed, yet it\u2019s serious enough contact with someone who ate certain fruit could kill! We\u2019ve realised fruit allergies are almost totally ignored, and action is needed.",
