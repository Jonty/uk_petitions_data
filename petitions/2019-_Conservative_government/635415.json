        "additional_details": "I am married to a teacher and I am also a counsellor. I support many clients in counselling who work as teachers - they present with stress and mounting pressure to meet unattainable expectations leading to anxiety and depression and in some cases reports of bullying and pressure from SLT. The Government needs to put a wellbeing officer on SLT, who works in the best interests of teachers and school staff. Supporting teachers will then enable the profession to thrive rather than burnout.",
        "background": "Teachers and school staff are under huge amounts of pressure without acknowledgement of their wellbeing and no offers of long term sustainable support. A wellbeing officer for staff should sit on SLT.",
