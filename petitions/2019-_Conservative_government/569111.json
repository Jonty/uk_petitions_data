        "additional_details": "All team sport matches should be cancelled. There is a national lockdown in place and only televised team sports seem to be exempt from the rules. Even though they were cancelled in the March 2020 lockdown. There is a new variation of the virus which is more contagious. Yet sports people are still allowed to tackle, high five, kiss, hug and more without masks, visors or social distancing. If two women can't take a walk with a their teas without being fined, why is this permitted? Please ban it.",
        "background": "Cancel professional team sports, such as football, which cannot be, and are not being played with any Covid 19 restrictions enforced. Televised sport is still being played during the current national lockdown in England, despite the fact that those involved are not following any Covid regulations.",
