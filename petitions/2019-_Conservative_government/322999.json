        "additional_details": "When paying road tax we are charged from the beginning of the current month. This means we are paying for up to 30 days more tax than we need. Likewise, when taking a vehicle off the road, we are only refunded for complete unused months, again up to 30 days more tax than needed. This is unfair to everyone as each over-payment is random. It also further arbitrarily penalizes people who change vehicles more often or wish to take vehicles off the road from time to time for whatever reason.",
        "background": "Calculate road tax on a daily basis starting from the day you tax the vehicle and ending on the day you apply for a tax refund. Road tax is a significant expense for many and there is no justification for rounding it up to complete months in the Government's favor at both ends of the taxation period",
