        "additional_details": "It can take 5 weeks before new Universal Credit (UC) applications start paying and issuing UC advances forces impoverished people and families into debt. As a result, people often report difficulties repaying their UC advances out of their monthly UC payments, which can cause them to have to rely on food banks. Because of Covid-19 food banks are struggling with increased demand and reduced supply. Please urgently make sure impoverished children and adults don't go hungry because of UC advances.",

Do you have children under 18 who are likely to go without food and/or are at risk of becoming homeless if this application is not processed urgently?\" If so, process the application within 5 working days.",
