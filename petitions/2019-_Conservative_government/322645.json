        "additional_details": "We are deeply concerned by BA's recent announcement that it will be cutting up tp 12,000 jobs. Despite receiving millions in taxpayers funding through the job retention scheme and reportedly having billions in reserves. BA appears to be using the current crises as an opportunity to ruthlessly cut costs on the expense of its loyal staff.",
        "background": "British Airways is owned by International Airlines Group (IAG) which is an Anglo-Spanish multinational airline holding company with its registered office in Madrid, Spain. We want British Government to nationalise BA once and bring it back to its former glory.",
