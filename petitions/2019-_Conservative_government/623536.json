In 2020 alone, the UK had 5,224 deaths by suicide that equating to an average of 15 deaths per day.\r\n\r\nThe Government establishing and funding this initiative can also minimise unnecessary contact or connection with police services when what a person needs are connecting with a mobile crisis worker or anyone within the mental health sector and also will put less pressure on the 999-emergency number and the A&E departments.",
        "background": "By calling or texting 988, you'll connect with mental health professionals. Modelled after 999, the three-digit 988 is designed to be a memorable & quick number that connects people who are suicidal or in any other mental health crisis to a trained mental health professional.",
