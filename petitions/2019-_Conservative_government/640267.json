        "additional_details": "The same privacy laws and contractual protections the banks currently offer their clients must be preserved. UK residents must enjoy the same protection of their moneys as are currently in place. Purchases must not be traceable to the product and the balance must be immediately withdraw-able as cash and balances must not be programmable. All this must be laid down in law before any new system is introduced. The same audits, rules and regulations must apply to any so called new players.",
        "background": "The introduction of the Digital Pound must not infringe on citizens current freedoms and rights. The state must never be allowed to freeze bank accounts or implement any social credit system or influence in any way how UK residents spend their money or what they can do with it.",
