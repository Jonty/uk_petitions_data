Anybody will travel at this time if they can't work from home. This will therefore not ease congestion or assist with social distancing. By not only reversing this but making all possible jobs done at home, congestion on trains when people go to work will hopefully become easier",
        "background": "Since covid Govia Thameslink stopped all people\u2019s freedom passes everyday until 9.30am. As a result these vulnerable people pay up to \u00a38 when they travel. They must reverse this decision. The govt must give Emergency Funding for All Transport Services and make as many jobs as possible done at home.",
