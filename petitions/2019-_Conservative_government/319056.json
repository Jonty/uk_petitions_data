We\u2019ve lost many lives and they\u2019ve been fighting the virus on the frontline, As we label this \u201cA war without a visible enemy\u201d We have great doctors & pharmacists helping us really tackle what we cannot see with their knowledge and expertise, They deserve way more than a clap. We need to honour each worker!",
