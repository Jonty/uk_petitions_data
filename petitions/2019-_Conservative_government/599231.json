        "additional_details": "Official police items and replicas are sold on many online platforms. This allows anyone to purchase and acquire real or official-looking items, which could be used to commit crime.\r\n \r\nImpersonating a police officer has been an issue for a long time, destroying the public's confidence in the police. Many incidents are circulated on news and social media of robberies, thefts, and other forms of crime committed with the unauthorised use of police uniforms and equipment. The current legislation allows these items to be sold online without much consequence, enabling crime. The Government should ban the sale of these items.",
