        "additional_details": "We no longer have confidence in the ability or motivation of our local Trust to provide cost effective, patient friendly, accessible hospital services or facilities. They consistently refuse to properly consider a centrally located clear site, where all West Herts people can conveniently access A & E & other acute services. They wish to splash \u00a31.25 billion (\u00a31.1 billion on Watford & \u00a3150 million refurbishing St Albans & Hemel) instead of a new central hospital at half the cost & no disruption.",
        "background": "We want the Government to stop West Herts NHS Hospitals Trust spending \u00a31.1 billion on a skyscraper hospital built on the cramped, existing site next door to Watford Football Club. We want a completely new hospital run by a better provider, more centrally located for all the people of West Herts.",
