        "additional_details": "There are households who are struggling to pay the bills due to the fact of having to isolate due to covid-19. Its unfair that key workers recieve this treatment and other workers are given 80% of the wages. Its very common in the care sector to only be paid Statutory Sick Pay which would normally be OK but at this difficult time having to be off for 2 weeks or more whilst being paid 90 a week isn't enough to survive on.",
        "background": "In this difficult time all key workers who are risking their lives should be paid full wages or 80% if they catch covid-19! At this time lots of key workers are struggling due to the fact they're only getting Statutory Sick Pay.",
