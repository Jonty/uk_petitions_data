        "additional_details": "My personal experience has been that current mechanisms to ensure child maintenance is paid are inadequate to extract payment from a parent who refuses to prioritise the wellbeing of their own children.\r\n \r\nNon-payment of child maintenance is a particular issue in cases of domestic abuse, where a parent may be unable to escape abuse and poverty if child maintenance is not paid.\r\nThe consequences for failing to pay child maintenance need to be stringent. Making non-payment of child maintenance a criminal offence would be a start.\r\n",
        "background": "I strongly believe the existing legislation around child maintenance payments is failing thousands of children. The legislation needs to create real penalties for non-payment, by making refusal to pay child maintenance a criminal offence.",
