        "action": "Require rear facing car seats for children under 18kg, 105cm tall or 4 years",
        "additional_details": "A rear facing seat will absorb most of the collision forces and supports the head; neck and spine. The seat keeps the spine aligned and limits damaging movement. When children ride forward facing, their heads - which for toddlers are disproportionately large and heavy are thrown forward. This can result in spine and head injuries such as fracture of the cervical vertebrae and internal decapitation. Organisations such as the NHS and Good Egg are already recommending rear facing car seats for longer.",
        "background": "To ensure all infants involved in RTCs have the best chance of survival. Current law allows parents with lack of knowledge to put their infants in potential danger without even knowing. Although guidance is there, many infants are being put into forward facing seats as this isn't against the law.",
