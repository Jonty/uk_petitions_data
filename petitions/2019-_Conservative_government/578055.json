        "additional_details": "Being the youngest in his school year, his birthday is in July. Fellow pupils born in September are 10 months older. This puts him at a disadvantage keeping up with his peers, saving for driving lessons, cars, driving licences, car insurance, UNI, living etc, for 10 months. People born in September on minimum wage of \u00a36.56 and the 17 year olds are on \u00a34.62 a difference of \u00a31.94 per hour \u00a315.52 for one 8 hour shift. They are then suddenly told that they are now not equal because of their age.",
        "background": "When a pupil leaves school they should all be treated equally and given the same start in life. A few months in age should not be put in their way. They should be given the same wage. It\u2019s only become apparent to me as my son left school. Started attending college and getting a part time job.",
