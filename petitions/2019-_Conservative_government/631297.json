I never asked for Brexit and I certainly don't give them permission to scrape thousands of laws. This is what Brexit was really about. Taking the working person rights away. STOP THE TORRIES and the likes of  Rees-Mogg making decisions that will effect this country for generations. This is the biggest \r\nthreat to sovereignty, which Brexit was meant to save. Stand up and be counted!",
