Mansfield is one of the worse ones! Going to my gym from Alfreton to Mansfield feels like going on a off road day trip! Without a SUV or a car with comfortable suspension the drive is really horrible. It\u2019s not about just my comfort - One day it will cause a motorcyclist to crash and die.",

You can report a pothole here: https://www.gov.uk/report-pothole\r\n\r\nYou may be able to claim compensation if your vehicle has been damaged by a road. You can find out more about this here: https://www.gov.uk/claim-for-damage-to-your-vehicle\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling on the Government to introduce fines for local authorities that fail to meet their obligations to maintain the highways they are responsible for, if that's what you want to happen.\r\n\r\nWe have also published the following petition, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nCompulsory annual safety inspections on roads throughout England: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/654090"
