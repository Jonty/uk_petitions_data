        "additional_details": "Since the completion of the successful Government sanctioned River Otter Beaver trial, and despite Natural England promoting the clear benefits of beavers to communities, there has not been a change in the current Government policy, restricting beaver release to enclosures. This is stopping communities across England from benefitting from the water engineering skills of beavers, which could protect villages, towns and cities from flooding.",
