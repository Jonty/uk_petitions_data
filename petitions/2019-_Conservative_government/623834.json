        "additional_details": "Teachers are payed an average of \u00a39000 more than further education teachers in the UK, despite FE teachers giving equal if not more effort into teaching the next generation and preparing them for the future. Many further education teachers are faced with needing to access food banks and not being able to afford heating due to this crisis. These essential members of our country should not be struggling to make ends meet whilst the government has the budget to help.",
        "background": "It is urgent that the government increases the pay of further education teachers in order to keep up with the disparity between their pay and the real cost of living in the UK. This is not only affecting these individuals, but also students whilst strikes are in action.",
