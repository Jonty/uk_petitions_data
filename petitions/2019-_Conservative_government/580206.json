        "additional_details": "Many buildings are due to have automatic Fire-door closing devices fitted as part of legislation in the next few years. I would like the government to direct councils and PFI management companies to fit the fixings immediately in order to protect people during this pandemic, and hopefully avoid another lockdown.",
        "background": "Currently fire doors have to be closed, meaning classrooms that have them are not adequately ventilated. This is essential during COVID as we know ventilation helps prevent the spread of the virus indoors. Consequently staff, students and families are being out at greater risk of COVID.",
