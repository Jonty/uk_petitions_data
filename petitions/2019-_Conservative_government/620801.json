        "additional_details": "Following the fourth death in four years in Clacton on sea (all within the same small proximity beside the pier) and the other deaths reported this week of people drowning off of our coast line I think that much more needs to be done to educate people of the dangers you can find yourself in when swimming in the sea.  More information on the currents and rip tides need to be given. With more people holidaying in the UK than ever a nationwide campaign is essential as well as far more signage on piers and information to go out to schools to teach all ages how to cope in an emergency.  A TV campaign at peak times should be broadcast as a health advisory just as other subjects have been. A day at the seaside should not end in tragedy.",
        "background": "I would like the government to have a campaign both in schools, on piers as hoarding as well as a TV campaign to show the dangers of swimming in the sea and  to educate people on currents.",
