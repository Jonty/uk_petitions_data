        "additional_details": "At present, a couple could be buying their first home together, but if either of them has owned their own home in the past they will not be eligible for the stamp duty exemption. This is true even if one of them is a first time buyer and neither of them currently owns a home, and might not have done so for many years. This means that people who do not qualify for the exemption have to save up more money to pay for the stamp duty.",
        "background": "I would like the government to allow homebuyers who haven\u2019t owned a property in the last 10 years to qualify for the first time buyer stamp duty exemption. Especially when said person is buying jointly with a first time buyer who will now lose their entitlement if they buy together.",
