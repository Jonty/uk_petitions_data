        "additional_details": "Though leaded petrol is banned from UK market, it is still being burned over our children\u2019s heads in the form of fuel for small aircraft. This poisons our atmosphere with extremely neurotoxic lead and its compounds. This is no longer acceptable in 2023, when the aviation industry has had ample time to fix the issue. There are no safe levels of lead in atmosphere nor in the human body. The NHS does not have solution to lead poisoning.",
