There are many teens like me who are already politically involved, and many more who would follow politics more if they could vote and be heard.",
        "background": "16 and 17 year olds are currently not allowed to vote in any UK elections in England, but this must change. Allowing 16 and 17 year olds to vote in mayoral elections would mean we can be part of the democratic processes that our country is built on, and we can have a say in how our cities are run.",
