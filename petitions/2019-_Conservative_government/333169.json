        "additional_details": "Not only will this affect those who already have eating disorders, but it will also put potential sufferers and people who have survived an eating disorder at significant risk. According to the NHS website, girls aged 13-17 are the most vulnerable in regard to eating disorders; this is a section of the population that is already mercilessly targeted by social media and society\u2019s expectations. Why is our government trying to put them in danger?",
        "background": "The strategy has not been thought through sufficiently. According to beateatingdisorders.org.uk, 1.25 million people in the UK currently have an eating disorder. This strategy is likely to antagonise their illnesses and put every single one of them at risk.",
