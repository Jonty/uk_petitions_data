        "action": "Reverse the grading system that downgraded disadvantaged pupils",
        "additional_details": "The A-Level cohort for 2020 saw almost 40% of students have their teacher assessed results downgraded. These grades are not a reflection of our effort and ability, but of the perception that OFQUAL has of traditionally working-class students. The degradation of state schools has been contrasted by the increase in As and A*s from independent schools.\r\n\r\nDespite the news that students will be able to appeal based on their mock examinations, no information on how to go about this has been released.",
        "background": "We demand the government reverse the grading system imposed on this years A-Level cohort. Students should recieve their Centre Assessed Grades, based on mock results and other assessed work as opposed to an algorithm that penalises state schools, aswell as information on the appeals process.",
