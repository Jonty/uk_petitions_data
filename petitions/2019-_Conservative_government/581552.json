We need to act fast to reduce waiting times and allow people access to vital mental health services. Systems need to be put in place for hospitals and GPS to quickly connect and refer patients, allowing self harm victims to leave hospital without support is crazy. Lives will be lost if we do not act now! Even people who had no mental health problems before covid are struggling and the support is not available.",

Damage has been done and as a nation we need to invest in the MH support for everyone who has ongoing or new mental health problems.",
