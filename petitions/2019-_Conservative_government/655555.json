        "additional_details": "My experience highlights the need for this ban. My cat, in its last days, was tormented by these deterrents in surrounding gardens, making our garden unwelcoming. Additionally, the noise disturbed our peace. This reflects a wider issue which I believe affects many, compromising animal welfare and community tranquillity. I believe banning these devices is essential for protecting animals and ensuring peaceful living spaces for residents.",
        "background": "I request that the UK Government and Parliament legislate to ban high-pitched cat deterrents nationwide. I believe these devices that emit sounds distressing to cats must be prohibited for animal welfare and neighbourhood harmony.",
