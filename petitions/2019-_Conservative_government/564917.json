        "additional_details": "The Erasmus programme holds innumerable benefits; the Russell Group themselves have cited higher academic attainment, enhanced employment prospects, and critical development of interpersonal and diplomatic skills in those British students whom have participated. It's universally recognised that intellectual and business competitiveness are enhanced by international co-operation and exchange; hence, membership of this programme will strengthen both the prospects of our citizenry and our country.",
        "background": "The Brexit deal that has been agreed as of 24/12/2020 terminates British participation in the widely-renowned Erasmus exchange programme. To maintain British intellectual and business dynamism, and to provide a novel opportunity for personal development, the government should rejoin the scheme.",
