        "action": "Close universities down for appropriate amount of time amidst COVID-19",
        "additional_details": "We would like the Government or Parliament to enforce this action due to the growing fear among parents and students that attend university. The ability to focus or concentrate is affected in addition to the growing fears of the Corona-virus. In our view, the government and health officials around the world are more 'reactive' rather than 'proactive'. This will result in more spread as time is given for the virus to do so. We hope to come to an agreement as soon as possible in a timely manner.",
        "background": "We would like the government to at least consider closing universities down in the coming weeks or as soon as possible, in addition to taking necessary actions to prevent further spread.",
