        "additional_details": "Young adults of today need to know more about how to check their breasts or testicles correctly and I therefore worry that many of them fail to do this on a regular basis if at all. There is a stigma attached to smear tests where girls are embarrassed to go and get checked and this is so important for their health with the prediction of 1 in 2 people having some form of cancer in their lifetime. This could help save lives.",
        "background": "Make it compulsory for children to be taught how to check for unusual lumps in their breast or testicles as part of the key stage 3 curriculum. This could then include discussions around the importance of smear tests and contacting GPS when unusual lumps are found with less embarrassment.",
