        "additional_details": "As a result of Brexit the pet passports, which pet owners paid considerable money to get and maintain, are now no longer accepted. These forms are required for each pet every time they travel to the EU. When you have several pets and travel multiple times a year to the EU this could result in costing hundreds if not thousands of pounds. \r\nThis means that british citizens are at a financial and bureaucratic disadvantage as a result of brexit. The certificate costs around \u00a3125 on average per animal plus updated vaccinations. Whereas once you had the initial passport the only cost was maintainance of the booster.",
        "background": "Regulate the costs to make it easy to obtain a certificate. If owners have the information and evidence and it is simply the vet completing a form. they should not be charged different and unaffordable amounts.",
