Mental health is such a worrying thing and on the increase daily that surely this should be taken seriously into consideration along with all the other points.\r\nWe would like the government/parliament to take action as we have tried the local council in the past and nothing has been done to ensure/ guarantee the continued opening of our local adventure play /park areas",
