        "additional_details": "Cancel IGCSEs summer 2021 is the only method for lowering the unfairness and ensuring every single student will be able to be assessed in the same position. COVID-19 is a global pandemic that affects people across the world, especially in the UK. Schools are closed for the majority of students for weeks and weeks. Remote learning isn\u2019t working the best for every single person, as some hasn\u2019t got devices. It\u2019s absolutely unfair that IGCSE students still have to face the public exams as normal!",
        "background": "Cancel IGCSEs public exams! The pandemic causes many losses to IGCSE students of this year. Mr Boris Johnson announced on 4th of January 2021 that all exams in summer 2021 have been cancelled and made an alternative measurement for students to lower the unfairness, which also includes GCSEs.",
