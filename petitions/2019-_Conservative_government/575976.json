        "additional_details": "Commonwealth service personnel pay the ultimate price in-service. if they are unable to pay these exorbitant Visa fees to regularise their stay after their discharge, including medical discharge, they face being deported. We believe this affects their fundamental human rights as some of them may have sustained injuries or raised families here, and being made to leave the country could mean access to less good health services, and ending up losing their lives and families.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to abolish or reduce existing immigration fees for Commonwealth Personnel to stay in the UK, which are currently almost \u00a32,500. The Government should either scrap these fees or at the very least give a 50% discount in recognition of their service to this country.",
