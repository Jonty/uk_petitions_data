        "additional_details": "I am a nurse and many of my friends and family are nurses/midwifes. Most of us struggle on the wage we are currently on. The 1% pay rise we where given was next to nothing it amounted to an extra maybe \u00a3200 a year? Probably doesn\u2019t even cover the cost of parking/ work related travel for most. I could Go on and on but eventually I think there will come a point nobody will want to apply to be a nurse anymore. I know so many who drop out of training or quit and find another form of employment.",
        "background": "Nurses received roughly a 1% increase in their pay. We never ever get a proper increase in our pay and sometimes you can actually get more money for working in retail shops that require no degree, no responsibility, cause far less stress etc etc.\r\nIt\u2019s about time we where given a proper wage.",
