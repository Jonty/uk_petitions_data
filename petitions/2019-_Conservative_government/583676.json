In many places, the local team is paramount to maintaining community cohesion and a sense of identity. Income for local teams provides facilities, jobs and hope for so many. \r\n\r\nThe European Super League, which will operate as a closed shop cartel - guaranteeing that the 'big' clubs involved maintain and grow their dominance, will take money and attention out of the domestic game and lead to its demise.",

It won't be forgotten.",
