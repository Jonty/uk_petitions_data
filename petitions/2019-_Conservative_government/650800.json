        "additional_details": "Homelessness is not a lifestyle choice and the government would be best served by providing adequate and secure accommodation off the streets with access to local services to support them with their issues. Abandoned buildings and mills could be utilised to provide shelter for those in need.\r\n\r\nWe object to the narrative and language of the Home Secretary seeking to demonise and distract the British people by exploiting the circumstances of vulnerable people for political gain.",
        "background": "The proposal from Suella Braverman to criminalise homelessness by preventing charities from offering tents and aid to those less fortunate on our streets is inhumane and should be rejected immediately.",
