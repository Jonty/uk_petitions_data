        "additional_details": "Get rid of the rule that you have to be double jabbed and let people live with covid. Those who want the jab or need it will have it and those that don\u2019t can live with their choices accordingly. We can\u2019t be on restricted lives forever. People will die at the end of the day and it\u2019s a hard truth we have to live with. There\u2019s never going to be a time where there isn\u2019t illness threatening all of our lives so let us actually make the most of them whilst we can! Especially after the year we\u2019ve had.",
        "background": "We should not be required to be double dosed in order to go out. People that are double jabbed are able to go on holiday without isolating. These are the people that will then be mingling in large social events. Without them isolating they\u2019ll be the ones spreading the virus! Let everyone live!",
