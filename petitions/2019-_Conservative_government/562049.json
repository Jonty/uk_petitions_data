        "additional_details": "The growth of zero hours contracts used by companies has become an excuse to not give workers what they would normally be entitled to. People are missing out on holiday pay, pension rights, sick pay and being left in the lurch regarding what hours / days they work. By enforcing the 50% turnover in three month rule this would protect seasonal working companies, and restrict other companies from just using zero hours contracts as a way to lower employment rights.",
        "background": "The Government needs to restrict the use of zero hours contracts to companies who have a genuine reason for using such contracts. I propose that companies are only allowed to use zero hours contracts where they have at least 50% of annual turnover during a single three-month period.",
