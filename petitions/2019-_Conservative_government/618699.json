        "additional_details": "Young people on low incomes specifically have been hit hard by the cost of the living crisis on top of alienating rises in national insurance recently.  \r\nThe government needs to pull itself together and realise that people can't afford to live and give their hard-earned money to older, wealthier people at the same time. \r\nIf social care needs extra funding, a charity donation scheme should be set up instead of forcing struggling, hard workers to pay for it",
        "background": "I propose that the personal allowance is put up to \u00a315,000 as the extra \u00a370.00 in 2021 is useless for people when inflation is pushing 10% and national insurance rises aim to force the poor to fund the social care of older, wealthier homeowners.",
