        "additional_details": "We believe the role of Minister of State for Disabled People, Health and Work is vitally important, with responsibilities including disability policy and cross-government responsibility for disabled people, disability employment and financial support for those at risk of falling out of work, and disabled claimants.\r\n \r\nOn Thursday the 7th December 2023, the Rt Hon Tom Pursglove MP was moved to an immigration post, leaving this position empty. We believe the failure to appoint a new Minister of State leaves disabled people with a sense of uncertainly which needs correcting.\r\n",
        "background": "On Thursday 7th December 2023, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, removed from post the Minister of State for Disabled People, Health and Work. A new Minister of State has not been appointed, although most of the responsibilities have been given to more junior minister at the Department.",
