        "additional_details": "I believe that many people on the road do not drive to an acceptable standard, and requiring regular retesting would ensure that people had to demonstrate they can still drive safely. Many people pass their test and then don\u2019t drive again for a long time, or their ability to drive deteriorates over time. This can lead to bad divining which poses a danger to others on the road, and pedestrians. Reform could help reduce collisions and the injuries and deaths that result.",
        "background": "Every 10 years after one passes their driving test, they should be legally required to retake their driving test, with licences becoming invalid if a test is not retaken. When one reaches 70, this should be reduced to every 3-5 years. The retake could be less strict than the original.",
