Because I'm on an emergency tax code, I am charged a higher amount of tax. This has made it extremely difficult for me as I've not been receiving anywhere near my full pay. I know I am not alone here. I understand that this tax is refundable once I have a consistent employer, however these wages have been heavily taxed at the time where I need money the most!",
