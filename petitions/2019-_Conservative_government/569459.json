        "action": "Extend mortgage and credit/loan holiday payments to 9-12 months.",
        "additional_details": "So many self employed are not working, unlike furloughed staff who are still receiving weekly/monthly payments, we have nothing coming in, but still have to provide a roof over our heads for our families. With the 4th SEISS grant not available until April, the 3rd paid in December to cover Nov-Jan has now gone. Especially if like myself you have not been legally allowed to work (beauty therapist) extending payment holidays until the country can get into work again will help so many of us.",
        "background": "The 6 month holiday payments have helped massively through 2020, now entering into 2021 and a national lockdown, so many of us are not working and have run out of funds to pay out mortgage and household bills, on top of daily food and debts. Please extend to 9-12 months.",
