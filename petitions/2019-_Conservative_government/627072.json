        "additional_details": "I think this should happen because if there are no fields or green space, then there is nowhere for trees to grow and therefore no way to turn CO2 into oxygen for us to breathe so we can stay alive and the less plants there are, the less oxygen there is for us to breathe so it could lead to very significant health problems. Without a plan like this, there will be a huge lack of biodiversity which could lead to extinction for many animals and then lack of food for us.",
        "background": "At least 20% of the town's total area must be kept as undeveloped green space. Every time I go somewhere, I see people tearing up fields to make room for new roads when the roads still work and I think that one day soon, there will be limited green space left only CO2 and a lack of biodiversity.",
