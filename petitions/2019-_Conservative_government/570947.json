Swapping one metropolitan city, like London, for another, like Leeds, is not going to lead to more investment and better policy making for towns, villages and rural areas. The centre of power needs to reflect and be based in communities that are most affected by lack of investment and locating it here will lead to more investment and better outcomes for local people.",
