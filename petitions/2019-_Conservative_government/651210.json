        "additional_details": "Many supermarkets do not accept points or vouchers towards baby formula and supermarkets are not able to offer the product in any deals either. This makes it much more expensive for caregivers \u2013 who may be unable to breastfeed \u2013 with some struggling families resorting to stealing baby formula. Data from First Steps Nutrition shows that the cheapest brand of formula milk has risen by 45% over the last couple of years.",
        "background": "Urgently amend infant formula legislation to allow retailers to offer promotional deals and discounts for baby formula, and to make it clear that retailers can accept loyalty points, food bank vouchers and store gift cards as payment for infant formula.",
