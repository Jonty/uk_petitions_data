        "additional_details": "With a serious increase in house prices, purchasing a house with a partner limits the options to remain eligible for the 25% ISA bonus.\r\n\r\nFor example, a 3 bedroom semi-detached house in Staffordshire you can expect to pay in excess of \u00a3280,000. Losing out on this bonus would be a real shame to couples purchasing their first property together with starting a family in mind.\r\n\r\nBringing the maximum price in line with house price increases in recent years would ensure the incentive remains current.",
