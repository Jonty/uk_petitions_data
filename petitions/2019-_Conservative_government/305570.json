        "additional_details": "I want the government to do this because it is the right thing to do. Our elderly should be cherished and respected in our society, they deserve to live on but with hoarding and panic buying increasing, the chances of your grandma, grandad, parents etc, surviving decrease and that\u2019s not good enough. The government should supply items such as canned foods, toilet roll, pet food, bread, sauces, pasta and any other essential goods to ensure that our elderly and vulnerable who can\u2019t get out, survive",
        "background": "I want the government to supply the elderly and vulnerable with care packages during the Coronavirus outbreak. Elderly people aren\u2019t able to collect the basic supplies they need to survive the isolation phase. I work in a store and I see that they\u2019re unable to get the basic needs because of hoarding",
