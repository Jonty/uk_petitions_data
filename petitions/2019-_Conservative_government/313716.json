        "additional_details": "Comparing student ability is unfair practice as it depends on the class and school. Ranking students involves a teacher bias, meaning that instead of student ability being based on personal attainment, it\u2019s subject to the teacher\u2019s belief- even if it is based on previous data.",
        "background": "To have A-levels and GCSEs to be graded through personal attainment, rather than comparing student\u2019s grades within the class. This is more fair, as the student\u2019s personal effort is considered instead",
