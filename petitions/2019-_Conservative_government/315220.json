Remove the suit.\r\nSuit must be - comfortable, water and air proof.\r\nElectronic device - control citizen location, temperature, if comply with advice.\r\nAdvantages:\r\n1. The physical barrier should eliminate the host - virus carrier.\r\n2. Those who do not comply - isolate by police.\r\n3. Multi-use - any future epidemic. \r\n\r\n2-3 weeks - all back to normal.",

Each suit must come with smart-watch like device to control: a). Integrity of the suit; b). Location - indoor or outdoor; c). Temperature.\r\n3. Wear for 3 weeks.",
