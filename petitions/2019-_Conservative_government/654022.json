        "additional_details": "The environment contains many valuable resources for life on earth e.g. clean air to breath, clean water to drink, soil and pollinators for food, and natural habitats for climate change resilience. In 1997 one estimate put the global value of global ecosystem services at US$33 trillion per year (\u2018The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital\u2019, Nature journal). A similar Bill has recently been proposed in the Scottish Parliament.",

This is to maintain the functioning of these valuable natural assets, and help meet climate and biodiversity targets.",
