        "additional_details": "We believe there has not been adequate consultation with the Cumbrian public on the proposals to restructure local government, something that will have effects on the lives of all living in the county. To take such a step at a time when many are struggling with the effects of the pandemic, when no public meetings or protests could be held is undemocratic and unacceptable.",
        "background": "Legislation to create unitary councils in Cumbria should be postponed until a referendum is held on these plans. To inform this the public should be informed of the logistical and cost implications of maintaining the status quo, forming a unitary council, or two councils, in the short and long term.",
