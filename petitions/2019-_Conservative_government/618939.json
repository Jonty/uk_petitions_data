        "additional_details": "Currently free childcare is only available for two year olds if the family is in receipt of certain benefits, or the child meets certain conditions.\r\n \r\nWe believe giving free childcare from the age of 2 would encourage many parents to get back to work sooner, and should generate more income tax to help cover the cost of free childcare provision, while also helping so many families increase their household income in a very challenging climate.\r\n",
        "background": "Cost of living crisis is real, and the measures put in place only just scratch the surface. Too many families are unable to have both parents work as childcare is so costly. If free childcare was available from 2 more could go to work and in turn more would pay tax to cover the extra funding needed.",
