        "additional_details": "Scottish people who moved to England, Wales and NI were able to do so because we are a United Kingdom. We relocate for jobs, families and opportunities. We shouldn't need to move back just to have a say on the future of our country. We have moved around a union, not abroad. Our vote matters in this. Please consider requiring the Scottish Government to give us the say that we deserve.",
        "background": "Scottish people who now live in England, Wales or NI were denied a vote in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. This means roughly 800,000 Scots were denied a vote on independence. We ask that the UK Gov require the Scottish Gov to give these Scottish people a vote in any future referendums.",
