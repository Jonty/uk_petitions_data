        "additional_details": "In response to this, I propose the Government provide funding for PPE recycling schemes, with facilities made available for public use. This could include PPE recycling positioned outside a variety of supermarkets in the UK. This would better enable a return from this pandemic sustainably. The government can make real change in enabling the country to better dispose of its PPE.",
        "background": "The pandemic has completely reshaped our priorities, we have become dependant on the use of PPE to protect ourselves from the dangers posed by Covid 19. How this PPE is discarded however poses a significant threat to the environment and our climate. The Government must enable recycling of PPE.",
