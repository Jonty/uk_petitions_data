        "additional_details": "As Russia increases its control over Ukraine, it is vital that an armed resistance is properly equipped to undermine the occupying forces in Russian-held territory. Every Russian working to support the occupation must be made to feel unsafe, day and night, and to live in constant fear of attack. Unremitting casualties will sap the will of the Russian people to support the occupation and, ultimately, Vladimir Putin himself.",
        "background": "Direct the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) and HM Armed Forces to identify resistance fighters in Russian-occupied areas of Ukrainian territory, and supply them with weapons, ammunition, and any other practical assistance they require.",
