        "additional_details": "Holding multiple viewings in a global health crisis clearly breaches the PM's message of unnecessary contact and social distancing.  It is quite apparent that as Universities have closed their onsite facilities, there would be no \"replacement students\" to obtain. Landlords have been granted a three month mortgage holiday, so they have been protected from losses in this outbreak. Students have had their part time jobs cancelled. It should be implemented immediately after the mandatory Lockdown.",
        "background": "Student landlords must offer a no penalty release from tenancy contracts for students financially affected by COVID-19. All Universities have now closed their campuses. University halls have given tenants the option to end contracts early.There are no replacement student tenants at this time.",
