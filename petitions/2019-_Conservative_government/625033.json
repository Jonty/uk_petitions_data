        "additional_details": "I am asking the government to look into creating a Purple Footprint badge, that can be given out in community hubs like libraries and businesses, where anyone can take one and when they wear it, it is a small sign, they would like to start a friendly chat that is non clinical or expert. This will help more people to start conversations, they might not otherwise have without the need to say any words and a great way to promote, more community inclusivity.",
        "background": "Across England there are many people who experience loneliness on a daily basis and don\u2019t interact with anyone. Often when they are in the local community, starting a friendly chat can be a real challenge and finding a way to know someone else wants to chat. The footprint represents non judgment.",
