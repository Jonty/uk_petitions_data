        "background": "The government joined an EU-wide ban on Thiamethoxam insecticides two years ago, and pledged to uphold its stance. Recently a regressive approval has been passed to allow their use. Studies prove they seriously inhibit pollinator larvae development, weaken their immune systems, and prevent flying.",
