        "additional_details": "Insurance providers can charge an extortionate amount of money for their services, sometimes, even more than the car being insured is worth. This is harmful to many low-income households who need to own a car but can't afford insurance. Young people are charged more whether they are a good driver or not, which is unfair as many don't earn as much as adults.\r\nIt is my belief that, if it is the law to insure your vehicle, the Government should be the primary backer for that insurance.",
        "background": "This scheme could offer more affordable premiums to everyone. It is the law to have car insurance, so, why should motorists be placed at the mercy of private providers and extortionate prices?",
