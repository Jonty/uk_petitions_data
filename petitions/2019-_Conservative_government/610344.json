The BSL interpreter is able to provide clarification that is equivalent to the support provided by an Oral Language Modifier (OLM).\r\n\r\nIt is possible for candidates who are both deaf BSL users and have learning disabilities to receive support from a BSL interpreter and OLM. Deciding what adjustments are necessary for individual candidates is an operational matter for the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency.\r\n\r\nIf you are unhappy with the arrangements for a driving theory test, you can find out how to complain to the DVSA here: https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/driver-and-vehicle-standards-agency/about/complaints-procedure"
