        "additional_details": "The Bereavement Scheme was announced on the 20th May 2020 for family members and dependants of NHS workers and independent health and social care workers who have died as a result of contracting COVID-19. Whilst the announcement was welcomed, it has been confirmed by the UKVI that this policy was designed to have a very small impact. This leaves many families behind, including NHS and care workers, to pay the extortionate fee and wait six months or beyond to be granted indefinite leave to remain",
