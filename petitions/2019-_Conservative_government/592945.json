        "additional_details": "Nightclubs and similar venues had been closed for nearly 490 days when this was announced. \r\nI do not believe that this rule is meant to protect anyone, only coerce younger people to get vaccinated. A double vaccinated individual can still catch and pass covid on. So my question is: if I have 2 jabs and also covid am I more welcome to absolute freedom than if I had 0 jabs and no covid? \r\nNow is the time for freedom.\r\nSay no to this rule. \r\nWe are young and healthy.",
        "background": "From the end of September 2021 the government wants to introduce vaccine passports as a requirement to enter large/ crowded indoor venues such as nightclubs. This was announced just as restrictions were lifted on the 19th.",
