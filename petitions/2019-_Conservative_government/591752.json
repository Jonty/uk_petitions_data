The players will be feeling bad enough , but to see the online racist abuse that people have been giving towards the players is heartbreaking. I just want it to stop, people need to be punished. What has race got to do with the end result of football. This is going to knock the players back so much and spiral their mental health. I have been extremely emotional about this all day, I cannot imagine how the players are feeling. Totally ashamed.",
