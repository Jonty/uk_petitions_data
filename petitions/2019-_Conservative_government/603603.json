        "additional_details": "Assessments could happen when a person enters the care system or via a CAHMS referral, or where an assessment has not yet been done when a person is arrested, to ensure our most vulnerable children would be protected.\r\n \r\nWe believe children are at present being unfairly criminalised when their intellectual or emotional age is below their peers. This can lead to people circulating through the criminal justice system or foster system, accumulating more abuse and trauma along the way, which also wastes public funds. Let's help those who can\u2019t help themselves.",
        "background": "The Government should implement a new law, so that children who have suffered abuse, neglect, trauma, have attachment difficulties, PTSD, ADHD, Autism, FASD or other neuro-developmental differences are assessed to determine whether or not they should be treated as being criminally responsible.",
