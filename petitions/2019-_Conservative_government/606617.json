        "additional_details": "The BBC is a much valued institution around the world.  As much as the Government might love them not to report against them, we believe they remain honest and balanced. The BBC provides an important service, and should continue to have a funding model that enables it to continue to provide its services in a way that meets the needs, desires and wishes of all members of society and not just carry content that can be made profitable.",
        "background": "The Government is considering getting rid of the TV licence in 2027. No alternative method of raising the funds has been put forward.  I believe it should be from the Government purse and included in general taxation. Funding should be ring fenced at the current level plus a minimum of inflation.",
