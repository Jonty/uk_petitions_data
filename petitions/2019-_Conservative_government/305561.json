        "action": "Cancel every single benefit sanction during the current coronavirus crisis.",
        "additional_details": "Almost anyone can be sanctioned, whether they are in work or not. People have been sanctioned for attending their own parents funerals instead of job centre appointments. People have been punished for going to job interviews rather than attending a job centre appointment. People have lost hundreds, even thousands of pounds in support just for being a few minutes late to an appointment. The government needs to look at suspending all sanctions during this unprecedented time of need.",
        "background": "Benefit sanctions have long been overly cruel and used for the tiniest infractions such as being just a few minutes late for a job centre appointment. Some claiments have been hit with sanctions of up to 3 years in duration. During the current crisis I beg that the government suspends all sanctions.",
