        "action": "Make vegan meals available in all public buildings.",
        "additional_details": "In our society we are taught from an early age that eating animal products is what humans do. It becomes normal. If proper vegan meals were available as normal people would realise that animal free meals are tasty, filling and nutritious and not just a jacket potato without cheese or salad.\r\nPlant based food is also a more healthy option and most importantly cuts carbon emissions. People could choose a plant based meal without feeling they were different or labelled.",
        "background": "In 2017 Portugal passed a law that made it illegal not to provide vegan friendly food in public buildings. It was widely expected that the UK would follow soon after. We are still waiting. People who want to live kindly or healthily should not be expected to be only provided with chips for a meal!",
