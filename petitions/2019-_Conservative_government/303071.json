The government should take actions ASAP, as the virus is spreading and there are more deaths every day.",
        "background": "Sack Boris Johnson as his response to the current situation with COVID-19 is very poor, locking down 70 years old in house for 4 months won\u2019t solve the problem. His actions are poor and not enough. People as scared looking at what other countries are doing to prevent the virus spreading.",
