        "additional_details": "Currently, there is no way for the public to call for a vote of no confidence in their government, or to partake in the vote. We must rely on our MPs to do this. This is a flawed system - how can we rely on our MPs to do this if we have no confidence in them? It\u2019s a catch 22. MPs work for the people, that is their role. With the public in the role of employer, it\u2019s only right we should be able to end the contract if our employees are no longer serving public interest.",
        "background": "We need a way for people to call for, and achieve change within their government. A system that allows the public to register no confidence in their government, that triggers a vote when an agreed threshold is met.",
