        "additional_details": "This proposed super league is motivated by nothing more than greed and elitism. The life blood of the clubs in question, fans, are being completely ignored and consider this the \"ultimate betrayal\" to them, so far, in the history of the sport. We support our clubs because we love & admire them & cheer when they win - its not about how much money they have or can get. Stop our national sport from being ruined.",
        "background": "I wish the Government & Parliament to debate, and hopefully, stop the setting up of the proposed European super league as it would be severely damaging to the premier league and other national leagues in Europe.",
