The concession will go some way to alleviating many these wholly avoidable situations. Winter fuel deaths in over 65\u2019s nationally have annually ranged from 30,000 - 50,000 and the covid related deaths not restoring the concession will simply add to the totals in regions along with the misery of poverty and ill-health.",
