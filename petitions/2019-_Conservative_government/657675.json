        "additional_details": "When I / we were in year 7, it was during Covid-19, meaning that we suffered a lot from lockdowns and being sent home because someone had contracted  Covid-19. This therefore meant valuable learning time was lost and for us as yr7's, who had just started Secondary school, was quite daunting, which obviously didn't help. So you STUDENTS / PARENTS / EVERYONE .SHOULD sign this petition as it will help us in GCSE's to be more supported, which helps with the lost time back in yr7 and can help us secure better grades and help us getting into further education, which can help us for our futures. Thank you.",
