        "additional_details": "Lockdown meant threatened Studland seahorses returned and flourished. Now human activity is putting seahorses and sea grass in danger once again.\r\n\r\nFunding is needed to install an anchor free zone and eco moorings for boats to stop damaging the seagrass. \r\n\r\nGovernment have authorized MCZs in UK law but have not provided any funding.\r\n\r\nWithout the resources to make effective change, MCZs are meaningless. Funding would enable MCZs around the UK to implement and enforce the desperately needed changes.",
        "background": "Authorities are failing to take action due to lack of funding. We want Government to provide the authorities with sufficient funds to carry out these obligations. Eg Studland Bay, designated an MCZ in 2019 to protect seahorses. No action taken. Government needs to back MCZs by providing resources.",
