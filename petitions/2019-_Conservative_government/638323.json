        "additional_details": "In this day and age, the importance of good quality suncream is imperative and the amount needed for the duration of the holiday and the people in the party going on the holiday. I believe the weight of such necessary items should be excluded from the luggage weight allowance to ensure the use of top quality creams are used and not having to buy low quality cream abroad that can't be UV guaranteed. Suncream and medication are a necessity not an option!",
        "background": "The weight given for luggage on airlines can be low for families going on holidays, when taken into account all the things that need to be taken. The amount of suncream and maybe medicine and medication can add a huge bulk to this weight.",
