        "additional_details": "The bank holidays are usually seen as a great way to boost the economy and support businesses across the land. Whilst in 'Lockdown' we will not be able to spend like we may have done on previous bank holidays, and therefore it is a wasted opportunity to put money to work in the economy. Now, imagine the scenes if there was a bank holiday just after 'Lockdown' or when it is deemed safe to congregate in numbers again - the huge crowds, the good cheer, and overall a big boost to the ailing economy",
        "background": "I believe that the two May bank holidays should be postponed and saved for a later date when the country can fully enjoy them.\r\n\r\nFailing this, perhaps a new bank holiday could be introduced, when it is deemed safe, celebrating the wonderful NHS workers, or to simply celebrate life after the virus.",
