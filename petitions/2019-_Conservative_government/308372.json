These rates of interest are usury, and destroy the confidence of ordinary people in the banking system, who will see the assistance provided by the government, disappear into high bank charges.",
        "background": "Banks will soon be charging interest rates of 35-40% for overdrafts. At a time when the Bank Base Rate is 0.1%, the banks will make millions out of the suffering of ordinary people. Please stop this by suspending all bank overdraft charges for the period of this crisis.",
