        "additional_details": "I understand why there is a reason for having to save for a deposit for your dream home, but me and many millions of people who rent simply cannot afford to save \u00a315k for 5% deposit. If you pay your rent every month, never missed a payment, a full check on your credit file then you should be given the opportunity of a 100% mortgage. This would also help the economy as more people would get approved and be able to have their dream home.",
        "background": "These days it\u2019s very hard for first time buyers, especially in the current climate. I also feel if there was a system to prove you are financially good with your bills and paying your rent on time and never missed a payment you should be given 100% mortgages.",
