        "additional_details": "Invasive advertising practices have grown pervasive, disrupting user experience on platforms ranging from live streaming to operating systems. Ads frequently interrupt content and services, misleading users and degrading digital experience. This warrants balance between necessary ad revenue and user experience. Without regulation, the digital ecosystem risks being undermined. The interests of users, creators and the wider digital industry need protection for a sustainable digital economy.",
        "background": "We call for the introduction of regulations to prevent disruptive and intrusive advertising across digital platforms and services. This should include guidelines on ad duration, frequency and placement, a clear distinction between content and ads and protection against misleading or aggressive ads.",
