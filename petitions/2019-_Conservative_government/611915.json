For example, it's not clear if you just want this ban only to apply to food that is normally referred to as \"fast food\", or any food that is unhealthy (for example because it has a high sugar or fat content). It's also not clear if you want the ban to cover just businesses that deliver \"fast food\", or any businesses that might deliver unhealthy foods, for example grocery stores.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
