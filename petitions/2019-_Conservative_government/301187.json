        "additional_details": "It is unfair that people are forced to pay for a licence even if they have no intention of watching the BBC but wish to watch the hundreds of freeview channels that are funded by adverts.\r\n\r\nIt is unfair that those who do not wish to fund the BBC because they feel they do not follow the charter can not watch other live TV as it goes against their personal believes. No other country in the world has such a system and this tax on the poor must stop immediately.",
        "background": "The TV licence is an outdated model and puts financial pressure on the most vulnerable in society.\r\n\r\nThe BBC should become a subscription only service so that those who wish to continue to use their services can do so.",
