A vote should be held on triggering a general election from the electorate.\r\n\r\nIt is also unfair that Conservative members are allowed to choose who to become PM. Yet, the rest of us are not allowed. Therefore, rest of the public should be able to choose as it is us they are working for as well, not just Tory members.",

It should be put into law that a general election is automatically triggered.",
