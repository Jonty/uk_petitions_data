        "action": "Change s1 of the 2003 Act that determines a woman (penisless) cannot be a rapist",
        "additional_details": "By saying that a women committed the despicable sexual act against the victim is only deemed as sexual assault (s3) or sexual activity without consent (s4) is discluding and dismissive. Who the penis is attached to should not conclude whether it was rape or not and add to the sexism society faces today and the struggle men (and women) go through to speak up about their assaults and worse, to be taken seriously.  \r\nRape under the Sexual Offences Act should be inclusive of all genders.",
        "background": "This section is extremely excluding of men who have been raped by women. And it is a known fact today that men have infact been raped by women (and women by women) \r\nThe fact that a penis attached to body of the perpetrator is needed for it to be called rape is extremely harmful to many rape victims",
