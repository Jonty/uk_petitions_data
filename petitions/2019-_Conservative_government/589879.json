I am sure I speak for thousands of working parents who find the summer holidays a nightmare. Not only is it a complete juggling act but I feel it is of no benefit to the children. Children thrive on routine & need structure, school is part of this. It is time for change to a system that no longer reflects modern times, whilst it is still education, schools are childcare for the working family!",
        "background": "The Government needs to review the education system's school holidays as this no longer fits the modern working family! The review should proceed with the view of reducing the summer holidays to 4 weeks maximum, possibly by adding a week onto the may half term & the Christmas break.",
