        "additional_details": "All those British nationals and residents who got vaccinated abroad are currently asked to retake the 2 doses in the UK (take 4 jabs in total), which is NOT SAFE, and NOT NECESSARY. Lots of people are spending money to take PCR tests to go to cinemas, theatres and other public spaces even if they are fully vaccinated. This is absolutely not fair and not necessary",
        "background": "At the moment vaccinations administered overseas are not currently captured in the UK vaccination database. As a result of this, the NHS COVID Pass service is unable to generate the COVID Pass or Letter. It is necessary that the government gives the possibility to recognise these vaccines.",
