        "additional_details": "I had my 2nd baby in July 2020 and started taking the pill in August 2020, as due to the pandemic I wasn't able to have the coil fitted. I finally got the coil fitted in January 2021 and within 2/3 weeks of having it fitted I found out I was pregnant and at the time of the coil being fitted I would have been 20 weeks. The doctor/nurse didn't get me to take a pregnancy test and carried out the procedure of the coil being fitted. I think this is totally unacceptable.",
