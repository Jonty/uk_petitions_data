        "additional_details": "FND is a problem with the functioning of the nervous system and brain. Symptoms may appear similar to Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson\u2019s and Epilepsy, and can be just as debilitating. Most patients are left unable to function and rely on carers and aids. Disorders like FND directly cost the NHS approximately \u00a33.1 billion, with an additional \u00a318 billion in indirect costs. With an NHS already under pressure, improving services and treatment for those with FND would greatly lift this burden.",
        "background": "Funding is needed to set up and increase service provision for multi-disciplinary treatment centres. Treatment requires specialist care with a team of neurologists, physiotherapists etc. which must be integrated to create an effective plan. Current options are limited & insufficient.",
