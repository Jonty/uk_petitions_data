This mechanism can help to protect the game from those who seek to exploit it for personal profit.",
        "background": "The FA should be compelled to make the 50+1 ownership principle that exists for the teams competing in the German Bundesliga mandatory for the English Premier League.\r\n\r\nFootball clubs should be to retain a majority of voting rights, with commercial investors holding no more than a 49% stake.",
