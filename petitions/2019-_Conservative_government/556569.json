Apprentices work around the same hours and work full time, they have the same holidays as other employees, yet out wage is drastically different, the government needs to review the minimum wage for apprentices and realise that it needs to be raised to an adequate and appropriate level!",

We need the minimum wage for apprentices to be higher.",
