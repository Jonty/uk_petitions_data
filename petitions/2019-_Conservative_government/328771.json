        "additional_details": "Gyms are more than capable of getting their members to stick to the social distancing rules, as well as make sure their premises are COVID secure. In fact, they are better and easier to manage at it, than pubs. Exercising is a vital part of making people's mental health better while drinking alcohol is actually the opposite.",
        "background": "The Government should allow gyms to re-open, as people who workout and are sober, are better equipped and more responsible in enforcing the +1 metre rule, than drunk people in pubs.",
