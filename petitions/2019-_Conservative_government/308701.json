It's hard for students to afford rent as it is. Then, on top of that, we are being charged for a room and not even living there currently. My tenancy runs up until the end of June so makes a total of \u00a31.5k to pay for nothing. I have asked the agency which I am currently renting from and they said they couldn't stop any payments due to 'government policies'.",
