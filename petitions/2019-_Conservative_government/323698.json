Its been very nice to feel the support from the nation with outstanding clapping once a week, but many of the nurse and staff that work the COVID wards are broken. The stress of going home to their children and loved ones has taken its toll. Its only right that as health care workers that have been forced to the front line and bravely went in for the betterment of the nation get either an extra week off or hazardous pay.",
