        "action": "Remove attendance policy from education system",
        "additional_details": "Many students including myself(16 going 17 and currently in college) can't entirely control when our body is well and unwell, with days where some can't get out of bed, days where some have to go to A&E, and days where some really cannot make it in, whether its due to poor physical and health, illness or related to a disability. In all fairness, the pressure for students to get 100% attendance is unfair, especially when we get ridiculed and our parents get threatened when we cannot come in.",
        "background": "Exchange the absence and attendance policy for something more lenient and less ableist, such as online learning for those who are unable to enter educational spaces, guidance for those within school with catchup sessions for when they're off ill, and remove the pressure to get 100% attendance",

Arrangements for how students who miss school due illness catch up on their education is a matter for individual schools.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petition, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nCreate a national online school for pupils unable to attend school premises: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/607052\r\n\r\nIf you want to see some other specific change to school absence arrangements, you can contact us at petitionscommittee@parliament.uk and we can try to help you start a new petition."
