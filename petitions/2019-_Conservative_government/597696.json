        "additional_details": "Around 56% of Ramsay Hunt cases are misdiagnosed as Bell's palsy, so over half don't get the right care and treatment for a condition that is much more severe and could end up affecting them for life. I now have life long pain and immobility that needs constant treatment because I was misdiagnosed. Giving it its own NHS page could help massively reduce this and healthcare professionals would have the right information at the time of diagnosis, saving people so much physical and emotional pain.",
        "background": "Ramsay Hunt Syndrome gets misdiagnosed as Bell's palsy so often that people who suffer from it end up not having the right medication and not fully recovering properly. I think this is because there is not enough information at hand for health professionals and having an NHS page would change this.",
