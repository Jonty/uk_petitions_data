        "additional_details": "The DfID was made independent of the FCO in 1997, solely to protect the use of aid for poverty reduction following a link between aid and a major arms deal in Malaysia. Merging the DfID - a transparent and globally respected department - with the FCO whose efficiency and transparency have scored poorly, will see a return to security-driven development. \r\n\r\nAid should work independently of diplomatic and security goals, the way to ensure this is through the continued separation of the DfID and FCO.",
        "background": "The Department for International Development (DfID) has been world-leading in the global effort to end poverty. Boris Johnson's proposed merger with the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) will result in a greater focus on security over poverty reduction.",
