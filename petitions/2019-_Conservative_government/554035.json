        "additional_details": "The impact of plastic pollution on our natural environment isn\u2019t just a problem for the UK. It\u2019s a global one. \r\n\r\nIn 2021 the UK will host COP26 and the G7. Whilst SARS-CoV-2 (COVID19) will dominate the conversation, the UK must use these events to tackle plastic pollution as well as climate change and the effect it will have on our natural environment. \r\n\r\nThis levy may create a fund for research into the effects of plastic pollution as well as solutions that may lead to an outright ban.",
        "background": "I want the UK Government and Parliament to introduce a levy on single-use disposable plastic manufactured and sold in the UK.\r\n\r\nThis will help consumers, business and industry transition towards more sustainable solutions; ones that are long term and ones that consider the entire product lifecycle.",
