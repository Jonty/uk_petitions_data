        "additional_details": "I\u2019m a retail worker from a national chain of shops throughout the UK, I also live with a vulnerable person and I\u2019m unable to take the time off work. By working, I\u2019m risking not only my life, but theirs too.. I know that other workers will also be in this situation and that it causes great anxiety around going to work. The health of workers is very important in this time and getting paid minimum wage, like myself, isn\u2019t enough to obtain all the necessities needed.",
        "background": "As all workers are currently risking their lives and the health of their family, all workers should be paid some kind of hazard pay. Retail workers, blue light employees, NHS, teachers and many more.",
