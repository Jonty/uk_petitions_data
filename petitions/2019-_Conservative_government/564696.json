        "additional_details": "As a student I know I don't have a fair opportunity to reach the grades predicted for myself or the grades predicted for my peers. Not all schools are equal, for example lack of funding when comparing private and public schools. This means not all students had equal learning opportunities over lockdown if they didn't have access to a computer or learning materials. Course work and teacher assessment ensures that all students are given an equal chance to get their rightful grades.",
        "background": "Cancel all standardise testing for year 11 and year 12 students in 2021. By replacing tests with smaller amounts of course work and teacher assessment, students would have a fair chance at achieving their target grades and it would relieve stress for teachers and students.",
