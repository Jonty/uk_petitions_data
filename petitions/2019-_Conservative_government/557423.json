        "additional_details": "New and expectant mothers during this pandemic have extremely little support. Because of government restrictions mothers and their babies are not allowed to mix with wider support circles as they aren't in their own household. What this means upon returning to work is that their babies will not be familiar with or may have never even met the people providing childcare, and may never have been without their mother. Therefore returning to work will be traumatic for both mother and child.",
        "background": "The government refused to extend maternity leave due to coronavirus earlier in the year. In light of a resurgence of the virus and new lockdown restrictions we desperately need government to reconsider their decision and extend maternity leave by at least 3 months.",
