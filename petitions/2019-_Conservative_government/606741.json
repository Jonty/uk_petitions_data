        "additional_details": "In March 2020 Covid19 restrictions were put in place across the UK. local authorities have used these restrictions as an excuse to save money by restricting access and opening times of recycling centres, a service the public has paid for.\r\nAs a direct result from march 2020 to March 2021 incidents of fly tipping increased by 16% \r\nAll of which must be recovered at public expense.\r\nRestrictions on waste disposal do not reduce waste production. Other utilities continued to function, waste should too.",
        "background": "Force local authorities to open recycling centres to all vehicle types carrying domestic waste and offer a paid recycling service to commercial services disposing of waste generated at domestic properties during maintenance and improvement work.",
