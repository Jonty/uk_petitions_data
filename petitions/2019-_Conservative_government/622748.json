        "additional_details": "We ask government to legislate that: \r\n\r\n- The rent amount must be stated in property listings.\r\n\r\n- Landlords/agents are barred from inviting/encouraging people to pay more rent for a property than is stated in the listing.\r\n\r\n- Landlords/agents are barred from renting to tenants who offer to pay more for it.\r\n\r\n- Tenants are banned from offering to pay more for rents.\r\n\r\nWe can end rental bidding just like New Zealand has. In the middle of a cost-of-living crisis, it is essential that we do so.",
        "background": "The rental system is broken. \r\n\r\nFinding a place to live is now incredibly difficult and people are forced to offer more rent than the listed price. This drives up rent for everyone and pushes people into making impossible decisions about their lives. \r\n\r\nWe must end rental bidding.",
