        "additional_details": "Dying people need fast-track access to welfare support but currently this only happens if doctors tell you that you have 12 months left to live.\r\nThis isn't good enough. A terminal illness doesn't respect a calendar.\r\nA terminal illness means many like me have to give up work. But thousands will miss out on financial support because they have a prognosis of more than 12 months. The government says its compassionate but the restrictions helping dying people is the opposite to compassionate",
        "background": "We ask the Government to give anyone with a terminal illness fast-track access to financial support. This would stop people worrying about money and it would help them to focus on spending time with their family. This only happens if you have 12 months or less which penalises those who live longer",
