        "additional_details": "However, due to the nature of the work, many freelancers have PAYE income on their returns for agencies they've not engaged with since the 18-19 tax year, so they can't be furloughed and if it outweighs their invoiced work, they don't qualify for SEISS either. \r\n\r\nWhen the chancellor talks about the 5% who 'fall through the crack', he refers to people with NO income history. \r\n\r\nCurrently, thousands of self-employed workers that CAN provide their income history are being denied much-needed support.",
        "background": "Due to stricter IR35 policy that came into play in recent years, staffing agencies across the country deduct tax at source for work carried out by freelancers who would otherwise use their UTR and invoice them. \r\n\r\nMany self-employed, therefore, have a mixture of PAYE and Invoiced income.",
