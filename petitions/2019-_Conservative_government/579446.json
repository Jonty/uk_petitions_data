        "additional_details": "The TV License is a burden upon many people as nobody watches the BBC. They prefer to watch alternative media sources and listen to podcasts on YouTube or the radio. The BBC already have huge amounts of funding; there are other ways which the BBC can get funding, for example, advertisements. This is unfair treatment as we already pay multiple taxes. According to the express total of three million households are now forced to pay \u00a3157.50 for a colour license and \u00a357 for a black and white license. This puts a strain on pensioners and low-income families that are already struggling to pay. If they are not able to pay they will go into debt or possibly jail",
