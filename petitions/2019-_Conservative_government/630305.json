        "additional_details": "Palm oil had been a continual driver of deforestation, killing and heavily damaging some of the worlds most biodiverse forests. Along with this the industry is damaging the habitat of animals like the Sumatran rhino, pygmy elephant, and orangutan, all of whom are already endangered species. Climate change is being exacerbated by carbon-rich peat soils and the loss of forests, which releases millions of tonnes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.",
        "background": "If a product contains unsustainable palm oil it shouldn\u2019t be allowed to be imported into the UK and would be prevented from being sold in  supermarkets. We should start educating people on the harm of palm oil and the damage it is reeking across the planet.",
