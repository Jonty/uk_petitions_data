        "additional_details": "University students need to be given the chance to raise their concerns. COVID 19 is impacting everyones lives, including US, university students but we are not being thought of. \r\nWe are still paying tuition fees, we are still paying accommodation rent, and for what?\r\nWe are not being looked after and this needs to stop now. Why cancel all the other exams but leave us to still do ours? Why only mention college, secondary and primary school rules but nothing about universities?\r\nCan you include us?",
        "background": "The Government need to start including the thought of University students in their debates regarding education. University students cannot be neglected by Parliament. Our future is on the line and no one is taking care of it. We are the future of our country and we are being pushed aside.",
