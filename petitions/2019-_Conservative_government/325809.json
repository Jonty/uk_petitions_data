We can live without new furniture for a while but these animals need to be fed.\r\n\r\nZoos are also outside and the government have been telling us for ages it\u2019s safer to be outside, so with the right measures in place please look at opening zoos before shops or as part of the next phase on 15th June. It cannot be left any longer with no help from the government.",
        "background": "Zoos are running out of money because paying customers aren't allowed in. The animals still need food and many zoos are now in desperate need of help.\r\nSome may have to choose which animals should live or die. The government need to allow zoos to reopen with social distancing measures in place.",
