        "action": "Scrap government plans to have all menus display calories.",
        "additional_details": "This plan encourages calorie counting; a proven trigger of new EDs, as well as relapse. This information should be at the forefront of these conversations, especially when we consider that over the past 13 years, EDs have increased by over 40%.\r\nThis plan also ignores the impact on \"obese\" people's mental health. NEDA states that weight stigma means people \"Are at an increased risk for [ED] symptoms\", showing that the plan would not only be harmful for mental health, but would also be ineffective",
        "background": "One part of the new government anti-obesity plan is to have restaurants show the number of calories in the food and drinks they serve on their menus. Although this seems a good idea on paper, it disproportionately affects people with food issues and reinforces negative tropes of overweight people.",
