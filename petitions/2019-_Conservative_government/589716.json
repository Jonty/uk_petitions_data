        "additional_details": "At least 2m people have a food allergy. Since 2012, there has been a 615% increase in hospital admissions for anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. However, allergy remains a \"Cinderella service\" in the NHS. There has been little investment given to NHS allergy services. The care people with allergies receive is often patchy, and at worst has led to avoidable deaths. Without greater priority given to allergies, these problems will continue and more lives may be lost.",
