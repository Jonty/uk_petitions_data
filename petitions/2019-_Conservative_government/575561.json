        "additional_details": "Every year, millions of pounds worth of unused, sealed packs of medical consumables (dressings, medications etc) are destroyed or sent to landfill because they are not allowed to be returned for redistribution in the UK. This is an appalling, unnecessary waste that we need to stop. Having allowed this shocking waste we then give cash for international aid, which is spent on medical supplies, when if we redistribute unwanted items the aid money could be spent on education, food and water.",
