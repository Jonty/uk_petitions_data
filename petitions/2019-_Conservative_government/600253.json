        "additional_details": "The food supply chain is a significant contributor to our damaging impact on the planet. Around 26% of global greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to food. \r\n\r\nThe biggest portion of food-related emissions comes not from transporting food (as is commonly believed) but from its production.  In order to reduce our food-related impact as consumers, we need clear, accessible information about the carbon footprint associated with the production of food products.",
        "background": "Introduce a mandatory requirement to label supermarket food products with information about their impact on the environment. These labels should be accessible, transparent, and provide detailed and meaningful information about how the production of the commodity has impacted the environment.",
