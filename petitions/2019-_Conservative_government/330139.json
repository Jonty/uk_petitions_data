        "additional_details": "Children should be more educated on this topic as for girls and women it is a common occurrence. It is necessary to educate young men about consent and what is sexual assault from a young age to reduce the number of women sexually assaulted later in life. Young women need to learn about safe places to talk about this. Children need to be educated that it is extremely traumatic and to not shame the survivors, as this will further the trauma from the events.",
        "background": "It should be mandatory for schools to educate children of year 7 and up about sexual assault and the affects of this on mental health. It should include about what counts as sexual assault and actions that can be taken to report it, without shaming the survivor.",
