They deserve to have their lives respected, just as we would respect the life of a dog or cat, or another human, or our own life.\r\n \r\nOverfishing also depletes fish stocks available to seabirds and other ocean predators.\r\n \r\nWe need to stop catching and killing fish, and also farming fish. We need to let the oceans and their wildlife recover and stop the violence against innocent fish.\r\n",
        "background": "200 million tons of fish are produced for food each year, both from the wild and from fish farms. Fish are sentient beings; they feel pain, like we mammals do. They are not vegetables. They have lives that matter. Also, overfishing is ruining the ecosystems and decimating fish populations.",
