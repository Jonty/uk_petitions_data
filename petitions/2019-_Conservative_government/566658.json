        "additional_details": "The covid situation has affected millions of students in the UK; the impact of GCSEs is something that lasts for the rest of someone's life- it determines what life choices they can make and what options will be available to them in the future. \r\n\r\nAlthough schools did open again at the start of term, many were unable to attend as they had to isolate due to either contracting the virus or having to isolate because of their peers, therefore putting them at an even further disadvantage.",
        "background": "The government needs to cancel GCSEs to give children a substantial chance of passing instead of continuing exams that they are not physically nor mentally prepared to do. Cancelling them as soon as possible allows effective alternatives to be taken into consideration.",
