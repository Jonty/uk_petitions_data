        "additional_details": "Students are currently facing the challenge of studying from home for their degree while missing out on valuable - and at times essential - practical experience, dealing with additional caring responsibilities, parenting and home schooling, struggling with disabilities and learning difficulties, difficult home working environments. Many such students are seeing home learning negatively impact their grades but cannot in the current system get funding to take a resit year or leave of absence.",
        "background": "The effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on students' mental wellbeing and ability to study have been varied and significant. While many have benefited from the supports offered by universities, many others - particularly those facing additional pressures have seen negative impacts on their grades.",
