        "additional_details": "The reason I want this is because firstly it\u2019s happened to my own children frequently these last couple of weeks on 2 occasions teachers have shouted at my son in a manner that causes the teacher to apologise afterwards. This will be happening in schools all over the country and it\u2019s not on by any standards . Teachers face a hard task within there jobs but it doesn\u2019t give them the right to act this way to our children . So I want it recognising and all teachers must abide by the code of conduct",
        "background": "I want the government to determine what they think is an adequate use of volume and anger when a teacher shouts at a pupil . Teachers are shouting at pupils loud enough and angry enough to cause them unnecessary alarm , upset & distress which isn\u2019t acceptable on any level and needs addressing",
