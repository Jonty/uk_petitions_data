        "action": "Force the Education Secretary to resign over the handling of exam results",
        "additional_details": "The Education Secretary must resign because the exam results for this year has severely and unfairly put poorer GCSE and A Level students at a disadvantage because a school\u2019s performance is taken into account for working out individual exam results. There is no individual appeals process, which is shambolic. This also shows contempt for the professional judgement of teachers who are outstanding public sector workers who have world-class training to assess such things.",
        "background": "Either the government should sack the Education Secretary, or Parliament should impeach him due to the monumental failure to protect working class students from class-biased exam results during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
