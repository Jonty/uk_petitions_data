        "additional_details": "In 2003 the Met wrote to a potential prosecutor that the Attorney General had advised the Met that they will never grant consent to initiate criminal proceedings against any member of HM Government. In the years since 2003 several applications were made to the Attorney General for consent to initiate criminal proceedings under the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 and the ICC Act 2001 but none was granted. Legislation as it stands denies justice to Victims of crimes committed by members of HM Govern.",
        "background": "In international crimes Parliament legislated that the consent of the Attorney General is required before a criminal prosecution may be initiated. This breaches principles of natural justice; separation of power and denies Victims justice in indicting members of HM Government for inter. crimes.",
