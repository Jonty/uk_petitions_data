        "additional_details": "I believe that people who produce or sell drugs such as crack, heroin, cocaine etc. are the real criminals, not the people they prey on. Drugs such as those listed above can ruin a person and turn them into someone else, and by treating them in the same way we treat criminals, it isn't going to make them less addicted. Drug users should instead be rehabilitated. Some people are even afraid to contact the authorities when a loved one is addicted, due to fear that they will be arrested.",
        "background": "The government should make sure that current drug laws cannot be used to prosecute addicts as criminals. They are victims and shouldn't receive a prison sentence as a result of their addiction. They need support instead.",
