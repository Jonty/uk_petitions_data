        "additional_details": "The only reason BST exists is due to World War 1, extending the working day so workers produced more goods in a time of war. Britain no longer needs this system and it should be abolished in peacetime. \r\n\r\nIt serves nothing but to disrupt workers and everyday people who have to conform to a new standard of time every summer. \r\n\r\nDoes the government think our country is at war still? I highly doubt it, seeing as we couldn\u2019t produce arms anyway with all of our industry exported to China and India.",
