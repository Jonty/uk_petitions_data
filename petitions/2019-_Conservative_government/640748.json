        "action": "Reform language and categories regarding ethnic heritage on Government forms",
        "additional_details": "I want the Government to do so as their forms and terminology are outdated. The term minority to me implies I am less than, which I am not. I was born in the UK. I am more British than my heritage but because of an outdated system I am often defined by my heritage rather than the fact I am British.\r\n \r\nThis is an institutional thing that I believe causes divide, and must be changed. Only the Government can do it hence this petition for change.",
        "background": "I want the Government to stop using the phrases \"ethnic minority\" or \u201cethnic groups\u201d on forms, and only refer to \"ethnic heritage\" instead. We also want specific ethnic categories for people who are Black British, Asian British, etc, to recognise that they are British.",
