So, our human rights could be met if we could go to the toilet for FREE and not have to pay a penny.\r\n\r\nBeing allowed to go to the toilet is not only a basic human right, it is also a medical necessity. Some people don't have the time or money to access a public toilet. Why should you have to pay when it is a human right? Free toilets would surely make a big difference to everyone especially the disabled and elderly.",
