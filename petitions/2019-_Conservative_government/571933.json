        "action": "Provide greater financial support to parents whose employers wont offer furlough",
        "additional_details": "Working and looking after a young child/toddler at the same time is irresponsible and unsafe. Homeschooling additional children at the same time is impossible. It also places the parent(s) under significant stress - trying to manage their workload and children at the same time is severely detrimental to mental health. Without furlough, parents have no option but to go unpaid, presenting major financial difficulty with mortgages etc and again, severe stress and poor mental health",
        "background": "Working parents, particularly those with young children, whose employer won\u2019t utilise the furlough scheme, are being placed in an impossible situation. Please make furlough a legal entitlement for these individuals or provide financial support so they don\u2019t have to take unpaid leave",
