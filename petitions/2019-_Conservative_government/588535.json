        "additional_details": "Attacks on livestock by off lead dogs are increasing. In May this year Gladis a heavily pregnant Highland Cow was killed after being chased by an off lead dog that was being walked by its owner.\r\n\r\nWe have evidence from farmers, small holders and horse owners across the UK showing the impact that these attacks have. Deaths, injuries, huge cost to the mental health of the owners of these animals and financial cost\r\n\r\nKeep dogs on lead is the easiest way to prevent these attacks and it should be law.",
        "background": "Gladis's Law. We want the government to make it mandatory for dogs owners to keep their dogs on lead where livestock, horses and poultry are present. The law should cover all land including open access land.\r\n\r\nExemption should be made for working dogs who are on the land as part of their work.",
