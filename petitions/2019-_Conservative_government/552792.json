        "additional_details": "It can be hard for many working parents to pack a nutritional lunch for their children in the mornings and is leading to an unhealthy diet. Free lunches would be nutritional and give children energy for the rest of the day but would also ensure more financial stability to parents who, especially with COVID-19, are experiencing money troubles.",
        "background": "Introduce free school meals for all students in primary school as many young children I know have been sent with a limited and small lunch which is extremely unhealthy and not good to keep them going for the rest of the day.",
