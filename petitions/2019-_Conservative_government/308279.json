        "additional_details": "These vulnerable people are unable to travel to major airports therefore travelling long distances and transiting via multiple countries with long layovers. This is putting them at further risk from COVID-19 and potentially further spreading the virus. \r\n\r\nThese elderly people have families, friends and lives back in the UK, with loved ones who are concerned for their well being. Options to bring them home are limited. They deserve the same rights as other British Citizens being repatriated home.",
        "background": "Elderly and vulnerable British Sikhs are stranded in Punjab unable to return home, as major airports including Amritsar are closed due to COVID-19. \r\n\r\nThey need support from the UK Government to provide dedicated direct flights from Amritsar to ensure their safe return back home to the UK.",
