        "additional_details": "The government has consistently ignored advice from leading environmentalists. It has ignored the fact that many places in the U.K. will not be connected by this vanity project and the spiralling cost vastly above the amount first quoted. We will find it is the workers and those in greatest need who will pay to recover the economy so to spend so much on an unnecessary project is ridiculous. During lockdown we have found business simply does not need to travel for miles to meet.",
        "background": "Stop all works on the unnecessary HS2 project. Encourage businesses to meet virtually for the sake of our environment. Retain the money instead of ramping up more taxes and cutting benefits to those who can afford it least after the pandemic has cleared.",
