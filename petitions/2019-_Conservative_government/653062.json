        "additional_details": "Approximately 200 Afghan special forces and 32 state officials who courageously worked alongside British Special Forces, are in imminent danger by being deported from Pakistan back to Afghanistan, where they could be hunted down mercilessly by the Taliban. We owe them a debt of duty and honour to bring them and their families to the UK, where they can live the rest of their lives in peace and safety. If we do not take care of our allies, then who are we as a nation.",

All Afghan special forces and state officials who courageously worked alongside British Forces in Afghanistan must be relocated, including those employed by the Afghan Government. Do not fail them.",
