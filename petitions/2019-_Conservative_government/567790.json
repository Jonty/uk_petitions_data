        "additional_details": "Mexican restaurants are a crucial part of life. Burritos, quesadillas, nachos, and fajitas (among other foods) are very delicious. There are not enough Mexican restaurants in the UK, and many chains and branches have had to close in recent years, leaving a huge gap in the market and creating long wait times at the existing restaurants. Many citizens consider Mexican food their favourite, and with the lack of these restaurants throughout the UK the people are unhappy.",
        "background": "We want the government to support the creation of more Mexican restaurants throughout the UK. There is a lack of good Mexican restaurants, and these restaurants contribute exponentially to the welfare of citizens. As such, these restaurants should be invested in by the government in some way.",
