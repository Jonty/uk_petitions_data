        "additional_details": "No family should be forced to wait over thirty years for justice after a murder as consecutive police investigations fall apart.\r\n\r\nDaniel's family were promised that the Leveson Inquiry would get to the bottom of press-police corruption in relation to Daniel's death - focusing on allegations against Rupert Murdoch's News International. But Culture Secretary Matt Hancock cancelled it in 2018.\r\n\r\nThe Leveson Inquiry must be completed as promised.\r\n\r\nThis petition is supported by Alastair Morgan.",
        "background": "Five police inquiries into Daniel\u2019s murder have collapsed since his death over 30 years ago. The government promised Daniel's brother Alastair that the Leveson Inquiry would investigate press-police corruption in relation to Daniel's murder but Matt Hancock cancelled it in 2018.",
