        "additional_details": "To enable hundreds of thousands of people, the opportunity to work. Previous to disability, I was working from home (pandemic) it was more productive for the employer, and more expensive for me. Retail is dead, people back in office will not save it. Instead look at saving people's lively hoods and giving people the power to work, those that want to can go to the office, but don't penalise those that can't. Also will keep businesses going by retaining staff at home rather than loosing them.",
        "background": "Enable people to be productive, allow them to work, minimize discrimination. And above all else make it equal, so that everyone is treated the same. Just a little fairness.",
