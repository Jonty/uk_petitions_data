I personally have seen heavy uproar on social media regarding this issue recently and know that it\u2019s an issue that affects many sexual assault and rape survivors and can make it very difficult for them to be able to consume media out of fear of being exposed to triggering content like this.",

It is therefore not clear what forms of distribution you want to be prohibited.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling on the Government to ban the showing of films with explicit content of rape or sexual assault in cinemas and on TV, if that's what you want to happen."
