        "additional_details": "I believe he has truly disrespected the public and made a mockery of us as human beings. He as health secretary could not even follow his own rules of social distancing, not hugging friends and family and so forth, as he repeatedly told the UK public we needed to do in order to save lives. People have not been able to console dying family members due to lockdowns and the rules. This is disgusting and an apology is not enough.",
        "background": "I would like the government and parliament to stand up and ensure Matt Hancock is no longer health secretary. Evidence has emerged that he broke lockdown rules during the coronavirus pandemic despite urging UK public to stay home to save lives. To not hug friends and family. To socially distance.",
