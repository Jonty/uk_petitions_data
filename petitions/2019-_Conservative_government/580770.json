        "additional_details": "Over the last 10 years, on average a woman is murdered every 3 days. Attacks on women in the street and at home continue to rise, especially during the pandemic. 'Lessons learned' need to be turned into tangible actions. The immediate action for government is to provide every woman and teenage girl robust and life saving self defence courses free of charge. It is the government's responsibility to keep its citizens safe. Equip women with the ability to fight back when their life depends on it.",
        "background": "Designate adequate funds to local councils to cover the cost of self defence courses for women of all ages and teenage girls. Make local councils responsible for organising and providing these courses free of charge, and hold them accountable for their successful implementation.",
