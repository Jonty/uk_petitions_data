        "action": "Introduce mandatory name-blind recruitment for all UK employers",
        "additional_details": "An overwhelming amount of evidence shows that names which suggest an applicant is of a non-white ethnicity are much less likely to receive a call back than names which imply that the applicant is White British. In the recent GEMM Project Study by CSI Nuffield College, Oxford, in Britain it was found that applicants with non-white sounding names had to make 60% more applications to achieve the same success rate as those with white sounding names, despite having identical applications otherwise.",
        "background": "To combat systemic racism and implicit bias in recruitment, we want name-blind recruitment to be made mandatory for all UK employers, given that name-blind recruitment is already implemented by the civil service, and name-blind submissions are a standardised practice across all UK universities.",
