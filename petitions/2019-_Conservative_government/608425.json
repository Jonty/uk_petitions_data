        "additional_details": "The job is intensely demanding, often involving 13 hour shifts or being on call. From recent conversations with her, I know that this debt only adds to the stress of the job and affects her morale; she feels that even if she begins to earn more, she will lose it in debt payments. There is a very real and worrying nursing/midwifery crisis in the UK and we need to be doing everything we can to keep them. The House of Commons Public Accounts Committee recently concluded that the government wasted billions of pounds on unusable PPE equipment. The least the Government can do, in recognition of our NHS nurses and midwives, is to write off their student loans and make an investment in their future which in turn benefits us all.",

They have missed out on previous free training and the newly introduced \u00a35,000 a year payment. Studying for 5 years, my daughter recently qualified as a midwife incurring a debt of over \u00a350,000.",
