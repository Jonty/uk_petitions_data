Thousands of lives (and their potential) are lost ever year through a legalised surgical process that stops an individuals potential from being realised. Individuals that could go on to make a positive contribution to our society - maybe a government advicer or researcher who finds cures for pandemics. Science is now showing that DNA is created from conception and so the arguments that supported the current legislation over when life begins are in need of a radical over view. If nothing else, the author of morality and life itself is in favour of its preservation in the womb,  and will hold the great and the good and everyone else to account one day. Please be a voice for the innocents.",
