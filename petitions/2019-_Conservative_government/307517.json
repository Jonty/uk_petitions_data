The large retailers are happy to make lots of money out of this situation but aren\u2019t really doing an awful lot to protect their vulnerable customers or to support those groups who are working on the frontline during this crisis or to protect and support their own staff as at the moment they\u2019re being expected to manage this on a daily basis.",
        "background": "I would like this to happen for the following reasons;\r\n1. To stop people from bulk buying and stock piling essential items\r\n2. To ensure that the elderly, the vulnerable and NHS, Carers and other essential staff are protected and supported to look after themselves and their families.",
