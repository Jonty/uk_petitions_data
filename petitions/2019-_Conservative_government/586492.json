        "additional_details": "A Private Members Bill that would have changed this law fell due to the 2017 snap general election. It would have ended the unnecessary legal requirement to send in your driving license as well as paying a fixed penalty for speeding. Currently this creates an additional cost for drivers on top of an already extortionate and unfair speeding fine campaign, as well as causing unnecessary climate damage, and wasting the valuable time and resources of the nation's police forces and courts.",
        "background": "The Government should put an end to the unnecessary legal requirement to send in a driver's license after paying a fine for speeding. Doing so has been an unnecessary waste of resources since the paper counterpart was retired in 2015.",
