Simple things such as my commute to work were difficult, expensive and lengthy. This impacts many areas of my life. Re-applying for a licence after a medical revocation should be as simple and accessible as possible - those with medical conditions should be able to send their applications online, as is the procedure for most applications, rather than experiencing months of delay by post.",
        "background": "The DVLA should not treat service users with a medical condition differently. As it stands, many licences can be renewed online. Medical reapplications, however, must be sent by post - this can significantly delay the process of obtaining a licence, disadvantaging those with a medical condition.",
