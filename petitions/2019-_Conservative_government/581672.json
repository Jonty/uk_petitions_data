        "additional_details": "As someone that has experienced it myself, I am beyond saddened to see how many people are coming forward about sexual assault attacks and there is nothing put in place for schools/colleges to support victims properly. The rates of sexual assault are increasing rapidly and it\u2019s frightening! There needs to be more awareness with younger generations to prevent this happening in the future!",
        "background": "Put a small amount of funding aside for schools to teach about sexual assault and to spread awareness of the extent of seriousness around it. The funding could also help support victims of sexual assault in schools.",
