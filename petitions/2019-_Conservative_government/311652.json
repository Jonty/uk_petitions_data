        "additional_details": "The NHS is the backbone of the UK. During the crisis many NHS staff will become ill from treating and coming into contact with Covid patients, there will also be those who pay the ultimate price for the service. The NHS and it\u2019s staff deserve the respect and honour a bank holiday would bring to them. The crisis will test its very core and it is the staff who will work tirelessly to care for the sick and dying, as the do throughout the year.  The NHS now, more than ever, deserves this recognition",
        "background": "We would like the government to instate a new bank holiday in the UK to commemorate the day the UK went into lockdown due to Covid 19. This day will honour our National Health Service and it\u2019s employees who have and continue to give their upmost during the outbreak and throughout the year.",
