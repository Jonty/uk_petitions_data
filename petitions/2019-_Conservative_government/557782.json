        "additional_details": "This would mean less stress for the current year 11's across the country as they haven't had an opportunity to learn for these properly due to the lack of environment where social distancing could be applied to conduct the required practicals. Also, at this present moment in time, the students are having to learn about these required practicals without even physically doing it themselves, so they are having to teach themselves something that they are not entirely sure about.",
        "background": "Many of the current GCSE students across the country are at a disadvantage of not being able to conduct required practicals that are in the Science curriculum, which they will be tested on in next summer's GCSE exams.",
