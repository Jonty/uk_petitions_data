        "additional_details": "There is a percentage of parents who are able and willing to help children at home and we prefer this over putting our children and older people they interact with at risk during COVID19. A lot of these kids have siblings at home to keep them company and also have access to closely supervised social interaction. There we see no reason why they can't continue schooling from home.",
