        "additional_details": "It is unfair that same sex couples have to make such a huge financial sacrifice before even having a child. \r\n\r\nSome NHS locations fund single women and same sex couples for conception up to the age of 40, but it\u2019s a postcode lottery. My wife and I are not entitled to funding but would be if we relocated to the next county. \r\n\r\nHeterosexual couples are entitled to free IVF if they have been trying to conceive for two years, which fortunately doesn\u2019t cost thousands of pounds.",
        "background": "At the moment a same sex couple has to have 6 unsuccessful private attempts at conceiving a baby before they can earn 1 free attempt of IVF, that means they are spending tens of thousands of pounds before being entitled to one free attempt on the NHS. One IUI attempt can cost around \u00a33500.",
