        "additional_details": "Funding should be put aside for this app because it will help women and girls deal with these issues correctly, as many current apps are monetised meaning some women can\u2019t access the expert advice on it; it should encourage safer sex; it could give more disadvantaged women access to this important information; it should make it clear that periods are medical and should be covered by our NHS and it could give a morale boost to the women in the workforce, aiding opportunity and prosperity.",
        "background": "Young women are now growing up in a digital environment, where sex ed is often monetised, unclear and dangerous. For the ordinary woman, the school sex ed curriculum may not answer all her questions, and the disadvantaged woman may not have access to sex education at all.",
