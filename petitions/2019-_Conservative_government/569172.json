        "additional_details": "These learners have paid for numerous driving lessons, many have had tests cancelled time and time again through no fault of their own, and need to keep practicing to avoid additional costs down the line. They have purchased vehicles, paid insurance, tax and repairs many as young people with little disposable income. They will be given a lift to essential place of work by the same person in their support bubble but can\u2019t drive themselves. There is no additional risk to the health of either driver or supervisor so please change this rule.",
        "background": "Amend the rule that learner drivers can\u2019t practice driving on essential journeys. They can travel to essential work in a vehicle with a member of their support bubble but are not allowed to drive the journey themselves. What additional risk is there? Scotland and Wales are allowed.",
