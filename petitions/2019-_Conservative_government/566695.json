Schools/colleges opened again in September but the disadvantage did not stop there. Repeated isolation and staff absence have kept affecting students and to run exams this year would just be unfair. Making exams optional would ensure each student has a fair chance of getting the best grade they possibly can under the circumstances of 2020/2021.",
