        "additional_details": "Mortgage holidays may help temporarily but after the holiday period interest is added to the loan and you end up paying more monthly. I would like to see payments stop and then continue when the country goes back to work. The mortgage could then be extended by whatever the period is we are required to stay at home. This will greatly relieve the stress of how we're going to pay our bills during this time and not force us to go out to work in order to do so and thereby risk spreading the virus",
