Civil service pay has fallen in value by up to 20% over 10 years. Civil servants have been overpaying pension contributions. Government pay policy for 2020 restricts increases to 1.5-2.5%. Government workers have delivered the Job Retention scheme, kept our courts running and our borders secure. It\u2019s time to recognise their contribution and restore the real value of their pay.",

After ten years in which the real value of civil service pay has fallen, many face hardship. The Government must start to restore the real value of their pay with a 10% increase in 2020.",
