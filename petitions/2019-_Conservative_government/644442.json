        "additional_details": "I would like the government to do this so that the people of Yorkshire can have a greater say on their government policy. A new government could decide the best areas to direct funding such as towards heavy industry and we could make our own laws, set our own tax rate and decide our own legal and electoral systems. We could also create an education system that works for us. We would also be able to direct funding to the most neglected areas of the region.",
        "background": "I would like for the government to devolve power away from Westminster towards the region known as Yorkshire, made up of the administrative counties of: North Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire and the East Riding of Yorkshire. The capital of this new political entity would be York\r\n",
