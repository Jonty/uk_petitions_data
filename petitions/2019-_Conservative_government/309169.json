The decision to allow non-vital construction work to continue is utterly devoid of the integrity so admirably displayed by the highly experienced, dedicated and utterly desperate NHS staff who have time and again begged for the lock down on free movement for the benefit of everyone. Show that you care about the NHS \u2013 Get the Lockdown Done!",

Tens of thousands of people work in associated supply and support companies. Stop this inexcusable pressure on the NHS.",
