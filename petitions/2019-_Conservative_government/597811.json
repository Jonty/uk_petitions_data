        "additional_details": "HGV drivers drive approx 75,000 - 100,000 miles compared to car drivers who do approx 1,000 - 10,000 miles per year yet lorry drivers are treated in the same manner with regards to punishments for driving offences as a car driver. HGV drivers are professional drivers who every 5 years have to complete 35 hours of training whereas car drivers do not complete any regular driver training. Driving offences accrued whilst driving a HGV should be dealt with more leniently with fines not points.",
        "background": "To change the law so that anyone driving a HGV, drivers in road traffic offences are to be dealt with via fines and educational courses and not by penalty points",
