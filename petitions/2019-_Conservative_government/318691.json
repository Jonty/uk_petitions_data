        "additional_details": "All across the country people are being financially impacted by the pandemic and lockdown.  While additional financial support is being provided to many, people already on legacy benefits such as JSA and ESA have been excluded from the support package while those on Universal Credit and Working Tax Credit have been given an increase. I propose that to prevent unfair discrimination legacy benefit claimants and Child Tax Credit are given similar additional support.",
