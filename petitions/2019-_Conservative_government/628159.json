        "additional_details": "I have worked in the Emergency Department as a Nurse and have seen the most horrific injuries sustained by motorcycle riders who have come off their bikes without wearing the appropriate safety gear.\r\nFact: A rider will lose 1mm of their exposed flesh for every mph they are travelling over 30mph.\r\nMost culprits are younger riders on mopeds which can travel in excess of 40mph - that is 10mm of their exposed skin lost.\r\nPLEASE put this petition through and get this law passed.",
        "background": "A law should be passed which ensures riders should NOT be able to pass their CBT (Compulsory Basic Training) without it.\r\nIf they are caught riding a motorcycle in shorts & T-shirt, they should be pulled over and given points on their licence or a fine.",
