Penalty Charge Notices (PCNs) are typically given out by local authorities and private providers for breaches of parking rules. This means that refunding PCNs would be a matter for those authorities and private providers, not the UK Government or Parliament.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about PCNs here: https://www.gov.uk/parking-tickets.\r\n\r\nYou could have a petition calling on the Government to abolish all fines for breaches of covid-19 restrictions, if that is something you'd like to see happen.\r\n\r\nYou might also like to sign this petition, which calls for a related action:\r\n\r\n'Repeal the Coronavirus Act': https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/592632"
