        "additional_details": "My grandfather died of lung cancer. He did not smoke, but he worked with a smoker; he essentially died from secondary smoking. When I leave my house I find people leaning against my home, smoking. You may think there is nothing wrong with that, but by smoking near others, they are forcing us to smoke, as inhaling smoke has similar effects as smoking. This is unacceptable. So I ask the government to make it illegal to smoke in all public places.",
        "background": "Smoking is already illegal in workplaces and enclosed public spaces, but this should be extended to all public places. Although taxes on cigarettes provide valuable public funding, people die every day of secondary smoking This is why I am asking the government to ban smoking in all public places.",
