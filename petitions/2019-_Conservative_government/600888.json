        "additional_details": "The voting age for devolved and local elections in Scotland and Wales has been lowered to 16. Many political parties support this, some of these are: The Labour Party, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats.\r\nSixteen-year-olds are taxed on income yet still have no power in elections despite contributing to the country and its future. You start paying national insurance at 16, yet don't receive your pension until after the age of at least 65. At 16, you pay many taxes, however you still cannot vote.",
        "background": "We want Parliament to allow 16 year old's to vote in General Elections and referendums. Under current legislation, a person must be 18 or over to vote in General Elections in the UK. We want this to change, allowing anyone 16 years or older to have the right to vote.",
