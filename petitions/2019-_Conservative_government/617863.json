        "additional_details": "Thousands of children are stuck in a warzone, a refugee camp or similar and in danger from the atrocities and displacement of war. In many cases, parents are not able to travel.\r\n\r\nCurrently children are treated as unaccompanied minors unless they are travelling with or to join their parents. This means that even if a child is travelling with another relative, with their parent's permission, as is permitted by the Ukrainian government, they may be refused entry to the UK due to safeguarding concerns.\r\n\r\nThe Government must review policy on Ukrainian children, who are accompanied by a relative other than a parent, seeking to enter the UK from Ukraine, to ensure that these children are supported to seek refuge in the UK.",
        "background": "Currently the war in Ukraine has displaced millions of people. The necessity of war has meant that many family groups have been separated and often children have been placed in the care of relatives other than their parents to flee. Many have been refused access to the UK due to 'safeguarding'.",
