        "additional_details": "We think that our asylum system is becoming overly abused, and that this abuse must stop. We think there is far too much of our taxes being spent on these disproportionate and unjustified proceedings, which we believe would be better spent on the UK and its citizens. We believe that if the Government removed all immigration and asylum appeal rights, and judicial review, it would save the tax payer money, which could be better spent on the UK's citizens, levelling up the UK, and also would rapidly decrease the unprecedented issues with the asylum system.",
        "background": "We call upon the Government to remove all appeal rights in all immigration and asylum cases, which should include restricting judicial review in immigration and asylum cases. Those whose asylum claims have been rejected should thereby be removed promptly.",
