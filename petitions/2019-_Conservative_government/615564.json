        "additional_details": "I have been out of work since Jan 2022 because I had depression and anxiety due to the negative treatment I experienced at work. I lost my income. I lost my confidence working. More importantly I lost my enthusiasm for my profession.\r\n \r\nI want employees to be able to claim constructive dismissal against their employer without needing to have worked for a certain number of years, to ensure that employers can be held to account for poor conduct.",
        "background": "If your employment started after 6 April 2012 you must have been employed for two years to claim Constructive dismissal against your employer. We want this rule removed, so any employee forced to leave their job against their will because of their employer\u2019s conduct can claim constructive dismissal.",
