        "additional_details": "Millions of students have been overlooked by the govt throughout this pandemic. Tuition fees remain at 9.2k a year plus interest which hasn\u2019t been addressed. Thousands of 1st year students have been forced into isolation with no consideration to the effects this will have on mental health. Uni students have been told to trust the government through these unprecedented times but we\u2019ve been constantly overlooked. I\u2019m asking the government to lower tuition fees until learning goes back to normal.",
        "background": "Students across the UK have returned to University to be told our learning will be predominantly online for the foreseeable future. The Government should therefore lower our tuition fees and we should receive a partial refund for the effects this will have on our learning and university experience.",
