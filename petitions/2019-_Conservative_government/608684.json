        "background": "With soaring energy bills and rocketing fuel poverty, we must recover our domestic oil and gas reserves. The British government must instruct the Oil and Gas Authority that recovering onshore gas and developing offshore oil is an overwhelming national priority.",

We could accept a petition calling for changes to the framework for oil and gas exploration and exploitation, but it would need to be clear what changes you wanted to be made to existing rules."
