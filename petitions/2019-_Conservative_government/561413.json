By dismissing her the government shows they are not prepared to accept this form of behaviour. Not to do so sets the wrong example to others. Bullying in every situation must be condemned.",
        "background": "The government must show it is opposed to bullying by removing from office anyone who has used bullying whilst in that office. By not doing so it would condone bullying which is damaging and could be life threatening in any workplace, in education, and in government.",
