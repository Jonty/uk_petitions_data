        "additional_details": "Having witnessed over the past 30 years, changes implemented by the Welsh Government, many of the elected members have taken the opportunity to make a mockery of the general public who live within the country by introducing policies which have neither benefitted or enabled the general public or enable corporate businesses to work within Wales. As such, it would be beneficial for the UK Government to change the process by ensuring legislations are made to the House of Lords before any assents.",
        "background": "Remove the cause and effect of which the Welsh Government have abused the devolved powers by repealing all decisions made by the Welsh Government and ensuring that no misuse happens towards the economy of the British Commonwealth.",
