Require removal of telecommunications installations from areas that demonstrated objection to installation or where poor/no consultation took place.\r\n\r\nWe believe the places we call home are being irrevocably damaged by the installation of 8-15m broadband poles by Alt Nets. Permitted development legislation (2015) gives Alt Nets rights to install poles without planning permission or consultation, regardless of whether an area is already well-serviced by underground infrastructure or where there is strong opposition to installation. Please stop  what we see as the unfettered corporate vandalism of our homes - we don't want your broadband poles, we want underground infrastructure.",
