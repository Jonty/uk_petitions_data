        "additional_details": "As an aviation enthusiast it is fun to listen to ATC at an airport as you can understand what is happening. It is also very educational for people who might want to become Air Traffic Controllers or pilots as they can listen and partially learn how ATC works. I know that many people in this community want to listen to ATC as many people are now taking their Private Pilots License (PPL) and it can help them in their future.",
