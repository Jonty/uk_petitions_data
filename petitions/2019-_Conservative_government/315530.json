        "action": "We want financial support for small company owners who get paid via dividends.",
        "additional_details": "Over a million small business owners don't take large salaries from their companies. Instead many of them receive most or all of their personal income as dividends paid to them as shareholders.\r\nSome of these companies have additional employees but many consist of just a single person who has followed their accountant's advice to set up such a structure.\r\nWe feel it is manifestly unfair that such people are not set to receive the same consideration that employed and self-employed workers will.",
        "background": "The government has pledged to provide furloughed employees with 80% of their usual salary during the COVID-19 emergency and we are asking for the owners of small companies who are paid largely or entirely through share dividends to receive similar treatment, i.e. 80% of their regular incomes.",
