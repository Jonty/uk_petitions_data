        "additional_details": "The Department of Health (2008) suggests that, for many, a good death would involve being treated as an individual, with dignity and respect, without pain and other symptoms, in familiar surroundings and in the company of close family and friends. Too often, however, people with dementia receive undignified treatment and are ending their lives in pain or indignity. We believes that people with dementia have the same right to a good death as people with other health conditions.",
