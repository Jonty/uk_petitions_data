I fully agree with a fair and just trial for all defendants, but after going through the process after the murder of my nephew Jay Sewell, I believe the process is one-sided and biased. At closing speeches defence counsel were allowed to read out letters of references as to the characters of defendants, so I believe it would be fair to allow Victim Witness Statements to be heard by the jury.",
