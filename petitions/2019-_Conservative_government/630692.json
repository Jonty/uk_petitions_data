        "additional_details": "People have been fishing sustainably from Holy Island for over 500 years. This proposal has already been opposed in a big way by communities both on and off the island. As it is now at consultation stage, the people involved are rightly worried. We believe our Government should be less concerned with a handful of boats fishing in a traditional and sustainable way, and should instead take action on bigger issues facing the industry, such as gigantic trawlers fishing illegally and huge ships acting outside of EU regulations on fishing.",
        "background": "DEFRA are consulting on making Lindisfarne a Highly Protected Marine Area, which would include banning fishing on Holy Island. This would ruin livelihoods of the fishermen and therefore community and island itself. We want the Government to commit to not banning fishing on Holy Island.",
