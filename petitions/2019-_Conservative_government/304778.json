        "additional_details": "This will help small manufacturers who are one of the biggest employers in the country keep their staff and ensure that their businesses do not go into liquidation. Suspension of business rates is very important alongside loans to support companies whose workforce cannot attend work during this period due to the nature of the manual work they do.\r\n \r\nLoans alone will leave the company in debt which may well only end in liquidation later, this needs to be avoided at all costs.",
        "background": "The Government should suspend business rates for small manufactures, as it has done with other industries, and make loans available immediately with minimal obstacles to obtaining support.",
