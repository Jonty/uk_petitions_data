        "additional_details": "Scalping is not a new issue, it has unfortunately become a popular way for people to abuse software advancements to purchase goods online, and complete transactions faster than the average public can. Apart from preventing the general public being able to purchase products such as PlayStation 5\u2019s online, these scalpers are enjoying huge profits of untaxed income, and have possible links to criminal organisations. A suggested solution would be to prevent, or cap, resale profit above RRP.",
        "background": "We, the general public and consumer, would like the government to consider options to prevent the \u201cScalping\u201d of products online. Products that are being purchased unfairly by advanced software, and then re sold above RRP by up to, and above, 50%.",
