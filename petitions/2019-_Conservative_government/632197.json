        "additional_details": "The most welcome solution would be to either push the 2030 deadline back or remove it all together.\r\n\r\nGiven the shortage of charging points, raw materials and an electric grid capable of supporting vast amounts of electric vehicles, 2030 is far too soon for an effective transition to electric vehicles, assuming people can afford them which is not the case for the majority.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, internal combustion engine technology in recently decades has become far less polluting and more efficient.",
        "background": "The push to ban new diesel & petrol cars by 2030 is unrealistic for several reasons. 1) Public transport is on average overpriced, unreliable and not practical for tradesmen. 2) Electric vehicles are too costly new & unreliable second hand. 3) Other means such as bicycles are often not feasible.",
