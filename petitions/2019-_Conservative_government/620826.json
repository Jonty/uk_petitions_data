Especially given the current cost of living.\r\n \r\nI had to visit a wound clinic 7 days a week for more than a month, I couldn't drive so I had to use taxis, then I had prescription charges on top of this. I was recovering from major surgery and it simply makes no sense to charge for prescriptions in these circumstances.",

This required emergency open surgery followed by an extremely rough 6-week recovery. I received \u00a396 per week. This had to cover taxis to wound clinics and prescriptions. It is not feasible.",
