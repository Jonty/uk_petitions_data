        "additional_details": "Experiences children and young people have in the classroom can become the foundation for personal development and academic progress. Teachers that carry unconscious biases, or don\u2019t know how to handle racism in the classroom, can have a detrimental effect to the development of young people of an ethnic minority. Mandatory training on how to eliminate unconscious bias, what constitutes a microaggression, and how to handle racism in schools, would be life-changing for black students.",
        "background": "We propose mandatory training on what constitutes a microaggression & how to manage racism in schools. Microaggressions have an impact on young BAME people's mental health. Mind found that 47% of school staff said that racism affects the mental health of the young people who experience it.",
