        "additional_details": "By law you have up to 24hrs to report an accident on the road even if involves a person and can face 5 to 10 penalty points, disqualification for 6 to 12 months and up to a \u00a35000 fine + up to 6 months custodial sentences. \r\n\r\nThe law can act as an incentive for drivers to flee scene if they kill/injure someone. I want sentences increased to be a deterrent from other drivers doing this and maybe we will be able to save lives on the road. And required report time reduced. \r\n\r\nA hit-run driver left our dad in the road to die alone. If he had stopped and rang 999 he may saved him or gave us chance to say goodbye. He got a fine and 8 points for failing to stop and report. This guidelines needs to be changed for drivers who cause death/injury on road and don\u2019t stop.",
        "background": "We want the Government to require that all traffic collisions be reported to the authorities immediately, and that minimum and maximum sentences for failure to stop at collisions that result in death or serious injury be increased.",
