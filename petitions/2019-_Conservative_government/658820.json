        "action": "Abolish KS2 SATs and Foster True Learning Experiences",
        "additional_details": "The government should eliminate KS2 SATs to promote a more student-centered and holistic education system. Abandoning standardized testing allows for a focus on individual growth, creativity, and critical thinking. This shift would alleviate the stress imposed on students, empower educators to tailor their teaching methods, and ultimately contribute to a more effective and meaningful learning experience. By investing in a comprehensive educational approach, the government can better prepare students for a dynamic future and foster a genuine passion for learning.",
        "background": "The government should prioritise a comprehensive reform in primary education by abolishing KS2 SATs. Instead, focus on fostering holistic learning experiences that nurture creativity, critical thinking, and individualised growth. Invest innovative assessment methods, and a curriculum that inspires.",
