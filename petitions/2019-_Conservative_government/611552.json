        "additional_details": "Most students taking their A Levels in 2023 will not have taken their GCSE exams as normal, and received teacher assessed grades instead. We believe it is therefore only fair for the Government to work with Ofqual to put in place similar arrangements to those that have been put in place for 2022.",
        "background": "We want the Government to require that exams boards provide advance information about the content of A Level exams, and work with Ofqual to ensure that students are graded as generously as they were in 2022, to reflect the disruption caused by covid-19.",
