Rishi Sunak has stated that his agreement with the EU (The Windsor Framework) makes NI an extremely appealing location for businesses to invest in. However, it is important that the entire UK receives the same benefits and becomes a desirable location for investment. It is unfair that only Northern Ireland has such opportunities while the rest of the country does not.\r\n",
