        "additional_details": "We support the creation of new measures, and we suggest that the government take steps to improve the practices of the insurance sector by creating the necessary regulations that ensure the process of recovering unused premiums to contributors. Encouraging alternatives to the conventional insurance such as national cooperative funds. Introducing emergency aid scheme under the National Insurance system to help people on low incomes manage accidental emergencies.",
        "background": "UK residents pays \u00a350 billion as insurance premiums every year, that is \u00a3100,000 per a single household lifecycle. While insurance is meant to be cooperative, insurers use only 10% of collected premiums to cover total claims and the remaining don't get paid back to holders because of bad regulations",
