        "additional_details": "We believe that resettlement schemes are much better for the lives of refugees. Refugees are at risk of mistreatment at borders around the world, especially if they are in areas of conflict. They can be beaten and tortured once they reach other countries. I am not trying to say that the British Government would actively enable this at our borders, but this is a testament to the low standard of the treatment of refugees in some countries. With more than 10,000 refugees crossing the English Channel this year, it is important that we welcome them with open arms instead of rejecting them.",
        "background": "We want the Government to work with other countries to resettle people seeking asylum in other countries, rather than send them to Rwanda while their asylum claim is processed. The European Court of Human Rights has said sending applicants to Rwanda risks treatment contrary to their human rights.",
