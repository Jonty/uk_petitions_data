        "additional_details": "We ask that the benefit cap should be temporarily lifted for those in employment, who can prove they had to self-isolate, are awaiting furlough payment or where the furlough payment is not high enough to mean the cap does not apply. It is great help to many that rental and personal allowances have been increased however if the worker, through no fault of their own, is not able to earn the amount required to lift the benefit cap he/she should not be penalised by the benefit cap.",

However the benefit cap affects many in self isolation, waiting for furlough payment or for whom the furlough payment is not high enough to mean the cap does not apply.",
