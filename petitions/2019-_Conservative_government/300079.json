        "action": "Reduce student debt for student nurses and midwives",
        "additional_details": "Prior to 2017, English student nurses and midwives received a bursary award towards living costs and university fees during their degrees. The new bursary is acknowledgment it was not appropriate to remove.\r\n\r\nIn the academic years 2017, 2018 and 2019, there has been no NHS bursary award. \u00a0Most student midwives and nurses in those intakes will therefore leave university with at least \u00a360,000 debt, despite having committed to a career in a valuable, public service at a time when the NHS is in desperate need of more of them.",
        "background": "This petition asks that the student loan debt of existing students during the 2017, 2018 and 2019 academic years is reduced by \u00a35,000 (the bursary from 2020) per each of those academic years in which they studied and did not receive any bursary.",
