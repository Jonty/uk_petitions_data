        "action": "Introduce harsher custodial sentences for crimes such as rape and murder",
        "additional_details": "There are concerns over the reoffending rates of UK offenders and the safety of the public. The current proven reoffending rate in the UK is 29% meaning there is almost a 1 in 3 chance of a murderer/rapist repeating their crime. This is a huge issue and many people in the UK do not feel comfortable knowing some of the countries worst criminals are given such light punishment. Victims have to suffer lifetime consequences whereas perpetrators can recover after less than a decade.",
        "background": "Debate the possibility of extending life sentences for certain crimes including murder and rape. These crimes have a devastating and lasting impact on their victims and this destroys lives. Rape sentences only carry an average sentence of 8 years despite a much longer impact on the victim.",
