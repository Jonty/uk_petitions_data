In light of this, it would be unfair to victimise a whole generation of students because of a pandemic they had no control over. \r\n\r\nBecause many students do much better in their actual exams than their predicted grades, it would be the fairest thing to do to allow students more time to sit their papers, and let their work speak for itself. \r\n\r\nIf the government is adamant about preserving the timeline, an alternative should be provided.",
