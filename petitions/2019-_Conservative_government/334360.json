        "additional_details": "Currently there are few requirements for tattoo artists other than to obtain a license from their local council and it's not that difficult to get one.\r\n\r\nPartly because of the history of our trade, some artists have a criminal history and I do not wish all crimes to be held against someone.\r\n \r\nAn enhanced DBS check bringing up particular crimes that make them a danger that will stop them obtaining a license will prevent them being in the industry. And stop them abusing their power against other artists/clients.",
