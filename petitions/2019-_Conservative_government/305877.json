        "action": "Close special schools to prevent the spread of covid 19",
        "additional_details": "The government should give headteachers the power to select which children within special schools should be considered vulnerable at this time and close all special schools. Children in these schools are likely to have low immune systems and be more physically vulnerable than children in mainstream meaning they are more likely to experience severe symptoms if they catch the virus. We must protect high risk students and the general population.",
        "background": "It was announced this week that schools will be closed from Monday 23rd March, except for children of key workers or with SEN. For special schools however this is the entire school population which means SEN teachers and children with SEN will continue to be exposed to large groups of people.",
