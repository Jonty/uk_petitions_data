        "additional_details": "We believe the protesters have an undeniable case of existential relevance for society. There have even been warnings by some experts that the Climate Crisis threatens to destroy civilisation altogether. Yet, the international processes supposed to stop the destruction of the planet - as we know it - and of civilisation appear so far not to be working.\r\n\r\nWe live in a democracy. When humanity and civilisation are threatened, the people are not only entitled, they rather are obliged to get involved.",
        "background": "The roadblocks and disruptive protests are ultimately the Government\u2019s fault. The Government must immediately engage in constructive engagement with protesters and consult society as a whole on how to stop the destruction of civilisation through the Climate Crisis.",
