        "background": "1.2 billion animals are slaughtered each year in the UK. In addition, almost one billion fish and 4.4 billion shellfish are killed each year in the UK. Requiring abattoirs to close and encouraging everyone to go vegan, even just for one day, may not save them all, but it could at least save some.",
