The group of people who will pay attention to and focus on calorie counts will be people with or at risk of eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia. People who are not actively trying to lose weight will not care about the calorie count, this will be unperturbed by such a thing being included on a menu.",
        "background": "We ask for the government to not implement the proposed rule where restaurants must display the calories in their meal on their menus. Find an alternative method please, such as healthy eating education, more nutritious school meals or making healthy food more available to low income households.",
