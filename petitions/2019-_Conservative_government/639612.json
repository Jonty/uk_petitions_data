        "additional_details": "The international stations were the key element of travelling in and out of London to our neighbouring European countries. It was ideal for UK residents to use local than spending more time travelling up to St Pancreas. It will give jobs to people who live close to the area and improve service and provide access to international countries without travelling into London to then come back through on the same train line to exit the country.",
        "background": "Bring back tourism and business travel services back to our local town. We were able to travel easy to France and other Europe destinations from Ebbsfleet and Ashford International before it\u2019s closure in 2020 as it bought in tourism and other services.",
