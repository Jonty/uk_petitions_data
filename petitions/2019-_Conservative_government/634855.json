        "additional_details": "So many victims of pedophilia feel like the law fails them, as the people that perpertrate the offences get off with a slap on the wrist, or in some cases a fine.\r\nOnline grooming, Pedophilia and sexual attack, deserve to be taken more seriously by the courts, not just past off as one of those things.\r\nI am Preposing we change the law so those that are convicted of child grooming, child rape, pedophilia are giving a minimum jail sentence of 5 years.",
        "background": "Our Children have the right to be safe, be it in real life, or online. There are so many sexual predators that try to prey on our Children, and so many of the sexual predators are repeat offenders.\r\nTo many pedophiles get off with extremely light sentence",
