        "additional_details": "This should benefit not only children but the whole UK population by helping to stem intergenerational spread. \r\n\r\nThroughout the pandemic the positivity rate among primary and secondary school aged children has been high. Given the high prevalence re-infections in children seems common. A recent UKHSA report showed that a significant proportion of those affected by re-infections < 90 days are children. This constant exposure occurs even with the current School's Covid-19 guidance in place. This would only be exacerbated if the government removes the tools to help schools identify and control Covid-19 spread.",
