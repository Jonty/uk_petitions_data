        "additional_details": "We are being kept up by roadworks that we were not warned about until past midnight during a lockdown. Legislate the roadworks within residential areas to avoid noise affecting the residents by limiting the allowed working hours within areas of residence. Roadworks on highways outside of these areas do not bother anyone. Roadworks that are on our doorsteps need to be regulated, the time of operation of such loud machinery should follow the same guidelines as construction work does.",
        "background": "Under current law, roadwork can be conducted at any time of night even in residential areas. Roadworks do not fall under the same laws as construction work. That appears amiss since these laws were put in place to protect the health and well-being of residents.",
