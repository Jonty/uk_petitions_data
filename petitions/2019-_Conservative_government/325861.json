        "additional_details": "Excluding British imperialism robs children of understanding how colonialist ideology was implemented. This stunts the growth of racial equality and hinders the racial esteem of black children. Younger generations are the minds we need to mould to build an anti-racist open minded society. Not only does education nurture intelligence in our children but it teaches them right from wrong. In a world that craves racial equality, promoting it should be at the forefront of education.",
        "background": "Make Black history ,including British imperialism and colonialism, mandatory on the national curriculum for primary and secondary schools. Focus on interpersonal and systematic racism in the UK. Focus on the evalution of systematic oppression ,e.g the history of the Windrush generation.",
