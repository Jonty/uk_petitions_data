        "additional_details": "We believe the proposal to install up to 116 windturbines in Sussex Bay stretching from Worthing to Selsey will blight the whole seascape along this area of outstanding natural beauty. The turbines will be as tall as 325m, 2.35 times  the height of Rampion1 turbines, and  higher than any hill in West Sussex. Sited only 8 miles from the shoreline, this proposal will be much nearer land than many offshore wind farms, which will impact local communities to a greater extent.",
        "background": "Energy Companies should be encouraged to make investments in windfarms in areas like the North Sea where the winds blow at greater strengths and more constantly, resulting in higher efficiencies. This would also be out of sight of land.",
