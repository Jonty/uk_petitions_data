        "action": "Make the wearing of face masks in public places compulsory during COVID-19",
        "additional_details": "The failure of the UK government to accept the mandatory use of face masks may cost us dearly with higher levels of person to person transmission in public spaces that in turn leads to more cases, more deaths and resultantly a significantly longer lock down period with greater economic damage to the country. See the blog https://leukaemiabusters.org.uk/blog/blog-unmasking-the-myths for further information and the rationale behind this call.",
        "background": "This petition urges the UK government to URGENTLY revisit its policy on the wearing of face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic making it mandatory for all citizens to wear a mask when in public spaces. Face masks should be manufactured in the UK by re-purposed manufacturers and handed out for free.",
