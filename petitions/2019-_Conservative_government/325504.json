        "additional_details": "We have come out to clap the NHS on consecutive Thursdays but we feel some more permanent recognition should be given. The George Cross is the civilian equivalent of the Victoria Cross, and there have been two occasions when it has been awarded to groups - to the people of Malta in 1942 and to the RUC and their families in 1999, so there is a precedent, and the NHS workers have been every bit as brave in the face of adversity as those two groups.",
        "background": "The George Cross committee of the Cabinet Office should recommend that the Queen awards the NHS the George Cross for their collective heroism and bravery in battling the pandemic and saving lives - from doctors to nurses and support staff and everyone working for the NHS.",
