The Government has already done this for energy bills through the Energy Price Guarantee, and we can accept petitions calling for this support to be made more generous. We could also accept a petition calling on the Government to put in place similar support for water bills.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
