        "additional_details": "We believe there has been significant under investment in the public sector since 2008/9 financial crisis, and that the consequences of not increasing public sector pay sufficiently are already being felt across the public sector.\r\n\r\nBoth the NHS and armed forces are struggling for personnel, and we believe this will negatively affect this country and our perception around the globe. The world appears to be getting ever more unpredictable and volatile and we think a strong armed forces and healthcare system is essential to our country.\r\n\r\nRead the IPPR's report on public sector pay here: https://ippr-org.files.svdcdn.com/production/Downloads/public-sector-pay-july23.pdf\r\n",
        "background": "Take the recommendation from the IPPR and increase public sector pay by 10.5% to improve recruitment and retention. The IPPR has said this would restore public sector pay to 2019/20 levels, and should only increase inflation by up to 0.14%.",
