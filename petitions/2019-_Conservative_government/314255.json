        "additional_details": "It is unacceptable and unethical that NHS staff members are unable to protect themselves adequately.  Under COVID-19 personal protective equipment (PPE) section of 'Safe ways for working for all health and care workers' , it states that \"staff should have access to the PPE that protects them for the appropriate setting and context\". NHS staff members are using bin bags as a way to protect themselves. They are risking their lives to fight COVID-19, who is risking their lives for them.",
        "background": "I want the government to invest in distributing more surgical face masks to NHS hospitals across the country. Whether that means seeking aid from manufactors who make surgical masks and protective gears or from other countries and investors. More needs to be done to help NHS workers.",
