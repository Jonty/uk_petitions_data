        "action": "Make mental health education compulsory in secondary schools and universities",
        "additional_details": "This is due to the fact that 50% of mental health symptoms start before the age of 14 and 75% before 24. In England alone 1 in 4 people will experience a mental health problem of some kind each year. This means in a school class of 30 statistically 7 students will experience these problems.\r\nEvery 30 seconds a teenager commits suicide around the world. This statistic proves within itself how vital mental health education is within our schooling system.",
        "background": "Provide a government mandated course that is compulsory for all secondary schools, Fe collages and universities. Whether its carried out online during Free/Study periods or in class to ensure young people are getting  the correct education about mental health to reduce the stigma around it.",
