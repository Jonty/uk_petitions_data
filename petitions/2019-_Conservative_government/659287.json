        "additional_details": "We believe the Government should implement a policy that allows for compensation of pay for placement students in non-salaried teacher training programs. Such a policy could ensure that these students receive fair compensation for their time and effort invested in their training, while also incentivising them to perform to the best of their abilities. This could not only benefit the students, but also the educational institutions and the broader educational community as a whole by fostering a more skilled and motivated teaching workforce. Therefore, we believe that it is imperative for the Government to consider adopting this policy to attract and retain top talent in the field of education.",
        "background": "Student teachers on a non-salaried route work receive no payment for their labour when on placement, despite working similar hours as full paid teachers. If these trainees were to receive payment, we believe they would be motivated to continue their studies and have fewer financial worries.",
