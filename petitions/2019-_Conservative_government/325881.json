        "additional_details": "Some hospital patients are not able to use their phones or video calls to stay in contact with their loved ones and have no contact with anyone they are familiar with. A typical examples could be they have suffered a stroke and have lost use of limbs or brain function. Seeing someone they are familiar with may speed their recovery and mental state of mind. Even an hour visit everyday by their main carer would benefit a vulnerable patient who they are used to relying on on a daily basis.",
