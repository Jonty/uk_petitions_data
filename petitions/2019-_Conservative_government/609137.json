        "additional_details": "Both Russia and the United Kingdom both possess large nuclear arsenals with the potential to wipe out all life on this planet many times over. We ask the Government to not go to war with Russia over Ukraine in order to preserve life on Earth as a conflict with Russia could be a nuclear war that leads to the deaths of everyone. The best way to avoid conflict with Russia would be to accept the Ukraine crisis is a matter between the governments of Ukraine and Russia, and no one else.",
        "background": "The Government is taking a needlessly aggressive stance towards Russia in the ever-escalating crisis over Ukraine. We believe this attitude towards Russia could eventually lead to a nuclear war which would kill everyone, and we do not want this to happen.",
