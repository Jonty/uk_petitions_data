        "action": "Introduce conscription for the military",
        "additional_details": "A mandatory military service promotes a sense of shared responsibility and national identity. It fosters a stronger connection between citizens from diverse backgrounds, contributing to a more unified and cohesive society. It can provide individuals with valuable skills, training, and discipline that can be beneficial in and out the workplace. It may also help the UK fulfill its international obligations and commitments by providing a larger pool of military personnel for peacekeeping missions.",
        "background": "I think that the UK should introduce conscription for 18 - 22 year olds because conscription can enhance the UK's military readiness by ensuring a steady influx of trained personnel, thereby strengthening its defense capabilities and preparedness for unforeseen threats.",
