        "additional_details": "Scotland and Wales have a Government voucher scheme to assist rural communities to obtain better broadband where fibre optic services are not available. The alternative is 4G broadband where speeds in excess of 35mbps are common, even in super rural locations. The voucher covers the cost of the equipment and in England this service was available, but stopped in December 2019. There are countless areas in England lagging behind the World where broadband is essential.",
