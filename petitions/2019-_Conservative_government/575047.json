Dog owners would no longer have the anxiety that their companion could be potentially part of a lucrative black market money-making scheme. A capped price makes dogs affordable for all, especially those with children or the elderly. Ensuring that all enjoy the companionship that a dog brings to peoples lives. This would also secure Lucy\u2019s Law for puppy farming & importation.",
