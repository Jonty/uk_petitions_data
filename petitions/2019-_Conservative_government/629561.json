The reward of allowing the local authority to become responsible is freedom, because the routes will no longer just consider profit but will consider the requirements of the local community. This will give freedom to teenagers to travel safely, freedom for key workers working in hospitals, care homes, supermarkets and economic freedom for businesses who need staff to turn up to work in remote areas.",

This law will allow the local authority to regulate the buses insofar as franchising private companies to work for it. The local authority will plan routes and set fares.",
