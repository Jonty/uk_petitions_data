        "additional_details": "The coronavirus pandemic could push our NHS to breaking point, especially if tactics such as striving to achieve 'herd immunity' are pursued.\r\n\r\nSome medical professionals have sent clear warnings that there could be an enormous shortfall in the number of critical care beds that are projected to be required.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, there may be as many as 8,000 beds in nearly 600 private hospitals. The government should commit to requisitionining these and turning them into intensive care units.",
