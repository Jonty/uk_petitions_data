        "additional_details": "Children in schools should have the right to privacy in the toilets.\r\nChildrens are already being watched by cctv in most areas of their life. \r\nChildren are already conscious about their body image without cameras watching over them in toilets. \r\nChildren use sink areas for hygiene purposes. \r\nGirls can suffer from heavy periods and sometimes like to freshen up using their toilets as a place of privacy \r\nChildren feel embarrassed and uncomfortable knowing they are being watched when going to the toilet or to use wash basins. \r\nCCTV in childrens school toilets will effect the way children view the new world and will only deepen any mental health they may be going through.",
