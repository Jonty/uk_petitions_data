        "additional_details": "The current pandemic highlights the severe shortcomings of the social care system in the UK. Despite numerous reports, successive governments have failed to address this increasing problem, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without the support they need because of age, disability or caring responsibilities. Investing in social care infrastructure will meet the aim to 'build back better' by generating badly needed jobs and treating those in need with care, dignity and respect.",
        "background": "Establish a National Social Care Service, free at the point of delivery and funded through general taxation, which parallels the formation of the NHS after World War II. This will create a lasting legacy after the pandemic, and give the people of this country the social services that they deserve.",
