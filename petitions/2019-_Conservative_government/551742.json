In a lot of cases the child isn't actually ill but may have coughed a few times. In other cases whole bubbles are being sent home because a high percentage of children and staff are just waiting for tests. This means children and staff at at home unnecessarily. This is causing a lot of mental health issues for many children and their parents/carers.",
