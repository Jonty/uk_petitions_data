        "action": "Bring back funding for youth clubs and organisations.",
        "additional_details": "Young people have progressively been faded away from any government plans. Youth crime is on the rise and prevention is better than cure! Having a youth club within walking distance from your house would allow many vulnerable children to have a safe place, away from home and with their friends. It would not only pull young people away from crime but would also allow us to make new friends. Considering the lack of face-to-face communication we have had over the past year or so, this is important.",
        "background": "Over the last 10 years, I have seen more and more youth facilities in my local area and across the country crumble due to a lack of funding and not receiving sufficient government support. The government should be scrutinised for not supporting the young people of the UK and their well-being.",
