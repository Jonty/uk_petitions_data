        "additional_details": "Many dog owners do not know the risks of rawhide products for their pets and due to this many have had their lives crushed by the devastating impact that it can have. Blockages, choking and contamination are all risks associated with rawhide, while some fight through, others aren\u2019t as lucky.\r\n \r\nRawhide can contain toxic chemicals, although only in trace amounts this can still cause E. coli contamination and salmonella that even humans can be at risk when coming in to contact with said bacteria.",
        "background": "The government should review the use of rawhide in dog treats and look at banning it as an ingredient, or at the very least ensuring that a clear warning of the dangers are displayed on all packaging of treats that use rawhide as an ingredient.",
