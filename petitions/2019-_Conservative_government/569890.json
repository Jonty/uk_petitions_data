        "additional_details": "I'm calling on her Majesty Government to declare a national day of mourning and prayer for this nation. It's right for us to mourn the death of those who have lost their lives to Covid and show our true value of LOVE to those families, of that which our NHS was founded, in that good healthcare should be available for everyone regardless of wealth and this is also founded on what our Lord and Saviour Jesus said, that we should LOVE our neighbours as ourselves. Dear Prime Minister, it's within your power to declare a National Day of mourning and prayer on the 2nd of March which correlates to the day the first official death due to Covid-19 was recorded in the UK.",
        "background": "I believe it's the right thing to do at this junction. It's going to a year now that the first Covid-19 death was officially recorded in the UK and since then many families have lost their loved ones to Covid. As you always reminded us in your briefings that \"we are all in this together\".",
