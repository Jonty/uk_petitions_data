        "additional_details": "Money management is not currently integrated into the PSHE curriculum but is a key part of our lives which young people should be confident in. The Young Person\u2019s Money Index found 81% of young people feel anxious when it comes to finance. The same Index, in their 2022-2023 findings, saw that 82% of young people want to learn more about money and finance in school which shows the importance of integrating in-depth teaching on this subject into the PSHE curriculum.",
        "background": "We should introduce money management skills to the PSHE curriculum to help young people understand how money works. This should include lessons on basic things like opening a bank account, taking loans out and pensions as well more complex ideas such as taxes, types of interest and inflation.",
