        "action": "Cancel 2022 GCSE & A-Level exams",
        "additional_details": "Do not put Yr 10 & 12 students through unnecessary stress which would impact their mental health by forcing them to spend their final year, trying to play catch up, where they have missed so much classroom time in 2020 & 2021. Cancel the 2022 GCSE & A-Level exams.\r\nBy the time current Year 9 & 11 students start their preparations for GCSE & A-Level exams, we would have been vaccinated & should be back to normal",
        "background": "Too many Year 10 & 12 students have spent less than 30% in a classroom environment in this academic year and will never be ready for 2022 GCSE & A-Level exams, so it is only fair for those exams to be cancelled & a teacher determined grade given.",
