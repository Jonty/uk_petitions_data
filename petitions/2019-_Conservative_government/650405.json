The Government need to reassess and not just throw every dog that meets some of the criteria into the same category; potentially taking away loved family members over their looks.\r\nThere are MANY dog bites that happen to people from small dogs that cause just as much damage but as big dogs are seen as a threat they are not treated the same.",
        "background": "The Government have set out a definition for an XL bully but this is generalised towards big dogs that 'look' a certain way.They state 'Large dog with a muscular body and wrinkles on face' which under this definition could include mastiffs,dogue de bordeaux,cane corso,other bulldogs amongst others",
