        "action": "Increase the annual ISA allowance for investments within the UK market",
        "additional_details": "The domestic FTSE 100 index has continuously lagged it's peers in recent years. UK investors and UK pension funds who naturally have a home bias, would likely have seen below average returns in the last few years. Compounding this problem, UK firms are increasingly choosing to list abroad due to better company valuations. This can lead to a negative spiral where more UK investors choose to invest their capital in overseas markets and we loose out on opportunities at home.",
        "background": "The general ISA allowance should remain at \u00a320,000 despite inflation rising. However, a new type of ISA called the UK stocks and shares ISA should be launched with an increased \u00a340,000 annual limit. This ISA only permits investment within UK listed stocks and bonds.",
