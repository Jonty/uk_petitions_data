        "additional_details": "When the government locked down care homes all visiting stopped, 5 months later visiting remains so restrictive that it is causing great distress to residents and families. Those with dementia and other mental capacity issues do not understand why their families have stopped visiting. Many are craving physical touch from those they love. My mother is not allowed to hold my father\u2019s hand, her husband of 59 yrs, despite his advanced dementia and him crying as he doesn\u2019t understand.",
        "background": "To class the families of those in residential or nursing care as key workers. This would allow much freer visiting in a way that is still safe. Being a key worker would allow families to access testing and be able to visit and help care for loved ones who need touch and quality family contact.",
