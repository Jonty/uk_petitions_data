        "additional_details": "The relaxation of restrictions over the Xmas period plus the fact that many may ignore restrictions over the festive period is likely to lead to a growth in the R rate. The delay of all education until the 15.01.21 will prevent mass gatherings at schools and Universities and delay the travel of 1.2 million students until a stage when restrictions have been reimposed for some time. This should control a predicted surge in cases and hospitalisation, ease pressure on the NHS and implements the SAGE advice of needing a more severe set of restrictions implemented for easing over the Xmas period.",
        "background": "The Government should delay the return to nurseries, schools, colleges and universities until 15.01.21, by requiring them to remain closed until this date, to reduce the spread of the Covid-19 virus as much as possible following the relaxations of restrictions.",
