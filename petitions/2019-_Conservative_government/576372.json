        "additional_details": "I don\u2019t claim to speak for everyone but I know me and the people around me feel this way and the fact that the government think this is even conceivable given the current situation surrounding the virus just demonstrates to the public how little they have actually researched into the facilities they propose to open as very little social distancing is actually able to take place given the size and quantity of pupils sent to them. So to avoid going in circles forever I propose that we wait.",
        "background": "The re-opening of schools is obviously a very rushed and uneducated decision that the government seem to think would be a good idea although this could help students mental health it is not worth risking thousands of lives and as exams are cancelled there is little to no point in doing this.",
