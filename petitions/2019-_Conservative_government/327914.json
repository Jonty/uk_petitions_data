It is reasonable to request a total ban, or for tighter restrictions on these mobile apps.\r\nThese apps are easy access for sexual predators, paedophiles, stalkers, abusers etc. to bully and harass their victims with no trace.\r\nThey are marketed as a safe method of contact for online business communication, dating or \u2018short term projects\u2019, but I think the possibility of criminal use outweighs the so-called benefits of these apps.",
