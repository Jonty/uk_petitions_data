        "additional_details": "The negatives of fireworks outweigh the positives. Every year fireworks do the following: \r\n\r\n- Stress out animals, often to point of causing death \r\n- Trigger people with PTSD and trauma (e.g. soldiers)\r\n- Harm those with sensory issues, due to the unpredictable noise\r\n- Cause litter that is then left to rot\r\n- Flood our already stretched A&Es with unnecessary injuries\r\n\r\nI understand that they look pretty, however they do more damage than good. Pro shows enable people to still enjoy them, just considerately.",
        "background": "Purchasing and owning fireworks should not be allowed for the general public. The Government should introduce a law stating that fireworks should only be permitted for professional shows and events - this will mean they are handled safely, cleanly, and at predictable times.",
