        "additional_details": "As a result of four months off of school, students are under extreme pressure and struggling as a result of the immense workload which A Levels entail. Not to mention students who have been experiencing bereavements and worsening mental health. The services which have been provided are not sufficient nor equal across the country and this only reinforces the classist divides in Britain. \r\nNot all schools have been able to provide resources for all lessons and pupils, with those in disadvantaged areas being most negatively impacted.\r\n\r\nI hope that you will recognise that making changes to A Levels is just as, if not more important than GCSEs. I really hope that you will re-evaluate the situation and make some changes which will help students. \r\n\r\nThis is about the next generation.",
