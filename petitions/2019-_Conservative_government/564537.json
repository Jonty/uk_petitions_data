A lot of parents at the moment have lost jobs or are on furlough and cannot afford to put their baby\u2019s in nursery, which would be the only place they are able to interact with other children at the moment. It\u2019s also massively important for a parents well-being to get a bit of a break during these challenging times.",

Babies born in 2020 haven\u2019t been able to attend baby classes, playgroups etc. Babies need social interaction with other children especially round their age to help their development.",
