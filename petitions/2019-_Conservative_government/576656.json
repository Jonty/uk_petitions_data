        "additional_details": "Since the pandemic began, university students have been continually ignored. A lot of students have been unable to return to university accommodation because of things like shielding, financial issues, mental health etc, yet we are still being forced to pay our rent. Some private accommodation/university accommodation have reduced/eliminated their rent for their tenants, but for students who access housing through agencies are still being made to pay rent in full... \r\n\r\nIt needs to change.",
        "background": "I want the government to acknowledge that making students pay for rent is disgusting, when they haven\u2019t been living in their accommodation. You need to formulate a clear plan for landlords in the steps to making this happen. This way there is no confusion & risk of refusal from landlord to tenant.",
