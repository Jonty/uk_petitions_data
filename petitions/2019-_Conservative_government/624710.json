This means parents have the same tax allowance as those without children, but incur more costs because they are supporting two or more people.\r\n \r\nGiven the cost of living crisis, we believe it would be fairer on parents if they were allowed to use the tax-free personal allowance of any children who they are raising.\r\n \r\nThis should be better for our children, better for parents, and better for our future!",
