        "additional_details": "Mental disorders affect 1 in 4 people at some point during their lives. They can be challenging, difficult to deal with, and feeling alone is common.\r\nESAs are always there when they are needed most. They provide unconditional love, a purpose and a routine. Through companionship and affection, symptoms of mental disorders can be reduced or alleviated.\r\nMental health is a disability and, controlled by registration, ESAs can offer emotional wellbeing, and they should be recognised.",
        "background": "The government should legally recognise ESAs as assistance animals for people with mental health issues and they should have the same rights as other assistance animals, such as guide dogs. This should allow them to accompany with travel and live in non-pet housing.",
