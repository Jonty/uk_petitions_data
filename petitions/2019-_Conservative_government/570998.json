        "action": "Request an immediate emergency reversion to the EU Transitional Arrangements.",
        "additional_details": "Already, the impact of leaving the European Union is proving more economically catastrophic than even many Remainers anticipated.   Progressively, we are about to see major industries ruined by the inability to import or export to Europe on a frictionless basis.    The order in which industries will fail will mainly be determined by the perishability of the stock, coupled with the physical ability and financial capability of the companies to hold large volumes of stock.",
        "background": "I want the UK Government to immediately approach the European Union to request a return to the EU Transitional Agreement, and then hold a new Referendum on EU Membership, with the aim, subject to its result, to re-join the European Union.",
