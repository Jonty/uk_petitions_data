        "additional_details": "The pandemic has left many families struggling with food insecurity. The Government\u2019s decision not to extend Free School Meal provision or vouchers across the summer holidays will mean many children will go hungry. Free school meals provide vital support for low-income families and for almost a third of children, school lunch is their main meal of the day.\r\n\r\nExtending this scheme can potentially decrease health inequalities and ensuring a holiday without hunger for our country's children.",
        "background": "No child should go hungry in our country. We call on the Government make the U-turn to extend free school meals to all children living in poverty, including low-income working families. This roughly equates to 1.3 million children.",
