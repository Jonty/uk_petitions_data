Each year, leading nations meet to discuss how nations will move forward to help reduce emissions and mitigate the impact.\r\n \r\nI believe legislation introducing new requirements for product manufacturers, utility suppliers and service providers to display a carbon emission score (whether physically, or digitally), using a traffic light system similar to that for nutritional information, could make a significant impact to driving change.\r\n",
