        "additional_details": "The recent US Presidential inauguration showed the power of art and poetry when its potential to raise the spirit and inspire is allowed to join and shine forth from the highest and most respected position of the state, with a young person to represent it. This is something the UK, with its talented youth, should also do. For vivacity, and depth of feeling, create this platform for young people in the UK to aspire to make the most of their formidable strength, leadership and creativity.",
