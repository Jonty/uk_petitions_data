        "additional_details": "It is ridiculous that during a global pandemic, exams are being prioritised over both the physical and mental health of the population, especially of students. \r\n\r\nOnce students are sent back, the number of cases and deaths, and therefore the strain on NHS staff and resources, will increase. It has happened twice before and it will happen again. \r\n\r\nThe uncertainty surrounding exams has had a huge impact on the mental health of all year 13 students, and can only be resolved by exams being cancelled.",
        "background": "Cancel all a-level exams properly - not replacing them with \u201cmini exams\u201d. This combined with mock exams set by schools individually has a huge impact on the population. \r\nThe government has stated that they are entrusting this year\u2019s grades with teacher assessments. Therefore, prove that.",
