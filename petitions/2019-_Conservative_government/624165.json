        "additional_details": "We would like the Government to include exemptions in this legislation which would allow people to water any food crops, even if a hose pipe ban is being implemented. Domestic growing of food crops is a healthy and environmentally sound use of water in drought time, avoiding unnecessary food miles and wasted resources and should be supported.\r\n \r\nAt a time where food security is at its lowest and focus on food origin and health benefits of organically grown produce is increasing, we should not put barriers in place to prevent people growing food in their gardens or allotments. Food crops are a justified use of water.\r\n",
        "background": "The law on hosepipe bans is set out in section 36 of the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 (FWMA 2010). Ministers have the power to amend or make further legislation including exceptions to the list of uses in a hosepipe ban. \r\n",
