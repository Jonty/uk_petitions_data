Children are also at very minute risk of becoming ill from Covid 19,  therefore we do not see a reason why children should be put through the further trauma of a vaccine. Particularly after the year of alarm and trauma they have already had to endure because of the pandemic.",
        "background": "We want the Government to halt any plans to vaccinate children with the Covid 19 vaccines as children are at minimal risk of becoming ill from Covid 19.  We also want long term safety data regarding vaccines before there are any plans to inoculate children.",
