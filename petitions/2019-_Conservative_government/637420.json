        "additional_details": "It's crucial for the Government to require local authorities to uphold their responsibility of ensuring road safety, just as drivers maintain their vehicles for themselves and others. Hazardous potholes have damaged countless vehicles and placed undue burden on drivers striving to comply with regulations and secure roads. Immediate action must be taken to address this critical issue and prioritize public safety. We believe current legislation and obligations on local authorities are insufficient.",
        "background": "We want the Government to create new legislation that defines and requires local authorities to identify 'hazardous potholes', which pose a particular risks to motorists and their vehicles, and creates new requirements for local authorities to repair these in a durable fashion.",
