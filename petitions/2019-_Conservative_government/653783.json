        "additional_details": "By implementing mandatory training for all social workers we can ensure they are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to recognise the signs of domestic abuse, provide appropriate support and connect survivors with the resources they need to break free from abusive situations. With mandatory training in place, we can empower social workers to better understand the dynamics of abuse and provide survivors with the compassion and effective support they deserve.",
        "background": "Recently, at a conference where I shared my lived experience of domestic abuse with 300 social workers, even though many of their clients are victims of domestic abuse, they do not have mandatory training in place. I want all social workers to have mandatory domestic abuse training.",
