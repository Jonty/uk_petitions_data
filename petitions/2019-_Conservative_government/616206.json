        "action": "We would like a windfall tax to be imposed on energy companies",
        "additional_details": "In my view its totally wrong that energy companies should be recording huge profits whilst many are struggling to pay their energy bills.  The French haver restricted energy companies to a 4% rise, other countries have lowered or scrapped the VAT applied to energy bills yet we get a loan that has to be repaid.",
        "background": "Some of the fuel companies have announced obscene profits whilst quite a large number of people including the elderly and those with young children are having to go hungry.  This is totally wrong.  A windfall tax could be used to help reduce energy bills",
