        "additional_details": "Up to 01/09/2021, there are 35000 new confirmed cases in the UK and 207 more deaths. However, some universities have cancelled social distance, ready to fully resume face-to-face teaching, and do not give support to online classes for students who have difficultly participating in courses. \r\nThere are three reasons why we are petition: current vaccination no longer provides high-efficient protection; changeable resurging pandemic and increasing cases; travel restrictions within the border.",
        "background": "We are a group of students who wish to contribute our efforts to stop COVID-19 from the total outbreak again in the UK and we strongly urge the government to formulate regulations for universities to provide online learning opportunities for students who are difficult to attend offline courses.",
