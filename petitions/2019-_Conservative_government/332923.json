A child must be taught first-aid at school if they are ever alone with a family member that suffers from an illness and needs immediate medical treatment. They will know how to administer first-aid and how to ring emergency services immediately.\u00a0If an individual is suffering from a medical problem and needs first-aid administered immediately, their survival rate would be increased to 76.5% of the population if employed.",
        "background": "To make it compulsory to receive free first-aid training, that first-aid training is added in school curriculums and that it is taught in the workplace. It is vital to life that all individuals are first-aid trained. If a member of public has a heart attack the first 5 minutes are the most crucial",
