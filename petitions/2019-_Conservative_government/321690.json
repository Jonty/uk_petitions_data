        "additional_details": "NHS staff, Police and Fire have been heavily relied upon despite putting their own health at risk during this Pandemic. It would be morally wrong to punish this sector to pay for this pandemic. We are not looking for a pay rise, a badge or medal. Just to secure what we deserve. Pay rises in line with inflation, promotion and time served. Some organisations in the sector are still victim of a pay freeze and many have just come out of one. This should not be the solution to this financial problem",
        "background": "The Government should not impose a Public Sector Pay Freeze to pay for COVID-19. Public Sector workers have had pay freezes in various forms imposed on them to balance the books due to the last recession. We do not want a freeze in incremental/promotional pay or pay increases in line with inflation.",
