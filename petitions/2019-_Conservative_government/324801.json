According to Statista, Rugby League had 62,000 participants playing it in the UK whereas Basketball had 280,000 participating in the UK. Rugby League was given 15 million pounds, basketball was given nothing. The loss of the league would be extremely detrimental to Basketball in the UK.",

I would like the government to give the BBL the requested 1 million pounds asked for by Sir Rodney Walker to survive the current situation.",
