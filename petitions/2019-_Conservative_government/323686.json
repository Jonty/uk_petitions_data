This would improve the service for British people, enable recruitment of the best people to work in the NHS and provide long term investment for medical research.",
        "background": "Parliament should bring about an act similar to the 2015 international development act, which would set a target of 10% of GDP to be spent on the NHS. This would help revitalise the NHS and ensure its future as a world leading health service.",
