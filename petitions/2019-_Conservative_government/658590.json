My son was trapped inside a bus stop shelter when a lorry hit him, he had nowhere to run. Protection posts could have saved his life. Others have died in the same way and I believe that this could have been avoided. We want to make it legislation that all relevant authorities must install mandatory posts at every bus stop to protect our children and citizens.",

We want urgent action to prioritise pedestrian safety at stops, installing bollard and posts to prevent vehicle collisions.\r\n",
