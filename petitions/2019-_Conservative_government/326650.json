        "additional_details": "Sanctions on Syria have created significant hardship for the Syrian people. High levels of inflation have meant prices outstrip wages, and many individuals can only rely on their families in the countryside who grow their own food, or their neighbours. Otherwise they starve. Indeed, many Syrian people are starving. Medicines and foods are scarce or non-existent. End this suffering. Now.",
        "background": "I want the Government to consider easing or removing the sanctions on Syria. Current sanctions are impacting innocent and poor people. The UK should either amend their sanctions to allow medicines and food to enter the country, or abolish them for the currency to revive and jobs to grow.",
