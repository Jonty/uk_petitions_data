I am fighting for my life in this current situation, I feel I should make the decision when receiving treatment. As do many others. \r\nI am a person with full capacity, and with this in mind, current care pathways and protocols should be changed in order for people to have autonomy. This is achieved when a person has an operation, a patient will sign the consent forms knowing the risks.",
        "background": "NICE guidelines want to save resources and staff by not letting people with cancer receive vital treatments, therefore Drs and consultants have taken away the peoples autonomy in making their own decisions.",
