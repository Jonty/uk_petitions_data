If not now the time for all to put aside Politics & work for the National Interest then we will probably not (so I fear) be even a nation come 2021. \r\nPLM Votes alone will NOT save life. Ministers could all fall like flies. Unite now. Put aside Political Rhetoric, use all expertise. Save The Country. Be efficient. Both sides have smart ideas & working together in crisis is the only way to boost confidence; to prevent hysteria.",

Up-hold the National Peace. Steer HMS GB into port to fix up before the storm hits.",
