I feel that central government must, take a lead, so that a campaign to remove litter from major roads and restore national pride in our countryside and cities can be started.",

This problem is even more visible than plastics in the oceans and needs to be addressed. The Government should increase funding to Highway Agencies for clearance of roadside litter.",
