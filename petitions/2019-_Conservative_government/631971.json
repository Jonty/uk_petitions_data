        "additional_details": "Despite a weak political mandate and no discernible long-term vision, the PM seems determined to hang on until the last possible moment. Long-term damage is being inflicted on the British public, including on older people. Silver Voices, representing UK elders, points to the unnecessary deaths caused by the health and social care crisis and rising pensioner poverty. It is time for all political parties to lay out their solutions to the challenges and for voters to decide on a new Government",
        "background": "With collapsing public services, a cost-of living crisis, rising poverty and a stagnant economy, this Government has no answers to the challenges facing post-Brexit, post-pandemic UK. The country cannot afford another two years of decline and a General Election must be held in 2023 for a fresh start",
