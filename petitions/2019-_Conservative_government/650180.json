        "additional_details": "the current practice is unfair.  Often a patient can call at 8.30 and wait in a call queue, only to be told there are no call back appointments left!! Think about elderly, disabled or immobile patients who cannot make that call at 8.30 am! A citizen should be able to call their surgery and make an advance appointment with their own GP. At present I could call every day and find there are no call back slots which means I could, potentially, NEVER speak to a doctor Never mind SEE one",
        "background": "Current practice (since covid) means that surgeries operate a phone call triage system - patients must call between 8.30 and 9 am, giving some details of their symptoms. The surgery decides if a call back will be made.  This still does not guarantee an appointment.",
