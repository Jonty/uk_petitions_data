        "additional_details": "Over the last 24 months or so car insurance has increased dramatically for many people simply renewing on same terms (address, car model, number of accidents, age etc). As increases have been substantially higher than inflation, even without cause for change in circumstances, we want an inquiry to identify the reasons that are driving this, so these can be understood and tackled at a government / industry level.",
        "background": "We want the Government to launch a Public Inquiry into the increasing cost of car insurance in the UK, which is well above inflation. We think this inquiry should investigate price increases by major car insurers and get to the bottom of this issue.",
