        "additional_details": "If a 10 AM start was mandated it would ensure that all schools started at the same time, and all school children would get the same benefits from sleep. The 10 AM start would not affect the hours that a child attends school for, and school would start at 10 AM and end at 4 PM to give pupils six hours of education per day.",
        "background": "Children need sleep in order to learn, and due to children's circadian rhythm being different to that of adults, getting up at early hours in the morning simply isn't helpful for a child's education. I believe an 8 AM start time is too early and a 10 AM start would be better.",
