Coventry Youth Activists are calling for the Government to strengthen social media platforms\u2019 safeguarding responsibilities, to encourage them to invest in innovative ways to tackle this issue, rather than passing responsibility to the users posting the abuse. People with protected characteristics including disabled people should be afforded the same protections and rights online as in public places.",

The Government should impose a specific duty on these platforms to prevent and remove abusive posts targeted at disabled people.",
