The next generation must know so we can move forward as a society.\r\n\r\nSchools are currently not required to teach about the British Empire. That means many students remain oblivious to this shameful period of British history, allowing harmful misconceptions that it was beneficial to be perpetrated and \u201cnostalgia\u201d to develop. It cannot be ignored. It must be taught.\r\n\r\nAs children, many were raised by the media to feel proud that Britain had ruled so much in the past. We believe that was wrong, and the empire was wrong. But due to lack of teaching, few seem to understand that.\r\n",
