A larger escort fleet could have prevented this. \r\n \r\nAdditional fleet numbers will also mean we have cover for other ships in maintenance/refits etc.\r\n \r\nThis could increase jobs in ship building and within the Royal Navy.\r\n \r\nFalklands protection (remember 1982 and the defence cuts).\r\n \r\nGod save the Royal Navy.",
