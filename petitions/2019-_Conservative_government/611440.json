        "additional_details": "The pet passport scheme- having been fought for for years- was part of EU membership. It ended when the UK took the inconsiderate decision to exit the union. The Pet Passport Scheme was appreciated by EU citizens as well as Brits going on holidays in the EU. As with other deals, the scheme was probably just \"forgotten\" and just disappeared from the radar. We must reinstate the scheme for the good of people and animals.",
        "background": "Many Ukrainians fleeing the war in the Ukraine own pets, e.g. dogs and cats. They are loved family members. Having to leave their beloved pets behind will cause a lifelong trauma, especially for children. ATM they would have to if they want to enter the UK to connect with their relatives.",
