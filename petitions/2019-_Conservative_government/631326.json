Introducing conjugal visits should reduce the impact on relationships of incarceration. It could also make prisoners more likely to follow the rules for fear of losing their right to have a visit.\r\n\r\nNorway allows conjugal visits and it has one of the lowest re-offending rates in the world, with only 20% of convicts reoffending within two years of release. In comparison, the reoffending rate for convicts released from prisons in England and Wales is over 20% within one year of release.\r\n",
        "background": "An estimated 310,000 children have a parent in prison in England and Wales. 10,000 visits are made by children to prisons every week. With a limited number of visits per month, typically lasting for a maximum of 1 hour each, prison can have a hugely damaging effect on relationships and families.",
