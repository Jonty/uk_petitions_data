        "additional_details": "Going out to practice driving poses no threat of spreading coronavirus as everyone stays in the car at all times and doesn\u2019t mix with other people, while not allowing learners to practice will cause a huge backlog of learners needing lessons and tests after lockdown is lifted. Banning driving practice may also be dangerous as learners may go out without L plates on, or will lose valuable practice time when they can be gaining safe and helpful road experience while the roads are quiet.",
        "background": "Under the current lockdown restrictions, learner drivers in Scotland can practice driving with people they live with, but in England we are not allowed. The government should allow all learner drivers to practice driving, as long as they only get out of the car for essential reasons like shopping.",
