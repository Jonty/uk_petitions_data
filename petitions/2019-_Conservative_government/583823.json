        "additional_details": "1. Morally, it is the right thing to do.\r\n2. The recent uproar throughout the country that dragged Parliament into the debate.  You are already involved.\r\n3. It is a good positive move which if done well will even help lower league clubs and prevent them going bust and so helping people not to lose jobs and homes or rely on food banks.\r\n4. It has been shown that invested ownership leads to better run, efficient organisations which retain strong moral principles, e.g. John Lewis, Building Societies",
        "background": "Following the recent debacle with the European Super League driven by rich (often absent overseas) owners, introduce legislation to ensure real fans own the majority of a football club, similar to how clubs are owned in Germany.  This is not a new concept.",
