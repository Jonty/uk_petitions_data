        "additional_details": "As we become more reliant on electricity to meet our climate agreement obligations we need a power grid fit for purpose. No more high moorland overhead wires. The oversight of the Electric power networks needs the same power as the DoT over Rail franchises.  Give OFGEM the power to sanction companies who fail and to take into public hands in the final resort.  Taking dividends at the expense of other stakeholders should be severely limited. This is a publicly developed national asset which is now in the hands of overseas investors. Like other critical infrastructure we need to be in control of our own destiny. Storm Arwen and others demonstrated the underinvestment in the infrastructure.",

However, we're not sure what you want these 'annual targets' to be, what criteria would need to be met in order for the proposed communications strategy to be deemed 'fit for purpose', nor what powers you want Ofgem to be given that they don't already have. Ofgem has the power to impose penalties on utility companies.
