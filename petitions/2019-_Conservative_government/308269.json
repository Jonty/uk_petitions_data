Some universities may be better than others, while others can\u2019t access libraries, ask lecturers for help. Nor are the online class great, since the connection doesn\u2019t always work. I believe by paying \u00a39,250 per year for an insufficient education is utterly ridiculous and a way to rip of students, yet again.",
