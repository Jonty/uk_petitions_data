        "additional_details": "We are living in a society where there is too much processed food, and people are eating large amounts of hidden fats and sugars, which many people have not been educated about and do not understand, and are therefore unaware of. The amount of sugar people consumed has increased dramatically in modern times! This has a direct impact on our health and the health of our children. Most people eat too much sugar on a daily basis due to lack of awareness around nutrition, and the lack of clear and concise labelling. We are in an obesity epidemic and we need effective change.",
        "background": "Currently food packaging must have nutritional information on the back, but labels showing whether products are high in sugar and fat are voluntary. We want the Government to make it mandatory to say clearly whether a product is high in sugar and/or fat on the front and back of all food packaging.",
