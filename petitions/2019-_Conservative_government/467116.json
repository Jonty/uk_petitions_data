I own a dog groomers and pet shop, owning 5 dogs myself I wouldn't even put my dog or any dog under a dryer in this weather. It's heart-breaking to see these poor animals suffering when left in cars and some dying. Owners need to suffer the consequence of being an irresponsible dog owner one way or another.",
