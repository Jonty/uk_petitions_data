        "additional_details": "A major tournament win for over half a century is more than deserving of a day of celebration, relaxation and enjoyment. Whilst millions do, indeed, work on Bank Holidays, there are numerous people who would benefit from having the day off to adequately celebrate (and recuperate from doing so!) such an achievement. For decades we've been hoping to see football come home. If it does, let us be prepared to offer it a warm welcome.",
        "background": "Monday 12 July 2021 should be declared a Bank Holiday under s1(3) of the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971 if England win Euro 2020 to allow the country appropriate time to celebrate a once-in-multiple-generations achievement, both on Sunday night and the following day.",
