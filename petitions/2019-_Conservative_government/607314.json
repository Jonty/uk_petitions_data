Our history is full of examples of the government and the people choosing the difficult path in order to combat slavers, despots, and other infringers on human rights. We should seek, we believe, to live up to the example our predecessors set. In doing so, we should hold to the spirit of the Budapest memorandum and guarantee the sovereignty of Ukraine.",
