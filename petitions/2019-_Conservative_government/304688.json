        "additional_details": "It has been said by various 'experts' to the Guardian that a delay to exams as far as 2021 has been proposed which would profoundly impact the lives of students, particularly at A Level who are due to be starting university and have already spent 14 years in education. Cancelling exams would be the only humane solution, allowing students to move on with their lives following the virus.",
        "background": "As it is clear that exams will not go ahead in May to June, the government needs to rule out any delay to exams which would severely affect student's lives, especially those starting university in September and instead give students their predicted grades based on previous work under exam conditions",
