We believe that it would be beneficial to add this to the curriculum to prevent the pay gap from continuing in the future. By teaching students about this it should encourage them to not put up with earning less than their colleagues even though they have the same qualifications and the same job. This could then lead to the abolishment of the pay gap.",
