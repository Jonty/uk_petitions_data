        "additional_details": "We live in an age of vastly evolved technology. We believe there is no reason to be using animals in this way against their will. I would like the government to phase out the use of horses and transition into the 21st century with modern methods of policing and other public duties they are currently used for. Not only can the horses be injured regularly but so can the general public. We believe London and other cities are not the place for horses because of noise levels, volume of people and unpredictable situations.",
        "background": "Stop using outdated methods for policing and the Household Cavalry. We believe this is exploiting horses and can result in injury on multiple occasions. Horses do not have a choice and can be put into frightening and dangerous environments against their will with minimal protection.",
