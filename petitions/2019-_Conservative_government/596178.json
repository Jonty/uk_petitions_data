        "action": "DVSAs new guidelines for Driving instructors check tests are unfair on SEN.",
        "additional_details": "The new guidelines for check testing driving instructors (as per the .gov website) suggests a statistical focus on percentage failure rates of their pupils and number of \u2018driver faults\u2019 accumulated by their pupils during test. This would appear to penalise instructors with a customer base such as mine. It is therefore not surprising that some instructors are already suggesting that they would not take on pupils with learning disabilities, making it more difficult for such pupils to gain their driving licence and enhance their independence.  This could also limit their employment opportunities.",
        "background": "I am a driving instructor, I am also Dyslexic. The majority of pupils I take have various learning disabilities. These pupils often take more attempts to pass their driving test; and often with more \u2018driver faults\u2019. This is not through lack of capability but generally due to their anxiety.",
