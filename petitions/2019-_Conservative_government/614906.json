This has had a negative impact on the lives, for many with disabilities, when travelling from UK Islands to mainland Britain, for; medical treatment, making travel connections and going on holiday. \r\n\r\nRequiring Ferry Companies to comply with the equalities act, would mean these companies would need to make reasonable adjustment, allowing all disabled travellers to have the same rights of those that are able.",
