        "additional_details": "Around 5-10% of breast cancers in the UK are caused by an inherited altered gene. Approximately 1 in every 400 people in the UK carry a BRCA (breast cancer genes) mutation. Having this significantly increases someones chance of getting breast, ovarian or prostate cancer. There are other gene mutations (i.e. PALB2, TP53, CHEK2, ATM) which also increase the risk of hormonal cancers. \r\nIf a person has an altered gene, it also means that their children have a 50% chance of inheriting this from them.",
        "background": "If predictive genetic testing was available to all at 18 years, this would enable either enhanced screening or for them to have risk-reducing surgery to try to prevent cancer. \r\nThis could potentially reduce the number of men and women who go on to develop a hormonal cancer due to a gene mutation.",
