With plans to move all benefits claimants to UC by the end of 2024, we believe more staff are essential to ensure prompt and efficient services. If the Government cannot employ sufficient staff it should consider postponing the complete transition to Universal Credit until sufficient staff are in place. A delay in the transition could allow the Government to assess staffing levels and ensure adequate support for claimants.",
