        "additional_details": "There have been a number of high profile cases of violence against women and girls committed by men from countries who do not hold British values or ideals when it comes to equality of men and women. There needs to be a more robust deterrent for these crimes and the British taxpayer should not have to pay for these criminals to remain in the UK and serve sentence here. They should be immediately deported on determination of their guilt or prisons should be built in Rwanda as part of that offer.",
        "background": "I would like parliament to debate the issue of violent acts committed by migrants against women and girls in Britain. I would like a change in law to ensure these men do not remain in the UK once convicted or are released into the UK after their sentence is served.",
