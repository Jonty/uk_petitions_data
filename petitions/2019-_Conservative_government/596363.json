        "additional_details": "In England, in a same sex relationship you need to have 6 failed cycles of IVF/IUI before getting one funded attempt on the NHS. In a heterosexual relationship, you get an attempt for free if you meet certain criteria. In Wales, ALL females regardless of sexuality get 2 attempts on the NHS. In Scotland, ALL females get 3 free attempts on the NHS. In Northern Ireland, ALL females get 1 attempt. It\u2019s about time England caught up and offered same sex females equal rights.",
        "background": "I didn\u2019t choose to be gay, but because I am, we have to pay up to \u00a36,000 per IVF cycle and around \u00a32000 for embryo transfers, not including donor sperm and drugs. The fertility process isn\u2019t an easy one and often results in same sex couples not having children because of the financial implications.",
