        "additional_details": "OCD can be a crippling personal battle for some people and can really debilitate your every day social interactions with others, as well as when you\u2019re alone too. As someone who has lived with the condition and recognised it from a young age, it\u2019s not hard to see the problems it can cause in everyday life. To my knowledge, OCD is not a condition that is deemed worthy of any benefit and I believe this should be reviewed. It is estimated that around 800,000 UK citizens suffer with this condition.",
        "background": "I think it should be reviewed that OCD is included in the PIP (Personal Independence Payment) allowance. Many people see this condition as something they just \u2018learn to live with\u2019 and though it may not be a physically impeding condition, the mental aspect is very real.",
