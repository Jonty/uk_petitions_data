        "action": "Reconsider the enforced and indefinite closure of zoos deemed 'Covid secure'",
        "additional_details": "Zoos are to remain closed for an indefinite period, despite being \u2018Covid secure\u2019, able to safely limit numbers and enforce social distancing rules.\r\n\r\nZoos are almost entirely dependent on income generated from visitors. Prolonged closure risks losing these zoos, and their vital conservation work, forever.\r\n\r\nThere are also double standards. The government has determined that many public UK beaches, parks and other beauty spots not deemed 'Covid secure' can open, as can non-essential shops.",
        "background": "Many zoos are now deemed a 'Covid secure' environment for the general public and the government insists these remain closed.\r\n\r\nThis petition asks for a reconsideration in light of the fact that many public UK beaches, parks and other beauty spots are not 'Covid secure' but yet remain open.",
