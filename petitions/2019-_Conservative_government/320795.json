        "action": "Keep schools closed until September- except key workers and vulnerable children.",
        "additional_details": "There is no evidence that children do not transmit Covid-19. We know that children can transmit the virus by coming into contact with infected materials. It is highly likely that opening schools will infect children, their families, staff and staff's families. Keeping schools closed will allow scientists time to develop a treatment and/or vaccine and for more testing, so that we know where the virus is. People will certainly die if schools open too soon, it is only a question of how many.",
        "background": "Schools should not open until we have a better scientific understanding and control over Covid-19. We need more testing and data tracking. Schools should only open in areas where we know the virus is at a manageable level. Schools need more time to better prepare and establish safe guidance.",
