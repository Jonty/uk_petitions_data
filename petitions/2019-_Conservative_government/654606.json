        "additional_details": "Some people feel that the new plan is just a ploy to implement the original plan behind the public's back, to avoid addressing the original outrage. We expect parliament to properly scrutinize this issue. Ask why they included the original \u00a338,700 with the knowledge that the majority of the public does not earn this. Ask, if they can backtrack and scale back to \u00a329,000, why can't they scale back further to \u00a320,000, creating a more gradual stable increase instead of a massive leap?",
        "background": "Currently, the financial requirement to bring your spouse to the UK is \u00a318,600 per year. The government planned to increase to \u00a338,700, but after the public backlash the government scaled back to \u00a329,000 with an increase to \u00a338,700 later, this does not address what caused the outrage.",
