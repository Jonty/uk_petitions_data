        "additional_details": "It is unfair that a spouse expects 50% of assets when they have not supported the relationship financially but are capable of working but choose not to. I paid into my company pension since I was 18 moved in with my partner at 26 and after a 38 year relationship he leaves me & expects 50% of my pension even though he did not financially support the relationship. The spouse needs to prove they have financially supported the relationship before settlement is made in a court of law",

A spouse must be able to prove that they equally contributed financially before being awarded 50% of their partners pension & assets. This should not apply if children are involved & the spouse gave up a career to bring up a family.",
