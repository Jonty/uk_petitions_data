        "additional_details": "Demand that the Spanish Police take immediate action when squatters are reported in an owners property. Evict them immediately if they have no written permission signed by the owner. Allow owners the option of cutting off all utilities rather than legally forcing them to pay for all the squatters usage. Currently Police will do nothing unless squatters are caught 'red-handed' . Eviction then has to go through the Spanish Court System which can sometimes take 1-4 years.",
        "background": "Contact the Spanish PM and Minister Of Home Affairs demanding they amend their current laws regarding squatters. \r\nTheir laws are biased towards squatters taking ownership of peoples properties and belongings leaving owners homeless and bereft of all their personal possessions sometimes for years.",
