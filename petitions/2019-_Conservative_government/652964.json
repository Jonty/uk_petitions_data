        "action": "Increase the TV Licence fee by \u00a314.50 per annum, in line with past practice",
        "additional_details": "We believe a \u00a310.50 TV License fee rise is not consistent with what was expected from the 2022 Licence fee settlement. The additional rise of \u00a34.00pa would be inconsequential to almost all individual households, but cumulatively would represent substantial additional funding for the BBC.\r\n\r\nThe BBC is highly-respected throughout the world, can be a life-line in areas of conflict, and a valuable 'soft power' for the UK. The BBC Board has said this decision will \"require further changes on top of the major savings that we are already delivering\", and we believe any reduction in the BBC's capability to produce its best is against the UK's interests.\r\n",
        "background": "We deplore the Government's decision to increase the TV Licence fee by only \u00a310.50 per annum, especially after a two-year freeze. We believe this is an ideological decision, disguised behind concern for 'cost of living'.",
