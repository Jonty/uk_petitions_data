My son didn\u2019t tell me at any point he was feeling so low and that he was having these awful thoughts.\r\n \r\nIf people were more aware of the signs of distress, and how to help prevent suicide, they could prevent tragedies like this in the future. We all have a duty of care to keep each other safe.\r\n",

A good first step would be running an annual national suicide awareness campaign, including in schools and colleges, to raise awareness of how to notice signs of distress, and how to help prevent suicide.",
