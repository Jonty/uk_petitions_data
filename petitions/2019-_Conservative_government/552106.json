        "additional_details": "Many businesses are refusing entry to disabled people who physically can't wear masks or visors. Now the laws are getting tighter more businesses will refuse these people entry or force them to wear masks that they can't keep on for health reasons. They are exempt for a reason and feel like they are going to be isolated even more. There's nowhere for them to report this, they are being challanged and turned away. This is causing more isolation in a world not designed for them in the first place.",

We want the government to help protect our most vulnerable and stop them being discriminated against and isolated",
