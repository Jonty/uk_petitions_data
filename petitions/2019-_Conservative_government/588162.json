        "action": "Ban the sale of petrol powered garden tools to encourage shift to alternatives",
        "additional_details": "Petrol machinery produces airborne pollution that can impair breathing & aggravate existing heart & lung conditions.\r\n \r\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has estimated that a lawnmower can produce the same air pollution as 11 cars. A Swedish study has also found that the emissions from a petrol mower used for one hour are equivalent to those released by a car on a 100-mile journey.\r\n \r\nA ban on the sale of petrol powered garden tools would encourage a shift to battery powered garden tools. This should improve air quality and could help tackle global warming.",
        "background": "With the world in the grips of an environmental crisis there is absolutely no excuse for the continued use of garden tools that pollute the atmosphere with chemicals and noise, damage people's health, and perpetuate our reliance on fossil fuels.",
