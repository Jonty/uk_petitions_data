        "action": "Allow all children who were going to do a GCSE this year to get predicted grades",
        "additional_details": "I believe that it is unfair as many children have been working diligently in order to get a good mark in their GCSE this year, only for it to be postponed another year. It is also difficult for schools to adjust to this as they must re evaluate their timetables for everyone. I believe that if Ofqual is able to give predicted grades to those certain years that can, they should be able to give them to those that cannot.",
        "background": "At this moment, Ofqual has stated that only certain years will be able to receive predicted grades and that the others must do their exams next summer, however I wish for all years who were supposed to do a GCSE this year to receive predicted grades instead.",
