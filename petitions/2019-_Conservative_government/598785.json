        "additional_details": "To reduce carbon emissions energy needs to be produced without using fossil fuels - tidal energy can help do this.\r\n \r\nThe UK has developed a renewable industry based predominantly on bioenergy, solar & wind power. The UK still relies on energy from fossil fuels in addition up to importing energy via interconnectors. The UK has an underused resource around the country. Tide should be used to a greater extent than it is. Grants should be given to help business develop this resource. The UK could develop technologies supporting jobs & allow an export market to be developed for British businesses.\r\n",
