Section 8 & 21 notices can be served as a scare tactic to those struggling financially, without consideration of the tenants circumstances. There are concerns that complaints are not being taken seriously or looked into. Many families need bigger homes. This review should also consider Housing Associations\u2019 finances and see whether failing Associations should be penalised. ",
