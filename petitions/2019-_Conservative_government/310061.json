When Boris Johnson addressed the nation at 8.30pm on Monday 23rd March 2020 Halfords warehouse staff finished and that night around midnight and are already back in. Halfords promised 3 weeks off full pay and then took that away 24 hours later and decided to reopen stores 48 hours later. Please help, the staff of all areas are at RISK. Buying a bike is not essential! Stay at home, save lives.",
