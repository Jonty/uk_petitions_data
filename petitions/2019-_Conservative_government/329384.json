Genuine A* students with top university offers face not getting their firmed place, this is the rest of their lives being played. This is the life they have worked hard for and deserve. \r\nAll students with conditional offers have their futures at risk, this is wrong... bright kids, deserving kids, hard-working kids having their futures ripped away.",
