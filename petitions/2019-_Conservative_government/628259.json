        "additional_details": "Because of these historical background, British subjects now remain in or return to HK, face a humanitarian crisis. The Chinese authorities stated clearly not to recognize these people as British subjects  and deny them of British consulate protection all together. Such unilateral actions on the Chinese side not only antagonize British national dignity and interests but also endanger these peoples' personal safety in HK. These people should be given the rights to express their wishes explicitly (similar to or alongside with the existing online platform of applying the BNO Visa) that they like to remain as British subjects and live in the parts of HK to be reclaimed by UK. If the UK government do not do this,  UK as a country will be belittled in the eyes of the world.",
