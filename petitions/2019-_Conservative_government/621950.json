        "additional_details": "The UK's eGates have never recognised EU/EEA/Swiss national identity cards because technical specifications differ between 28 EU/EEA countries. In October 2021, the UK ceased to accept EU/EEA/Swiss national identity cards except for those with rights under the EU-UK withdrawal agreement. In contrast, the UK continues to accept all Irish passport cards (438,000 and rapidly increasing) and all Gibraltar identity cards (\u00b130,000). Therefore the UK's eGates should start recognising these two cards.",
        "background": "Irish passport cards and Gibraltar identity cards are the only two card-format travel documents that the UK continues to accept for entry to the UK by all bearers. Therefore please ensure that UK Border Force's eGates start to recognise these two travel documents at all relevant UK ports of entry.",
