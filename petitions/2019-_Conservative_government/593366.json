She has been vaccinated in the US with the one dose Johnson and Johnson vaccine, which has been approved by the U.K. Government. \r\nShe was hoping to return to the U.K. for a two week holiday but, if she has to isolate for 10 days, it gives her just a few days to see other family and friends, which just isn\u2019t worth the expense and lost time. Please sign and help end this discrimination against U.K. citizens living abroad.",
