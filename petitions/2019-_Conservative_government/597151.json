        "additional_details": "Many people with learning disabilities live on disability benefits and spend a high proportion of their income on the cost of their care.\r\n \r\nThis can be made less of a burden by removing daycare services for people with learning disabilities from the scope of VAT.\r\n \r\nThis Government and those before have promoted choice and control for people who are disabled and encouraged private providers of social care to take over provision from local authorities.\r\n \r\nIf daycare services for disabled people have to close as a result of VAT charges, the lives of many could be ruined!",
        "background": "HMRC recently won a case which confirmed that daycare services provided by private bodies to vulnerable adults in England are liable for VAT. Many councils are refusing to fund the extra cost for many clients, which will need to be met by people with learning disabilities.",
