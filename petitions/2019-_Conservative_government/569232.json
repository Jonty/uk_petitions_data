By banning us from practicing in our own cars your inevitable creating more fails in driving test when they start back up and are throwing hundreds of pounds of peoples money away (mostly young people that can\u2019t afford to loose money) as they won\u2019t be getting the regular practice they need (so they\u2019ll need more lessons). Also at a time like this where there is very little we can do, continuing to practice has served as a coping mechanism for people as it\u2019s something that they can do that\u2019s safe and it means they can look forward to the future and work towards their independence",
