        "action": "Amend the Animal Welfare Act to make fatal dog-on-dog attacks a criminal offence",
        "additional_details": "Amend the Animal Welfare Act. This amendment is the Animal Welfare (Responsibility for Dog Attacks) Bill informally known as Emilie's Law.\r\nUnder the Dangerous Dogs Act, attacks on humans, assistance dogs and guide dogs are covered but NOT pet dogs. This is a loophole which needs to be addressed. Under the law pet dogs are considered to be \u201cchattels\u201d. This amendment would give the police more powers to prosecute and the courts more power to impose heavier penalties.",
        "background": "Thousands of innocent dogs are attacked every year by out of control dogs, often fatally. The pain, trauma and long term mental health impact on both dog (if it survives) and the owner cannot be stressed enough. Owners of attacking dogs are rarely held to account.",
