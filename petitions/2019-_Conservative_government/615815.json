        "additional_details": "Since the pandemic bands have been reporting venues taking as big as 25% cuts of sales at their venue. To a young up and coming band these sales are vital to their survival and if they are not vat registered it equates to almost an 50% loss of their revenue from a sale.\r\n\r\nVenues that are doing this in the UK are mostly owned but the big music groups as well, so this compounds the issue as these companies already take large booking fees of ticket sales etc.",
        "background": "Since the pandemic bands have been reporting venues taking as big as 25% cuts of sales at their venue. Bring in legislation to prevent the venues from being able to take such key revenues from the bands.",
