        "additional_details": "Eating out can be challenging for those with an eating disorder and these plans will make it harder, if not impossible, to do and enjoy. Even for those who consider themselves recovered, having the calories written out in front of them can be a huge distraction from a social activity that\u2019s supposed to be enjoyable. I believe that this will negatively affect those with an eating disorder far more than it will encourage those who may need to lose weight for health reasons to do so.",
