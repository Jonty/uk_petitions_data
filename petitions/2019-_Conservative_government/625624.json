Buildings and roads are still being built that are not accessible to all.\r\n \r\nMany people do not know how to be accessible. Accessibility should be added to the curriculum so people understand the accessibility needs of neurodivergent people, wheelchair users, registered blind or those who are hard of hearing.\r\n",
