They continue to work putting their mental & physical health at risk without complaint. Some have contracted COVID-19 & others have died selflessly caring for others. All staff honour their professional regulations by \u2018putting the needs of the patient first\u2019 to deliver best practice. We need to retain this valuable resource of staffing & allow them time to recovery & recharge.",
