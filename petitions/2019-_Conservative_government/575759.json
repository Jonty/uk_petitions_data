        "action": "Remove Ultra Small-Volume Vehicle Manufacturers from 2035 decarbonisation target",
        "additional_details": "Introducing earlier target is harmful both to car enthusiasts communities and to the uSVMs themselves. It puts many craftsmanship jobs at risk, reduces vehicle diversity and innovation - all the attributes the UK car industry was loved and praised for. According to DfT, (U)SVMs will be treated the same as the volume manufacturers who have significantly more resources. This means that registration of new enthusiasts' cars will be banned after 2035 even though these cars are often hand made so their CO2 manufacturing footprint is negligible. Therefore, they should remain exempt from the new legislation at least until 2040.",
        "background": "USVMs (producing less than 1000 cars per annum) should be exempt from the decarbonisation target under de minimis rule. Alternatively, the 2040 target should apply to them (as promised in the previous years) and they should be allowed to manufacture cars with ICE under individual emission targets.",
