        "additional_details": "E-scooters that are left on pavements cause obstructions to pedestrians, especially those with mobility issues and the visually impaired, and can result in serious injuries. Many park them in middle of pathways and in some cases I have seen them blocking entrances to shops and buildings.\r\n \r\nIf it was legal requirement for e-scooters to be parked in designated docking stations, with penalties for not doing so, this should decrease injuries from e-scooters that are parked inconsiderately.",
        "background": "At present it is up to local authorities whether to designate specific parking areas for e-scooters. I want the Government to make it a legal requirement for e-scooters to be parked in designated docking stations, to ensure they are not simply left on pavements, where they are hazards.",
