        "additional_details": "because some students parents are financially better off and able to pay tutors online to receive top quality teaching. Whilst others have no school teaching and no tutors and so have to be self teaching with not much support from schools.I believe the GCSEs and A levels for next year should also be cancelled as these students have already started to courses and their progress will be severely impeded if they don\u2019t reach their potential. Next year grade exams by predictions and past assessments.",
        "background": "learning has been severely disrupted, some children are offered more help than others by online private tuition etc. This is an unfair system meaning some will do better due to factors out of our control. Grade the students based on predictions and current progress.(for A Levels even GCSE grades).",
