Why is it ok to pay anothers mortgage for their security then in the long run we lose it because they decide to sell or stop renting.",
        "background": "If people can afford to rent which is potentially paying someone else's mortgage, then said person/s can afford to pay a mortgage, however the protocol to get a mortgage is so difficult with the high deposits etc please change it, rented properties are becoming almost none existent, please help.",
