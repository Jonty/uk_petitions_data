        "action": "Stop the Mayor of London from expanding ULEZ to outer London from August 2023.",
        "additional_details": "The proposed extension of ULEZ is a significant new tax of residents of outer London and surrounding counties. Many residents of these areas, who cannot afford to replace their vehicles, will face significant additional financial difficulties and for those who are not residents of a London borough, there will be no help or assistance. This included a large proportion of emergency services staff, who work shifts and have to drive to work within London.",
        "background": "Commission an independent enquiry into the proposed extension of ULEZ. If the finding is that the extension offers no proportionate benefits, then prevent the mayor from proceeding.",
