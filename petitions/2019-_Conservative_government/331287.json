With those shielding coming out of lockdown and the winter flu season approaching, we need to do all we can to prevent a second wave sweeping the nation. Wearing of face coverings when inside public spaces will reduce the spread of the virus by asymptomatic people that are active with the virus. We must protect the vulnerable and save the NHS.",

Therefore the government urgently need to make the wearing of face coverings mandatory across the whole of the U.K. when inside a public space.",
