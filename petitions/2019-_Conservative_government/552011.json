        "additional_details": "Current data released informs the public of total infection rises per day and we are being informed of how it\u2019s the highly daily rise since May etc. However we are not able to truly compare the cases because the statistics do not mention the amount of daily tests in comparison. People are genuinely concerned and misinformed if the percentage of positives compared to total tests are not released. Having 10 out of 100 test positive is a great difference compared to 10 out of the 1000.",
        "background": "Instead of just releasing daily positive test count release the count in percentage of positive results compared to total tests taken. Also release percentage of positives to total tests taken in previous months to allow transparency in number of cases in comparison to today.",
