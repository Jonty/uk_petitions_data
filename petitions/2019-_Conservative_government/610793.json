They must be offered refuge, too (in addition to Ukrainian family scheme), and are vital in giving comfort to fleeing, traumatised people in these horrible times. With current entry pet rules quarantine for 4 months isn't a feasible option for refugees.",
        "background": "Please, relax entry rules for Ukrainian refugees' pets as many animals in Ukraine, including dogs and cats, are neither vaccinated nor microchipped, meaning they do not have the necessary documents to leave the country with their guardians or other compassionate people and enter the UK.",
