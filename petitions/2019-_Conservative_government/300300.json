        "additional_details": "Last year saw Parliament paralyzed as MPs refused to allow the government to carry out our departure from the EU by blocking every effort made to pass a Bill. The Fixed Term Parliament Act meant that the Parliament can intentionally leave itself in a stalemate and prevent a deadlock being broken by an early election. This Act is not fit for purpose and was last tried during the Long Parliament of 1640 which also ended in turmoil. This situation should not be allowed to occur for a third time.",
