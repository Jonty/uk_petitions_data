        "additional_details": "Family courts were prevented from attaching powers of arrest in 2007 when breach became an offence to be prosecuted in the criminal courts.\r\n \r\nHowever, taking action is now solely a matter for the police and CPS, not the civil courts, and victims face the ordeal of testifying in criminal proceedings of uncertain date and outcome.\r\n\r\nWhen half of domestic killings occur around separation, powers of arrest provided continuous victim protection, with swift accountability for perpetrators of breach.",
        "background": "A power of arrest effectively deterred breach as reported breach normally resulted in immediate arrest and a contempt hearing before a senior judge. It promoted calm while the court resolved related issues, crucially children, which can make victims vulnerable to former partners.",
