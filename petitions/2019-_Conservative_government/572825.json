        "action": "The UK should share vaccine supplies once its most vulnerable have been treated",
        "additional_details": "There is a global shortage of Covid-19 vaccines.  The UK has managed to secure a good supply, unlike many other countries.  Once the most needy here have been vaccinated, we should share our supplies to help the most vulnerable people everywhere get the jab as quickly as possible.  This will bring the pandemic to an end faster and reduce the number of deaths worldwide.  The vaccine should go where it is needed most, regardless of borders or nationality.  This would show the UK at its best.",
        "background": "The UK is well on the way to vaccinating all of its most vulnerable citizens.  Before rolling out the programme more widely at home, it should ensure vulnerable people across the world are jabbed first.  This will save more lives, rebuild the world economy faster and is the moral thing to do.",
