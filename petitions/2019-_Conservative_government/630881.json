        "additional_details": "Some patients just needs to be seen to get medication or analyse symptoms, they do not need the facilities at A&Es. This could either be dealt with by a pharmacist or a GP. Only if the GP or pharmacist cannot be of help should someone need an A&E. We believe 24/7 pharmacies and 24/6 GPs are necessity. Non-life threatening patients can use these services. Over the weekends many patients have no access to pharmacies or a GP.",
        "background": "Many people with non-life threatening illnesses are approaching A&E for medical attention as there is nowhere else to go. Round the Clock Pharmacies and 24/6 GPs could help reduce the influx of such patients in A&E, and we want the Government to provide the funding to enable this.",
