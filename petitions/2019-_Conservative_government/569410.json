        "additional_details": "Particularly consider her poem 'The Diet' which focuses on two eating disorders: Anorexia and Bulimia. The text is triggering and harmful for the 16 year olds whom must read and study it at length.The poem is distasteful as it does not translate well to the youth of today who deal with eating disorders on a scale like no other generation before. The book being named 'Feminine Gospels' suggests that eating disorders only affect women when in fact 25% of the 3.4 million UK sufferers are male.",
        "background": "I wish for Carol Ann Duffy's 'Feminine Gospels' to be removed from Exam Board Specifications in light of mental health awareness and how her messages fail to translate to the youth of today.",
