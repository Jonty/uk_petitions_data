        "additional_details": "The Government has yet to be clear on how they mean to go forward concerning the self employed. \r\nRishi Sunak only stated \"I'll keep this scheme under review.\" \r\nExtension of the current SEISS grant needs to continue along side employees who are Furloughed till the end of October. \r\nThe self employed had to wait near 3 months for a payment, these payments should now proceed on a rolling monthly basis until safe working practice resumes to previous earnings before the virus Covid 19 prevented it.",
        "background": "Continue to furlough the self employed the SEISS on a rolling monthly basis as with employees. When it is safe for the self employed to return to the work place their furlough can be adjusted to their earnings monthly. This could take into to account loss of business/custom caused by Covid 19.",
