Shelves are empty and 'uncontrolled' crowds are pilling into the stores with little or no respect to other's needs. Hopfully the security may be able to control these situations and still get a wage from the supermarkets. We can all shop in a safe and normal way just with a little bit more protection.",

A number of retailers have announced plans to open early for elderly or vulnerable customers, and NHS workers. Many have also introduced limits on the number of shoppers they allow in at once, and have security to manage this.
