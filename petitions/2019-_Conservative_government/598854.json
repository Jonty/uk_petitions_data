        "additional_details": "The level of anxiety and distress that is caused by fireworks to animals is astonishing. Humans and animals have died due to the impact of the loud noises in their heart. Not to mention the massive fire risk that fireworks pose. The statistics to prove this are overwhelming. On average, 127 fires in homes and buildings in the UK are caused by the use of fireworks each year. This is just one of the many statistics surrounding the danger of fireworks.",
        "background": "The use of fireworks in residential homes needs to be banned. This is because of the huge fire risks it poses, distress and anxiety it causes animals and many people with psychological disorders. I have a 12 year old golden retriever who is petrified and it\u2019s awful seeing him suffer.",
