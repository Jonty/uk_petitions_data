        "additional_details": "Patients can grow the correct medicine for their specific needs. This would reduce the fearful image that patients have of the police and reduce crime rate. Many medicines are often out of stock, which can create reversibility with a patient\u2019s condition. This issue can be abolished for patients and police time will not be wasted. Patients can control the quality of their own medicine and will know everything that has gone into it preventing the potential harm created by the illicit market.",
        "background": "Many cannabis patients struggle financially when acquiring medicinal cannabis. A large percentage of products available are to treat general conditions rather than specific conditions that patients may suffer from. Patients should be able to grow 4 plants, supposing a maximum 60 grams per plant",
