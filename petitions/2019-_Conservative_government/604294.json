        "additional_details": "These drivers work hard all day and many make very little money after they pay their taxi/private hire licence fee every year on top of paying fuel, road tax, MOT and insurance, which are taxed in different ways. Some drivers have barely anything after paying for all this. Fuel, road tax and insurance are already taxed so I don't feel it's necessary to put more burden on them.",
        "background": "I want the Government to exempt taxi and private hire drivers from Income Tax and National Insurance (inducing the social care levy) as they already pay lots of money for road tax, car insurance, fuel, MOT and professional fees. With COVID it's become hard for many drivers to maintain their income.",
