        "additional_details": "We want social media platforms to be required to use end-to-end encryption for private messages, to help prevent unauthorised access and ensure privacy of privately shared messages and photos is respected.\r\n\r\nBy implementing stronger privacy measures, the Government can help prevent cyberbullying, harassment, and exploitation that often target young people.\r\n\r\nWe urge policymakers and social media companies to prioritise the implementation of these measures. Together, we can create a safer online environment for all.\r\n",
        "background": "We are deeply concerned about the lack of privacy protections for young people on social media platforms. Every day, young people engage in online conversations and share photos and we believe there aren't adequate safeguards in place to protect the personal information of young people.",
