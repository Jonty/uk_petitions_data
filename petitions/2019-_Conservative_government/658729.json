        "additional_details": "We think that mandating microplastic filters on new washing machines is crucial. Evidence shows synthetic fibres from clothing are a source of microplastics in water bodies and can harm marine life, enter the human food chain, and our bodies. Filters can mitigate this by capturing microplastics before they are discharged into wastewater systems. Numerous studies have highlighted the effectiveness of these filters, and they should be built into washing machines as standard.",
        "background": "We think the Government should mandate microplastic filters on all new washing machines from 2027. 700,000 microplastic fibres can be released in every clothes wash. We think action is needed!",
