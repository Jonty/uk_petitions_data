        "additional_details": "Because the station was closed in the 60s transport options have been more limited. To travel from Ringwood to anywhere you need either a bus, coach (expensive) or a Taxi (also too expensive). This contributes to heavy congestion on the A31 (the dual carriage way that passes through Ringwood), which contributes to climate change.",
        "background": "The Government should fund the rebuilding and reopening of Ringwood railway station and the line to Brockenhurst, and fund services on this line. Considering that the line closed the 1960s due to the Beeching cuts (the then Government's fault) it would only be fair to fix what has been destroyed.",
