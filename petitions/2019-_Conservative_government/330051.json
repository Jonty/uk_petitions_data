        "action": "Grant non-BNO Hong Kong permanent residents immigration rights.",
        "additional_details": "Since June 2019, HK people have suffered from increasingly violent oppression by the HKSAR and Chinese regimes.\r\n\r\nWe hear our UK government will grant immigration rights to BNO holders. However, countless non-BNO holding youngsters (born after 1997) have risked their best years in jail to protest on the frontline the past year, and they deserve the same, if not bigger, chance to move to UK. Also, to prevent Chinese espionage, all applicants must go through rigorous background checks.",
        "background": "We, the British citizens of Hong Kong heritage, want the Government to grant immigration rights to non-BNO passport holding Hong Kong people (i.e. people who were born in HK after 1997).",
