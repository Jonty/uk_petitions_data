        "additional_details": "As mentioned previously, students have missed out on a number of lessons positioning them in a major disadvantage compared to previous years. It would be great for students to have the option to not take PE lessons and instead allow schools to allocate this time for teaching. By the time they are in Secondary School, they should be able to exercise by themselves, even if \"homework\" was set with a list of activities they had to do at home, rather than spending valuable time in school.",
        "background": "With the amount of teaching hours reduced from lockdown, schools should be able to make it optional for P.E. lessons to take place. These lessons could be replaced with helpful sessions of catch up with staff or self-research/revision.",
