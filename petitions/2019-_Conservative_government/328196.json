        "action": "Establish Emancipation Day on August 1st as a national bank holiday.",
        "additional_details": "In our time, the public glorification of slave owners in Britain has come and past. We must now educate ourselves on the history of slavery and the mistreatment of BAME people in the UK. Public recognition of this history will seek to build bonds with the communities that have been victims of slavery and celebrate the healing process still ongoing. This holiday will act as a conduit for conversations on how we can shape a brighter future and separate ourselves from the mistakes of the past.",
        "background": "Emancipation Day is observed in many former British colonies to commemorate the emancipation of enslaved people of African descent. To acknowledge Britain's role in colonisation and end of the transatlantic slave trade, we petition the government to make August 1st a national bank holiday.",
