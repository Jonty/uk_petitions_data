        "action": "Scrap the proposed legislation for speed limiting technology from 2022",
        "additional_details": "Imagine you are driving  down the road at the speed limit and another car behind is coming too fast, this means the driver in front will have no way to go faster to get away from the danger behind. Although all cars are proposed to have the speed limiting technology, there will be older cars on the road without this technology. As this is a new technology I think it's imperative that this technology is tested for many more years or even decades in order to have them on the roads safely.",
        "background": "The UK and EU have proposed a legislation to limit speed on vehicles. This will take our freedom to break the speed limit. Also technology can always be hacked which is a risk so there maybe a chance of it being hacked then danger will occur.",
