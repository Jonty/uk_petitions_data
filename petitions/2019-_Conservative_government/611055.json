        "additional_details": "The current situation surrounding Ukraine has seen the UK Government and Fuel companies such as Shell express their intentions to no longer use Russian Oil. Thus, driving prices up to as far as \u00a31.75L (E5 99Ron) as of 08/03/22.\r\n\r\nA temporary suspension would lower the price at the pumps from \u00a31.75L to \u00a31.40L, a standard price as usually expected.\r\n\r\nAs the cost of living crisis continues, a simple VAT suspension will relieve a lot of pressure on the public who depend on fuel for everyday life.",
        "background": "We would like the government to temporarily remove VAT from all road vehicle fuel purchases in the UK. This would be until such a time where oil prices per barrel return to a normal level as previously seen.",
