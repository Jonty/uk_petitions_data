        "additional_details": "The Housing First model prescribes safe and permanent housing as the first priority for people experiencing homelessness, the home serving as a platform from which they can pursue personal goals and improve their quality of life. Once housing is secured, a multidisciplinary team of support workers can address complex needs through services like drug and alcohol counselling or mental health treatment. The mean age of death for homeless men is 45 and 43 for women. This has to change.",

Especially in the current climate is it so important to support the most vulnerable in society.The \u201cHousing First\u201d project run by Finland has been proven to help reduce and eradicate homelessness.",
