Residents of Somerton need Government to support this council, to ensure financial support in alternative ways. Thereby ensuring that Somerton can reduce the risk of further flood damage.",

Now, when heavy prolonged rain falls, flooding occurs to numerous dwellings that are situated at various points down hill. The drainage system cannot cope. Please stop new development.",
