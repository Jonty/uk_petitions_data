But alcohol is their main source of revenue, and they need income now. \r\n\r\nThere's also a lot of cask ale which is going out of date. We're not sure how much, but 36,000 pubs will all have several kegs which are going out of date. \r\n\r\nThese businesses can work, and customers want to support them. Save pubs, get alcohol delivered.",
