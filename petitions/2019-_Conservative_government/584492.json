Social distancing in place, and the parent to return outside once the baby is fed.",
        "background": "I am asking for parents to be allowed to sit inside while feeding their breast or bottle fed children.\r\n\r\nIt is far too cold outside & uncomfortable to feed children while no indoor seating is allowed. As a mother of two I\u2019m finding it very hard to leave the house as there is nowhere to feed inside.",
