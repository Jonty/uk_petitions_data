As we edge closer to post-pandemic, the effects of Covid-19 still remain. Young people were one of groups most disadvantaged by the pandemic. From school closures, to minimal social interaction in formative years, to a lack of resources for lower income households. Directing funding to youth services is a vital first step.\r\n",
