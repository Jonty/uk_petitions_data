        "additional_details": "Mental health for many people is deteriorating as a result of the corona virus regulations and laws, Nights are getting darker making meeting people outside more difficult. Many adults with mental health difficulties also work full time and need positive contact, irrespective of whether they live with other people. Many work unsociable hours, and different hours from their household, therefore can be left isolated for long periods of time. Allow those with mental health difficulties to access face to face support from a support buddy outside of their household.",
