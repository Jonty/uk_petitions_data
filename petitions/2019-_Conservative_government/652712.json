Even if the surviving parent was dependent on maintenance payments, or any financial support from the deceased parent, they are not entitled to a penny from the Government. We believe allowing a child who had married parents to benefit from thousands of pounds from the BSP, yet not allowing this for a child with separated parents, is a discriminatory benefit gap that must be closed.",
