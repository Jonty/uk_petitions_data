        "additional_details": "Something clearly isn\u2019t working, social media companies clearly aren\u2019t doing anything to solve the problem as it simply isn\u2019t being sorted. I should hope that the government would put some kind of law in place forcing people to go through a more vigorous set up when making, for example, Instagram accounts, so people are more accountable for clear and obvious insults towards people who serve our country. Saka, Rashford and Sancho didn\u2019t deserve this but it\u2019s a recurring problem that needs fixing.",
        "background": "Passports should be needed to make social media accounts so people\u2019s comments are held accountable, rather than people commenting disgusting abuse and going unnoticed. With recent events in the euros final and the comments Saka in particular has received, it\u2019s time for this to stop.",
