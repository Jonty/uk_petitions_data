If our numbers kept decreasing then I don't think that we would even be able to defeat some smaller countries. Our Air Force is also something that I believe lacks in fighter jets/pilots, if we don't have enough fighter pilots then our ground forces won't stand a chance because they wouldn't have enough air support.",
