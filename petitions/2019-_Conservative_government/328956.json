        "additional_details": "Bars and hairdressers have been allowed to reopen, which is absolutely no different to tattoo studios in terms of working in close proximity with your client, and reduced social distance. The difference is, barber shops can see 20+ clients per barber, per day. Yet a standard tattoo studio ONE artist has ONE client per day. Our working environment is medically as clean as a hospital, 100% cleaner then pubs which have been given the opening nod over us. We NEED to reopen.",
        "background": "Tattoo studios have absolutely no indication of when they can re-open. We have the most clean, sterile, safe environment out of any other business\u2019s. Our equipment is 100% sterile, single use and every working area is deep cleaned with hospital standard cleaning equipment multiple times daily.",
