        "additional_details": "It should be refused on the basis that this unwanted MSA (Motorway Service Area) would destroy an important wildlife environment, used by migrating wildfowl and indigenous wildlife.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, local villagers' lifestyle will be badly affected by increased crime, rubbish, anti-social behaviour, noise, and light pollution, if the MSA is built.  There is a Moto alternative at two nearby MSA's, which would negate the need for this development and result in zero impact on the environment.",
