Bereavement counselling is offered but only if you\u2019ve had a stillbirth There\u2019s no  specific mental health support to help couples make a plan to improve there state of mind following on from the loss of an unborn child. This must be addressed as patients individual needs are not being assessed. Thousands of couples are suffering mentally with nowhere to turn and no support.",

Those that fall into this category are slipping through the net as there is no patient pathway that exists",
