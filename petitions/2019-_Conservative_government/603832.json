        "action": "Amend Covid passes to include natural immune response from Covid-19 infection.",
        "additional_details": "mRNA injections for Covid-19 have been shown to trigger an immune response which protects the recipient from serious illness, hospitalisation and death. This effectiveness decreases dramatically as weeks pass. Natural immune response has been shown to be far more effective and long lasting than that of these injections. Therefore, you are discriminating against people who have recovered from Covid infection by refusing them a number of rights with no scientific or logical basis for doing so.",
        "background": "Recognise natural immunity as a result of contracting and recovering from Covid-19. Understand that this produces a strong and robust immune response which surpasses that of the mRNA injection. Use this basic understanding to include natural immunity on a Covid pass through positive PCR testing.",
