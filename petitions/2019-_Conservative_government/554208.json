I want the Government to grant additional \u00a350/week to meet these complex basic needs.\r\n\r\nMy 6 year old son is diagnosed with life-long high functioning autism, he is non-verbal, has sensory needs and faces increased issues during lockdown because we cannot buy him enough resources for him to stay busy, e.g. bike, toys and other essentials. The amount we receive is \u00a35 a day which is hardly enough for food.",
