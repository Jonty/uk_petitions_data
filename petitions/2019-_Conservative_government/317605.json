        "additional_details": "Evidence shows that Coronavirus is spread easily in large groups and children spread it easily too! This would be probable that a second wave could happen. Many people are apprehensive about pupils returning to school and before summer just seems a little bit premature. If schools remain closed until September there will be a higher chance that no second wave of the virus can occur,putting our country and more risk.Keeping schools closed would ensure that the country can rebuild after the virus.",
