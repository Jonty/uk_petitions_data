        "additional_details": "I believe that more so now than ever getting people working would greatly benefit the UK, however, due to current nursery fees parents are often unable to afford these fees. The current help with universal credits permitting families to claim 85% of childcare costs only apply to two children and often many families are unable to claim this due to \u2018earning too much\u2019. Tax free childcare also doesn\u2019t make much of a difference and fees are still too high. To pay bills, work and put children in nursery a house would have to earn a bare minimum of \u00a335,000 a year, this is without any luxuries.",
        "background": "I want the government to review nursery and early years fees and the help available to working families. More often than not one parent has to choose between career and children due to astronomical nursery fees.",
