Countries that went into lockdown earlier have recovered earlier, due to following scientific advise. When WHO calls a Public Health Emergency Scientific Advisers should have a greater say in the actions following that announcement. This is why Scientific Advisers should have more of a role in the actions the Government takes in regards to Public Health Emergencies.",
