        "additional_details": "We would like the government to do this as we believe it will reduce carbon emissions and help with the global issue of climate change. The bus fares at the moment are roughly \u00a3450 per person per year which is the highest it\u2019s ever been. We wish for the prices to be lower so that they are more affordable for low income or large families as we believe that everyone deserves the same opportunities.",
        "background": "We want the government to increase the amount of money that is given to public transport in order to reduce bus fares (specifically for secondary school and university students). We hope that this will help to reduce carbon emissions by encouraging more young people to use the bus services.",
