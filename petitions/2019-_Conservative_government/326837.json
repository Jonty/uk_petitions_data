        "additional_details": "I do not agree that the vote on the Agricultural Bill was an accurate representation of the public's view; it would not be right to sell food in the UK that would be illegal to produce in the UK. I want all food that is sold in the UK to be from farms that have a minimum production and welfare standard. It is undeniable that the UK has some of the highest welfare standards in the world, this is because of years of campaigns, petitions and manifestos (including yours); this shouldn't be subverted",
        "background": "As our representatives, I want the government to ensure that any agreements made do not undermine the UK's food production and welfare standards. If it would be illegal to produce and sell in the UK, it should be illegal to import it.",
