        "additional_details": "Britain benefited from colonialism and slavery for centuries, leading to oppression of BAME communities through systematic racism.\r\nThe British Empire has been glamorised and the global impact of Britain\u2019s colonialism downplayed. The limited and historic lens adopted by the education system implies racism is an issue of the past.\r\nWe need to educate young people on how they can be involved in standing up against racism. Education can help to cure racism, the current system is failing to do so.",
        "background": "National Curriculum needs a mandatory inclusion of black history, diversity and systematic racism within all school subjects, all year around. English and social studies need compulsory incorporation of poetry and fiction focused on black authors and their experiences.",
