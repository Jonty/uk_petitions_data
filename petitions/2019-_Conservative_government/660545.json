The Channel is obviously permeable. Our country needs to be ordered, not confounded. We need passports to travel, driving licences to drive, now bring identity cards for all adults to prove their recognition by this beautiful wonderful country of ours.",

Since we want to encourage international exchanges, and we seem to lose track of some claimants, introduce identity cards for all Brits and temporary ones for all asylum/ immigration claimants whilst their applications are processed.",
