        "additional_details": "Chester Zoo is an important attraction for the UK, and global wildlife conservation and education. Due to the recent order to remain closed 'Indefinitely' they are now at risk of closing permanently.\r\n\r\nThe government have already eased restrictions on people in public spaces where the ability to control the number of people is limited. Chester Zoo is a wide open space under the control of an organisation that has the experience and the resources to limit the number of people who are on site.",
        "background": "I wish for the Government to allow Chester Zoo to reopen, and revoke the order that it must remain closed 'Indefinitely'. When other similar sites have been given permission to open. This has put the Zoo in a precarious position and are now at risk of closing permanently.",
