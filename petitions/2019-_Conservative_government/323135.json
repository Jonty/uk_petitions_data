        "additional_details": "We want the Government to grant immediate leave to remain because it is the right & decent thing to do\r\n\r\nApplications are normally intrusive & scary but 12 hour shifts with no PPE during a national terror when most people were locked up safely at home?\r\n\r\nPeople with a British spouse and leave to remain claim no benefits or housing.  Most are OK with that.  \r\n\r\nWe ask the Government to grant immediate leave without delay or further \u2018processes\u2019 to the families who have served this country so well.",
        "background": "Foreign spouses need 'Leave to Remain' in UK but there are delays causing fear and uncertainty.  Many did essential jobs during COVID providing food, fuel & medicine, working & dying in care homes, getting supplies to isolating families. \r\n\r\nIt is time to repay the debt and grant immediate leave.",
