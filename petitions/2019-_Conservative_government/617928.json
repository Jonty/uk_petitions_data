He has been found to have broken the law, he has paid his fine but he doesn't believe he needs to resign. \r\nThis has dragged on for months and is ridiculous. It must not be allowed to play out like this again. So the solution is simple, a PM cannot be allowed to hold office if they have broken the laws they create and swear to uphold. Their career history, successful or otherwise is irrelevant to the situation.",
        "background": "Introduce a new parliament/Government rule. If a Prime Minister in office is found to have broken the law then they must be forced to resign without debate. They would be unsuitable to hold office. I cannot think of a law where exception would be allowed.",
