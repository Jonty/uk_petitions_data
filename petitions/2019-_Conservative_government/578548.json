        "additional_details": "Local government lacks the funding to plant enough trees and has no obligation to plant. \r\n\r\nThis project would be cost-neutral for local authorities and we \r\n believe would receive widespread local support.\r\n\r\nIt would assist the UK in meeting its carbon footprint target.\r\nMost trees in conservation areas are not protected by Tree Protection Orders. Trees may be felled for good reasons, e.g. subsidence or for development. We seek legislation to ensure adequate replacement planting takes place in the urban locality.",
        "background": "Trees trap carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, and improve the urban environment.\r\n\r\nAbout 60,000 trees in our city conservation areas are felled every year. Many are not replaced.\r\n\r\nWe want parliament to pass legislation to ensure more trees are planted in our towns and cities.",
