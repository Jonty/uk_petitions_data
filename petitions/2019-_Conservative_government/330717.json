        "additional_details": "These exams are causing added pressure to students, which is not needed in these times. The current pandemic and lockdown has caused inequalities in pupils education, as it has been made aware that students from a more privileged background have had better and easier access to online resources, leading to more consistent education. Cancelling these exams will therefore end unfair inequalities  in the outcome of students exam results, dependant on their access to technology and support from schools",
        "background": "Cancel exams for 2021 students, due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Instead use previous mock and internal exam results to create a grade for each student in their subjects (moderated grade).",
