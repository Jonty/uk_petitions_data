        "additional_details": "This will boost the UK economy & make it more resilient by stimulating the movement of cash.\r\n\r\nGovt support on starting a business has made doing so easier.  The real struggle is growing to a sustainable size, because Micro-entities & the SE mostly deal with similar sized businesses; meaning access to a very limited pool of cash.  Micro entities can often provide much better value to clients, which means everyone benefits through competition & innovation and distribution of wealth via enterprise.",
