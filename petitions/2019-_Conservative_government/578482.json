        "additional_details": "I am a student and every time I have to take a train from London to Folkestone, pay an expensive taxi to be able to go onto the eurotunnel, then take another train to Paris from Calais. It\u2019s so expensive and shouldn\u2019t be so complicated. If simply the Eurostar had some terms and conditions but allow pets onboard things would be so much easier and safer for me and many others.",
        "background": "Firstly, it is ridiculously complicated to bring a pet into the UK. I would like the government to try and change the pet policy for the Eurostar. It is not fair that pet owners have to pay \u00a3500 simply to bring their pets across the border through the eurotunnel.",
