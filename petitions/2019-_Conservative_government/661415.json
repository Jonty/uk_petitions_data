        "additional_details": "The smell of cannabis can get into other people's homes and gardens. This can have impact those in the vicinity, and in particular those with sensory issues due to autism and ADHD. Children shouldn't be exposed to the smell or second hand smoke, while playing in their gardens. Second hand smoke can also be bad for people with hear conditions. The police sometimes won't do anything about it despite it being illegal.",
        "background": "We are concerned that the police do not always take action in response to reports of the illegal smoking of cannabis. We want the Government to review how the police respond to illegal use of cannabis, and consider whether the current response is appropriate.",
