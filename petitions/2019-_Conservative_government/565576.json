        "additional_details": "The importance of education is immeasurable - this is something which cannot be disputed. However, the wellbeing of students must not be brushed aside. To state that morale in schools is low would be an understatement; long periods of isolation, teaching staff contracting the virus and catching up on a crucial 5 months of missed work are contributing to a mental health disaster. 50,000 people are contracting the virus per day, and young people are not disposable.",
        "background": "In order to protect the lives of young people and teachers, many of whom are vulnerable or have vulnerable family members, schools must be closed and all teaching moved online. Exams also cannot take place - too many students have suffered this year for there to truly be a level playing field.",
