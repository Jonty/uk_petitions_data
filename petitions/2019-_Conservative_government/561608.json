        "additional_details": "This could permit family members to be within close proximity of each other on what is, for most, one of the most momentous days of a person's life.\r\n\r\nThe wedding industry has suffered throughout 2020 and many couples have been forced to postpone or reduce numbers. For those going ahead, the thought of doing this without the close contact of family members or friends is heartbreaking. This petition would allow couples to marry in close company of their most loved ones and in turn would support the businesses impacted by the pandemic through an increase in small ceremonies taking place, without the need for social distancing between guests.",
        "background": "This petition is calling for the introduction of rapid testing for weddings during the pandemic, to allow the already restricted number of guests to be in close contact. ",
