The past decade has seen pay freezes, below inflation pay rises which has resulted in real term pay cuts across the board. During this recent Covid-19 pandemic we have realised the true value of our NHS, Emergency services and public sector workers. They've risked their lives and their families lives. It's time to support them and do the right thing.",

The Government needs to reflect that value by immediately reversing the effects of below inflation pay rises/freezes and issuing a pay rise.",
