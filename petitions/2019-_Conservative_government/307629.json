        "action": "Freeze University tuitition & accommodation fees for 3 months due to COVID-19",
        "additional_details": "Students are also a huge part of the UK economy and are facing financial difficulty in the coming months. The product has changed in some ways, therefore this should be reflected in the fees. Not all jobs can be done from home, leaving many students with nothing. Many pay fees, rent and bills through their wages, which with no work, it means they can't continue paying their expected remainder of fees. Many relied on working in universities but with the current measures and closures are jobless.",
        "background": "Waiving fees will put the universities into financial hardship, Parliament should make it mandatory for universities to give ALL students upto 50% discount on the remaining tuition and accommodation fee amount. OR All fee payments should be frozen/delayed for 3 months like mortgages. No late fines.",
