        "additional_details": "I would like to see parliament debate this issue and vote on a law to pass through the house of commons and the house of lords, which follows the direction of the Scottish government in abolishing minimum term rental contracts. The oppressive rental laws in England meaning that new tenants have to take out a minimum contract term. This is I believe fundamentally wrong and paying customers should have a legal right to end their tenancy agreements, if it does not meet their needs.",
        "background": "Tenants of private accommodation companies in England have little freedom when it comes to moving out of their rental property. I am campaigning for the UK movement to abolish minimum term rental contracts so that tenants like myself have freedom of movement, as paying customers of a service.",
