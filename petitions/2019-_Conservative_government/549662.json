        "action": "Extend the immigration healthcare surcharge waiver to all healthcare workers",
        "additional_details": "The promise the government made previously seems to have not been fulfilled. Currently the waiver does not recognise those here on visas already and is only provided to qualified healthcare professionals coming under the new health and care visa. Thousands of people from overseas in the UK have worked throughout this pandemic to provide care but are not eligible. The waiver also excludes anyone not in a \"qualified\" position such as porters, cleaners and assistants who play vital roles too",
        "background": "We want government to extend the immigration healthcare surcharge waiver to include all employees of health and care providers. It was introduced to recognise contributions to the NHS and other providers during the COVID-19 pandemic by those from overseas",
