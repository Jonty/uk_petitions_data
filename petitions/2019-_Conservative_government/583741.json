        "additional_details": "Football clubs are the heart of most local communities in the UK, and for too long have been exploited by selfish, foreign, narrow-minded interests.\r\nThey have been allowed to takeover the clubs purely for the outdated concept of  \"maximising shareholder wealth\" only being measured in terms of \"Dollars earned\", rather than emphasising or understanding the truer, intangible benefits and wealth that well run football clubs provide to the people who truly support them.\r\nEnough is enough.",
        "background": "The UK Govt. must bring in legislation to make football fans the majority shareholders of their respective teams.\r\nThe German model of fan ownership should be used as a basis for the structure and processes required.\r\nFans must be 51% majority shareholders of all football clubs.",
