Young people\u2019s experiences of homelessness are different from other age groups, so the solutions need to be different too. We know what works. That\u2019s why we are calling for a cross-departmental strategy, prioritising prevention, housing & finances, to end youth homelessness.\r\n \r\nAs a coalition of over 100 youth organisations, we\u2019re calling on government to commit to a strategy to end youth homelessness. \r\n\r\nWe need a #PlanForThe129k.",
        "background": "In 2021-22, 129,000 young people experiencing homelessness approached their council for help. Yet no one is talking about this and there is no national plan to end this ahead of the General Election.\r\n\r\nThis has to change. We have the power to help so many young people, and absolutely should.",
