        "additional_details": "We have seen individuals loading whole trolleys full of toilet paper and other products, some of which are essential such as bread and pasta. This has resulted in vulnerable people going without. More worryingly baby formula is being stockpiled leaving some families struggling to feed their babies, which of course is very dangerous. Supermarkets have said they are limiting quantities but some quantities are still large and it is not being consisitently enforced.",
