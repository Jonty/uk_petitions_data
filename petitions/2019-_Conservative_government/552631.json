        "additional_details": "I personally have been self employed on and off for 2 years until early 2019 where I was fully self employed. My trading income was just under 50% of my total earnings for those two years, if the 19/20 tax year was taken into consideration I would be eligible for money, I have now missed 2 grants that would have helped me through the tough times.",
        "background": "Most self employed people will have filled this already and the government should behave all the necessary documents to include it, this would help newer self employed people get money they was and is needed.\r\n\r\nToo many people will have been left out due to that year being left out.",
