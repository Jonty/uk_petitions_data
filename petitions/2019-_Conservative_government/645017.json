The reduction for nights should not be 1/7th as the increments to equal share are not accurate, that\u2019s why there is a big difference from 3 nights a week to 3.5 nights a week. \r\n\r\nOvertime and bonuses should not be counted towards child maintenance costs. We do overtime to help pay for maintenance. \r\n\r\nThe discount we get for millage should be the same as what it costs.",

Mileage calculations should also be changed to reflect the cost of us transporting our children. Also looking at the discount rates of overnight stays that the paying parent gets.",
