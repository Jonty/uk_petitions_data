        "additional_details": "We have been learning about how petitioners used online platforms to convince the government to provide free school meals over the holidays and we feel this should be extended to homeless people. Many people sleep on the streets and beg for money so they can feed themselves. We believe their dignity should be considered and we should provide them with access to at least one free meal a day, allowing them a nutritious meal which could be the difference between life and death.",
        "background": "We are a year 4 class based in a school in Hackney, London who have been learning about activism. We have decided to create a petition on a cause that we feel passionately about, homelessness. We would like the government to provide homeless people with a voucher for supermarket food each day.",
