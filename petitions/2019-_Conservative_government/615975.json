The dangers of drink driving are known too well, there is ZERO excuses for it, drugs are the same. As for dangerous driving, all drivers are aware they need to drive in line with the law, with weather conditions and within the limitations of their licence. A proper deterrent is one with a minimum sentence NOT a maximum and action needs to be taken now.",
