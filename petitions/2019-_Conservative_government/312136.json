We are the ones to always make an effort to help people, to safe lifes, to help the community and to keep fighting, whatever comes our way. We are the ones to keep on going when everything else has stopped. We are the ones who get the least respect. Any other time we are being treated with disrespect, even though we are trying to safe people's life and do so with every inch of power that we have.",

This is to show them how much we are respected in the community and to pay tribute for how much do. Even taxi drivers earn 2-3 times as much as we do.",
