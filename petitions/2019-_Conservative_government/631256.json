        "additional_details": "Following the High Courts decision to allow a Dartmoor land own to restrict wild camping on their land despite it having been legal for over 30 years there is a pressing need for a legal right to wild camping akin to the right to roam.\r\n\r\nSpending time in nature in wild and remote areas has massive benefits of fitness and mental health.  It is an integral part of the Duke of Edinburgh experience and of training Mountain Leaders.  There is a need for access to these areas to be afforded as a right",
        "background": "The Government should introduce via primary legislation a right to responsible wild camping in remote/upland areas of England.  Legislation should define what remote/upland and where the right is applicable.  Secondary legislation should be used to define a code of what is responsible wild camping",
