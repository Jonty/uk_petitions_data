        "additional_details": "I think this would make a big difference to families. Children are one of the biggest culprits of germ spreading and schools one of the places where germs can spread. Most people spend time with elderly relatives over the Christmas break. We think giving time for illness to clear up before this would be very sensible, and would also help avoid a late start to January when there are fewer activities available for families to enjoy. We think this makes sense, especially given that the NHS is more stretched over winter.",

Schools should break up at least a week before Christmas to try and reduce the risk of transmitting illnesses from school to older family members they see over Christmas. ",
