        "action": "Require councils to collect textile waste as part of household recycling",
        "additional_details": "Textile Recycling has come a long way since Household Recycling Act was passed in 2003. The advent of AI has made it increasingly cheaper to sort out waste; and mechanical and chemical recycling facilities allow textile to be turned back into raw fibre form to be reused.\r\n \r\nIf the UK is to reach its Net-Zero targets then legislation around textile waste has to be part of the mix.",
        "background": "Around 360,000 Tonnes of clothes are thrown away in the UK every year. Waste is a feedstock which recyclers are finding hard to get access to. We believe adding textiles to household recycling will be both an environmentally friendly and a good commercial decision for the long run.",
