The stores could be open as the area coverage is in the same format at Supermarkets.  The restrictions could be the same and social distancing could be applied.  The benefit would provide access to materials for work to be completed at home and at the same time enable activities to relieve an unnecessary boredom.",
        "background": "I understand the need for distancing at this time, I totally agree with the reasoning.  However during these hard times of a lockdown families are at home full time, as this is the case a lot of my friends wish to carry out work within the gardens and in their homes. Access to equipment would help.",
