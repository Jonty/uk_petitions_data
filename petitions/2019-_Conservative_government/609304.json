If supermarkets, call centres etc all close on Sundays, more people will be able to go out enjoy the day with family and have time out of work.\r\n \r\nIn terms of benefits, restaurants, bars, pubs, clubs could get more revenue through the rest of the week and this should help make people\u2019s lives better. As it stands, no matter the day every day is a working day and this has to change.",
