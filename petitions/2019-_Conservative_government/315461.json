        "additional_details": "This current scheme discriminates between various types of small business and quite frankly no business that is officially registered in the UK, and has a tax number should be cut out of this grant money. We have many out goings like any business has including suppliers, insurances etc. By changing this in include all small business will save many service type business such as electricians, plumbers, painter decorators etc which is the back bone of this country, from going out of business.",
        "background": "A large number of small business will suffer due to them not have separate office premises and operate from home. This means under the current system they are not entitled to the \u00a310'000 grant money. This needs to change as most business that operate from home are the  most in need of this grant.",
