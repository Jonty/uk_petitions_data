        "additional_details": "Estate agents are unregulated and unqualified to conduct such valuations and their work has wider implications on the property market. \r\n\r\nOver estimating the value of properties compounds over time. When new buyers eventually come to sell they will need to continue overvaluing the property in order to make a profit. The lack of regulation in estate agents is just one cause of younger generations being priced out of the housing market.",
