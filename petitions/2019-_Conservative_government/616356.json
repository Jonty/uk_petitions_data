        "additional_details": "These sanctions should include a ban on serving in public office where a serious breach is found. This should help restore public trust in their elected representatives. We believe current processes to enforce the Code of Conduct for MPs are inadequate, and that MPs should have no role in deciding whether the code has been breached, or what sanctions should be applied. \r\n \r\nThe current systems in place do not have our confidence, and we believe they are ineffective at stopping bad behaviour by our elected MPs, which in turn can have a negative effect on overall governance.",
        "background": "A new Independent Office of MPs Conduct should be created to review the existing Code of Conduct to ensure it's fit for purpose, on a par with that of other public bodies e.g. the Police, and be given powers to investigate and impose sanctions for alleged breaches of this revised Code of Conduct.",
