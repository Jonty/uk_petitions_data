        "action": "Change building regulation, so house builders build more energy efficient home.",
        "additional_details": "Im a renewables technician, i see so many developments being built with a couple of PV panels on the roof(tick a box),  still installing oversized gas/oil boilers, not installing or thinking of future technologies like Heat Pumps. We want to reduce CO2, so why are major house builders not leading the way in this. Because the current regulations are at such a low standard, they dont have to. One major house builder still made profit of 296m pre tax profit in 2020.",
        "background": "I want the building regulation to change now, we are so behind our European friends in building efficiency, using renewable technologies.\r\nMajor house builders are building houses that have poor CO2 standards & have been getting away with it for years. Our old & new housing stock is very poor.",
