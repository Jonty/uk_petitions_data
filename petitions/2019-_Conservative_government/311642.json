        "additional_details": "The Covid-19 outbreak has decimated the NHS and damaged the economy like nothing before. The decision to continue spending money on the HS2 is flawed and should be urgently reviewed. We cannot use the excuse that we need HS2 to aid the economy, as there is a much greater need for the money elsewhere and the economy will need to focus on the basics and local economies for years to come. The land purchased and re-designated can be used for building homes and business units, which will aid our recovery.",
