To not allow venues to sell alcohol as a takeaway option , which many have already puchased and is sat in their cellars is completely unfair. Unsold beer will be wasted again and businesses cannot continue to afford this. If supermarkets are allowed to sell alcohol during the upcoming lockdown, the hospitality trade should be allowed.",
