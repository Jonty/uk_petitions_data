        "action": "Enact Sexual Harassment Law(s). Link laws to education in schools and university",
        "additional_details": "For centuries, women have been told how not to dress, told not to get too drunk, the inference being that women are responsible for harassment and attacks upon them if they present themselves too attractively, or if they make themselves vulnerable through alcohol. Society\u2019s advice to women publicly acknowledges this danger whilst doing nothing to enact laws that would deter, punish and rehabilitate offenders. What are you waiting for? There is huge public support for control of abusive behaviour",
        "background": "Enact laws that give police power to arrest and charge people who sexually harass using stalking, kerb crawling, groping, and any unwanted behaviour that causes humiliation fear or a loss of dignity. Include these laws in compulsory Sexual Harassment education in school, college and university",
