        "action": "Create a higher rate of Carer's Allowance for people providing 70+ hours care",
        "additional_details": "The Government should consult on the appropriate level of this new rate. This could include twice the current rate of Carer's Allowance (\u00a3139.40) or treat the 70 hours of care as equivalent to a full working week of 37.5 hours at the hourly minimum wage (\u00a3356.25). Caring for 70 hrs a week makes it unlikely to be able to sustain full-time paid employment, so the new rate should reflect this. It should also have an increased or no upper earnings limit, so people can claim no matter what paid work they can do.",
        "background": "People are entitled to Carer\u2019s Allowance of \u00a369.70 a week if they care for someone at least 35 hours a week. Many unpaid carers provide more than 70 hours care a week, and we want the Government to create a higher rate of Carer\u2019s Allowance for people who provide 70 or more hours care a week.",
