        "additional_details": "The law does not allow an unmarried mother to place the father's name on the child's birth certificate without them being present. When the father is deceased it is impossible to register them on the birth certificate without having to go through financial burdens, legal processes and added heartache. This could be seen as discrimination. I want my child to have his father's name on his birth certificate as it is bad enough he has lost his father already and I am not alone in this situation.",
        "background": "Change the law to make the process easier so that the father's name, who has died before the child's registration of birth, can be recorded on the child's birth certificate. This could be done by the deceased's legal next of kin representing the deceased with legal documentation at the registration.",
