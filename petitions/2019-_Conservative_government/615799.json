        "additional_details": "Transparency International reported that there were corruption red flags in 20% in UK's (covid) PPE contracts. Of particular concern was the \u2018VIP\u2019 lane used to fast track offers of PPE from companies referred by MPs, peers & senior officials. The High Court ruled that the government acted unlawfully by failing to disclose details of Covid-related contracts until forced to do so by litigation. It is therefore appropriate to investigate whether these decisions were driven by personal gain.",
        "background": "Undertake an investigation into MPs & government advisors to establish whether they personally gained from decisions they have made or influenced. All personal shares in companies that have gained from government policy should be investigated e.g.\r\n pharmaceutical companies, testing & PPE suppliers.",
