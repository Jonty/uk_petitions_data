        "additional_details": "In the near future, there looks to be pay freezes for the essential workers and other public sector workers who we thanked during the 'Clap for Our Carers' movement with the support of the Prime Minister and the Government. Many of these workers were later denied pay rises by the Government. It is only fair for the same alternative form of compensation (such as a weekly clap) be a possibility for MPs, if it is fit for all public sector workers.",
        "background": "We call upon the Government to introduce a bill to amend the Parliamentary Standards Act 2009 to give the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority the authority to award MPs alternative compensation options in addition to its ability to award higher salaries.",
