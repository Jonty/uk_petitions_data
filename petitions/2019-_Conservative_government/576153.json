Financial issues, transport difficulties and mental health problems are only being added to by frustration surrounding driving tests. It is crucial that the government steps in to address this issue and put a system in place to combat the massive backlog of tests in the system.",
        "background": "Driving tests Should be temporarily replaced with a driving instructor based test where the driver has to meet certain criteria set out by the DVLA. This ensures safety standards, whilst clearing out the unprecedented backlog in the system and stopping learners from losing out anymore financially.",
