        "additional_details": "We believe this benefit is at too low a level, has inadequate eligibility criteria and outdated and punitive systems, which are causing unnecessary financial hardship and distress to many unpaid carers, who are already struggling to make ends meet.\r\n\r\nThousands of carers are incurring substantial debt as a result of Carer\u2019s Allowance overpayments, sometimes due to going over the earnings limit by as little as \u00a31. Overpayments that result from an honest mistake can lead to debts that run up into \u00a31000s.",

We want systems to be modernised and urgent action from DWP to cap and prevent large overpayment debts for carers.",
