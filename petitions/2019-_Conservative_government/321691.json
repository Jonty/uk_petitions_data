        "additional_details": "The Apple / Google app will most likely be a better app and is being adopted by the German government who have led the way in Europe by suppressing the virus outbreak quickly and effectively in their country. \r\n\r\nAlso the Apple / Google app better respects user privacy because it doesn't retain the same amount of personal information as the rival NHS / Gov app. I believe we should trust the experts in Tech and not the Gov / NHS to find a solution to a Tech / Mobile problem.",
        "background": "Apple and Google are the leading companies globally in the mobile operating system and app space. I believe their app, which is ready to be deployed, would be far better at tracking and tracing coronavirus outbreaks in the UK than the app developed by the NHS. Privacy is also better respected.",
