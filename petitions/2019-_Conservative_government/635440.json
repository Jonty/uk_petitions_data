The child\u2019s DLA does not replace an income, it is to \u2018help with extra costs of looking after a child\u2019 with disabilities. The Carer's Allowance benefit equates to \u00a31.99 an hour for 35 hours a week, and is \u2018a benefit that provides some financial recognition that a carer may not be able to work full-time\u2019. Many parents who are full-time carers to disabled children will not be eligible for Universal Credit.\r\n\r\nMany nurseries and schools are not trained or equipped to cater for all disabilities, and the Government should support all parents who need to be full-time carers for their disabled children.",
