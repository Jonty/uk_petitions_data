        "additional_details": "If you are a pet owner, you know your pet is family. In most parts of the world, you are allowed to travel with them in cabin (less than 8kg) and in hold (more than 8kg), while respecting health guidelines i.e vaccinations. However, due to government regulations UK forces pet owners to register their pet as \"cargo\", meaning they pay >\u00a31-2k to cover for customs. We plead the government to take example from other countries, and not punish both pet owners and their fury loved ones.",
        "background": "Although UK has one of the highest no. of pets, it still has one of the most stringent travel schemes. You aren't allowed to travel with 'an accompanied pet', neither in cabin, hold or Eurostar. We want parliament to consider allowing pets to travel both in/out without having to register them cargo.",
