I think teachers should be trained to spot bullying in schools and help students who feel like they don't fit in. The education system should help support students by giving them an opportunity to find passion in their work.",
        "background": "I think the parliament should act on this issue because one in every five students have reportedly been bullied, that is 6 in every classroom. this statistic is way too high and speaking from first hand experience I know how demoralising this can be.",
