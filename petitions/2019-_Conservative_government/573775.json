        "additional_details": "There are too many lives being destroyed due to parents being denied their names on their children\u2019s birth certificate. Mainly the fathers. We live in the 20th century but too many fathers and some mothers are prevented from gaining parental responsibility due to the ease of a single parent registering a child\u2019s birth. This can cause emotional distress for the parent and later on in life the child\u2019s health and mental well-being. This change would help ensure both parents can have an active role. Only under exceptional circumstances may the names of both parents not be on the birth certificate.",
