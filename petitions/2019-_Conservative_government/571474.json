They would work if they could and it isn\u2019t fair. They are being punished by not paying them proper pay. \r\nSome of these people cannot work from home. But cannot work as a key worker. \r\nThey are not entitled to benefits in some situations but actually are losing out due to being unwell through no fault of their own and cannot seek temp employment like other furloughed people",

Make it mandatory for employers to pay these people and not make them financially worse off. \r\nThey cannot go to any work. A furloughed hospitality worker or builder could temporarily work in a different field to get money. CEV cannot at all",
