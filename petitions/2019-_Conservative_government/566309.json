        "additional_details": "The Government has said that tackling homelessness is a moral duty and they provided accommodation for rough sleepers during COVID-19. Many people will be evicted from their homes after the eviction freeze ends because they have lost their jobs or cannot afford rent. If empty homes in their area aren't refurbished, we are going to see very high numbers of rough sleepers on our streets whilst the country recovers from the Coronavirus pandemic.\r\n\r\nGovernment must act now.\r\n\r\n#HomelessnessIsComing",
        "background": "Because of COVID-19 there is currently an eviction freeze which means people cannot be forced to leave their homes. When that ends, thousands of people and families will be made homeless. We want the Government to refurbish old houses and flats where these people can go instead of on the street.",
