        "additional_details": "We ask the UK Government to consider a double Bank Holiday to give the British people hope and something to look forward to. This is not about replacing a religious holiday, this is for everyone, for all those who have faced restricted celebrations, the missed birthday parties, the wedding celebrations, the cancelled holiday leave for those dedicated Doctors, Nurses and key-workers. \r\n\r\nHaving this in place would encourage people to follow the rules, not take undue risks safe in the knowledge that they have something to look forward to, a celebration to bring the nation together, a type of \u2019Christmas in July\u2019.",
        "background": "As many of us face a restricted Christmas and some NHS staff have leave cancelled, 2021 is looking more hopeful with vaccines and the summer months easier for the NHS to cope with. ",
