Things will only get worse if the repercussions are not more severe as more and more people are giving up. There is a shockingly large lack of consequences, with the majority mere warnings. There should be mobile emergency alerts and TV overrides alerting lockdowns, not hearing about it via social media & friends. The government has not treated this with severity this, it does not feel like as much of a concern to most people.",
        "background": "I want to see lockdown/tier reaction breaking rules such as throwing parties or mass-gatherings treated with more severity. Such as larger fines and community service where rule breakers could meet with ex-COVID Ward patients and current ward staff to discuss the severity of the pandemic.",
