        "additional_details": "At present the person selling a motor vehicle and the person buying the same motor vehicle must pay full road tax for the month it is sold/purchased. This is because drivers must pay road tax for the full month for any period they are responsible for a vehicle. This means the Government is charging vehicle tax twice for the same month for the same vehicle. Enough is enough. This must stop now.",
        "background": "Amidst the cost of living crisis the Government is charging double vehicle tax for cars bought and sold in the middle of the month. This is absolutely deplorable. The Government should reform vehicle tax so it is calculated to the day, rather than having to be paid for the full calendar month.",
