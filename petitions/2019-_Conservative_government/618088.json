        "action": "Exempt Looked After children from citizenship fees",
        "additional_details": "In 2019 my partner and I adopted a child born in the UK to parents who were not UK citizens. Her local council decided not to apply for citizenship on her behalf, so she remained stateless until the adoption order conferred my citizenship upon her.\r\n\r\nOther children are not so fortunate. The likelihood of a child being adopted diminishes as they age, so children taken into care later in life are at risk of finding themselves stateless in their own country, or even vulnerable to deportation.",
        "background": "Citizenship applications for children cost \u00a31,012. Where a child is Looked After this cost would fall on the local authority, which many routinely try and avoid. We want the Government to exempt Looked After children from citizenship fees so these children can more easily secure citizenship.",
