        "additional_details": "The risk of transmission in these environments is no more, potentially lower, than many of the other attractions and facilities that are now invited to reopen, and have less stringent requirements to meet. \r\n\r\nIt is not only the gym owners and PT\u2019s that suffer, the communities they have built suffer too. Training isn\u2019t just about fitness in one dimension, it is good for mental health as well as physical health. \r\n\r\nThe industry has created a safe environment for us to recover in. Let them use it.",
        "background": "Today\u2019s reduction of lockdown measures is very welcome. The exclusion of gym and leisure facilities, devastating. These businesses have spent months preparing to operate within all the parameters previously set (2m spacing, reduced numbers inside at one time, additional deep cleaning routines)",
