        "additional_details": "Unless Government takes action now, the spectrum allocated to these services could be lost. Protecting Freeview will prevent millions of older people at risk of loneliness, depression and ill-health, from being excluded from public information and entertainment. Silver Voices, which advocates for the over 60s, points out that relying on internet based services is less reliable and much more costly. Poorer households are already cancelling streaming services because of the cost-of-living crisis.",
        "background": "Government must safeguard the future of broadcast TV and radio by instructing Ofcom to take a 'no change' position in the frequency allocated to Digital Terrestrial TV (Freeview) at the World Radio Communication Conference in November 2023. Millions rely on Freeview to keep in touch with society.",
