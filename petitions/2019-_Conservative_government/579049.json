        "action": "Lift COVID-19 restrictions on Baby and Toddler group activities",
        "additional_details": "There is not enough facilitation of activities where infants through to toddler age can interact and learn through socialisation. This is may be particularly vital for children whom are an only child or for families whom are isolated from other families with children of the same age. This ability to play along side each other is an important learning stage and to provide this creates less of a leap from being at home to going on to attend nursery.",
        "background": "In tier 3 lift COVID-19 restrictions on indoor baby and toddler group activities, so that toddler groups and soft play can re-open and with the allowance that children can interact with each other through activity and play.",
