        "additional_details": "I want government to continue with the EU ban of this dangerous pesticide in order to protect the UK's biodiversity of pollinating species and not put any further pressure on our already fragile environment. Bees and other pollinators are a vital part of our ecosystem and don't need to come under further threat from even more pesticides when the government pledged it would continue the EU ban of this substance.",
        "background": "The British government wants to allow our UK farmers to use Neonicotinoid Thiamexthoxam on crops. This would kill bees and other pollinators that actually pollinate up-to 3/4 of British crops. Since 1990 the UK has lost 13 species of bee and 35 aren under threat of extinction.",
