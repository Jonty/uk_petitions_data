        "additional_details": "If E-Bicycles are legal to cycle them on public roads then why e-scooters are NOT?\r\nThis low cost transportation vehicles could be a base for transforming a way of travel around the city centers. This could boost a reduction in congestions as well as make people to choose this very low carbon footprint travel rather than other means of transport that are much more polluting. Let's give people a freedom of choice and legalize on public roads e-scooters and end unnecessary pressure on the police.",
        "background": "E-scooters just like any other form (apart from electric bicycles) of short distance travel are illegal to use on public roads in the UK. This type of vehicles has been proven very popular for short distance travel with successful hire businesses in many cities around the UK",
