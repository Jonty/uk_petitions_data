        "action": "No lockdown till June for the UK.",
        "additional_details": "I would like the government to take in that someone not protecting themselves should be their own responsibility and not going out or seeing your family can ruin people\u2019s mental state. People are not allowed to visit their elder family and this can heavily affect people as they can\u2019t see their loved ones go. Children and adults with disabilities should be allowed to have trips as it helps them. Having a lockdown until June affects people with a job as they\u2019re out of a job and can not provide for their family.",
        "background": "Not to enforce a lockdown on the UK till June. We should keep doing the lockdown for three weeks. When Boris Johnson enforced the lockdown he should have been more strict and should have had rules like Italy, if he did enforce that after the three weeks the UK would be fine.",
