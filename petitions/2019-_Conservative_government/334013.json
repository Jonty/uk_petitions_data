        "action": "Allow free and accessible appeals of GCSE and A Level calculated grades",
        "additional_details": "Following the IB and the SQA results, we have seen evidence that due to the new grading procedure, individuals have not received grades they feel are consistent with their work over the last two years. \r\n\r\nWithout any appeals process, students in England could be forced to reapply for university/college or defer their entry - even if they have evidence that they feel goes against the grades they received.\r\n\r\nPlease sign the petition to allow any errors in grades to be appealed and to ensure greater fairness in the process.",
        "background": "This petition is for the government to introduce a free evidence-based appeals process (similar to the process currently under use in Scotland) for anyone disappointed with their 2020 exam results so that they may have more opportunity to progress to their next stages.",
