        "additional_details": "Recently a video has been shared on social media showing a man burning a Pride Flag.\r\n \r\nThis took place a few days after the man declared his intent to run in a local by-election following the resignation of Boris Johnson.\r\n \r\nWe believe this is an unacceptable publicity stunt, likely to cause grave concern and upset, and that those engaging in this kind of behaviour are unfit to hold public office.\r\n \r\nBurning the Pride Flag should be made a specific criminal offence, with a ban on public office for people found guilty of this offence.\r\n",
        "background": "We want the Government to pass legislation to bar people standing for public office if they have been found guilty of burning Pride flags. There should be no place in British Politics for those who stoke prejudice and hatred towards the LGBT+ community.",
