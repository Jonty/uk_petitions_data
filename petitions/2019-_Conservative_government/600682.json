        "additional_details": "This is causing great anxiety and we are all mentally drained from the stress. Most of us are away from our partners which is causing unnecessary pressure on our relationships. It is not fair at all that we have all paid for this visa expecting that it would be finalised in 12 weeks. We have contacted our local MP and the UKVI tell them that the application is still under consideration. We contact the UKVI through paid emails and calls but they give us no information apart from that we have to wait.",
