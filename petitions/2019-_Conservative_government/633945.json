        "action": "Hold a referendum on replacing representative democracy with a direct democracy",
        "additional_details": "This would allow the public to take direct control over our laws and over how we want the country to be shaped. Laws including tax changes, worker's rights, human rights, where our tax gets spent, trade and foreign policy and more would all be voted on directly by us and not by elected representatives who we feel often do not vote for what we want and instead only vote for what they want. Therefore the government should hold a referendum on this matter and allow the public to decide what is best for us.",
        "background": "Direct democracy means all policies and legislation would have to be voted on by the British public in referendums. To do this an app or website could be created in order for the public to read about a proposed policy or law and vote on it. The winning vote would then be implemented.",
