Seeing as these key points directly impact prisoners, they should be able to have their say on these issues, yet they are still not being included in the democratic process.\r\n\r\nThere are many other countries which allow prisoners to vote such as Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Spain, South Africa, Sweden and  Switzerland - yet we do not.",

This infringement on human rights is unacceptable and the Government should change legislation to ensure all prisoners can vote during elections.",
