        "additional_details": "Rape culture is a culture in which sexual violence is normalised, rapists are protected and victims are blamed for their own assaults. By teaching grooming, victim blaming, molestation, all forms of rape in schools will help the understanding of rape culture become more wide spread. Youth people will learn from a young age how to not become perpetrators of rape culture. This will hopefully decrease the number of victims in the UK.",
        "background": "Home office statistics state that 1 in 5 women experience sexual assault at least once in their lifetime. The scope of sexual assault for the most part falls under a grey area. In order to combat it, young adults need to understand what constitutes as assault/rape culture.",
