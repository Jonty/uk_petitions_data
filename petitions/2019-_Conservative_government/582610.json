Muslims come closer to ALLAH (God) by obeying his command of fasting and are reminded every year of the importance of giving alms to charities and taking steps to easing poverty and alleviating its causes around the world. The Public Call of Prayer (Athan) is an integral part of the Islamic faith which acts as a reminder to its followers of the daily five prayers. Ramadan Mubarak.",
