People of Black Caribbean background are dying 1.7 times the rate of white people. \r\n\r\nHealth secretary Matt Hancock said in early May: 'Matt Hancock, said: \u201cWe recognise that there has been a disproportionately high number of people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds who have passed away.'\r\n\r\nThe government are 'recognising' the problem yet refusing to acknowledge their part in it.",
        "background": "The review on how and why Covid-19 is killing more BAME UK citizens was due at the end of May. Now the government has delayed the publication of the report based on fears that it will stoke 'racial tensions'. \r\n\r\nThis is a disgraceful excuse. BAME people are dying and the government must act.",
