        "additional_details": "It is outrageously unfair for the government to advise the public to stop attending these venues, without ordering their closure, as this means that business owners are forced to cover their own losses during this time and cannot claim on their business insurance. Businesses are therefore staying open unnecessarily, and putting their workers at risk due to government inaction.",
