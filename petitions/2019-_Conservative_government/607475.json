Based on industry averages, this equates to an estimated \u00a314,950,000 of wasted energy per day across the UK, and \u00a33,619,000 whilst we sleep. \r\nThis creates 37,440,000 kg of carbon dioxide emissions, or what would be the equivalent of 62 flights around the world each day. At night it\u2019s 8,985,600 kg.",
        "background": "There are a significant number of business and large buildings seemingly unoccupied with all of the main interior lighting still switched on. Lighting inside businesses and large unoccupied complexes is a huge, unnecessary waste of electricity.",
