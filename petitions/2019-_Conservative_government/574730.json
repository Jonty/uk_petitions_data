        "additional_details": "Blanket IR35 assessments fail to take into account individual circumstances and working practices of the Contractor. Blanket / role-based assessments are being used as a risk-averse approach for corporations to mitigate risk of any tax liabilities to them. As a result Contractors are being incorrectly classified. An increasing number of Corporations are taking this approach on the lead up to the reforms due 6th April 2021 with evidence illustrated on the lead up to the reforms in 2020.",
        "background": "The Government should establish a statutory regulator to oversee IR35 assessment and empower those impacted by blanket / role-based employment status tax checks to enable them to challenge decisions, especially where these have not been made on an individual assessment.",
