        "additional_details": "Schools have been closed for around five months over the last two years, and individual students have also missed school due to positive tests. Collectively, pupils have missed hundreds of millions of schooldays. The greatest problem with this is that some have missed more than others, and some have caught up more than others. Therefore, it is necessary to give students some guidance regarding upcoming exams to ensure fairness across this cohort and grade equality with others.",

This should provide information about what content will be included in exams, along the lines of what has been provided this year.",
