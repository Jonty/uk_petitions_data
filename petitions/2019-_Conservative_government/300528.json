        "additional_details": "Students must pay fees in full even when academic support and lectures are permanently lost due to strike action. Doing right by the students will force universities to address the concerns raised by employees, hence preventing future strikes. We urge Parliament to demand that universities reimburse the fees corresponding to refused services. It is a tactic on the side of justice making the universities realise that they are not a business but ultimately a service for the betterment of society.",
        "background": "The University and College Union has repeatedly called on its members to strike. However, strikes are ineffective if students, not employees are the main source of revenue. For this to change, government needs to step in and require universities to reimburse tuition fees lost due to strike action.",
