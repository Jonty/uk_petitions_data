UK and European governments to allow fertility patients to travel with a medical document and negative COVID test within 72 hours of travel. Infertility is a medical condition, that is fact. Patients undergoing treatment for such should be allowed to travel for medical reasons and it should be classed as essential travel.",

We want the government to deem travel for fertility treatment as 'essential travel', the same as other medical conditions.",
