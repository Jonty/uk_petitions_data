        "additional_details": "Pavement parking affects everyone, but is especially dangerous for people with disabilities, including people with sight loss and wheelchair users, as well as parents with children, and older people.\r\n \r\nCars on pavements can make it difficult for people to get to work, education, or social activities. The constant fear that cars will block their way can also reduce peoples\u2019 confidence to leave their house alone.\r\n \r\nIn 2020, the Government consulted on options to tackle pavement parking, yet no progress has been made.",
        "background": "Parking on pavements poses a serious threat to public safety as cars blocking pavements can force people out on to the road. We want the Government to legislate restricting pavement parking, unless an exception is made by a local authority, to ensure that everyone can walk their streets safely.",
