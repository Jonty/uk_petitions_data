Their UK-based relatives may not have enough space and private accommodation is unaffordable. The only remaining option is to apply for 'homeless\u2019 status on arrival, which is deterring many from travelling. The joined up and fair solution is to allow and facilitate access for these individuals to the HfU scheme \u2013 providing 6+ months rent-free accommodation.",

Instead of having \u201chomeless\" status, they will get the 6+ month rent free benefit available under the HfU scheme.",
