This can cause great distress to those on waiting lists and their families. It's time neurodevelopment is taken seriously. The effects of late diagnosis are well documented. Children diagnosed earlier perform better in school, they are less likely to develop mental health issues later in life. Adults left to wait for such long periods are more likely to develop mental health issues. These are just a few benefits of early diagnosis.",
