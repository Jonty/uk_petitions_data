        "additional_details": "Too many facemasks are making their way into our oceans. Not only does this cause catastrophic issues for a wildlife and marine life, tiny microplastic particles make their way into food supply and contaminate human food produce. If even only 1 percent of single use masks were disposed of incorrectly, this would result in 10 million masks per month dispersed in the environment. The weight of each mask is about 4 grams, this results in more than 40 thousand kilograms of plastic in nature.",
