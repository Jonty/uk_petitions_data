        "additional_details": "Mandatory labeling of products tested on animals serves as a powerful tool, empowering consumers to make informed choices aligning with their values. By clearly indicating which products have undergone animal testing, consumers are equipped to support cruelty-free alternatives, thus driving a positive shift towards ethical consumerism. This move not only reflects a commitment to animal welfare but also fosters transparency and accountability within industries.",
