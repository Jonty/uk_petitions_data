Currently such irresponsible behaviour as we have seen during the festive period is going unpunished and so will continue. The problem with this is that the virus will continue to spread because of the decisions made by a number of careless and irresponsible people and currently there is no real consequence for this.",

There must be real consequences for breaking the rules during this time to deter individuals from spreading the virus",
