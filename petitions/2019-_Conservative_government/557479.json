He will later apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain but this means paying another \u00a31,500, and taking English exams and the Life in the UK Test. He cannot visit his (British) daughters who live in Turkey as and when he wants with his current residency status. This is not right given how long we have been married and living in the UK.",
