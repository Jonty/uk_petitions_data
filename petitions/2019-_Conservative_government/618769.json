        "additional_details": "We need thriving cod populations around the UK for the health of our seas, our people and our businesses that depend on cod. However, the situation is dire. The West Scotland cod population alone has declined by 92% since 1981. Despite continued warnings about the perilous condition of the stock, the UK set catch limits far above sustainable levels. The UK must set catch limits at sustainable levels to allow cod populations to replenish themselves and flourish in our seas, for us all.",
        "background": "There are five cod stocks around the UK, all of which are overfished. Four are so badly overfished that populations are at risk of collapse. Every year, catch limits are determined in negotiations between the UK, EU and Norway and every year the UK ignores the science and allows overfishing.",
