        "additional_details": "Children are leaving hospital currently without having an oral assessment and tongue ties are being missed causing a lot of distress for new mums and their babies making breastfeeding difficult. The consultant being present on the ward would mean all babies could be checked prior to leaving hospital and providing extra support for new mums. Ultimately taking pressure off other services as a result of feeding issues not being picked up sooner.",
        "background": "I would like the government to provide funding for fully trained lactation consultants to be present on maternity wards in order to support new mothers with feeding techniques and to check the new born for any feeding issues such as tongue tie as 1 in 10 suffer with this.",
