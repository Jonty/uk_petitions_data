        "additional_details": "I want the Government and local police to open a investigation into the people who have not only broken lockdown but have also defaced very honoured and respected memorials. 14 people is not enough and brings no justice to the armed personnel and loyal people of the UK who have followed guidelines. When you break the rules there should be repercussions. And so far no one has been arrested or jailed for defacing memorials which honour the dead. Local police should hang their heads in shame.",
        "background": "The total lack of respect and valour to war memorials and statues / monuments across the UK is a direct insult to everything we\u2019ve stood for. The past week, only 14 have been arrested in London for breaching Lockdown and none for vandalising monuments. London has CCTV everywhere. Where\u2019s the justice",
