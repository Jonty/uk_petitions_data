        "additional_details": "Sexual assault is a horrible thing that a lot of women and men have to experience. Speaking to numerous teenagers about this has made me aware that consent isn\u2019t taught in the majority of secondary schools which is appalling. Teaching young children consent could help prevent the amount of sexual harassment cases we get in the UK each year. As well as this, helplines should be provided to those taught about consent so if they have had an experience with sexual assault, they know who to go to.",
        "background": "With the recent situations that have been surrounding the media, it should be mandatory to teach consent in all sex education classes in secondary schools across the United Kingdom.",
