Examples are those who work in trades (window fitters, plumbers etc). \r\nMore and more people will suffer financially, mentally and physically unless a full lockdown is ordered for the UK, similar to those we have seen in Italy and China.",

Supermarkets, hospitals, pharmacies, doctors and other key job roles. \r\nStop ALL travel except for commute to work, shopping or health care. \r\nClose boarders into the UK.",
