Vaccination status is a choice, as much as choosing to become pregnant, religious beliefs, choosing to enter a civil partnership or marriage and/or gender reassignment. \r\nIt is against the law to discriminate against someone who has any of these protected characteristics. I fear that the unvaccinated will be next in line to be discriminated against as they are a minority group.",
