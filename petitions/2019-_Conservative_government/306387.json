        "additional_details": "We ask for detailed and mandatory safety guidelines for essential workers, specific to each type of job, which have to be followed by those workers and members of the public that they come into contact with (e.g. limiting the number of customers entering shops, maintaining 1 metre distance when queuing). Essential workers should be provided with personal protective equipment (e.g. masks, gloves) to limit the transmission of Covid-19 and should be prioritised for testing when symptoms develop.",
