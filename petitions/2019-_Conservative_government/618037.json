This happened in broad daylight - had it been dark, it may have escalated to dangerous levels. We, the people, have the right to feel safe on the streets, whether during the day or at night. Criminals will break the law to harm law-abiding citizens. Law-abiding citizens have only their bodies to defend themselves with. This needs to change.",
