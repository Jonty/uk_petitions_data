        "additional_details": "Fly tipping has always been a growing issue in the UK. Even with the threat of fines individuals or companies will still dump rubbish that they cannot afford to recycle.\r\n\r\nUltimately we want to have a sustainable country that prides itself on innovate ways of being better. \r\n\r\nIsn't it about time that we stop charging individuals or companies for doing the right thing, taking all materials to be disposed of correctly and reward them, by inviting them to do this free of charge.",
        "background": "Government need to reopen Household Waste & Recycling centres. Using skeleton staff on rotation. Clear social distancing rules and measures in place. And allow materials to be recycled free of charge.\r\nAllowing both landowners & individuals to feel they won't be penalised for making better choices.",
