        "additional_details": "We are not allowed to go to the gym, go fishing, play golf or other sport. They have numerous health benefits, both physically and mentally. Which I think we all need in this difficult time. However we can all still go to work where we are coming into contact with many people each day. To get this under control so we can all return to our normal lives, something more drastic needs to happen. Factories with over 1000 people are still functioning, yet a fishing match where people are 20 yards or more apart or golf which is a nearly solo sport where social distancing can be practiced aren't allowed. Peoples mental healths are starting to become effected and if we don't get strict when will we see an end to this?",
        "background": "Stop all work that isn't key workers, limiting hours on shops and supermarkets and tighter restrictions across all of England in an attempt to be able to return back to normal. Working in big companies, factories and the like are not reducing the R rate. Its a breeding ground for it to spread.",
