In addition, under the Family Procedure Rules 2010, the family court may make such order for disclosure and inspection, including specific disclosure of documents, as it thinks fit.\r\n\r\nThere is already statutory guidance, Working Together to Safeguard Children, which sets out guidance on safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/779401/Working_Together_to_Safeguard-Children.pdf\r\n\r\nIf you want the Government to make some other change to the legal requirements on social services in respect of child abuse you could start a new petition about this, but would need to be clear what change you want the Government to make.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition calling on the Government to create a legal obligation for social services to report all cases of suspected child abuse, if that is what you want to happen."
