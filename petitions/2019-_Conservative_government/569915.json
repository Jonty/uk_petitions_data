We're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. \r\n\r\nThe Government has already issued guidance on providing lunch parcels for pupils eligible for free school meals during the national lockdown, including that these should meet the school food standards and should cater for pupils who require special diets, for example allergies, vegetarians or religious diets. See:\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-free-school-meals-guidance/covid-19-free-school-meals-guidance-for-schools\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do, if there are specific actions you would like the Government or House of Commons to take."
