        "additional_details": "Brain tumours kill more children than any other cancer, but can often go undetected or be misdiagnosed. Malignant brain tumours can be aggressive and can kill without being detected. The treatment can be harsh and so better funding for research into childhood cancers and support for childhood cancer patients (both with brain tumours and all other varieties of cancer), and their families, could greatly benefit these children and those around them.",
        "background": "Childhood cancer research and support receives only a fraction of the funding that adult cancer receives, however can in some ways be more devastating for the patient and their family.",
