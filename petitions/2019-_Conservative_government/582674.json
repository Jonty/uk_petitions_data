        "additional_details": "Millions of British citizens are excluded from freely accessing the EU labour market on par with nationals of EU member states. When applying for employment in an EU member state British citizens will only be considered if the national of an EU member state cannot fill the vacancy. This will disproportionately affect people who cannot meet the income thresholds for emigration to EU member states, and therefore is likely to be more detrimental to people from lower socio-economic backgrounds.",
