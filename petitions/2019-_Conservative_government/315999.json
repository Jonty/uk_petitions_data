These staff members play vital roles in keeping our wards stocked, clean, and organised which ultimately keeps our doctors and patients cared for. These key workers are now being left behind because the governments new measure do not go far enough, and many may be forced to return home during a critical moment for the NHS and the UK as a whole.",
