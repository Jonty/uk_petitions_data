        "action": "Im writing this petition in hopes for better funding towards zoos across the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Only 34/300 zoos have been awarded funding so far, but at the end of February all funding will be non accessible. The fund scheme is also corrupt due to the fact that they have to be twelve weeks away from bankruptcy to receive any money from the fund; this is no good, by twelve weeks zoos are already closing down and rehoming the animals. Furthermore, Zoos are one of the top places to bring in money pre-pandemic, they are great tourist attractions. Its immensely important we prioritise zoos during these tough times, they're just as important as we are.",
        "background": "Funding for zoos is crucial to look after the animals WE put there. If we don't help soon zoos will get shut down and the animals that can't get rehomed will be slaughtered; this will lead to extinction for some animals. These animals rely on us to keep them safe, and currently we are failing them.",
