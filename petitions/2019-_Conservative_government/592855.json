However in practice there are still often limits on the number of birthing partners allowed at a woman's birth. This has caused a substantial amount of stress on many pregnant women across England, as they are forced into an unideal birthing situations. A legal right to have two birthing partners at births should be established across England. Birthing partners could be required to present negative covid tests.",

While legal limits on the number of people who can attend life events have been lifted, many hospitals are limiting the number of people who can be present at a birth. This is not acceptable.",
