However, homelessness charities and migrant rights organisations have strongly opposed this rule, describing it as a \"huge step backwards\", and say that it will prevent vulnerable people asking for help. The shadow home secretary has said: \u201cDeporting people for being homeless is immoral.\"\r\n \r\nWe ask that the Government listen to the groups with first hand experience of these issues and reverse their decision.",
