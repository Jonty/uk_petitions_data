        "additional_details": "This is not a fair way to tax parents of this country. \r\nThe current rules are discriminating against families which include any of the following; 1 \u2018stay at home\u2019 parent, 1 \u2018low income\u2019 parent and \u2018single\u2019 parent households. \r\n\r\nThis needs to be looked at urgently and make the charge down to a combined earning of households over 100k to make this a fair system across the country for all people.",
        "background": "The child benefit high income tax charge is extremely unfair as it considers income from only 1 parent. \r\n\r\nThe charge should be based on a combined household income, as one parent can earn \u00a350,000 and be charged this tax but two parents can earn a combined \u00a399,999.",
