        "additional_details": "During the Coronavirus pandemic, there are better uses of public money than repainting the prime minister\u2019s VIP RAF plane red, white and blue.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the waste of money, this will turn the aircraft into a \u201cbrightly coloured lollipop\u201d when it is used for the military purposes for which it was originally made (i.e. mid-air refueling), a former pilot has warned.\r\n\r\nAt the time of a pandemic, this both wastes money that the NHS could use and puts the lives of RAF pilots and aircrew at risk.",
        "background": "Boris Johnson\u2019s red, white and blue paint job on the prime ministerial plane is costing the UK taxpayer \u00a3900,000. The project has been condemned as a waste of public money and reduces its value for refueling in dangerous air space.\r\nThe government should stop these plans and save the money.",
