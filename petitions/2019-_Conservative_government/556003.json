        "additional_details": "With this current climate with COVID-19, I don\u2019t see how it will be safe to fit all students in an exam hall as for some topics there are over 500 students sitting the same exam. Especially how the majority of cities are going into a tier 3 lockdown, I really don\u2019t feel comfortable as a student going into an exam hall, putting myself, my family, and friends at risk for to sit an exam. Do the government not see how much pressure this adds to student\u2019s lives as we have to be weary of our health!",
        "background": "I would like the Government to cancel the exams for BTEC students in January 2021. This is because, we already have so much coursework to do. Along with this, we didn\u2019t get our predicted grades for exams last year like A level students did, which means in January some BTEC students have 6 exams!",
