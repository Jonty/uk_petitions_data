        "additional_details": "Poisoning our own waterways will kill us all eventually. It is dangerous and short-sighted. Already much of the sealife (fishes, crabs and lobsters and sea-birds) around the UK are being decimated. It is impossible to swim in the sea and rivers in some places, because of the sewage and of course, this will impact on the livelihood of those living by the sea and rivers which are being polluted.",
        "background": "Legislate to fine water companies for dumping raw sewage in our waterways on a par with the EU. It should be done immediately as there is immeasurable damage being done to our ecosystems, fishes, crabs, sea birds and us. We are all interconnected.",
