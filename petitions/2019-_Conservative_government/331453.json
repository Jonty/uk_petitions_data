        "additional_details": "By scrapping this as part of a \u00a31.6bn TfL bailout package, those from poorer backgrounds will be forced to pay to go to school. This will impact those who cannot freely travel to school (driving, cycling or walking) . As there are fines put in place for children who do not return to school in September 2020, this will further increase economic problems for many families in the UK. This will increase poverty within the UK, causing more people from poorer backgrounds to fall further into debt.",
        "background": "To not decide to scrap free travel for those who are under 18. As a teenager who has relied so much on free travel, it has allowed for me to go to school without the worry of an extra expense and explore around the beautiful city of London also. Destroying free travel would hurt so many of us.",
