There is no guarantee that this virus will get less serious, and with new variants it could get more serious.\r\n\r\nVaccination alone is not enough. We need protective measures to keep transmission as low as possible to reduce the number of infections.\r\n\r\nAs one of the primary modes of transmission is aerosol spread one of the most important protections is clean indoor air in all shared indoor spaces outside of the home.",
