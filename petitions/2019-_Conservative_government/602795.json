        "additional_details": "The government have made a huge mistake by completely removed the towing test from September 20th 2021 amid proposals to remove the licence requirement for towing. This has left thousands of people in limbo and unable to tow larger trailers as they do not have the required licence category. This proposal will also have a severe detrimental effect on driving standards for towing larger trailers.",
        "background": "Reinstate the towing test with immediate effect after a farcicle proposal to withdraw the requirements for towing larger trailers with a motor vehicle, and withdraw the proposal to remove the B+E licence requirement.",
