        "action": "Ban Police using horses, especially during protests.",
        "additional_details": "Following tonights protests, we have witnessed how utterly useless and cruel it is to attempt to use horses to control crowds. An officer and protester were injured due to the chaos of the situation and nothing was resolved through the use of horses. Two people were injured and a horse was on the run in central London. Other than placing animals in serious distress and harms way, it only served to antagonise the crowd, the majority of whom had not thrown objects at police.",
        "background": "We would like parliament to ban the use of horses to control crowds, we would like them to examine whether it breaches animal cruelty laws, and we would like them to weigh up whether the injuries caused both to police and members of the public was worth their excessive display of force.",
