We are one of the many families in the UK waiting to be diagnosed. But just as worryingly those who have received a diagnosis often do not receive the help and support they need! It\u2019s not enough and we deserve better care and more support.",

Additional funding should also be provided for support groups, local services and outreach programmes for neurodivergent children and parents of these children. Early intervention is key.",
