        "additional_details": "The UK Chief Medical Officers say school return is not risk-free and that parents should \u201cunderstand the balance of risks to achieve the best course of action for their children.\u201d But current policy does not give parents the right to do this. As well as the risk to children's health, the risk of harm to a child of losing a parent or having a parent incapacitated and unable to care for them is significant. Give parents the right to make decisions that are right for their child\u2019s circumstances.",
        "background": "The government must remove the threat of fines and further action and allow parental choice based on individual circumstances. Currently a blanket policy applies regardless of individual family risk levels from Covid-19 (for example to those who are clinically vulnerable or single parent families).",
