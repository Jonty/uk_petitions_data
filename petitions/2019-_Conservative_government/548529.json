        "additional_details": "A return flight from London to San Francisco emits more than twice the emissions produced by a family car in a year (BBC, 2020). \r\n\r\nAs the world returns to normal following the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of flights are set to increase, especially with the effects of \u2018revenge pollution\u2019.\r\nWithout an air mile allowance, the government could impose air travel restrictions by increasing the cost of plane tickets. An air mile allowance ensures fair travel opportunities for all.",
        "background": "An air mile allowance would help to limit or reduce the effects of the climate crisis by preventing excess air travel. An annual air mileage allowance for one adult could be equivalent to 1x long haul and 1x short haul flight a year. Any unused allowance could be sold/bought on an official exchange.",
