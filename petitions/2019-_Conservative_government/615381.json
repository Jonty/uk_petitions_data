        "additional_details": "I have contacted my local Conservative MP and Councillor with no luck in any action. The responses I have had explain that there is no legislation to enforce parent and child parking. The other issue is the cost of line painting and the probable loss of parking spaces as the bays require greater width. They explained although they felt they should consider the provision in future, it is unlikely that there will be any installed soon.",
        "background": "Since becoming a new mum I have noticed the lack of parking for parents in Gosport.\r\nThe high street is struggling at the moment. This issue makes it even less appealing to visit. \r\nThere are plenty of Disabled spots in all of the car parks, surely there should be a fair share of spaces for parents?",
