        "additional_details": "The livelihoods of so many people of different cultures; backgrounds and vocations are at risk. British Theatre faces a major threat that it may not recover from. If we lose Theatre, we lose the positive impact it creates: providing people with jobs; educating and expanding on the knowledge of different cultures; giving young people a place to express themselves that other vocations don't allow; it's value to the economy of roughly \u00a35 billion and to the tourism sector of \u00a32 billion. It is vital.",
        "background": "Everyone involved in the arts need the government to act, in response to the crisis that the Theatre Industry faces due to COVID-19, by providing financial support. It's estimated that the shutdown has resulted in a loss of \u00a3330m for the sector. We need you to help it recover.",
