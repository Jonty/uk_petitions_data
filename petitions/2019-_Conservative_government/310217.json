People have the right to work in a safe environment without being coerced by managers with fear of being fired if they do not comply. Unethical employers are not making enough adjustments to allow work from home.  We call on the Prime Minister for clarity in this down lock and prosecution of employers not complying.

This is unacceptable, employers should be prosecuted for putting people's health at risk, and endangering the public by spreading COVID-19 and not taking steps to protect staff and the public",
