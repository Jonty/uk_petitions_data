        "additional_details": "Some industry sectors will increase their profits from this covid19 pandemic (food, medical, etc) whilst others are unable to trade. The government has tried to redress this imbalance with a number of measures (80% of salaries paid etc) but this does not reduce the bill to the tax player or lessen an negative economic impacts. The increased profits from companies who do benefit could be used to offset some of the cost of government support and help support the economy as a whole",
        "background": "I would like the government to increase corporation tax on profits generated beyond a baseline level for individual companies e.g. comparison to period (unaffected) period. I understand measuring if Covid19 has directly increased profits will be difficult due to a number of dynamic factors",
