If we where able to stop our studies it would relieve a lot of stress as well as mean that we could work more in key sectors and help out our fellow citizens. It a huge stress to have 20 plus assignments to do on top of effects from the crisis whilst our peers have finished studies.",

As students we are assessed throughout the year and so it would be easy to give us a grade. As a group, we are all stressed-feeling the pressure and uncertainty.",
