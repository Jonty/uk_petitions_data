        "additional_details": "Currently, millions of citizens from the United Kingdom are having to choose between heating their own home or putting food on their table. This is no choice that anyone should have to make, at the current time, with the economic crisis, many people have to make this choice.\r\n\r\nThe Trussell Trust food banks are currently struggling for food and food donations. Supermarkets should be made, by law, to donate any consumable food to these food banks instead of allowing them to dispose of it as waste.",
        "background": "To bring forward the 2030 food waste pledge and make supermarkets responsible for all of their food waste, but making sure they dispose of it in a more humane way, thinking of those in need rather than exploiting their profits.",
