        "action": "Provide free hospital car parking facilities for all NHS staff indefinitely",
        "additional_details": "Lack of parking facilities for NHS staff predates the COVID19 crisis. Each hospital and council has its own parking rules, pricing, and permits are readily not available. This issue makes it difficult for NHS staff who often rotate between hospitals, to deliver emergency care. The current provision has demonstrated that it can be done and more importantly it has given NHS frontline staff the opportunity to deliver emergency care without worrying about parking fines or struggling to park.",
        "background": "During the COVID19 pandemic, free hospital parking was provided to all NHS staff by most hospitals and local authorities across the UK. This should continue indefinitely as we are constantly providing emergency care. We ask parliament to develop a free healthcare parking permit scheme for NHS staff.",
