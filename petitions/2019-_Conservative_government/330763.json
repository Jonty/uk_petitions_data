The Royal British Legion estimate that there are over 6000 homeless veterans In the U.K., yet The latest Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) homelessness data reveals that over the past year only 1,780 homeless veterans were identified by local authority housing services. That\u2019s identified, not housed. Most of those would still have not received enough points.",

If veterans are willing to put their lives on the line for this country, the least we can do is home them when their service ends",
