Our history is full of examples of the government and the people choosing the difficult path in order to combat slavery, despots, and other infringements of human rights. We should seek, we believe, to live up to the example our predecessors set. In doing so, we should hold to the spirit of the Budapest memorandum and guarantee the sovereignty of Ukraine.",
