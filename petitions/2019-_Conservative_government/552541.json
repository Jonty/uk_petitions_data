        "additional_details": "We are living in unprecedented times, where the spread of Covid-19 has stopped many aspects of day to day life. One big change has been the severely reduced amount of contact learning that students are allowed with their lecturers which, whilst is completely understandable, is not the students fault. They should not have to pay full price for a course which will mostly be done online and with some pre-recorded lectures, but instead be reimbursed for the service that they are not receiving.",
        "background": "The Government should lower the amount that University courses cost from the full \u00a39,250 (or indeed more in some cases) to a reduced amount.",
