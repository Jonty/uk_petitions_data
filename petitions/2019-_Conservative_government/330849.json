        "additional_details": "The potential for the younger generation to suffer long-term unemployment, or be faced with an alternative of apprenticeships which have no guarantee of a permanent job at the end, is something we as a forward looking nation should seek to avoid. Therefore, rather than paying unemployment benefits to young people, and leaving them unable to realise their potential, why not help them into a career and redirect the unemployment benefits saved to fund a reduction in the retirement/pension age.",
        "background": "In light of the forecast impact of COVID-19 on unemployment figures we call on the Government to consider reducing the retirement age/pension age, either on a temporary or permanent basis, in order to free up job opportunities for young people.",
