        "additional_details": "On top of the recent high profile concerns found in \u2018The Met\u2019 by Baroness Casey, front line officers are spending countless hours watching people sleep in hospital whilst crimes go unattended. Victims are getting assaulted while response officers wait at traffic lights due to a lack of training. Cases dropped because of prosecution time limits or fridges failing. We are letting victims down continually. \r\n\r\nA Royal Commission into Policing is long overdue to restore trust and confidence.",
        "background": "Confidence in policing across the nation is at an all time low. In a model that thrives on the notion of policing by consent, that very consent is threatened. As a serving police officer, I want to see a system that allows us to support vulnerable victims, and prevent, detect, and investigate crime.",
