        "additional_details": "Food delivery couriers are essential workers that provide a much needed service. The HSE last year issued a letter warning restaurants that it's against the law to prevent access to suitable toilet and hand washing facilities. \r\n\r\nThe HSE must start enforcing Regs 20 & 21 of the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 and provide local authorities with additional support in enforcement. It is proposed that fines be issued and delivery service providers be forced to cooperate.",
        "background": "The right for couriers to use toilet facilities is a legal requirement under Regulations 20 and 21 of the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992. However, too many restaurants are routinely failing to comply with this obligation. The HSE must get tougher on businesses failing.",
