Alcohol use is normalised, but causes significant physical and mental harm to many.\r\n\r\nAlcoholism is on the increase. There are extensive waiting lists for many alcohol detox centres. Some may never reach this level of help to stop drinking.\r\n\r\nSome stores have removed confectionery from checkouts, yet are pushing the sale of alcohol into our view. Cigarettes and tobacco are behind the counters and hidden from display.\r\n\r\nDepression, money issues, violence, motor fatalities, relationship breakups, can ALL be fuelled by ALCOHOL.\r\n\r\nThis ban shouldn\u2019t apply to a specialised wine shop or similar, because it's personal choice to go there. \r\n\r\n",
