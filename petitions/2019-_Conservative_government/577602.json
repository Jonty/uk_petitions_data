        "additional_details": "At the moment there is no testing for adults on the NHS and private testing is very expensive.  I feel this is a injustice to many of the people out there from all walks of life who have not been able to adapt or understand why and how they do the things they do in compensation for struggling and understanding.  Giving people the understanding allows them to have an acknowledgment, and a cooping mechanism to prove they can do things and approach things in a different way with support.",
        "background": "I have struggled all my life and which I have kept secret because I was to ashamed to believe I could have dyslexia, and I believe many adults out there don't understand many of the aspects of their life which they have learned some how to compensate and get through with their struggles.",
