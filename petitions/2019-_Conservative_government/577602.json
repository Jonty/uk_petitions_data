I feel this is a injustice to many of the people out there from all walks of life who have not been able to adapt or understand why and how they do the things they do in compensation for struggling and understanding.  Giving people the understanding allows them to have an acknowledgment, and a cooping mechanism to prove they can do things and approach things in a different way with support.",
