All categories should be allowed to have any of the ratings. The Department of Health and Social Care are the authors of the National framework for NHS continuing healthcare and NHS-funded nursing care, so it is not valid for the Government to claim that they are not responsible for this.\r\n",

This means that dementia patients aren\u2019t receiving the healthcare they need. All of the domains in the CHC assessment should be allowed to have a Priority score.\r\n",
