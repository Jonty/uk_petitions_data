        "additional_details": "Although classed as non-essentilal, gardening is considered by many, government included, as good for physical and mental health generally, but especially during this lockdown period - See 'Guidance for the public on mental health and wellbeing aspects of coronavirus (COVID-19)'. Enabling people to access plants and other materials to partake in this activity in a safe environment with social distancing, would be good for them and also the business and the industry at this usually very busy time.",
        "background": "Garden centres generally have a large retail area for customers to shop in, with a large amount of this area outside. This makes it easier than most other retail businesses to socially distance from others, easier than many supermarkets certainly. Spring is the busiest time of year for the industry.",
