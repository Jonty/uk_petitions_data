        "additional_details": "Office-based employees previously had access to pool cars. Now that home working is being enforced/encouraged and as a result of the successes of home working for many businesses, this model will now long continue. Employees requiring pool cars to undertake their jobs either have to inefficiently drive from their homes daily to collect a pool car and return it later to avoid being subject to taxation. This is a real drain on small businesses and an unnecessary environmental impact.",
        "background": "Abolish company car tax for pool cars that are not based at a company's premises. Cars that are sign-written, fitted with trackers and where they are not the employees only vehicle can be evidenced that they are solely for company use and there is no benefit in kind.",
