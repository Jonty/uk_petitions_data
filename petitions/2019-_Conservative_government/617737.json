        "additional_details": "This has detrimentally affected pet owners in their ability to travel to and around the EU with their pet. Many people consider their pet to be an important member of their families. The change in status of the UK for pet travel means that for many families the opportunity to travel with their pet is now out of reach financially as the cost for an Animal Health Certificate (AHC) can be \u00a3200 to \u00a3300, whereas the cost of a pet passport was around \u00a390 and would be good for 28 trips to the EU.",
        "background": "Since the UK left the EU pet passports issued in England, Scotland and Wales are no longer valid for pet travel within the EU. There are many other countries that are not EU members but still benefit from being able to travel with their pets, using a passport issued in their own country.",
