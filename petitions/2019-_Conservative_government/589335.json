        "additional_details": "For too many years, rape victims and survivors have been let down by the entire justice system - the police, the CPS and juries - who have all demonstrated victim blaming and rape myth mind sets when making their decisions.  This has had traumatising and life altering outcomes for the victims and survivors.  Rape has been decriminalised in the UK. We demand justice for those whose historic cases have been dropped and we want to see rapists brought to trial.",
        "background": "The government\u2019s unreserved apology to failed rape victims and survivors is but a baby step. Cabinet ministers have said they are \u201cdeeply ashamed\u201d but they must now take action and review the bad decisions made by the CPS.  We are calling for all rape cases to be reopened and re-evaluated.",
