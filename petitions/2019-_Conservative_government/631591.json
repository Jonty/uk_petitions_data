        "action": "Amend the British Museum Act 1963 so as to enable the repatriation of artefacts.",
        "additional_details": "The Elgin Marbles rightfully belong to Greece. The Marbles' removal from the Parthenon in the early 19th century together with their placement in the British Museum reflect nothing other than ruthless imperialism. It is highly objectionable and unfortunate that the Trustees of the British Museum, by virtue of the British Museum Act, have the ability to ignore the continuation of this injustice. Now is the time to change the law so as to facilitate the Marbles' return.",
        "background": "The British Museum Act 1963 does not make provision for the widely supported permanent return of the Elgin (Parthenon) Marbles to Greece. In the name of justice and decency, Parliament must respond to the British public's calls for the Marbles' repatriation by amending the Act.",
