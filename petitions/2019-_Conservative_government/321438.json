        "additional_details": "The current on-line booking market is extremely uncompetitive, dominated by a small number of companies, which has resulted in a significant number of complaints. Having a government-funded system should bring accountability and restore the reputation of the UK accommodation sector and ensure the country can thrive and the resorts and destinations will have funds to adapt to new challenges in a positive manner.",
        "background": "In order to support the UK economy as we recover from COVID 19 and other economic pressures affecting the UK Economy, we believe there is a need for a government-funded online booking platform which freely connects to accommodation properties without the need to change their existing provider.",
