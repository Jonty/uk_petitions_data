As well as this, it provides an income to thousands and is home to hundreds of dedicated clubs, many of which are from the poorest and most deprived areas of this country.\r\n\r\nThese individuals and clubs heavily rely on regular forms of paying spectators to attend live boxing. From 90,000 fans at a stadium, to 90 people at a club show, no audience in attendance has had a hugely negative impact and will continue to do so.",
