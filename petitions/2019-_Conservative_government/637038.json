        "additional_details": "When wholesale gas prices soared in 2022, consumer gas prices increased. So did electricity prices as it cost more buy the gas burned to fuel electrical generation. But a kWh, is a kWh, is a kWh - so big energy producing solar got to sell their energy at the new market rate (though it cost no more to produce) and benefited from huge profits.\r\n \r\nPaying market rate will help with cost of living and promote solar installation. I believe that It is in accordance with free market principles and it is morally correct.\r\n",
