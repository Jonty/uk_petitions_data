        "additional_details": "A lot of students have 42 to 51 week contracts with our student accommodations. Some started in October and had over a month of Christmas holiday, There were 6 weeks worth of strikes. Now the universities are shut. We still have to pay for a room until our contracts have finished (baring in mind a majority of students went home due to this hard time). A lot of students feel like they haven\u2019t been attending enough to be in \u00a318k (maximum) debt, also give out free money to student accommodations.",
        "background": "As we all know there has been crisis due to corona virus. Government is helping full-time, part-time and self employed, with this hard time. How about university students gain something back? We shouldn\u2019t be paying for \u2018other or more\u2019 expenses if we aren\u2019t attending to uni or student accommodations",
