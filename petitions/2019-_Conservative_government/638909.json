Developers can appeal against planning obligations, and appeals are considered on the basis of whether the evidence indicates that the current cost of building out the entire site (at today\u2019s prices) is at a level that would enable the developer to sell all the market units on the site at a rate of build out evidenced by the developer, and make a competitive return to a willing developer and a willing landowner.\r\n\r\nIt's not clear whether you want the process for appealing against affordable housing obligations to be changed, or removed.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
