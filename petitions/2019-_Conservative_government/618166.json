        "action": "Increase funding to allow support for BPD patients to be more accessible.",
        "additional_details": "BPD is one of the most underfunded and misunderstood mental health disorders, even though a large population of people (2%) are estimated to suffer with BPD. This means that 2% of our population is not receiving the quality of care they deserve. As well as this, due to the lack of public awareness, those with BPD suffer a huge amount of stigmatisation from both society and healthcare professionals alike. I believe if we invest in BPD services, we can improve quality of life for those with BPD",
        "background": "The government needs to invest in services for those with BPD to make them more accessible through funding. Every trust should have a dedicated NHS team that has the training and skills to be able to support those who suffer with BPD. Until then we are failing a large mass of people every day.",
