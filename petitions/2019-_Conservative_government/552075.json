        "additional_details": "The parking companies fine people that genuinely don't breach there guidelines, make it difficult to appeal and then damage peoples credit score if they don't agree with there appeal. This industry should not exist to the private domain and should only be managed by people without the biased incentive to hand out penalties and fines.",
        "background": "Stop the issuing of parking fines from small parking control companies on little stretches of private land that are on or near publicly accessible roads, shops, business or otherwise. Solely private parking, surrounded by private land not immediately adjacent to public land should be monitored.",
