        "additional_details": "We want legislation to be introduced that results in the automatic dismissal of police officers who are convicted of criminal offences. The officers could, if they wish, re-apply. This removes the huge public cost of misconduct hearings and puts the burden onto the convicted officers to consider reapplying for a job in the police where their criminal convictions would be considered as part of the application process.",
        "background": "When a police officer is found guilty of a criminal offence, the police then have to pursue misconduct proceedings to dismiss them. Given the high burden of proof required for a criminal conviction, we believe police officers found guilty of a criminal offence should be dismissed automatically.",
