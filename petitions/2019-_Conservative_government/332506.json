        "additional_details": "For 10 weeks we clapped at 8pm every Thursday to thank our NHS heroes, but actions speak louder than words. \r\nRemoving the interest on our student loans removes a huge burden on medical professionals and might even increase the numbers entering the (understaffed) profession especially from the working class.\r\nUltimately by the time we pay off our loan, we will be paying more than double the initial capital. For a cohort of people who dedicate their lives to caring for others, this is wrong.",
        "background": "It takes 5/6 years to train a doctor, with each year costing \u00a39000. Interest is charged from the day you take out your loan in your first year of study, the final bill ever increasing, and unaffordable. Instead of clapping, the government should waiver the interest on student loans for NHS workers.",
