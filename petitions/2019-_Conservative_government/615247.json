        "additional_details": "Public transport is unreliable and doesn\u2019t take us everywhere and for those parents/guardians that work full time they make struggle to get their child where they need to be. If young people can drive a moped at 16, why not a car too?\r\nSome say that driving a car is safer than a motorcycle due to the fact you have air bags, 4 wheels and a seatbelt to add that protection. Not only that, data from a few years ago shows that the risk of death for a motorcyclist is roughly 57 times greater than that for a car occupant, so young people are safer in cars than on motorcycles.",
        "background": "Many 16 years olds are just starting to get jobs. They can\u2019t always rely on parents/guardians or public transport to take them where they want to be. Therefore lowering the driving age should give them that independence and maturity.",
