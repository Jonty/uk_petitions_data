Please amend the mobility laws to go 15mph.",
        "background": "As a disabled person with a more modern mobility scooter with a speed capability of 15mph it would be good if we could update the law of the maximum speed to 15mph. Going at 8mph on the same mobility scooter is taking too long for many of us, we can\u2019t take them on bus or train so please look into it",
