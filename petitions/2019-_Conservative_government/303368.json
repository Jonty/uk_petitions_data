This includes the elderly, the sick and the families of these people. Persons with asymptomatic COVID-19 can spread the virus, therefore there is no assurance possible that Cancer patients are not being treated by a clinician with the virus when being administered intravenous Chemotherapy. Administration is inherently less than 2 meters.",
        "background": "Presently there's no requirement for Nurses to wear surgical masks when administrating life saving Chemotherapy Drugs as part of Cancer Treatment therapy. Cancer patients during treatment fall into the category of immunosuppressed and can self isolate but they cannot avoid a clinician's cough.",
