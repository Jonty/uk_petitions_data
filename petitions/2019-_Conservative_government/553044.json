        "additional_details": "It is inequitable to charge Non-EU nationals considerably high fees than EU nationals. UK came out of European Union officially on 31 January 2020 and therefore everyone must be treated equally and no citizens should be given special treatment. One of the UK social pillar is 'equality and justice for everyone' and hence UK Government should impose this amendment in the permanent settlement application fees with complete transparency.",
        "background": "The UK Government should increase fees for EU nationals permanent settlement applications after 31 December 2020. EU nationals do not have to pay for permanent residence applications while Non-EU nationals have to pay \u00a32,389 to apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain. These fees should be equalised.",
