Yet as shown in a recent report by the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (Speech and language therapy during and beyond COVID-19) too many people have not been able to access the speech and language therapy they need during the COVID-19 pandemic, making their lives worse in a number of ways, including their mental health.
