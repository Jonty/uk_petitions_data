        "action": "Refund University Fees or offer an additional semester to International students",
        "additional_details": "Indian & non-EU students pay nearly 3 times more in their fees. Many come from a modest background; hence they supplement their expenses & finance their university fees through part-time jobs; many of such jobs have been lost. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, universities are now asking for full payment of fees for the summer term. This is in addition to the already paid spring semester fees; a semester which has moved online with far below standard experience.\r\n\r\nGiven this crisis, we have filed for this petition",
        "background": "Given the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, we request the universities to waive the 2020 summer term fees and pay back 30% of the spring term fee for the Indian students. If not, we request universities to offer an additional semester of study to International students",
