        "additional_details": "Due to COVID 19, students education has been compromised. 2021 summer exams have now been cancelled. However for those who should be taking GCSEs in 2022, it has been hard to teach yourself at least 1 years worth of GCSE content. Therefore, by having the courses half coursework, students will be able to level out their workload. In addition to this, if 2022 exams get cancelled due to COVID 19, students will be awarded grades regarding the coursework they have completed and not just classwork.",
