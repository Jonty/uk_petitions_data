        "action": "Abolish the TV licence fee and publicly funded subsidy of the BBC",
        "additional_details": "BBC has given a one-sided presentation of COVID19 science. Minimal airtime of evidence that lockdown has not helped prevent deaths. Little/no analysis of shortcomings of Imperial College study (eg no peer review) upon which lockdown is based, or poor disease modelling track record of scientist who wrote it. Given the incalculable lasting damage to economy/society, failure of BBC to provide balanced coverage amounts to gross dereliction of duty and must lead to forfeiture of licence fee revenue.",
        "background": "We demand an end to public funding of the BBC, which during the COVID19 outbreak has become a mouthpiece for the government stance on the perceived need for draconian restrictions on civil liberties, and has completely failed in its stated objective of \u201cachieving due impartiality in all its output.\u201d",
