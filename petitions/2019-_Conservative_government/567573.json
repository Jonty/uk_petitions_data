        "additional_details": "In Lancashire particularly in areas like Accrington, Nelson in Pendle and Blackburn taxi fares are so low starting at \u00a31.50; that it is making it impossible for the taxi drivers to earn a reasonable wage. This is causing more working tax credit claims being made due to very low earnings. The bosses and owners of the taxi companies do not do anything to change this. They are charging drivers a lot for car rental and for pda\u2019s that send jobs to the drivers, and are not affected by the low fares.",
        "background": "Set a minimum price for a taxi fare and guidelines that have to be followed when pricing taxi fares. Have local Council\u2019s overseeing that these guidelines are followed.",
