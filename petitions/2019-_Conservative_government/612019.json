We therefore believe that the government is not doing all it can to eradicate the disgusting conditions that many people go through. Also, it is clear that without good housing people very easily fall into the cycle of committing crimes, so it is vital that to combat the root of the problem the government must put more effort and time into our citizens' homes.",
