You can find out more about this legislation here: https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9747/\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petitions, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nStop housing asylum seekers who entered the UK illegally in hotels: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/628324\r\n\r\nHold a referendum on how many asylum seekers the UK accepts: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/634785\r\n\r\nIncrease support for homeless people: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/631032\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling on the Government to increase funding for the building of new local authority housing. If you want to start a new petition you'll need to provide your full name."
