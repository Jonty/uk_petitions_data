On 22/4/17 he ordered a chicken burger at a restaurant, explained his allergies to the server & with no other info on the menu, was assured it was safe. However, the chicken was marinated in buttermilk, to which he was very allergic. He instantly knew something was wrong & 45 minutes later he collapsed & died having suffered a massive anaphylactic reaction. We aim to prevent future deaths.",
