        "additional_details": "The UK Government and/or Parliament should halt the proposed reduction in the size of the already small British Army. Both should ensure the Army is properly staffed and has the equipment and support it deserves and requires to support the UK's interests.\r\n\r\nTo be able to deploy appropriately and realistically deter our adversaries the above is vital. Just as important is the need to remain credible with our allies and internationally as a strong and independent nation.",
        "background": "To stop the cut to the Regular British Army. While talking about future threats and realigning we cannot leave the Army understaffed. Especially at a time of constant global deployments, the strain on the Army is significant, particularly with the concept of forward deployments.",
