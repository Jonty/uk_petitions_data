        "action": "All Primary school children should receive free school meals",
        "additional_details": "However, the cost-of-living crisis means that many families, who fall out of this remit, are struggling to give their children a hot meal.\r\n\r\nWe must look beyond the cost and consider the enormous benefits to our young people.  There is a direct link between children's diets and their educational attainment, and therefore free school meals are vital.\r\n\r\nWhen our government says there is no money, or that such a policy is unaffordable: It is a lack of pollical will and not a lack of money.\r\n\r\nOur children deserve this free school meal provision. If the government is serious about supporting growth, this should start with helping our children. \r\nPlease sign and share this petition if you agree.\r\nThank you!",
        "background": "Currently, only children whose families are on less than \u00a37400 a year, and are in receipt of universal credit, are entitled to free school meals.\r\n \r\nIt has been estimated that it would cost 950 million to provide universal free school meals.",
