Not everyone who does not have a consistent income wants to stay in the UK illegally or at all.  Keeping parents away from children and potentially breaking up families is beyond wrong. We do not look back at life and remember what we bought but the memories we made. This is time we will NEVER get back. This should never happen to anyone and it is discriminatory.",

My partner was denied a visa and since has not met our son who is now nearly two years old.",
