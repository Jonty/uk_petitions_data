        "additional_details": "We hear so many stories of children being groomed online via these apps on a weekly basis.\r\nIt is too easy for children to gain access. I feel all social media platforms should bring into force of using National Insurance numbers as proof of age to access these apps. All children under the age of 16 shouldn't be able to access these apps by means of a fake date of birth, that's too easy and unsafe.\r\nI put forward to the government to change these rules and implement NI Numbers as proof of age.",
        "background": "Social media apps such as Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok and Facebook are far too easy for young children to access by inputting a fake date of birth.\r\nThese platforms are far to young for children and too dangerous.\r\nI would like the government to put forward the input of NI numbers as proof of age.",
