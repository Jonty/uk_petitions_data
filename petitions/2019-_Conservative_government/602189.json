The more unvaccinated people there are on the planet, the greater the risk a new variant that is resistant to vaccines will emerge.\r\n2. Many countries in the world can't get vaccines because we (rich countries) pushed the price up & have most of the stock\r\n3. Binning vaccines under these circumstances is deeply immoral",

We got a life back; Fab!\r\nThe current policy seems to be, if we can't use doses before they go out of date: bin them.\r\nPlease donate them instead to countries who don't have the means to get vaccines doses.",
