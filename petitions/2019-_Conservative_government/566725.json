        "action": "Make GCSE exams go ahead",
        "additional_details": "Many students (such as myself) simply will not pass their GCSEs unless their exams go ahead. This will protect immense amounts of children's futures and save people from unemployment, poverty, homelessness, and many more issues. Covid is temporary, the lives that will be ruined by the cancellation of exams are not. Exams are supposed to test the memory and recallation of knowledge, however teacher assessed grades do not do that at all, it brings teacher bias into the situation aswell.",
        "background": "GCSE exams must go ahead in controlled settings and made open-book and easier to account for missed time in schools.",
