        "additional_details": "We believe that the Police Service is underfunded, prioritised to focus on matters that were never within the remit of the Service when it was created as a civilian force, operating with the consent of the community it policed. Policing has moved so significantly away from public consent due to political and \u201cpopular\u201d non-police trends that it no longer has public confidence. The Police Service as it is led, trained and operated is no longer fit for purpose and needs a thorough overhaul.",
        "background": "The last Royal Commission on Criminal Justice took place in 1991 and was published in 1993. Since then, policing has faced some major internal challenges, such as underfunding and understaffing, all while adapting to combat the new, more complicated threats that the sector faces in the digital age.",
