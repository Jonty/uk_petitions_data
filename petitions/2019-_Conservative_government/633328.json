        "additional_details": "Knife crime appears to be on the up and not just in major cities but in towns and villages as well. It is almost as if youngsters see it as \u2018trendy\u2019 now to possess a blade.\r\nOnly through harsher sentences will they start to see sense. Suspended sentences and fines/community orders for possession of a blade aren't a big enough deterrent, and neither are the light sentences for wounding and attempted murder with a knife.\r\nIf changes aren\u2019t made soon this is only going to get worse.",
        "background": "For too long now people are getting away with light sentences when it comes to knife crime, including murder and attempted murder.\r\nI propose that anyone caught in possession of a blade should be handed a 2 year custodial sentence.\r\nFor wounding/attempted murder - 10 years\r\nAnd murder - 25 years",
