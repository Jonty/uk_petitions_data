There has been no firm comment on how hard it is for lawyers to continue trying to work as normal in this situation which is far from normal and to try to meet Directions and prepare for Trials.

For Trials currently listed over 12 weeks to be vacated and for a blanket stay, perhaps by way of an overriding Practice Direction, to relieve pressure currently placed on lawyers to meet Directions",
