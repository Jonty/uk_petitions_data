This is leading to people getting them selves into debt and causing the family to live in poverty. Or parents make the decision not to go back to work, this will make it harder to get back to work when the children are older. \r\nParents that want to work should be supported with this payment. Being in work helps support the family, improves mental health and creates good role models for children.",
