        "additional_details": "Currently, the ownership/carrying/use of pepper spray by common citizens is banned under Section 5(1)(b) of the Firearms Act 1968, & carries the same penalties as carrying lethal weapons despite being non lethal. \r\n\r\nSelf defence aids that are currently available on the market, such as rape alarms, or Eveaid, are not sufficient enough to prevent or stop attackers in certain situations.\r\n\r\nLegalising pepper spray under licence would help prevent potential misuse of the product",
        "background": "Legalise the ability to carry pepper spray as a self defence aid only, under licence, so that people are able to feel safer in situations where they may be at increased risk of assault.",
