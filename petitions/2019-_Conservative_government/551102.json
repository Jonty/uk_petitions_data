Moreover free mixing with no masks will increase the likelihood of the virus being spread through the population rapidly, impacting our livelihood and delaying the possibility for our lives to return back to normal.",
        "background": "Make masks mandatory for children and teachers whilst inside as well as for the carers when they pick up the children to help battle the rapid transmission of the virus. Furthermore enforce temperature checks and ensure children, carers and teachers are following hygiene protocols in schools.",
