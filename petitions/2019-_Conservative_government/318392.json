        "additional_details": "Following the models of countries already using formulas, property/assets/financial instruments acquired or set up before the marriage are excluded. Inheritance should also be excluded. The divorce settlement should look at gains or losses during the marriage i.e. from the date of the marriage up to the date of separation or filing of the divorce. Large assets acquired during the marriage should be sold to minimise disputes. Assets/financial instruments should be declared before the marriage.",
        "background": "It is estimated that 42% of marriages in the UK will end in divorce. The UK should follow the examples set by other countries and create a formula based on the \u201cspoils of the marriage\u201d so that divorce settlements can be simplified, reducing undue stress, legal costs and valuable court time.",
