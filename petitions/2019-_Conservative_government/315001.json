It would work by using a specific model for each mode of transport.\r\n\r\nThe Government should do it to ensure that the 2019 net zero emissions by 2050 target is achieved. Parliament should be taking a lead on issues like this. This would enable the public to see what MPs have been emitting while carrying out their work and gives them the opportunity to scrutinise or praise our politicians. Inevitably, this will lead to a reduction in carbon emissions by MPs. If the country is going to be carbon neutral by 2050 then our policy makers need to be the ones taking the first steps.",
