        "additional_details": "Climate change is an existential threat to our world and to business as normal. Pursuing business as normal with countries that are not engaging positively with the impact of climate change will severely impact the well being of everyone and the GDP of all countries. It is irresponsible to reward and encourage countries that deny climate change or are not engaging with pollution reduction with trade deals. As the UK wants to be a global leader on climate change, these deals should not be made.",
