        "action": "Cancel plans to ban conversion therapy",
        "additional_details": "We believe banning conversion therapy infringes on religious freedoms, the liberty for conversion therapists to do their jobs without Government intervention, and the right for LGBT people to decide for themselves whether they want to have it. We believe that the Government's statements that the practice is \"coercive and abhorrent\" are incorrect and deeply unfair. I am not suggesting that the Government allows \"corrective rape\". But conversion therapy, including supportive prayer, should be allowed.",
        "background": "In 2018, the UK Government promised to end conversion therapy. Last summer the current Government confirmed this commitment, and to even provide funds to LGBT people impacted by it. I want the Government to cancel these plans. Conversion therapy should remain completely legal for all ages.",
