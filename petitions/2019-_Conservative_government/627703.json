        "additional_details": "Because the government have given Yemen \u00a31 billion in aid but is reported to have \r\nlicensed \u00a36.5 billion worth of arms to the countries bombing it. This is completely contradicting the \u00a31 billion that the government has given but it is also going against the British Values that you as a government have set in place. So whilst we are trying to help we are mainly causing more issues affecting millions of peoples lives. this is why the government need to rethink the way they should help the crisis in yemen",
        "background": "Right now there is a massive humanitarian crisis going on in Yemen and we as a country are donating a bit of money but could be doing so much more to help. Right now there is 20.7 million people in Yemen who rely on humanitarian assistance to survive and 13 million are facing severe starvation",
