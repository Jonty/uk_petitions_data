Westminster Hall debates give MPs an opportunity to raise local or national issues and receive a response from a government minister. Any MP can take part in a Westminster Hall debate.\nWhat is a Question for short debate?\nFour short debates ('Questions for Short Debate') take place on Thursday every five weeks in Grand Committee of the House of Lords, away from the main Chamber. These debates are an opportunity for members of the House of Lords to discuss important current issues and draw the Government\u2019s attention to concerns. A Government minister or spokesperson responds at the end to the issues raised in the debate.\n",
