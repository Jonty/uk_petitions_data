        "action": "Ban drilling for fossil fuels and put more money into using renewable energy.",
        "additional_details": "The banning of drilling for fossil fuels will push more to our goals for the climate, In a few months COP26 will be held in Scotland to discuss the climate crisis; by then it may be more frequent in use meaning more research to improve renewable energy. Thirdly, I believe by doing this other world leaders will follow by example by doing the right thing for the Earth, climate change affects everyone and we need to actually do something longer term rather than short term.",
        "background": "We see destruction to the environment every day that passes. I believe by banning the drilling on fossil fuels, we can make a difference to what is happening to the Earth right now, alternatively we should use renewable energy and have the government use the technology we have right now.",
