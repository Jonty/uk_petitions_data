        "additional_details": "The attacker will be \u201cadvised\u201d not to contact the victim, if he does it can be logged as witness intimidation, or harassment - but that doesn\u2019t always stop attackers from reaching out, or getting someone to do it for them. The police cannot impose bail conditions to offer the victim protection, the victim is advised to seek legal help, which can cost around \u00a32,500 for a non molestation order.\r\n\r\nThe police do the very best they can, but the law should have more in place to protect the victim, bail conditions should cover the entire process before possible conviction.",
        "background": "Rape, sexual assault, domestic abuse. Just some of the cases in which evidence can take 6-12 months to investigate. Due to the time limits for bail, many are released under investigation without the conditions usually attached to bail. This offers very little legal protection to the victim.",
