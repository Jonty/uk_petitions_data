        "action": "Ban the sale of fireworks to the general public",
        "additional_details": "It is clear that fireworks have extreme adverse effects on pets, farm animals and wildlife. People suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder can be also affected by the unpredictable noises and people with autism can suffer from sensory overload. Fireworks are legally allowed to be set off several weeks prior to Guy Fawkes' Night, which causes an extended period of suffering for the aforementioned groups. Consider the ban of public sale to increase the attendance of public displays instead.",
        "background": "Not allow fireworks to be sold to the general public, only allow the sale to licensed firework display teams. \r\n\r\nHundreds of animals suffer for weeks with the general public allowed to purchase and set off fireworks in residential areas with no regard for animals' welfare and the distress caused.",
