        "additional_details": "This is an out-dated law that provides no benefit to the pet or its welfare. Besides this, people consider their pets to truly be family or companions. There are times when we need to take our pets abroad and putting them in the luggage causes serious anxiety to the animal.\r\nThe pick-up point for pets is often far from the terminal meaning the pet is left for hours longer than needed. \r\nThe pick-up point can close early holding your pet overnight. \r\nAirlines can loose the pet as its luggage.",
        "background": "Current law requires dogs/cats to travel as \u2018cargo\u2019 (under the plane) when entering the UK. We ask the government to change the law so that dogs & cats can travel in-cabin and aren\u2019t required to be manifest cargo. \r\nThe USA, EU & other nations allow in cabin travel. Lets bring our pets home in cabin",
