And the real kicker is that this allows nuisance calling companies to bypass the call blocking device you might have bought.\r\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t always done for devious reasons \u2013 some companies display a freephone number so you can call them back without being charged, but that needs controlling",

Call centres are using software to fool your phone\u2019s caller ID system to hide their real identity. This means they can make it look like they\u2019re calling from a mobile number, or from a local area code.",
