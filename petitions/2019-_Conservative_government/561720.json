        "additional_details": "Total transparency on the number of deaths that are from covid 19 and those that die with covid 19, classing someone who had covid, survived, but then sadly died from another cause within 28 days is misleading and should not be allowed, only those people who die from covid 19 should be counted, and the death rate should be adjusted once the information has come out to paint a clear true reflection on the number of deaths.",
        "background": "I want Parliament to get the figures for people who have died FROM COVID-19, and separate them from those who died with COVID-19, so we have a better understanding of it, people recovering from it, then 28 days later be killed in a car accident for example, should not be classed as a covid death.",
