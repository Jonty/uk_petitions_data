Under international human rights law states are also responsible for protecting human rights when people come within their jurisdiction or control.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about the compatibility of turning back migrants at sea with international law here: https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/is-turning-back-migrants-at-sea-compatible-with-international-law/\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling on the UK Government to withdraw from the international agreements creating the above obligations, and increase funding to patrol the UK's borders, if that's something you'd like to happen."
