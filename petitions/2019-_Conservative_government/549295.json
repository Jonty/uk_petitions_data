With no hard shoulder and suddenly have a family vehicle stop in front of you, stopping a 40t lorry doing 40-55mph is almost impossible. The worst are emergency laybys - too small for HGV's & breakdown vehicles and emergency response vehicle's unable to manoeuvre through traffic.\r\n \r\nRoadworks at present need to be finished first, then a detailed review over a meaningful period of time to see just how safe and practical they are.",
