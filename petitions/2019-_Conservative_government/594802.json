        "additional_details": "I and many dealers I have visited and people I have spoken to all agree that the current level of VAT on electric  vehicles should be removed all together or at the least reduced substantially to help encourage the early adoption of electric vehicles in the UK.",
        "background": "I believe the UK government needs to kick start adoption by improving the subsidiary on vehicles upto \u00a350000.  The small subsidiary already given on electric vehicles is clearly not enough to encourage early adoption, the government gives with one hand and takes back more in VAT in another.",
