This raises grave concerns for the future safety and protections of the fundamental rights of all people living in a post-Brexit UK.\r\n\r\nJohnson\u2019s government claims our basic rights will be protected, but they have repeatedly shown they cannot be trusted. The Convention affords us an independent authority to petition if our government seeks to violate our rights and freedoms.",
