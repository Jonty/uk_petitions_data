University owned halls are letting their residents out of the payment, as long as they have moved out before April 10th. So why are private halls not doing the same?\r\nThese students didn\u2019t ask for a global pandemic, forcing many of them to go home. Yet they\u2019re still being told they have to pay for accommodation they\u2019re not using.",
