        "action": "Re-open gyms closed due to second lockdown",
        "additional_details": "Compared to the initial lockdown, we have vast amounts of data to put forward the argument that gyms are incredibly low risk. Both UK active and safeACTIVE have released figures pertaining to around 80 million plus visits with just under 600 infections resulting in a 0.000007% rate of infection. For the positive mental, physical and emotional benefits as well as economic and financial impact too, I, among with many others, feel it's necessary to keep gyms open",
        "background": "I politely ask you to review the recent restrictions on gyms put in place due to the second lockdown. We are very aware of the links associated with exercise to both depression and physical health, with such a large emphasis on tackling obesity and mental health, it seems nonsensical to close again",
