        "additional_details": "We need change and we need a reduction in the fees that aren\u2019t justified. The definition of tuition fees, as seen on the UCAS website, is: \u201cTuition fees are charged by universities and colleges to cover key elements of your course and academic life, as well as core services related to students\u2019 wellbeing and experience on campus\u201d. No one can say that this definition is being met this year.",
