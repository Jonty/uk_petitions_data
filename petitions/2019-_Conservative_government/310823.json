        "additional_details": "After the chancellors announcement on Thursday 26th March regarding support for the self-employed during the covid19 pandemic, it became clear that the same support was not going to be offered to small owner managed limited companies. \r\n\r\nDividend income in these small owner managed companies will not be taken into account when calculating what support a director is eligible for. This is despite dividends being subject to both corporation tax and personal income tax.",
