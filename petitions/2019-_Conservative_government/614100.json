Some of these individuals are living angels, saving so many. It just really upset me to hear that they don't get training for mental health, considering the amazing job they do. I believe they should be entitled to this training, for the benefit of our police force, and our community, to ensure the best outcome.",
        "background": "Police are now assigned to mental health call outs in the community, without any mental health training. I couldn't believe this at first. This is quite poor considering, these amazing officers are doing everything they can to protect us, but how can they protect in areas they don't understand?",
