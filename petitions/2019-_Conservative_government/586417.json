        "additional_details": "If the government is serious about the move from petrol/diesel to electric cars then drivers need to know that when they get to a charger they are actually going to be able to park and access it. My local Tesco constantly has people just parked in the bays not charging because the bays are always close to the shop entrance. 1000's more chargers are going to be needed by 2030 and drivers need to be able to use them un-hindered.",
        "background": "As above really. Should carry a penalty of points on your licence and a fine. There are constantly pictures and stories online from people that want to charge their cars but cannot because someone in a petrol/diesel has blocked the charger. Offence wherever the public charger is.",
