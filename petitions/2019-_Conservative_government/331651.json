        "additional_details": "Driving theory test expires in 2 years but those who have been affected by the pandemic already have lost almost 5 months of their preparation time for practical test.People also, after 5 months lack of opportunity to practice on the car,need extra hours to back to their previous level and also because of the crowded test centers booking a practical test will be more challenging.So,most of the learners have stress of having to retake theory test as well.",
        "background": "we want the government to consider the chance of extension of 6 months for those who had a plan to get their driving practical test but have been affected by the pandemic .It is obvious that learning for practical test for most of people is a stressful and costly process .",
