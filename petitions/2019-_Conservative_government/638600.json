        "additional_details": "Some supported housing groups are at risk of closure. Elderly and vulnerable residents are frightened, and want to stay in the supported environment that the homes create for them.\r\n\r\nThe Government require that all privately rented homes and fuel poor homes achieve an EPC rating of C by 2030. We believe that for some supported housing groups this time frame is too short. In some cases, finances to carry out these upgrades have been impacted by economic circumstances and the covid pandemic. We also ask the government to provide funding for supported homes at risk of closure due to the costs of the energy efficiency upgrades.\r\n",
