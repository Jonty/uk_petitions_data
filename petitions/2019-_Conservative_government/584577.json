        "action": "Bring an end to horse slaughter in the UK",
        "additional_details": "The absence of Government intervention in horse welfare has led to ongoing equine crises. Over-breeding is a major cause of problems. The government needs to address this issue by limiting the number of foals born annually and promoting responsible and best practice standards on those who breed horses. Government regulation needs to address the racing and horse sports industries, specific breed societies as well as a focus on inexperienced individuals who lack horse management resources.",
        "background": "Unregulated horse breeding has led to an excessive number of equines in the UK. The result is the slaughter of thousands of horses each year. We call on the Government to introduce a licensing system that limits the number of equines who can be bred and ensures horses do not end up at slaughter.",
