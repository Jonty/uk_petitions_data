        "action": "Change the focus of Covid-19 testing from infection tests to antibodies tests.",
        "additional_details": "The immediate positive effect of testing for antibodies would be a better measure of a pandemic. We would know how many people were infected and recovered. Those already immune can then safely work with others, especially with the vulnerable members of our society. The first who should be tested for antibodies should be health workers, social workers, volunteers, teachers, police officers, etc. Once we have enough healthy and immune people we can restart economy.",
        "background": "It is crucial that while saving lives we also try to bring the economy back on track. With the current focus on testing for infection and isolating whole society it will take a very long time. If we started testing for antibodies i.e. those who are already immune they can go back to work.",
