        "additional_details": "The brown hare is an endangered species in the UK and numbers have dropped 80% in the last century. The law means the hare can be killed even through their breeding season which lasts from February until September. There used to be 4 million brown hares across the UK, the last estimate puts their population at around 700,000 and declining. It is estimated nearly half a million hares are killed by shooting each year. We need a change in the law to protect these magical and mystical animals.",
