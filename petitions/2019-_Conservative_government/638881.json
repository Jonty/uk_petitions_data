Why should the taxpayer pay for an issue which has been caused by privatised water companies when they have already invested in preventing this issue? The calamitous management of funds enabling the problem of sewage pollution to grow means they should be fully accountable for its resolution.",

Taxpayers money should have been better invested in infrastructure before to stop this problem. As this is entirely the fault of privatised water companies, this should come at their expense only.",
