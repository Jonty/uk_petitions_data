        "additional_details": "A Level and GCSE exams 2021 were cancelled due to the fact it was not safe nor fair to sit them. To then replace these with \u2018mini\u2019 internal exams defeats the object of cancelling exams in the first place and only adds more pressure to students who have already suffered from so much disrupted learning this academic year. The disparity within the nation in terms of online teaching given both last year and now means it would be unfair to put students against each other in any form of assessment.",
        "background": "The government should allow teacher predicted grades (as used last year) to allow for moderation in the case of cancelled exams; giving full \u2018trust\u2019 in teachers. If a student feels this grade is not representative, more work can be completed safely at home or the exam can be re-sat in November.",
