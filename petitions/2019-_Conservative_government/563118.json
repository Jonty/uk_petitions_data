        "additional_details": "Alternative fuels use current infrastructure, so more affordable for those on a low income. Making Batteries releases high emissions. Electric cars have impracticalities - long charging, lower range & fast charging leads to shorter battery life & expense.\r\nEVs are heavy, tyres wear faster, more tyre particle dust & road damage.\r\nSome can't charge near home. \r\nBiomethane is more biodiverse & can be made from waste reducing pollution.",
        "background": "Government should allow the sale & future development of cars running on cleaner fuels such as higher bioethanol content E12 up to E85, & CO2 neutral Biomethane to cut CO2 & other emissions. Allow the sale past year 2030 of these cars going forward to reduce battery waste & lower car production CO2.",
