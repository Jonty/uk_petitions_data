        "action": "Fund more specialist school places for children with special educational needs",
        "additional_details": "The Government is not funding enough specialist schools provision. It must fix the broken education system and the severe lack of special needs teachers, teaching assistants and schools. These children need our help and the support of a government that understands its duty of care to them. Specialist schools up and down this country are overworked, understaffed and full, and children are unable to receive the education and support they so desperately need and deserve.",
        "background": "The lack of spaces in specialist schools in parts of the country like the North East is affecting so many vulnerable children and their families. Specialist schools say they\u2019re full, how can the authorities not think something is seriously wrong and insist these children go to mainstream school?",
