There has also been a recent review into hospital food, you can find out more here: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-blueprint-for-better-hospital-food\r\n\r\nIf you believe that food received in hospital is inadequate, you could make a complaint:\r\nhttps://www.england.nhs.uk/contact-us/complaint/\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
