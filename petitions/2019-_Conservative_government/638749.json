If we could get the training into schools not only would it give people a better chance of survival should they ever become a victim to a knife but we believe it may also open up the youths' eyes to the horrific consequences of carrying knives and by making things more realistic it may prevent them carrying knives.",
        "background": "We want the Government to make bleed control training mandatory in all schools. Youths should be taught what to do in the event of a catastrophic bleed, how to use the equipment installed in a bleed control kit and what to do if that equipment wasn't available.",
