        "additional_details": "I feel that with the current situation going on in Ukraine, families are having to flee to other countries - the UK being one of many. The Government said they will donate \u00a3350 per Ukrainian family, regardless of their quantity. I feel this is too low, as a large family would need more funding, or maybe a small family needs more nappies due to a health issue. Either way, an extra one hundred and fifty pounds could seriously help out. It can allow you to do a big grocery shop or pay off a bill.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to increase the funding for Ukrainian refugees to \u00a3500 as this could help out a lot. Some families have babies, others might have 6 kids, and \u00a3350 may not be enough funding to support a family. To compare them, this sum could help do a huge grocery shop or something else.",

This is a scheme which awards \u00a3350 to people who are housing Ukrainian people or families seeking refuge. The \u00a3350 sum does not go directly to the refugee/s. \r\n\r\nYou could start a petition asking the Government to increase the \u00a3350 contribution for people who take part in \"Homes for Ukraine\" to \u00a3500 a month. Or you could start a petition asking the Government to give \u00a3500 to each person arriving from Ukraine as a refugee. \r\n\r\nYou can find out more about the Homes for Ukraine scheme here: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/homes-for-ukraine-scheme-launches"
