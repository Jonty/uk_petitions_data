Processed meat is also high in salt which we are trying to reduce in diets nationally. Processed meat is cheaper and is being consumed more with limited budgets (Kantar). If we banned processed meat from nursery and school menus, children who still eat processed meat at home would have less of it in total. This ban would help reduce health inequalities and risk.",
