Our xl bully\u2019s are not to blame it\u2019s the the owners. That are using the breed as an accessory and not giving the dog any love or training. These people don\u2019t care about the dog all they care about is looking \u201cbig, hard and scary\u201d therefore they are actively training the dog to be aggressive to show off. All these attacks are no fault of the dogs only bad owners that should not be Allowed to own animals. Please sign and stop this beautiful soft and loving breed being banned",
