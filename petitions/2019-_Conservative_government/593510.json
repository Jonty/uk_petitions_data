        "additional_details": "Despite being Vaccinated and adhering to all social distancing issues this voracious virus still continues to run rampant on the health of a Long Covid sufferer making us more vulnerable to variants, and anecdotal reports show that booster vaccines will likely incapacitate us further along with reinfection making us more vulnerable and some who have even recovered will not feel safe enough to return to the work place immediately. Therefore we will need financial support going forward to survive.",
        "background": "Currently there is no clear pathway for financial support, along Covid has over 1 million in the UK too ill to work for an avg of 6 months according to ONS data (2021). We would like PIP type financial support which is currently being refused to often with housing and daily living costs required.",
