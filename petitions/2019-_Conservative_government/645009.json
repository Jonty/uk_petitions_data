Section 60 should be permanent, 24 hours a day 7 days a week, giving the police powers to stop and search whenever they see fit. Hopefully this will lower the amount of people carrying a knife/bladed article.\r\n \r\nWith the number of families who are living without loved ones due to knife crime and an increase in the amount of knife crimes across the UK something needs to be done. Police can only act on a section 60 for 24/48 hours after an incident, this needs to be permanent to give them more power to stop and search. We need to keep the public safe and I believe this will help.\r\n",
