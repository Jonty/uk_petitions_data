        "additional_details": "It is only right that this group of students are recompensed for their loyalty, dedication and service on the Covid-19 frontline when called on by the Government. They are the only group of students not to receive a bursary or the \u00a35000 free nursing grant afforded to all other groups. This is unfair and they should be rewarded.",
        "background": "September 2017 nursing students are the only group in recent times that have not received a penny from Government. They are now to work on the frontline against the Covid-19 virus for the benefit the UK. Recognise this by giving them \u00a35000 announced in the budget for all other groups of nurses",
