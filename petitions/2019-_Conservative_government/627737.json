We need this law to avoid a lot of cables from extension cords running from households to charge electric cars. \r\nCharging at the price of the household should be 4.5 kW, if more power is needed, then the owners of electric cars will pay a higher price, but the minimum price should be available to every owner of an electric car near his living area.",
        "background": "Create a law, which will regulate the pricing policy of charging station operators in the living area. This law should protect the rights of electric car owners who want to charge their cars near the house and should not fall under the influence of charging operators.",
