        "additional_details": "With banks using Covid to accelerate branch closure programmes, in turn nudging retailers and restaurants to refuse cash, around 10 million people will struggle \u2013 the poorest use it to budget to prevent falling into debt, those in rural and remote communities struggle with poor broadband and mobile connectivity, for women in controlling and abusive relationships cash might be their only chance of escape and the elderly are at risk from becoming isolated in this digitised world.",
        "background": "As reported by The Telegraph, Britain is 'becoming\u00a0a cashless society\u00a0against the public\u2019s will'.
