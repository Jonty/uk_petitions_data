Students will have to sort out their next steps in a much shorter amount of time than expected. Parents and teachers will have to deal with the stress of results for a lot longer.\r\n\r\nWe haven't been given a reason for the results to come out this late. We need answers. Why make students revise, yet again, for exams they may not sit?",
        "background": "The Department of Education said that they would try to give our GCSE and A-Level results as early as possible, with the end of July being a target. \r\nA few days ago, they decided to go against this and keep the results days the same. This seems to disadvantage everyone apart from the exam boards",
