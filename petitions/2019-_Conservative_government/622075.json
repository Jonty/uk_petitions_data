Government are failing such citizens; innocent victims in the UK's cladding scandal. 'Cladding prisoners' can't sell flats till cladding is remediated and until EWS1 forms issued, which can take years. Costs can be unrelenting: waking watch, legal, contingencies. Getting a new home is made more difficult with 2nd home SDLT surcharge; exempt for them!",

Flat owners burdened by unsafe cladding can't acquire EWS1 forms & can't sell till cladding is remediated. These owners unfairly face a SDLT surcharge if they buy a new home.",
