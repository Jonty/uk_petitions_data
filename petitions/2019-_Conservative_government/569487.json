        "additional_details": "EU students who have lived, studied and worked in the UK for years should be able to progress in their education without having to leave the country. A significant increase in tuition fees will prevent most EU students from accessing education in the UK. British universities pride themselves in being inclusive and open to all, but equality of opportunity and diversity of student background cannot be achieved unless education becomes affordable for all.",
        "background": "We request access to home fees for EU students with pre-settled status starting from the 2021/22 academic year.\r\nEU students with pre-settled status were promised access to home fees to continue their education, but now we are finding out that pre-settled students will have to pay up to 30k in fees.",
