        "additional_details": "They have eventually after two years reopened spousal & family visas, so logically, you would reopen flights.\r\n\r\nIt is far too costly & time consuming to take redirected flights from the UK to Europe and then onto China. Flights can cost thousands of pounds, this is just crazy. Reopening direct flights from London to China would surely ease the time constraints, bring down the flight prices drastically, and allow more people to return or reunite with families, loved ones and partners.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese government have just reopened spousal and family visas, so the next logical step is direct flights.",
