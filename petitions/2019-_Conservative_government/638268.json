        "additional_details": "Mainstream and specialist schools, and pupil referral units (to name a few) have the right to use reasonable force (which is normally used to control or restrain) on young people, to prevent them from hurting themselves or others, from damaging property or causing disorder.\r\n \r\nThis can be used without parental consent and often is used on children with autism and other SEN. Children as young as 6 with autism are routinely being restrained by adults and this can contribute to ongoing trauma into adulthood.\r\n \r\nTherapeutic approaches must be at the forefront of supporting these children.\r\n",
        "background": "Review Section 93 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 which provides all school staff with the power to use reasonable force to prevent pupils from hurting themselves or others, from damaging property or causing disorder. We believe the law should give priority to a therapeutic approach.",
