Banks have gone as far as they can with warning customers, but the scammers have come up with new ways of tricking or panicking customers to disregard these warnings. Banks have unintentionally contributed to the growth of these scams by allowing very large payments to be made almost instantly. Many customers do not need this facility, and security is more important to them. The customer should be given a choice and sometimes needs to be saved from himself.",
