This law could have prevented this happening.\r\n \r\nGiven the prevalence of knife crime we desperately need an intervention by means of licensing and the deterrent of a minimum sentence for carrying an unlicensed knife.\r\n \r\nA deterrent is important, anyone carrying a knife may use it and cause serious harm or death.\r\n \r\nThe Government are not taking knife crime seriously enough, we cannot continue to bury our children, the age of stabbings is getting younger.\r\n \r\nThe law needs to change.",
        "background": "The Government should require people who have a reasonable excuse to carry a knife to apply for a licence, with strict minimum sentences for carrying a knife without a licence, equivalent to those for carrying an unlicensed firearm.",
