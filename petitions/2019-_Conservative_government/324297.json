        "additional_details": "Throughout the Covid-19 Crisis more people than ever have turned to growing their own vegetables. Thus, the \"lottery\" of possible contamination in manure and compost, whereby whole crops can be lost and gardens and allotments ruined for years, should be mitigated by a ban on the sale of aminopyralid and clopyralid in the UK. If we are to move towards a more sustainable relationship with nature, and a more secure and healthy relationship to our food, such cases of contamination must be avoided.",
        "background": "I would like the Gov. to ban these herbicides due to increasing cases of contamination in manure and compost. These herbicides can ruin gardens and allotments for many years as the chemicals persist in manure and compost. My allotment has recently been contaminated, and many crops have failed.",
