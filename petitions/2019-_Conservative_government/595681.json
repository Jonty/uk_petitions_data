        "additional_details": "We believe that this law will punish the Afghan population. In the UK there is a sizeable Afghan community and they will be cut off from their homeland, where their families still live. There are also British Afghans who have invested in Afghanistan over the last 20 years and cannot just leave their businesses and come back to the UK. We therefore request that such blanket punishment of the whole population is avoided and if there are any concerns regarding security, that Afghan nationals and those who have Afghan lineage must be exempted from this law.",
