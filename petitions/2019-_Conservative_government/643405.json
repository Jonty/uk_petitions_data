They are also entitled to become the administrator of the estate, and so have total control over funeral and burial arrangements. We believe this is not fair.\r\n \r\nSpouses should not automatically inherit under intestacy rules when a conditional divorce order has been granted. In these circumstances the spouse should only have the same rights as a divorcee. They should also not be entitled to become the administrator of the estate, and so have the power to decide on funeral and burial arrangements.\r\n",
