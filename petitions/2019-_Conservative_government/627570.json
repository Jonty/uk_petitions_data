        "additional_details": "Working can be difficult alongside studying. To account for the cost of living, approx 59% of students work to make ends meet. Although, we as students can apply for the HC2 certificate, which would help with prescription charges - more often than not we are not eligible for this. In fact, for those students that don\u2019t claim maintenance loan, this unclaimed loan is added towards their income. We thus call for the government to support students and make us exempt from prescription charges!",
        "background": "Exemptions for medication charges include being over 60, being in full time education up until 18 and income support. With this, university students over the age 18 are still expected to pay for medication. This seems rather unfair since we are paying an annual fee of \u00a39250 to fund higher education.",
