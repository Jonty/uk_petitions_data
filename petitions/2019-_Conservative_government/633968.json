        "additional_details": "There needs to be more funding to support people suffering from an eating disorder, which can be deadly. Early intervention is essential to tackling eating orders successfully, but currently too many do not receive support early enough. We believe more training is also needed for medical professionals to ensure they are able to diagnosis and make suitable referrals for people suffering from eating disorders. It is estimated that around 1 in 50 people in the UK suffer with an eating disorder. Support for sufferers, and their families, needs to be improved.",
        "background": "There is not nearly enough support for people with eating disorders, or their families. Many people struggle to access support, including through Community Eating Disorder Service (CEDS). More funding is needed to ensure that individuals with eating disorders and their families are supported.",
