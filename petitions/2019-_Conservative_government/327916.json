        "additional_details": "We need to limit the number of imported cases of Covid-19 into the UK to avoid a second or third wave and limit overwhelming the NHS. The 14 day quarantine doesn't seem to be deterring people from making non-essential journeys to the UK and people are openly not quarantining. Also ban international travel for UK citizens and UK residents to avoid Covid-19 being brought back in as some people are still making non-essential journeys.",
        "background": "Only allow UK citizens and UK residents to return to UK and cargo deliveries to enter UK (such as food, medication, post). Close all borders to non UK citizens and non UK residents until the Covid-19 alert levels in the UK are at 2 or 1 or when vaccine is ready, whichever is soonest.",
