        "additional_details": "Mass balloon and lantern releases are becoming more and more common as part of funerals or remembrance ceremonies.\r\n\r\nReleasing balloons and lanterns into the air ultimately means that they end up in fields or the sea, where they are ingested by animals, causing them to suffocate or die with them in their stomachs.\r\n\r\nCharities such as the Marine Conservation Society have published extensive evidence of the harm that releasing balloons into the environment can do.",
        "background": "This petition proposes that the act of balloon and lantern releases should be made illegal on the basis that it knowingly harms the environment and ecosystems.",
