        "action": "End the use of horses for crowd control by police in the UK",
        "additional_details": "In London on 06/06/20 police rode into a protest on horses. A police officer was unseated from a horse as the horse charged past traffic lights which collided with the officer. The horse then ran loose through crowds of people which is highly dangerous and can result in injury or death, to both the horse and people. This is an archaic use of animals and it is time we left it in the past. Other protests went ahead across the UK without police mounted on horses, so it is not necessary.",
        "background": "In light of recent events at London protests, it is clear that the use of horses by Police for crowd control purposes is dangerous and cruel. It is very distressing for the horses, charging at crowds of people only exacerbates the situation, and can cause injury to both police officers and crowds.",
