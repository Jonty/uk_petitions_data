        "additional_details": "Because the current legal sources only apply, in most cases, where a wrong has already taken or is taking place it leaves room for employers to unfairly discriminate against people for specific reasons such as gender and race at the initial stages of employment since it's more difficult to prove and challenge. Recognition that the mere use of words such as \u2018commit to have a more diverse workforce and reduce the pay gap\u2019 are not enough to address the issues of inequality in the UK workforce.",
        "background": "The government needs to set up legally enforceable rules and a body/organisation that will enforce the rules to ensure that UK companies become more diverse. Current laws and systems are clearly insufficient to address these inequalities and encourage more segregation between races and sexes.",
