        "action": "Include British Sign Language in the primary school curriculum",
        "additional_details": "BSL is used not just by those hard of hearing, but those with learning difficulties such as global development delay and autism. BSL is a British language and it stands to reason that this would be incredibly beneficial and logical for students in Britain to learn. It will pave the way for students who move on to become teachers to communicate with their students. It will reduce the amount of children being placed in SEN programmes purely due to a language barrier.",
        "background": "I would like the government to incorporate British Sign Language into the standard school curriculum. To provide funding for teachers to learn BSL and for schools to provide resources for students. At a minimum, poster boards with basic BSL on classroom walls to help include all students.",
