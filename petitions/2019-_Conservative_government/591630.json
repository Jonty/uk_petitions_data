They have put their lives and that of their families at risk and unfortunately many NHS staff lost their lives. We would like the hard work of the NHS staff during the pandemic to be acknowledged by dedicating a commemorative \u00a310 note and \u00a31 coin to the NHS. This way the efforts of healthcare workers will be remembered and the legacy of the work done by them will not be forgotten",
