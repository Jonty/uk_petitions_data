        "additional_details": "We want the Government to do this, as the curriculum is very Eurocentric at the moment despite the U.K. being so multicultural. It would also be a way of combatting racism within the system, as people will become more aware of black history.",

There\u2019s more to black history than just politicianry, we want pre-politicianry history to be taught. We want students to be taught about Africa before it was colonised.",
