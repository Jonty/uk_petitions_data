        "action": "Thank NHS nurses and frontline workers with inflation-busting pay rises as well.",
        "additional_details": "NHS has been struggling with crippling underfunding for years. It was almost at the point of collapse when the pandemic hit UK. During this crisis, no-one but the NHS workers made sure that this beautiful service serves the people of UK with their hard-work, determination, fearless patient care and unparalleled love for their communities. These heroes sacrificed the safety of their own families to make sure others get the best possible care. If they are ignored now, their morales will be shattered.",
        "background": "Having worked in one of the busy hospitals alongside nurses and other staff, I have witnessed first hand how all of them put their lives in danger caring for the nation. It seems only fair to award ALL of the NHS staff with inflation adjusted pay rise esp. the nurses who have gone above and beyond.",
