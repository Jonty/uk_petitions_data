        "action": "Scrap the proposed ban on new petrol and diesel cars",
        "additional_details": "If there is a ban on new diesel and petrol cars sold and only electric cars sold in UK then this will be violating our freedom, because electric cars are more expensive and running electric cars on long journeys will be more expensive.  Even if we are allowed to drive older diesel and petrol cars, this isn't good enough as cars overtime get harder to maintain. Diesel and petrol cars are fun driving with their nice engine sounds unlike electric cars which do not have much noise in comparison.",
        "background": "The Government plan to ban the sale of diesel and petrol cars by 2040 or even 2030. This is because of the goal of UK being carbon neutral by 2050. We believe this is not realistic and that electric cars are nowhere near as economic as diesel and petrol cars, so this ban would make driving expensive",
