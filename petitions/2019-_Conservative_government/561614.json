        "additional_details": "Whilst battery EVs are suitable for many scenarios they are not suitable for all. For families with no home-charging, or want to drive long distances with fast refill, towing, or needing larger family vehicles, fuel-cell cars offers an emissions-free solution. The ownership experience is no different to existing petrol or diesel vehicles. In the same way as government-backed schemes have kick-started solar/wind farms and home solar, the same mechanism will kick-start fuel-cell vehicle choice.",
        "background": "In order that people can choose an emissions-free vehicle without changing their existing lifestyle the government should support the conversion/installation of at least the first 100 garage forecourts nationwide.  A government grant available to the first 100 garages would encourage early adoption.",
