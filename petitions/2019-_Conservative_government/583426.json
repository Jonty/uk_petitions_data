        "additional_details": "Current council tax system is based on property valuations that are now almost 30 years old and therefore bear no resemblance to the realities of current house prices. An average home in Easington valued at \u00a388,000 could pay \u00a31,498.53 a year in council tax while an average home in Westminster valued at \u00a31.2m would pay \u00a31,127.07 a year \u2013 which is just 0.09% of the value of the property.",
        "background": "Property taxes must be reformed so that they are based on today\u2019s property values and homeowners\u2019 ability to pay. The current council tax system is a \u201cwealth tax\u201d on poorer parts of Britain and is in urgent need of a comprehensive overhaul.",

Your petition refers to reforms so that council tax is based on today\u2019s property values and homeowners\u2019 ability to pay, but it's not clear how this would work in practice.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petition, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nCap monthly Council Tax payments to no more than 8% of net income: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/579654"
