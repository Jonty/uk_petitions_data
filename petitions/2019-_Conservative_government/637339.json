        "additional_details": "The chicks are usually returned to the farm or provider to be dispatched. Females sometimes kept for egg laying but the boys always unwanted and culled.\r\n \r\nSome chicks are born ill or disabled as the eggs are not properly looked after and veterinary attention and adequate care is not normally provided.\r\n \r\nDeemed as educational, the children are not given the full educational story about the fate of these chicks they have been part of raising. We believe this is cruel to these animals and deceiving to the audience\r\n",
        "background": "We want the Government to ban egg hatching projects in educational settings. This is where eggs (usually chicken or duck) are placed in an incubator in a school room, nursery room, nursing home or similar with the view of being educational.",
