        "additional_details": "By removing legal protections for transgender people, the government would be sending out a message that their lives are worth less than others in our society.\r\n\r\nEveryone is born equal, whether they happen to be transgender or not. Everyone deserves dignity, opportunities and the ability to live a full life in society.\r\n\r\nRemoving trans rights would also set a dangerous precedent. How can any minority group feel truly protected under the Act, if they see one group have their rights taken away?",
        "background": "The PM has stated that he intends to remove trans rights from the Equality Act.\r\n\r\nIf this happened, trans people could legally face discrimination in work, housing, medical care, and more.\r\n\r\nWe are asking the government to assure us that trans people will continue to be protected under the Act.",
