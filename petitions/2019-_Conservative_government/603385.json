Example: \u201cWe allow one visitor (someone in the immediate family, or a carer) on agreement with the nurse in charge. If your child is receiving end of life care, we allow both parents to visit.\u201d This means a patient with a partner and children, can only see a single member of family. We believe this in inhumane for both patient and family. No more patients should die or be buried separated from their loved ones.",
