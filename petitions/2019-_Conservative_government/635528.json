I think that children in an enriched learning environment where they are studying a subject, they have enthusiasm for are more likely to achieve higher grades and have better mental health. If a child attends a specialist school they should not be forced to take a GCSE that may not benefit their choices for further education or career choice, especially if the school was picked for the child at a younger age.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to make it so schools cannot require pupils to take specific GCSEs other than English, Maths & Science, even if the school is a specialised school. Allow all children to flourish in their chosen subject/s they love and wish to use throughout their adult lives.",
