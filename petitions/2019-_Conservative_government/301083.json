This to me shows that non-binary is a very present community in Britain and becoming a more accessible label for people to identify with. We should acknowledge this community by allowing them the option to put their gender on legal paperwork such as passports. Similar to what Australia, Pakistan, and the Netherlands (among others) have done.",
