The Government should have took precautions and laid a contingency plan for the very likely event that 2021 Exams would be cancelled. This has caused Teachers and Students to panic and Mocks are being set. Save the Mental Health and Futures of the next generation by limiting the amount of Mocks to reduce stress and anxiety. Exams are being disguised as Mocks - this is unfair.",
