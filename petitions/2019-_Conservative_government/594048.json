        "action": "Make student loans available for commercial pilot training",
        "additional_details": "Being a commercial pilot is a highly rewarding career for those who pursue it. Unfortunately, due to high fees, it is almost impossible for students from low income families to enroll onto courses as they simply cannot fund it. It takes around 18 months to complete with competitive, high salaries allowing for the pilot to repay the loan quicker than with most university degrees and this will benefit the economy as more people are giving back to society and it provides greater equal opportunity.",
        "background": "The Government should make loans available for people who want to take commercial pilot training. This would help fill the global pilot shortage and provide a more equal opportunity for people from low income families.",
