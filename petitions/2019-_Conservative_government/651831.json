        "additional_details": "I'm a passionate environmentalist and have heard that the Kenyan Government has created a bank holiday to plant 100 Million trees. woodlands only occupy 13% of the UK's land area with around 3.2 million hectares. With only 19% of Scotland,10% of England, 15% of Wales and 9% in Northern Ireland is covered in Trees. A national holiday when people are encouraged to plant trees could help increase this.",
        "background": "I think that the Government should create a national climate change holiday and encourage people to use the day to plant trees. Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere so this could help reduce climate change. Trees also provide us with food, shelter, wood fibres, medicine and fuel.",
