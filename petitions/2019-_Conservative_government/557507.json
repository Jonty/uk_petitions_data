        "additional_details": "The hospitality industry has been very hard hit and the ability to provide off-sales during the first lockdown gave a lifeline to many.\r\n\r\nIndependent free houses have responsible landlords and landladies, who know their customers, environment and can provide safe sales following a risk assessment.\r\n\r\nThis no only benefits the pubs, but in most cases helps the small independent brewers who already have beer which will otherwise be wasted.",
        "background": "Public Houses should be able to continue to provide takeaway beer for home consumption during lockdowns.  Many pubs used their ingenuity to sell takeaway beer from windows at the front of the pubs, and with social distancing in place via appointments where necessary.",
