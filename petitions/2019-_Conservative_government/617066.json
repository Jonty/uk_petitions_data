        "additional_details": "Currently adult adoptees have to find a therapist who is part of an adoption support agency and Ofsted require these agencies to keep records of these adults who are seeking therapy, why? These regulations have been further tightened recently, making it even harder for adults affected by adoption to find support. Adult adoptees feel stigmatised by Ofsted\u2019s unnecessary involvement.We need to find a more suitable way of regulating therapy for adopted adults which makes accessing support easier.",
        "background": "Currently adopted adults in UK have to follow rules set out by Ofsted to access counselling services. This exacerbates the feeling of being different and infantilises adult adoptees, something many adoptees have experienced throughout their lives. Give back choice to adult adoptees who want therapy.",
