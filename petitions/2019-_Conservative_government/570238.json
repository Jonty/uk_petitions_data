        "additional_details": "In Jan 2021 the government  amended the critical worker status of vets and now only recognises vets in the food supply chain as critical workers. \r\n\r\nOur small animals vets work tirelessly to support our pets, they need the support of the government to continue to do so and be eligible for child care under critical worker status.\r\n\r\nAdequate veterinary care is crucial to ALL animals not just those seen as a commodity in the food industry.",
        "background": "Reinstate the status of ALL veterinary professionals (not just those caring for animals in the food chain) to critical worker status so that they are eligible for childcare support and able to continue to carry out their vital work without unecessary staff hardships and shortages.",
