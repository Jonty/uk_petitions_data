However, the truth is my ancestors were slaves under the British Empire, that is how they got to Jamaica. Although I firmly believe a nation should honour its brightest and best, at present, for a person of colour offered an honour including 'empire' in its title, there is always cause for reflection. Let us celebrate and name the Commonwealth, placing our honours firmly within our modern, inclusive society.",

I should like to see it replaced with The Most Excellent Order Of The Commonwealth Of Nations which is both current, inclusive and better reflects society.",
