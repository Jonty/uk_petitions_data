        "additional_details": "Now that the country is no longer with the EU, we believe allowing graduates to apply for ILR will help the UK to retain the best brains. This will boost productivity and in turn the growth of the economy. Secondly, we believe immigration fraud will reduce once this is put in place. It will also be a source of funds for the UK government because we think there are many people who will take advantage of the opportunity. Finally, it will help keep the best brains trained by the country's lecturers from going to other countries.",
        "background": "As part of new immigration laws, allow those who have graduated from a UK university programme of at least a year in the last 5 years to apply for ILR along with their dependants.",
