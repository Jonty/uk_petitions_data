        "additional_details": "Emergency measures need to be considered to control this threat, such as mandating stores to introduce rationing systems to ensure fairness and equal access to vital food supplies and provisions during the pandemic crisis. Lack of government action could be seen as a dereliction of duty.",
        "background": "The COVID-19 threat is causing public panic and food stockpiling leading to empty supermarket shelves. This creates more panic and more stockpiling. The situation is now a catalyst for greater public angst and more irrational behaviours which, in the worst case scenario, may result in civil unrest.",
