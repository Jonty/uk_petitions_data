        "action": "Prevent water companies from increasing bills to fund infrastructure improvement",
        "additional_details": "Britain's watercourses are in a terrible state in no small part thanks to systematic under-investment by private water companies. Awarding them yet more money after they have spent substantial amounts of our money in years gone by providing dividends for shareholders rather than fulfilling their obligations to maintain watercourses should be unconscionable. Water companies should be forced to fund these improvements rather than providing pithy assurances that yet more money will fix the issue.",
        "background": "Water companies should not be allowed to increase bills as a means of funding improvements to infrastructure. The money for this work should be coming out of the pockets of the water companies rather than consumers and the government should categorically rule out an increase in bills for this.",
