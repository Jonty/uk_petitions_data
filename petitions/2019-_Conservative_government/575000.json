Who knows how many more went unreported? \r\n\r\nIn 2017, character education was scrapped in favour of \u2018life skills\u2019, but at the Virtue Ethics Foundation (VEF), we believe it is vital under Personal, Social, Health and Economic (PSHE) to prevent harmful societal issues that affect all of us every day. We believe character education is the necessity and right of every child.",
