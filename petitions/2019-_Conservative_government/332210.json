The modern family with two working parents should be equally equipped to explore and discover a healthy balance to meet the baby\u2019s needs after birth and to bond with their baby, and adjust to the new life together. \r\n\r\nMothers are at risk after birth for \u201cthe baby blues\u201d or post-partum depression.
