        "additional_details": "While it is understandable,there has to be some control, rules imposed deprive people like myself of contact with close family. Having to do so many tests,pay hundreds on top of traveling expenses and still having to quarantine is excessive and making it almost impossible for people to see their family. Most of people travel for maximum of 2 weeks,having to spend most of it in quarantine is not right.",
        "background": "I as many other people who live, work and pay taxes in UK while our family members (such as older parents) live in other countries want to ask current system to be reconsidered and changed for purpose of traveling for family visitations.",
