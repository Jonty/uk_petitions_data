There are women who have had miscarriages will have the heartbreaking news finding out at their scan on their own with no support from their partners as they aren\u2019t allowed to be there, this is unjust and heartbreaking. 2 people from the same household should be allowed to attend scans. Staff in hospitals wear full PPE. Anyone entering hospitals have to now wear masks and keep a distance. Shopping trips are far more risky than just 2 scans on 9 months",

Many fathers would not have seen their babies at all in the scan during the whole pregnancy! This is needs to be changed!",
