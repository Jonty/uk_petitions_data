        "additional_details": "Students are either stuck in their university cities without their families or have had to move back home or elsewhere due to closures of universities across the UK. Students are particularly vulnerable to the financial impact of Covid19 as many rely on parents or work to pay rent. Many work places have now closed, making student rents an additional burden for students and their families. It is also important to consider that families will be making their own financial recovery post Covid19.",
        "background": "UK universities are part of a multibillion pound industry and they are currently closed for business, inevitably lowering costs. I would suggest universities help students financially by reallocating student tuition and strike \u201crefunds\u201d and costs saved from closure to help students pay their rent.",
