The model at the gym I am employed at, is they pay employees \u00a3490, then the next day they take \u00a3650 as payment for rent due to your self employment role. This is the new model a lot of gyms have put in place since the law was changed to stop companies utilising free trail shifts in April of 2020.",
        "background": "change legislation to make it illegal for companies to charge their staff more in rent for self employed roles than what they are paid for work done as an employee. By making personal trainers take both a self employed and employee role, gyms are able to take any employment pay straight back.",
