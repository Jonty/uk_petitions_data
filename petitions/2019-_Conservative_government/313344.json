        "additional_details": "The Corona virus has acutely highlighted the extent of under investment in our NHS and how precious it is to all parts of our lives. By having an explicit tax systems for the NHS, allows the public and tax payer to know how much is exactly being ring fenced for the NHS and also setting the correct % in order to bring us at least in par with other leading European countries. This is the time to change how the NHS has been managed and funded. Never has our generation been tested so hard.",
        "background": "In the current taxation system it is not transparent exactly how much a tax payers contribution directly funds the NHS. I would like the government to create a specific tax just for NHS that is ring fenced & makes it clear to tax payers exactly how much of their tax payments is going only to the NHS",
