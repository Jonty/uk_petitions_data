These facilities could make us a world leader in vaccine research and production, creating both jobs and putting us clearly on the world stage for trade contracts with other countries in the future who would certainly be willing to trade if we led the world in this area.",
        "background": "I'd like the gov't to fund and initiate vaccine control facilities within our borders, bring facilities, research and production back on to UK soil that we never have to be threatened by the EU in future years with threats of blockades and restrictions of exports of vaccines.",
