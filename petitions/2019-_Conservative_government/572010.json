        "additional_details": "Apart from the inconvenience of having to don a mask and go inside to pay, there is the infection risk. Queuing to pay for fuel forces people into a confined space and there is no way of social distancing when others who have paid then walk past you to exit. Petrol kiosks are small spaces with little ventilation and close proximity of people means there is a huge scope for infection. So pay @ pump must be available at all petrol stations.",
        "background": "Many petrol stations have facilities to pay at the pump, but this can be covered up or disabled meaning everyone has to go inside to pay. Whilst the queue may be socially distanced, you can\u2019t avoid the person who passes by just a few inches, on their way out. This is an infection risk.",
