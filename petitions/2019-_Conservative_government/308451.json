        "additional_details": "The work by the NHS during the COVID19 crisis is amazing. They are heroes in the truest sense. Not in the way that sports stars get described as heroes, but in the same way as our Armed Forces. The NHS staff are putting their lives on the line to help our country and save lives. They therefore deserve a national honour or award or medal. Parliament and the Government can decide on which honour is most appropriate.",
        "background": "All NHS staff should get a national honour for their brave and tireless work during the COVID19 crisis. Perhaps a George Cross (which is for acts of the greatest heroism or for most conspicuous courage in circumstance of extreme danger), or an MBE/OBE, or a special new COVID19 medal.",
