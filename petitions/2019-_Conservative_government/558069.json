        "additional_details": "Keep the children safe and the adults that they life with safe. Many children live with their grandparents or vulnerable adults and as long as school and universities are open, Covid will continue to spread and be alive and well. Understandably, education is important but the constant bombardment of Covid rules during the school day is distracting and unsettling. Health is more important than missing one month of school in order to keep ourselves and our families safe.",
        "background": "Schools across the nation should be closing as well as the majority of places during November. Covid-19 is spreading among young people when they attend university or school and this is unavoidable. If there is a complete, full-swing 1 month national lockdown , we can keep control of the virus more.",
