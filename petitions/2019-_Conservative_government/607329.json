        "additional_details": "Higher education offers skills vital for our nation\u2019s future. Graduates can contribute greatly. The Government is continuing to allow universities to charge tuition fees while grants have been removed.\r\n \r\nMany graduates never pay back their student loans. During the debate for https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/550344, it was stated that only 25% of university graduates are expected to pay off their student loan in full. The remaining loans end up written off.",
        "background": "We want the Government to scrap tuition fees, of up to \u00a39250 a year, and replace with an annual admin fee of a maximum of \u00a3500. It\u2019s crucial the Government responds to concerns of university students/graduates about the long-term impact of 30 years of debt & COVID-19.",
