        "additional_details": "If Dental Practices close permanently, the UK public will be unable to or find difficulty in accessing Dental care, either NHS or Private. This will increase physical and mental suffering to an even greater degree than existed pre the pandemic. Numerous Dentists and Dental staff will lose their jobs, resulting on State dependency and a percentage moving abroad in search of jobs. This would be a dreadful situation, considering the cost of Dental training the UK public has funded.",
        "background": "There's a nationwide shortage of Denists and Dental Practices. Coronavirus puts great financial pressure on Practice Owners, Dentists and Dental Staff so many Practices considering permanent closure. Put in adequate funding to avoid Practice closure, redundancies and problems accessing dental care.",
