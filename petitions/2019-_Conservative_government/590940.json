        "action": "Reduce the minimum income requirement for UK Family Visas",
        "additional_details": "It is estimated that 40% of the UK population do not meet these income requirements, with women and under 30's being hit the hardest. Recent figures suggest over 13,000 families are currently separated due to these restrictions, and that 15,000 children are currently growing up separated from one of their parents. The NHS Surcharge and benefit rules already protect public funds. This means that the high income requirement is an unnecessary hurdle for families seeking to live together in the UK.",
        "background": "Since 2012 it has been required that a UK Citizen must be earning a minimum of \u00a318,600 per year before their non-EU spouse can apply to live with them in the UK. This has resulted in thousands of UK Citizens being prevented from living a normal family life in the UK with their foreign spouse.",
