Mental health problems in young people increase yearly, especially during the pandemic. Hypothetically, schools could evaluate how often a student is taking mental health days and intervene early rather than risking them slipping through the cracks.",
        "background": "Students are allowed 4 mental health days, resetting every term. Individuals with diagnosed mental illnesses or have recently experienced trauma e.g bereavement are eligible for extra days. Parents must inform the institution if underage or teaching staff can authorize on a students' behalf.",
