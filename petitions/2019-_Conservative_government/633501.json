Landlords in their majority will not accept DSS and agencies that do accept DSS they will do so only if you can provide a guarantor that owns a property. There are plenty rental that appeal to people , be it location or property type . The only thing stopping this is landlords and estate agencies. If I need a property why must it be a guarantor? Why involve a third party. This is not fair.",
        "background": "I would like for the Government/Parliament to make it obligatory for landlords and estate agencies to accept people on DSS and/or not condition them with guarantors. This will ease pressure on borough's and council housing as people would gladly rent if that option is streamlined and made possible",
