        "additional_details": "Council taxes have increased well above inflation in 2020 and bin supplements have been introduced by many councils adding huge increases. With the prospect of many not having any income for months due to the Coronavirus pandemic it is only fair for local councils to stop council tax collection or risk forcing people into debt and risk losing homes. Many people have no option to claim benefits or tax credits if they were working or employed recently.",
        "background": "Stop councils collecting or demanding council tax. Stop issuing bailiffs and CCJs for people unable to pay their increased council tax bills.",
