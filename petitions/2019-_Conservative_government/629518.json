        "additional_details": "This puts the fossil fuel industry before people and the planet and cancels out any progress Britain has made on renewable energy.\r\n\r\nThis is investing in the damaging sources of energy from the last century and not the clean energy needed for children's future.\r\n\r\nA new coalmine would have no impact on reducing energy bills or ensuring our energy security.\r\n\r\nThere is an urgent need to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and this is  undermining the most important global issue of our times",
        "background": "Michael Gove has approved plans for the UK will build its first new coalmine for three decades in Cumbria, despite objections locally, across the UK and from around the world.\r\nIt will cause an estimated 400,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions a year.",
