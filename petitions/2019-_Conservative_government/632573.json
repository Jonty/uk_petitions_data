        "additional_details": "The closure of ticket offices is purely profit driven and has been a target for many years. The Taxpayers' subsidies will still be paid into the Railway only for more profits to go towards private shareholders and the public receiving less service. Ticket office staff already do cleaning, passenger assistance, refunds and ticket machine maintenance as well as being a deterrent for anti-social behaviour.",
        "background": "To recognise the importance of ticket offices remaining open for passengers that do not have the means or ability to purchase tickets online and at ticket machines. Including the most vulnerable people in our society. Stop the systematic decline in the workforce for the profit of private companies.",
