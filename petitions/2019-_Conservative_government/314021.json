On a micro-scale in someone stated they were diagnosed, then proceeded to shop as normal. The disregard like this for the brevity of the situation requires a legal remedy. \r\n\r\nThough police have extensive powers they do not have specified powers. Some of the appalling responses by police is not to their fault but to the fault of the government for providing no guidance. Protect the people who protect others.",
