It enables families and businesses, particularly the hospitality sector, to confidently plan ahead. It creates a circuit break in the Covid 19 cases across the country.  It acts as a quarantine period ahead of Christmas.  Planned now, it gives both personal and commercial certainty for a more normalised festive season.",
