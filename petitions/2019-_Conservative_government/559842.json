        "additional_details": "I would like the government and local authorities to do this, and educate local people, to ensure that roads around schools are safe for students. Lots of children aged 10+ walk home from school and they may not necessarily fully know what they are doing crossing the road etc - they are smaller than adults and harder for drivers to spot therefore by reducing the speed limit around lots of schools this would prevent any serious accidents or deaths.",
        "background": "I would like the government to work with local authorities to review speed limits outside all schools, colleges and universities in their areas. If a decrease in the speed limit around the area is found to be necessary, this should be enforced.",
