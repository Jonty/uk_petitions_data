        "additional_details": "Many people in the UK don\u2019t make that per year. We believe this policy punishes those who fall in love with someone with a different nationality. Love is not only for the rich and we believe this change is is unfair for hard working British tax payers. This change is sudden so families were not prepared for this. The Government action could tear apart families for good, due to the fact they do not earn \u00a310,000 extra a year.",
        "background": "Currently the financial requirements to bring your spouse or other family member to the UK is \u00a318,600 per year. The Government wants to more than double that to \u00a338,700, and has said that this will happen in stages, with the threshold rising to \u00a329,000 in Spring 2024. We don't want this to happen.",
