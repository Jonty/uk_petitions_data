        "additional_details": "We want the Government to ban products that are tested on animals because more than 100 million animals die from testing every year, and this is grossly unfair.\r\n\r\nMany animals experience pain during testing, including being blinded, and tests often result in the death of test animals. There are many unsolvable problems in the world, but this is one that can be solved easily, and could make a huge difference if this happens.",
        "background": "We want the Government to ban the sale of products that are tested on animals, so that only products that have not been tested on animals can be sold. If we ban products that have been tested on animals, cosmetic companies should shift to developing products that have not been tested on animals.",
