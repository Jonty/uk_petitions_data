        "additional_details": "The current reality of NHS work is that doing your job means risking your life. Despite this, not only are doctors and nurses working hard while the rest of us stay safe, but thousands of retired NHS staff are returning to help in the war against Covid-19. We rightly respect soldiers because they run towards conflict so we don't have to. In this case, it is NHS staff who risk their lives for us and, should they lose them, they should be compensated for their sacrifice just as a soldier would be.",
        "background": "Compensation to be paid to the families of NHS staff, both permanent staff and those who returned voluntarily after the government's call, who die whilst helping to fight Covid-19. The compensation should be in line with what soldiers would be entitled to if they die whilst deployed at war.",
