These same risks apply to healthcare students. The current situation in hospitals also means that learning opportunities are limited. They are being treated as unpaid healthcare assistants.",

They are paying vast sums of money only to be denied the opportunity to learn due to COVID-19's impact. Instead, they are treated as free labour in impossible settings.",
