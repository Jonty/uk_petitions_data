        "action": "Give more funding for thyroid research and patients after price hike",
        "additional_details": "Hypothyroidism is one of the commonest conditions in the UK. However 10-15% of patients despite levothyroxine treatment have persistent ill health, although some find their symptoms improve dramatically with liothyronine (another thyroid hormone). Despite being a common problem hypothyroidism has not attracted research funding and there have been no new treatments in decades. More funding for research and patient support might revolutionise the treatment and lives of many patients.",
        "background": "A fine of \u00a384 million has been levied for the price hike in liothyronine (T3), which had a significant impact on patients. We request that an amount equivalent to a proportion of the fine (1-5%) is made available for thyroid research and support for patients with hypothyroidism.",
