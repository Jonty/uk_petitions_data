Consumers are getting ripped off twice: for the energy that they purchase which is now more expensive and for the energy that they export back into the domestic supply which is bought for very little.\r\n\r\nEnergy companies shouldn't use double standards for the purchase of green energy exported by consumers. They should give something back.\r\n",

They then profit by selling this back for the full market rate. The Government should give powers to Ofgem to set a high minimum rate for the SEG.",
