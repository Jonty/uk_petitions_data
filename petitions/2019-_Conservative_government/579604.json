        "additional_details": "I would like this bill to be amended to limit the powers granted, which include the power to define what constitutes \u201cdisruption\u201d(e.g as minimal as elevated noise). \r\n\r\nI believe MPs should have the chance to vote on each element of the bill.  I would like this Bill to be impact assessed for risks of it silencing diverse voices, and blocking the voices of those not yet eligible to vote, and for the risks of discriminatory surveillance.\r\n\r\nFor a protest to be impactful it must make an impact.",
        "background": "The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill grants sweeping powers to block non-violent protest to this or any future Home Secretary.  It will ease the path for them to decide if a protest, however peaceful, will be dis-allowed, and allow citizens to be needlessly criminalised.",
