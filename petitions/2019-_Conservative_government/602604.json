This week the Government has announced a series of new measures we believe will be ineffective at controlling the drug trade. This is the same week that it has been reported that cocaine traces have been found in the bathrooms at the Palace of Westminster.\r\n \r\nSince the Government maintain strict drugs policies and refuse to recognise the value of regulating and taxing drugs and taking the power away from dealers and gangsters, let them be the first to prove they are innocent.",
