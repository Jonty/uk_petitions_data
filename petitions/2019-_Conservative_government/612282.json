        "action": "Government to tax energy companies to reduce the impact of April's rate increase",
        "additional_details": "The threat looming overhead from energy companies raising their electricity & gas rates by up to 54% has everyone anxious. Such action will force alot or ordinary households in to a state of absolute poverty where they can't decide whether to buy food or heating by winter time. \r\nIt's an absolute disgrace that the Government is sitting idly by & allowing energy companies to enjoy massive profits. BP compared itself to a cash machine making an expected \u00a34bn profit. \r\nMake energy firms pay, not us!",
        "background": "The government needs to significantly tax energy firms, energy suppliers and other large multi billion dollar organisations (who currently don't pay any tax, despite every UK hardworking citizen having to pay Tax and NI) to raise funds & plug the hole in electricity & gas prices going up",
