        "additional_details": "Immediately sack sadiq Khan and have another mayoral election, he has ruined the reputation of a fabulous city and turned it into a no go area for British visitors, he has ruined the transport system and with the help of cresida dick made a laughing stock of the metropolitan police, not only does this effect the people of London, it effects everyone in this country, to see London turned into a third world city is an embarrassment to the whole nation.",
        "background": "Not only has sadiq Khan let our once great capital city turn into a war zone of knife crime, he has allowed far left demonstrators to vandalise and deface our historical statues that show the truly fantastic history of our great nation, and made travel in London nigh on impossible, we've had enough",
