Nobody can predict whether you will react \u201cmildly\u201d or \u201ccritically\u201d to COVID-19. Key workers can get back to work if they are now immune. Terrified \u201cat risk\u201d and \u201cvulnerable\u201d can be spared the worry if they can be proven to have had and recovered from the virus. The people call on the government to invest in these tests NOW, at a cost that is far more comparable to the huge sums being injected into the economy.",
