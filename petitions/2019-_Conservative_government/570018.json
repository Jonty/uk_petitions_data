        "background": "Sperm donation is an act of altruism and at the moment, an unmarried couple regardless of whether or not you're on the birth certificate, can make a claim for child maintenance if you donated your sperm outside of a clinic; sperm donors should be able to donate anonymously without any pitfalls.",
