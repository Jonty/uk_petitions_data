        "additional_details": "Right now in Europe, there is a shortage of sperm; if a financial incentive was offered that may alleviate some of the strain however another problem is that fathers may still be liable for financial contribution even though their motives were purely altruistic.\r\n\r\nA lot of people choose not to go through clinics as it's expensive and excludes a large proportion of male donors; even if contracts were established and had legal standing I believe this would safeguard and encourage sperm donation.",
        "background": "Sperm donation is an act of altruism and at the moment, an unmarried couple regardless of whether or not you're on the birth certificate, can make a claim for child maintenance if you donated your sperm outside of a clinic; sperm donors should be able to donate anonymously without any pitfalls.",
