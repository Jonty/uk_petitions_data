        "additional_details": "With hope, by the time of the 2022 exam series, it will be safe to sit exams as the situation with COVID-19 will have hopefully improved. However, this does not overrule the fact that GCSE and A-Level students are still at a disadvantage as they\u2019ve missed many critical months of their education to online learning. Online learning hinders students\u2019 ability to learn and work to the best of their ability, so this should be made up for with reduced exam content.\r\n\r\nWith credits to FA.",
        "background": "Prior to the cancellation of the 2021 summer exam series, students were due to receive exams with reduced content as a result of the time they\u2019d missed. Students due to take exams in the 2022 series have also missed a considerable amount of time and their education has been severely disrupted.",
