His employer refused to take him back. So now instead of getting 80% of his salary he will be forced to claim universal credit which is a fraction of this amount. \r\nPlease help support those who have been loyal workers and have been put out of work due to coronavirus.",
        "background": "It has been put in place for employees to receive 80% of their earnings so they do not loose their jobs due to coronavirus. But many employees lost their jobs before this announcement was made. Please offer some substantial financial support for those who lost their jobs before this announcement.",
