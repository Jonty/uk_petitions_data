        "additional_details": "The Government should also work with local councils to roll out regenerative farming re-education courses.\r\n \r\nIt\u2019s well documented that monocropping decimates soil health, by implementing regenerative farming methods endless benefits are achieved. Nutrients are replenished via multispecies cover crops, huge amounts of carbon are recaptured in both the growth of above ground biomass and below ground root structures, no-till farming prevents stored carbon from being released back into the atmosphere, crop yields greatly benefit from nutrient dense soils and the need for chemical fertilizers is eradicated.",
        "background": "The Government should ban farming methods that are not regenerative, and incentivise farmers to implement regenerative farming methods such as no-till sowing, multispecies cover crops and multi farm cooperative livestock grazing, through revising subsidy allocations and requirements.",
