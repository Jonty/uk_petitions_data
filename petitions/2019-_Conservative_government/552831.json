        "additional_details": "There are repeated and unpredictable disruptions to educational learning due to COVID-19 and self or household isolation. Remote learning does not provide an effective learning environment with some students requiring more support than online lessons and having limited IT facilities at home. Students, who are completing exams this year, are at a significant disadvantage to previous years and it is only fair that formal examinations should be cancelled.",
        "background": "Due to the current situation regarding COVID-19, I believe that students are at a disadvantage from each other and previous years that have already completed year-end exams. Therefore I would like to suggest that students are centre assessed like the previous year.",
