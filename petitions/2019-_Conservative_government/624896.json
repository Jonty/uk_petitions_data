You could start a new petition calling for the Government to extend its current discounted homes scheme for key workers to the Southeast, if that's something that you'd like to see. You could also start a petition calling for a certain proportion of new builds to be set aside for key workers, at a discounted price, if that's something that you'd like to happen. \r\n\r\nYou may be interested to know that new leases cannot be charged anything more than a \u2018peppercorn\u2019 ground rent. The value of this is zero so you will not have to pay anything, but it forms a legally binding contract with your landlord. You can find out more about ground rent and how service charges are calculated here: https://www.gov.uk/leasehold-property/service-charges-and-other-expenses\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about the discounted homes for key workers and local residents' scheme here: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/discounted-homes-for-key-workers-and-local-residents-as-flagship-first-homes-scheme-launches"
