        "action": "Do not reopen Primary schools until after May half-term! Safety first!",
        "additional_details": "Government should consider the wider impact of sending primary children back to school which includes: \r\n-Putting teachers at risk, particularly those with medical conditions that aren\u2019t covered by the shielding initiative \r\n-Putting families at risk of infection as children spread germs between each other very quickly \r\n-It is impossible to practise social distancing in a classroom setting, particularly in classrooms that are very small with a large amount of pupils",
        "background": "There has been a lot of pressure from reporters and newspapers to reopen schools, this is not the view of most people! We do not want to undo all of our hard work in lockdown so far. Schools are unable to use social distancing properly in a classroom setting with 30+ pupils and teaching staff.",
