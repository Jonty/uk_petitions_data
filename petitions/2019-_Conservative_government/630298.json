        "additional_details": "The well established principles of representation were set out in 1774 by Edmund Burke in his famous speech to the electors of Bristol: representatives have a clear duty to give their best, most unbiased judgement, and to not betray democracy by sacrificing it to public opinion.\r\n \r\nWe believe the Brexit decision is the antithesis of these principles: the result was taken as an authoritative instruction and followed blindly.\r\n \r\nWe think that in a functional democracy, that result should have be taken as a vote of no confidence, which should have been dealt with before anything else. Far from respecting the result, we think that by ignoring this option the electorate have been taken for fools.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we want the Government to stop calling Brexit a \"Democratic decision\".",
        "background": "The UK is a parliamentary democracy and it is irrational to suppose the electorate did not know that when they voted in the EU referendum. \r\n\r\nWe think that the Prime Minister's decision to leave was inconsistent with principles of representation that have guided this nation well for centuries.",
