We need an inspectorate that helps both schools and parents to recognise what is good in schools, not what they do wrong. A deficit model will not help schools to improve.instead, it scares many and costs huge amounts of work.",
        "background": "Ofsted is past its sell by date and is now an arm of the Tory government. The opinions of a few inspectors can condemn good, inclusive schools in deprived areas. It is no good for parents as it inspects the things that concern few and doesn\u2019t inspect what counts, e.g #everychildmatters.",
