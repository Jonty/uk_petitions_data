        "additional_details": "This plan fails to address the obesity epidemic , which is a complex socioeconomic and political problem. Instead of addressing root causes, this policy addresses something surface level - calorie intake (which is not an indicator of nutritional value). To focus on calorie count alone to tackle obesity is irresponsible given the 1.25 million adults with an eating disorder in the UK. This policy encourages an unhealthy relationship with food and fails to address the problem in any real way.",
        "background": "Reject the plan to include calorie counts on menus and instead put money towards subsidising more nutritional foods, and towards teaching kids how to properly cook at home.",
