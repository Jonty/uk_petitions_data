        "additional_details": "The residual impact of Covid-19 lockdowns and the large scale disruption caused by teachers strikes is appalling. Students in years 10 and 12 are struggling endlessly with a constantly changing situation, and the expectation of having to sit examinations \u2018as normal\u2019. We believe implementing measures along the lines of those in place for 2022 exams would be a fair and appropriate support measure for students in these cohorts due to the extreme circumstances that we hope will never be witnessed again.",
        "background": "We want the Government to work with exam boards and Ofqual put in place the same interventions for 2024 as were in place for 2022; the provision of advance information to students, and more generous grading. This would reflect the impact of covid-19 and strikes on these cohorts.",
