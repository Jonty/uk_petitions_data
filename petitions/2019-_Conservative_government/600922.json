        "additional_details": "Young people are often labelled as not having enough knowledge about voting, parliament etc. to understand politics, or genuinely do not know enough knowledge and so feel like they cannot get involved with what is a very important subject.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the GCSE specification, there are currently only A-level politics courses. However, with students having the choice with what subjects they take, they very often opt out of learning about this interesting and important topic.",
        "background": "The Government should make Politics compulsory at secondary school from years 7-9. The curriculum should introduce students to democracy and international politics so that they can be more engaged. Topics can include Political Parties, Parliament, the Constitution, international bodies etc.",
