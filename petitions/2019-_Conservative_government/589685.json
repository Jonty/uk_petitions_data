        "additional_details": "The green list seems to be updated more for political reasons than real risk factors related to COVID. Often, the countries on the \"Amber list\" have lower rates of infection and they are still not being added to the \"Green List\". Although infection rates may be rising in the UK, death and hospitalisation rates are falling. Some people want to travel to countries for family they haven't seen in over a year and it is unfair that only those who can afford so many tests and to isolate can travel.",

Demonstrate that the reason people are forced to pay exorbitant amounts for tests and made to isolate is not a political move. Justify with quantifiable and objective reasons why these decisions are taken.",
