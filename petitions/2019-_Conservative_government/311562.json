It is the moral duty of any government to safe guard the health and safety of its citizens. By allowing these businesses to operate not only are the workers at grave risk of infection but also the wonderful NHS staff who emotionally plead with people to stay at home. Please do the right thing and close down down. Human life should be above all else. Thank you",
