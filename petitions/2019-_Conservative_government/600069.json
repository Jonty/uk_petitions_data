We all know the purpose why people seek employment, it\u2019s to make money. But more and more employers are requiring potential employees to perform work duties as part of the interview process. Candidates do this work, with no pay and at the end of the day they still might not get the job. I think this is an unfair recruitment process which I feel should be made illegal. If employers want candidates to work during the interview process, then they would have to pay them as if they were a proper employee working a shift at the correct hourly rate.",
