        "additional_details": "By June, the travel industry will have taken 16 months of no income. It cannot continue. Once you are vaccinated allow travel to at least other countries that are vaccinated too. Travel is not the problem and never has been. Millions in the industry are without pay or have lost their jobs. Please end this. The airlines cannot survive another summer without income. Allow travel to vaccinated countries like the travel corridor system.",
        "background": "Allow international travel to resume so the travel industry can finally recover after what will be 16 months of no income, restrictions and destruction. Or at least allow travel to vaccinated countries similar to the travel corridor system.",
