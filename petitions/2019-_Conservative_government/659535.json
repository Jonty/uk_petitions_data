Some drivers do, although, many do not.\r\n \r\nOur family cat Felix had been run over a week ago. Thankfully he managed to get home so I could seek him medical assistance but many cats don't make it home. Unfortunately a week after Felix had to be put to sleep as the damage was too severe. You can imagine the emotional impact that this has had on me and my children. The law needs change.\r\n",
