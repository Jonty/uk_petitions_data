        "additional_details": "The VOLATILE political and  humanitarian aid situation over decades, and dependence of GAZA on an irresponsible openly BARBARIC ISRAEL regime means that at a drop of a hat millions are at risk of deaths, maiming, and unimaginable low quality living standards for reasons they do not control. These people are HUMAN, and should NOT be treated like animals. Control needs to be taken urgently from external forces to ensure stability, human basic aid requirements, and avoid further global escalations.",
        "background": "URGENTLY create a joint UK/GLOBAL military sustained GAZA-SAFEZONE protecting against further ILLEGAL ISRAEL war crimes (accrued over a 75 year barbaric occupation /apartheid regime). It will prevent avoidable human death, and maintain aid/stability to 2 Million  people (50% children) for >5+ YEARS.",
