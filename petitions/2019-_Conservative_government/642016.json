I made it past the entry requirements but fell ill due to the food served in the army canteen. Instead of helping me though the rest of my training they discharged me. If there was food available for me to eat I would have been able to carry on the rest of my training. If they can cater to Halal, vegetarian why not more options. This would open the gate to more soldiers.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to create ration packs for the military for people with food allergies and tolerances (eg. Coeliac disease), to allow more people to join the army. As they cater for dietary requirements like Halal and vegetarian, we believe this is only fair.",
