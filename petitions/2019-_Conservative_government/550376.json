        "additional_details": "Not only are illegal exhausts antisocial and blight the lives of many but terrorises horses long before the driver can be aware that a horse is affected. A bolting horse not only puts the life of the rider and horse at risk but also any other road user that it may crash into.\r\nThis video uses real footage of the problem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT874Zx2_XE\r\nThe law is there but there is simply no enforcement.\r\nThis petition seeks that the law be enforced at MOT testing and with policing.",
        "background": "Any exhaust modified to louder than when the car was manufactured is illegal in the UK but flagrantly breached with no law enforcement causing blight on people's lives and particular risk to horse riders.\r\nThis petition seeks that the law be enforced at MOT testing and with policing.",
