        "additional_details": "As a new owner of an all electric car I was shocked to discover many car chargers charge as much as 69p per KW. For my own car that's \u00a334 for 210 miles of driving, this is making me leave my new electric car at home for long journeys and take my diesel.\r\n\r\nThe same charge at home is \u00a37.30 or even \u00a32.45 on special tariffs.\r\n\r\nThis outrageous pricing will put many off buying an electric car, especially those without a drive that can make use of cheaper home charging.",
        "background": "Cap the amount companies can charge to 200% of the electricity cost. So if they're paying 15p KW they can charge no more than 30p KW.\r\n\r\nPlease legislate this now before it gets completely out of control.",
