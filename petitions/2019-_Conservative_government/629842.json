        "additional_details": "Families are struggling under the burden of government policies relating to formula which is putting babies health in direct risk. Healthy start vouchers do not cover the rising cost of formula, and most food banks will not accept donations of formula or pass it out. These policies do not address wider support issues that prevent or stop people from breastfeeding, instead just penalising those most vulnerable in the current economic crisis.",
        "background": "The government currently has policies in place which restrict shops from offering discounts or loyalty points for customers purchasing formula. However, in light of the cost of living crisis we are asking for those policies to be amended to make formula more affordable.",
