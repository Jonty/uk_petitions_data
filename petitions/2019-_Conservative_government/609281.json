        "action": "Refund student's tuition fees for lost teaching time resulting from strikes",
        "additional_details": "Many students will have simply lost weeks of teaching as a result of the extensive strike actions: strike actions that as a result of the Freedom of Information Act are now known to save universities' money. This money should be paid out to students who had their learning impacted. It is not an inconsequential time loss, I myself having roughly 20% of my seminars cancelled - that being my only opportunity for face-to-face learning. It is thus unjust to expect students to pay the same.",
        "background": "Students that have been unfairly disadvantaged as a result of union strike action should have their tuition fees reimbursed. \r\nFees were reimbursed to students previously in the years of 2018 and 2019 by universities, the government should impose this reimbursement yet again.",
