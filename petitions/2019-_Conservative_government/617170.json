        "additional_details": "The Welsh government are making plans to change all 30mph speed limits in Wales to 20mph.  Ultimately this policy direction emanates from an ideological anti-car standpoint of the present administration.  Like any ideological policy it is deeply flawed.  The UK government should legislate to protect the existing limits which have been in place since 1934 and do not require amendment for reasons relating to passing political trends.",
        "background": "The UK government must reiterate through UK-wide legislation the lowest default speed limit should be no less than 30mph. \r\n\r\nThis should not remove the right for local governments and councils to independently specify lower limits when a requirement can be demonstrated.",
