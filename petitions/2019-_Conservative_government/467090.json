If we allow robots to become more advanced then humans might as well not exist. We would have no purpose to live which is a common trigger for suicide. Our brains would grow super weak because of inactivity. We have until 2030 before it starts getting bad. Please if you want something to live for and not become a useless pile of flesh and bone i am begging you to sign this petition.",
