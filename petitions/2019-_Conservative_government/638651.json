        "action": "Set up a debt relief programme for students affected by university strikes.",
        "additional_details": "The grievances of students are seldom taken seriously. Communicating internally has been demotivating and students are tired of being dismissed by their superiors. Those in charge of our education make the university strikes seem like natural disasters, portraying them as out of their control - except they are responsible for the quality of our education. Thus, a partial debt relief programme for students affected by the strikes would expedite the legal enforcement of our consumer rights.",
        "background": "Many students would like to see the government create a scheme similar to Biden\u2019s loan forgiveness programme for those affected by university strikes. The point is to make it accessible and to make it easy for students to get compensation as we are very easily dismissed by the available mechanisms.",
