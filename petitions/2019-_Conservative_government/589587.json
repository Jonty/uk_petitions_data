        "additional_details": "In this life, at least once, has every young lady/woman been in an emergency where her period has come unexpected and is not prepared. In some schools/colleges, sanitary products are given out for a price, yet condoms will be given out for free. Having periods is not a choice and in some areas, for women that are also struggling financially, sanitary products are overpriced. If Scotland have made this free, it would make sense for the Capital to move forward and do the same.",
        "background": "The government should make all sanitary products free as it is a necessity in every females life. The Government need to recognise that women\u2019s hygiene is very important and, for some people,  products to keep the hygiene are over priced.",
