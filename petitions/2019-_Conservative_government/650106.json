        "additional_details": "Our petition is vital due to the safety and traffic congestion on narrow two-way streets. These streets are not equipped for safe, two-way traffic flow. Converting them into one-way streets will greatly improve safety by reducing accidents and ease traffic congestion, resulting in safer and more efficient transportation in London.",
        "background": "Our petition urges the London Government and Parliament to assess narrow two-way streets in collaboration with local authorities and residents. The goal is to determine the feasibility of converting them into safer one-way passages, enhancing traffic flow, and ensuring pedestrian and cyclist safety.",
