        "additional_details": "While we appreciate this will help many,\r\n there are a lot of us whom would rarther ride it out instead of getting further into debt. Surely you can't force us to take on a debt we don't want.\r\nMake it so that if people who would like to be part of this scheme can then apply for it. Which will make it so the right people who it will help out can then receive the support they need.",
        "background": "Yesterday the government announced they would reduce our electricity bills by \u00a3200 by means of credit to our meters or reduced bills by \u00a3200. We will then pay it back \u00a340 for the next five years. We won't be giving a choice on this.",
