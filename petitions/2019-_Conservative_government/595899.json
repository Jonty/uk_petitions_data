        "additional_details": "Since March 2020 us students in year 11 have missed 147 days of education not including half terms and weekends which is alarming , as there are 6h in a normal school day 147 x 6 is 882h of disrupted education ,The misses schools days can also be increased for the bubbles and year groups that were sent home in schools.I am also mentioning the poor mental health of us students as we were just thrown to school from lockdown and it is hard for teens to express their emotions as they are really difficult , The first mock it is our first ever mock and we were in terrible conditions of missed education and poor mental health as we are on a disadvantage . We want the government to give us teacher predicted grades or teacher assessed grades as we would feel much comfortable with the system",
        "background": "I would teachers to set our exams for the upcoming year since the teachers know what they have been teaching us and what we need to be assessed on or have teacher predicted grades from attendance , classwork and class assessments from Y7 to Y11. ( first mock not included explained bellow )",
