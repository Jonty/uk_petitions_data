        "additional_details": "Zoos are opening across Europe and are able to do so safely. The UK\u2019s zoos have implemented measures making them Covid secure, able to safely limit numbers and enforce social distancing rules. This is something that public beaches, parks and other beauty spots cannot do. If zoos are not allowed to open soon they may never be able to open again.",
        "background": "UK zoos have been closed since lockdown and all zoos across the country are at risk of closing forever. Zoos rely on the income of visitors and donations. Other public places are beginning to open yet zoos have been told to remain closed. I ask the Government to allow the UK\u2019s zoos to reopen.",
