This cannot be done with such a large disparity between wealth, means and class.\r\nExpenses are taken for granted leading to complacency and contempt for those who apply for extra help in the form of benefits or other support.\r\n\r\nHow can an MP claiming expenses for two homes, a nanny and a cook understand what it's like to be a single parent working a NMW job and bring up two children?",
