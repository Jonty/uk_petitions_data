The vehicle took us to a safe location where we had to wait 3 hours for a taxi with isofix to take us home. If the rescue vehicle was fitted with isofix we would of been able to go home with the car. I want to make sure infants are safe in a breakdown situation as sitting on a parents lap is not safe.",

Breakdown vehicles are currently not fitted with isofix to ensure infant car seats can be fitted during a breakdown rescue.
