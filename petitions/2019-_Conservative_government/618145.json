        "additional_details": "Speak to Saudia Arabia on their unfair stance and how not only does it impact British Muslims but also British businesses. \r\n\r\nIt seems Saudia Arabia are intentionally trying to limit how many British Muslims can go from western countries.\r\n\r\nThe Hajj travel service is big and this could mean many business going bust. People now can only get a Hajj visa/package directly via the Saudi Lottery style system where people will not be financially covered by ABTA or Atol.",
        "background": "Recently Saudia Arabia decided last minute to change how people goto Hajj. Numbers have been greatly reduced for western countries and they have to apply directly to Saudia Arabia lottery system. This is impacting british travel agents now who have been told they can no longer sell Hajj packages.",
