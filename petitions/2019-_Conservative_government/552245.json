In the London Borough of Sutton these LTN's are being forced through without the full support of residents and the electorate damaging local relationships during a challenging pandemic and ruining local business and not supporting an 'open Britain'.",
        "background": "Currently under COVID emergency measures, LTN's are being forced through by local governments without any democratic consultation of the electorate. They need to be stopped immediately unless full consultation is held prior to implementation and revoked until such time meetings can be held.",
