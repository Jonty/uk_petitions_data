        "additional_details": "Retention Scheme it is a very good idea and it works but not for everyone. It still has many downsides like this. If someone started job before 28th of February will be able to be furloughed but people who were always in employment and were always paying their Tax and NIN but recently changed their job are not eligible which is very unfair. Employer who has to close down or has gor a lot less work can not do anything to help his employees but only laid them off. So many people now are without money and support to live.",
        "background": "We want Government to update Retention Scheme, people who were in employment before Retention Scheme but changed their job after 28th of February should be eligible to be furloughed as well. There should be no different for them as they are still in employment.",
