        "additional_details": "If we can keep schools open & exercise outdoors then we can we can keep these clubs open. The arts is going downhill as it is so take it away from the future generation and it will be lost before we know it. It\u2019s not just a hobby and it\u2019s not just something we do for a laugh, it\u2019s our love and our life.",
        "background": "Closing dance schools and drama clubs was not the right choice. To millions of kids all across England it\u2019s just as important as academic education. How can you expect children to be okay with the fact that their love, their passion and their hobby has been taken away from them.",
