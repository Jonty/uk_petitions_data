Since it has hit us, the NHS & Carers have shown us how important they are to this country and the public. We should be proud to have the NHS and the people that provide care in the care homes across the country. We shouldn\u2019t underestimate the work they put in during this time, historically and the future.",

These are the individuals that have been risking their lives and not blinking twice by continuing on with their working days trying to save other peoples lives.",

For example, you could start a new petition asking for the Government to create a fund for a day that supports charities who work with NHS staff and carers. \r\n\r\nWe have published this petition calling for a day to acknowledge those in the NHS and Emergency Services and asking for the government to make a fund in support:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/308614\r\n\r\n"
