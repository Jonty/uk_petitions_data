        "additional_details": "bring back the old highway code which we have all learned for years and years on paper it might look like it works but in the real world this will cause more crashes and make the roads more dangerous than they was before for the safety of everyone we need this new highway code removed ASAP before someone gets seriously injured for once listen to the public . 90% of the uk does not agree with this new highway code",
        "background": "The new highway code on paper might have made sense but in reality has made the roads worse . The highway code was perfectly fine before this new change. We would look both way before crossing now you can walk out without looking and vehicles have to stop if a crash happens who's at fault?",
