        "additional_details": "I am a single mother of 5 children ages. I receive tax payers help for only 3 of my children and we have spent the last 2 years struggling to make end meet. Relying on food banks (which are now struggling to cope with the demands of people needing the service) taking out long and short term loans to be able to survive. The government states my family is allowed \u00a31790 per month but the benefit cap reduces my payment by over \u00a3500. This needs to end",
        "background": "I want the government to end the benefits cap that is crippling families and vulnerable people all\r\nOver the uk. The government has recently bailed out working people offering 80% of wages each month due to COVID-19 yet only a 6.5% increase to benefit claimants rather than end the benefits cap",
