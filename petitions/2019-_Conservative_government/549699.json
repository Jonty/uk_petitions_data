I have been hit in the knee by a dog at full pelt causing severe bruising, I have seen a small child knocked over. Only about 5% of owners have sufficient control to be considered responsible. Most owners couldn't care less what mayhem their dogs cause. Dogs should only be let off their leash in an appropriate open area.",
