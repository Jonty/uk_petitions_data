        "additional_details": "The STV system works by ranking candidates in order. The party that has the least first choice votes is eliminated, and their votes go to the voter's second choice candidates. This is repeated until each party has enough votes to gain a seat. In a constituency, there are multiple seats, which means that smaller parties can gain more seats. \r\n\r\nFor example, in Ireland (which uses STV) the number of seats that were given to the wrong party was only 6. However, in the UK it was 114.",
        "background": "The current First Past the Post system means that many people's votes are wasted. 'Safe seats' mean that no matter what people vote, one party will get in. A solution would be the Single Transferable Vote (STV). This system is much more proportional, and has worked in many countries.",
