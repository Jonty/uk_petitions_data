        "additional_details": "It\u2019s imperative that the staff, volunteers are knowledgeable and the founders competent. Now I can create an animal sanctuary from a 10th floor flat from a phone by opening a group on social media and collect donations for animals immediately. The entire system is ripe for abuse. Rescue is emotive and well-supported by the public, but this is declining due to cases of neglect. A license gives the public confidence the animals are visible complaints and concerns can be followed up promptly.",
        "background": "All species of animals deserve the same level of care whether kept as part of a business or rescue. There have been reports of horrific cases of cruelty, animal hoarding and neglect. UK rescue homes need to be licensed as animal businesses are, and required to register with a relevant regulator.",
