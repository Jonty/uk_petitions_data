It is unfair that Zimbabwe is still on the red list however the cases are less than 100 but America is on amber but it was a country which was highly affected. please understand we have loved ones to see, dead ones to go mourn and family weddings to attend.",

Many of us have loved ones who are in Zimbabwe since the COVID we are unable to see them even those that have passed away we are unable to mourn with them. We have family weddings to attend and the amount for the hotels are ridiculous especially for families.",
