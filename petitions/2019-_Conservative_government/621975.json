        "additional_details": "The Commonwealth Games Opening Ceremony was clearly demonic.  A large raging bull was pulled into the auditorium by chained and enslaved women, whipped along by demons.  On top of the bull, described as a beast, sat Europa, holding what was described as a fallen star. Satan is described falling to earth with his demons.  At the end the beast and demons made the \"all seeing eye\" with the peoples of the earth bowing to them. Ensure that this disgraceful depiction of the UK shouldn't be repeated.",
        "background": "Please review and examine, how such an overtly demonic representation of the biblical account given in the book of revelations in the bible, was chosen to represent the UK at the opening ceremony.   The description of the event was far removed from the true meaning of the biblical raging bull.",
