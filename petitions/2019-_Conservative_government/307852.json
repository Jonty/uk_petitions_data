        "additional_details": "Supply chains are failing & will continue to do so as long as COVID-19 remains a dynamic event. \u2018Panic\u2019 buying severely impacts the elderly, key workers & vulnerable people, those who we are supposed to be protecting the most. Simply asking people not to \u2018panic\u2019 buy has not worked. Food & essential items should be distributed in an equal & fair way. This can be done in 2020.",
        "background": "I ask that the government, supermarket bosses, local food suppliers, logistics experts etc all show leadership & put their heads together to come up with a contemporary take on the rationing system so that everyone can have one less thing to worry about in these unprecedented times.",
