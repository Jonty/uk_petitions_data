It cost 20\u00a3 daily to ride a train from Hatfield -\r\nTo London Kings Cross return daily (319\u00a3 with season ticket). It cost instead 13.00\u20ac to go from Naples to Rome for 2 hours 45min travel, and this is only an example. Why we heave to pay a lot more compared to other countries? In Luxembourg transportation is free and in Germany prices keeps going down. They face the same energy crisis.",

It's unfair and unjust that doing 3 stops with the train costs 20\u00a3 return. \r\n\r\nIn Italy for example where electricity has been historically more expensive, to do the same milage costs less than 5\u20ac.",
