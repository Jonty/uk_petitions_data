Since 17 May 2021, the UK Government has said face coverings are no longer required in classrooms, but has not published data to support this decision.\r\n \r\nWe need to understand the role that schools play in Covid-19 transmission so we can judge if appropriate action is being taken to protect children, school workers, families and wider communities. It is not acceptable for children to catch and transmit COVID. This disrupts education and risks Long COVID.",
