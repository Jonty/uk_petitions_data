        "additional_details": "UK law should priorities positive ecological practices both during and post the crisis.\r\n \r\nThe House of Commons has announced a climate change emergency.\r\n \r\nAircraft engines emit particulates and gases into the atmosphere which contributes to climate change.\r\nIn times of low international travel (such as now, during covid-19 outbreak) planes should not fly empty.\r\n \r\nLaws such as the 80% slot usage leads to economical incentive for airlines to fly empty planes because slots are valuable. This practice should be stopped. The priority should be to reduce pollution not support big airlines.",
        "background": "Under international guidelines and EU law companies keep their landing slots if they use them over 80% of the time in UK's major airports.\r\n\r\nDuring the covid-19 crisis this is resulting in ghost (empty) flights.",
