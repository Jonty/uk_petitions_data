The current situation with COVID-19 highlights just how fearless and hardworking it\u2019s frontline staff are. One of those groups is its nurses, many of whom can miss family moments to care for other people\u2019s family, and who help to bring life into the world and care for you when you leave.\r\n \r\nThere are more than 40,000 nursing vacancies, and huge difficulties in recruitment. This charge was already a challenge for many people, and to increase it just makes this worse.",

Overseas nurses should not have to pay this! They already contribute to our NHS through work, income tax and National Insurance",
