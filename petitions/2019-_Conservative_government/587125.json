        "additional_details": "As long as the appeal success rate is above 50%, the decision makers are clearly not capable of making those decisions. According to independant.co.uk, the DWP spent \u00a3121,000,000 on staff costs between 2017 and 2019, while losing three quaters of tribunals. this clearly shows that there is a serious problem in the decision making process, and while recent reforms have only incresed the number of appeals. I believe it is only fair for them to see a decrease in thier wages, until they improve.",
