        "additional_details": "In 2013/14 there were just under 27,000 offences involving a knife or sharp instrument. In 2022/23 this had increased to over 45,000. There have been hundreds of thousands of these offences in the last decade.\r\n \r\nWe need tougher sentences that apply from the first offence. Currently minimum sentences only apply for multiple offences.\r\n \r\nWe need a deterrent to make people think twice before they decide to pick up the knife!\r\n",
        "background": "We want the Government to introduce minimum sentences for possession of a knife from the first offence. These should be 4 months detention and a \u00a31,000 fine for 16-17 year olds, and a 6 month custodial sentence and a \u00a31,000 fine for people aged 18 and over.",
