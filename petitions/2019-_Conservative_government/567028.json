        "additional_details": "New Zealand closed its borders to all non-residents and non-citizens in mid-March, becoming one of the earliest countries to do so. At the time, that decision may have felt drastic, especially for a country that at that stage had experienced no deaths from Covid-19. However, almost a year later and the country is completely free of Covid-19 and life has returned to normal. A proven method of preventing transmission (in New Zealand and Australia), has no reason not to be implemented.",
        "background": "The Government needs to take more control over Covid-19 and the way in which it spreads. The only step that seems to be missing from the newly implemented measures of the national lockdown is closing the borders to all travellers.",
