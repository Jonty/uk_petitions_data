        "additional_details": "We demand that the government, as a matter of urgency, makes buildings around the UK fire-safe. We also would like to understand why there are buildings in the UK without fire-safety measures, despite the Grenfell tragedy having happened 3 years ago. As an apparent \u2018first-world\u2019 country, residents of the UK should not worry that the homes that they live in are unsafe in the terrible event of a fire. During the Grenfell tragedy, 72 people died. Do not let their lives have been lost in vain.",
        "background": "It has been 3 years since the tragedy that was Grenfell and there are STILL buildings in the UK with dangerous cladding and without sprinkler systems. This is unacceptable and it should not have taken 3 years for the government\u2019s promises to come to fruition.",
