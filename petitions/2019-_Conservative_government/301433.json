        "action": "Cancel the 2019/2020 Premier League and EFL season due to Coronavirus outbreak",
        "additional_details": "As a public health emergency is looming and given the likely timetable of disruption to everyday working life, it would be highly prudent to cancel the 2019/2020 premier league season with immediate effect.  Fans, players and staff health are paramount and every measure possible should be considered to protect the public and delay the outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).  The season should be halted immediately and all records expunged from history with promotion/relegation cancelled.",
        "background": "The government should cancel the 2019/20 Premier League and EFL season to prevent and slow down the Coronavirus outbreak.  Assuming a public health crisis has been averted or becomes manageable this season should be restarted in time for the 2020/21 season start with promotion/relegation cancelled.",
