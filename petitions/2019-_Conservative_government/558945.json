        "action": "Ban the bang in public sold fireworks for personal garden displays.",
        "additional_details": "I understand after many petitions asking for the ban of fireworks being sold to the public that simply isn\u2019t going to happen. I\u2019d like the Government or Parliament to consider a compromise by banning the sale of loud noisy fireworks to the public for personal displays. Keep the loud fireworks for controlled professional displays. This issue affects a lot of people, be it animals like my own dog who has a severe noise phobia to vulnerable children, adults & service personnel suffering from PTSD.",
        "background": "Remove the loud bang from public bought fireworks. Save the noisy fireworks for organised displays in a controlled environment. Many animals & vulnerable people including service men & women with PTSD are severely affected by the weeks of loud noise made by public personal firework displays.",
