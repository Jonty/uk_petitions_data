        "action": "Provide funding for universal access to Fracture Liaison Services (FLS)",
        "additional_details": "FLS is the world-standard for secondary fracture prevention, yet access is a postcode lottery, causing entrenched health inequalities. People who live on the wrong side of a catchment line are being left to suffer life-changing spinal and hip fractures. Government can transform the picture through a clear strategic direction from the top, backed with modest funding and sensible incentives. We\u2019re calling on the Government to provide funding which will ensure that FLS is a universal NHS service.",
        "background": "The Government should commit to equitable access to FLS for all. The APPG on Osteoporosis and Bone Health\u2019s recent report highlights the scale of under-diagnosis, under-treatment and missed opportunities in the NHS and provides a blueprint for change, which the Government should implement.",
