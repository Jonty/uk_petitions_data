        "additional_details": "The government need set up regulations for all counselling and psychotherapy. For counsellors themselves not having this regulation often means joining a governing body and being charged each year. It also means many counsellors are asked to work unpaid. After spending thousands of pounds on degree etc, I feel it is unfair to then ask us to work for no or very little money, even within the NHS.",
        "background": "Counselling and psychotherapy in the UK is unregulated, this means anyone can call themself a counsellor. People deserve to know their counsellor has the correct qualifications and skills to help. Not having these qualifications can cause harm.",
