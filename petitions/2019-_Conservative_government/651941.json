        "additional_details": "The junction in Hipperholme is very congested at all times. The air quality is the worst in Calderdale. Residents commuting to Halifax, Bradford, Leeds (or Manc) have to drive to Low Moor, Halifax or Brighouse station first (which negates the benefit of public transport). Reopening the station would allow residents to access trains already passing through; decrease congestion; improve wellbeing; benefit Bradford's economy; improve air quality and support Hipperholme, Lightcliffe and Hove Edge.",
        "background": "Please reopen the Hipperholme train station in Calderdale. There used to be platforms running alongside the lines, up to the tunnel. The Calder Valley trains currently pass through.The suggestion would be that the trains stop at Hipperholme to allow residents to commute to Bradford/Leeds/Halifax.",
