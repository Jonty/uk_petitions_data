        "additional_details": "With current measures being introduced to stunt the spread of the Covid-19 virus, it makes sense for public houses and bars to follow suit and shut down to further reduce direct and indirect contact. This will protect the public from further cases, but also protects those working within the hospitality industry against those who may have the virus but do not yet show the initial signs of it.",
