There is no reason why technology cannot be implemented to stop this. Car manufacturers benefit from another sale if a vehicle is stolen. The police have to conduct dangerous pursuits at huge risk when we all know systems could be implemented that allow vehicles to be automatically switched off. We need action!.",
