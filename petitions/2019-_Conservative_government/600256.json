        "additional_details": "This should take into account what measures the venue has to tackle issues like spiking, sexual harassment, trafficking, drug use, violence to name a few.\r\n\r\nThere should be an indicator of a venue's safety so that people can make an informed decision on whether they would feel safe to visit - just as the Hygiene Rating does for restaurants. Preventing spiking, sexual harassment etc is just as, if not more important than hygiene standards, so there should be an accredited way to assess it.\r\n \r\nHaving this sort of rating would give venues incentive to ensure that their premises have effective precautions in place to protect their customers from harm.",
        "background": "The Government should require licensing authorities to inspect licensed venues regularly, with the results added to a national Safety Rating system, like the Food Hygiene ratings for restaurants. ",
