        "additional_details": "There are many reasons an owner may not realise what council their missing dog has been picked up by and also may miss an initial call. Some councils use contractors and both council/contractor fees can be extortionate, which can result in an owner losing their beloved dog if they cannot pay. We want to see a fee cap and a requirement to offer payment plans. It isn't always an owner's fault why a dog goes missing.",
        "background": "The 7-day period after which a stray dog goes into council care needs to be extended as sometimes it may not be enough time for an owner to be aware and/or travel to collect their dog. Kennel fees need to be capped as some council/contractor fees are extortionate and payment plans aren't offered.",
