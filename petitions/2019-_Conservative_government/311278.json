        "additional_details": "The legislation states that workers who started work after the 28th February are not entitled to this funding meaning that their new place of work is not eligible to claim the 80% relief of their salary. \r\n\r\nThis is a huge oversight and puts thousands of workers at risk, and stuck in the place of having no income and little to no prospect of getting employment in this current economy.\r\n\r\nWe need this amended. Punishing those for bettering themselves by furthering their career and starting a new job is not fair.",
        "background": "Employers are making staff redundant with no option of furlough because they\u2019re not eligible for the coronavirus retention scheme because they started after the cut off date  February the 28th. \r\n\r\nNew workers joining payroll in March won\u2019t receive any pay from the government.",
