        "additional_details": "Please can we lift the quarantine of 14 days on returning from the canary islands and balearic islands as these do not fall into the same catagory as mainland spain cases,\r\n\r\nIslands should be looked into as numbers are low and we need to support the islands more than ever now , i think the quarantine should be based on the destination and the number of cases as to if you need to quarantine \r\n\r\nfor example Tenerife has had no new cases in 21 days so why quarantine from this country",
        "background": "Please we all are aware how serious the COVID-19 pandemic is,we are also aware some countries are a greater risk than others we therefore asking that the balearic&canary islands where cases have been very low&being controlled amazingly by local authorities should't be classed same as mainland spain",
