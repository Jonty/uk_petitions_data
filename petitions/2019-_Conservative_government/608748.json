        "additional_details": "SAGE reiterated this February that the ONS Infection Survey is \"a critical tool for understanding the state of the epidemic.\"\r\n\r\nWe must keep the survey as it is to maintain our world-leading surveillance capacity to track the development of future variants which could be worse. Scaling it back would be a false economy that could spectacularly backfire.\r\n\r\nIf free testing is removed it will be even more vital.",

Other case data depends on testing availability/behaviour whereas the ONS Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey provides valuable information that is not impacted by testing issues.",
