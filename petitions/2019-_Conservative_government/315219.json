The Resolution Foundation is calling for the savings and capital threshold to be updated \"so it doesn't unfairly penalise those with savings\", and leave families having to live off their nest egg that might have been intended for a first house deposit, see: https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/no-work-no-pay/",
