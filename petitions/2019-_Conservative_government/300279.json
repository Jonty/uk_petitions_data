        "additional_details": "After the declaration of Climate Emergency on 1 May 2019 by the House of Commons, there remains a lack of understanding among decision makers and the general public about the importance of these issues. There is a misplaced notion that environmentalism is either optional or a hindrance in the face of economic activity and development. For the undertakings made by the Government to be meaningful then these misconceptions in society must be changed on a fundamental level and from the youngest age.",
        "background": "The Government should act to enhance the national curriculum at all stages in schools to include rigorous instruction in environmental and ecological conservation and sciences. Ensure these are promoted with at least equal weight to that afforded to matters such as economic and financial activity.",
