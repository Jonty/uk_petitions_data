        "additional_details": "The Government needs to adopt the Emergency Plan set out by Independent SAGE. This seeks to lower covid cases & buy time through a short circuit breaker while effective institutional \"scaffolding\" is erected over 4-6 weeks, with NHS England in charge, to oversee effective, localised track & trace. Other measures are proposed to ensure public safety with details freely available on Independent SAGE website. Only by effectively containing the virus can the economy & normality recover.",
        "background": "Management of Covid in the UK is failing, damaging health & economy. The Independent SAGE group of top experts urgently advised cracking down on Covid over summer. They were ignored but rapidly rising cases prove them right again. Government must listen to these experts & adopt their Emergency Plan.",
