        "additional_details": "We have instead seen veterans repeatedly investigated and their reputations sullied, as incidents that happened decades ago are used in an attempt to rewrite history.\r\nNo value is placed during those investigations on the fact that incidents often happened in situations where the veterans were clearly in danger.\r\nThe veterans do not want an amnesty, as this would suggest their actions had equivalence with the IRA's actions, or those involved in indiscriminate bombings and sectarian bloodletting.",
        "background": "We want an end to the persecution of veterans who served during Operation Banner.   Known sectarian incidents have been ignored, despite 2500 deaths, and those responsible were given Comfort Letters which effectively provides immunity.   So why have our veterans not received such letters?",
