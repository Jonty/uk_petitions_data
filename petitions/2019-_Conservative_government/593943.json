They have reverted back to SSP which only equates to \u00a390 pw. \u00a3260 less than an employee working 45 hours pw (minus tax) With only 10% of the population having had Covid 19, more are to follow. We are already having to deal with loss of wage and hardship due to this pandemic, we do not need more uncertainty from lack of support from employers!",
