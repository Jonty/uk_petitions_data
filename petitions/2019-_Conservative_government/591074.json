        "action": "End Blanket No Pet Clauses in Tenancy Agreements & Leases",
        "additional_details": "We welcome recent changes to the model tenancy agreement, our governments recognition of the importance of pets to people & how traumatic it is to have to give up a pet when moving into rental housing. Unfortunately this is not enough; we call on government to go further. Without legislation like that proposed in 'Jasmine's Law' landlords can still include blanket bans on pets.\r\n\r\nChanges in legalisation would open doors for love and companionship for many humans and animals.",
        "background": "We ask the government to introduce formal legalisation that takes a fair & balanced approach to pets. We call for an end to blanket no pet clauses in tenancy agreements, protecting existing human companion animal relationships & reflecting our pet loving nation. Every pet deserves a loving home.",
