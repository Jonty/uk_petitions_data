        "additional_details": "The Sunday Trading Act was introduced in 1994 but society has changed significantly since those days. More and more people work unconventional hours and having one day of the week reduced to just 6 trading hours makes planning your days off tricky. Additionally, this could be beneficial to the employees of these sites as they may have more hours available to them to earn more. This could also lead to more Income Tax paid to the government and increased VAT revenue from the additional sales.",
