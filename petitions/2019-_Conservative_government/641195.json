        "additional_details": "We believe introducing an 'Open Work Visa' would:\r\n \r\n- Increase tax revenue by allowing easier job switching and greater competition for high-paying jobs.\r\n \r\n- Reduce unemployment by enabling skilled workers to create new jobs through entrepreneurship.\r\n \r\nCurrently, Canada and Germany are easing the conditions of work visas and permanent residence, and we believe the employer-dependent work visa for five years to get ILR in the UK is unfair and burdensome.\r\n",
        "background": "Introduce a new 'Open Work Visa' for people who have worked in the UK for at least two years under a Skilled Worker visa, so they can do any work, without needing a sponsor. This could ease job changes, increase entrepreneurship and make it easier for employers to recruit skilled workers.",
