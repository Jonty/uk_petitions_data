        "additional_details": "Considering the current climate with the Black Lives Matter movement in America and across the world, it is clear that there is a large gap in the general public\u2019s understanding of British history and thus less understanding of how far back these issues go. By educating people from earlier on they can develop a deeper understanding of these issues and be open to how they affect us still to this day.",
        "background": "Make teaching about colonialism and it\u2019s impact on society mandatory. Including how it has led to the racial disparity we see today. Give students an understanding of how the British empires history has impacted BAME communities and continues to shape current policies and society as a whole.",
