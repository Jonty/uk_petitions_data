        "additional_details": "All the people in the middle working people owning their own home who are working have been affected but all we\u2019ve been given is 3 months and then extended by 3 months payment holidays after which our credit score would be affected. We\u2019re missing universal free meals and just get on with it. The additional UC bonus or uplift shouldn\u2019t be given to people who were on it prior to covid- so when People return to work their money pays for this additional money",
        "background": "There are many of us who do not fall into the universal credit bracket who receive no help financially. Doesn\u2019t mean we haven\u2019t struggled just that we have been self sufficient in sourcing financial support and probably ended up In debt!! Most claiming UC have the same circumstances pre covid",
