        "additional_details": "The lack of detailed education surrounding Black History and the role that Britain played in this makes it almost impossible to change society\u2019s opinions and perceptions in the years to come. Only through early education and intervention do we stand a chance of putting a stop to ignorance and racism. The current history curriculum is heavily focussed on World War One and Two, Hitler and the Holocaust, the history of the British Monarchy with a mere nod to politicianry in America.",
        "background": "We want the Government to introduce truthful and in-depth Black History education to Secondary school children. We want the Government to teach beyond the obligatory nod to politicianry in America, and actually educate our future generations on the history and topics of racism in Britain.",
