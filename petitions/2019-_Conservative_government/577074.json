        "additional_details": "Social services conduct is very much in the public eye. They present themselves in individuals homes and have the power to influence a judge\u2019s discussion on the future of children and young peoples lives. I think this is a great deal of power . As with the police they are dealing with individuals on a daily basis. Although this might be classed as intrusive it is a very intrusive procedure to be allowed to enter private homes. I think this is also a helpful way to avoid harm to people in the services",
