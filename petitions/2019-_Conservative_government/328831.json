This industry has been neglected during covid-19. We are all self employed and can not afford to be forced to stay closed any longer. Why can pubs and hairdressers open when the self employed people that are already trained in hygiene are unable to do so.\r\nI and many other artists have been forced to get temporary jobs in order to get through this time and now will have to fork out to return deposits of clients that have been rebooked several times. Us self employed artists have already prepared for reopening with extreme precautions because we know if we get Ill and have to take two weeks off we loose money!",
