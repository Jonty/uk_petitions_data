        "additional_details": "Many people cannot afford, or do not have access to private land. Many private fields for hire do not allow XL Bully dogs at all, or require them to be on lead and muzzled if with another dog for insurance purposes. This means many dogs may experience physical health issues due to infrequent or inconsistent amounts of exercise. They will also not be able to socialise as easily with other dogs, which could impact their wellbeing and temperament. We believe this is not conducive to their welfare and will cause long term problems.",
        "background": "Due to the XL Bully ban many dogs are now not able to exercise in public off lead. Given that they are required to wear a muzzle to prevent injury to others and also have third party liability insurance, we want the Government to amend these rules to allow XL Bully dogs to run and play off the lead.",
