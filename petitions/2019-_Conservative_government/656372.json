        "additional_details": "The reason the public are asking for this is because, the official banning of the XL bully was put into fruition in October 2023. The certification cut off date is 01/02/2023. \r\n\r\nThis gives only 3-4months to get Exemption. In the most financially difficult time in UK present times and within the most financially difficult time of the year over the Christmas period. \r\n\r\nIt is unfair that the people who may not be able to afford the costs until after the new year should face further charges.",
