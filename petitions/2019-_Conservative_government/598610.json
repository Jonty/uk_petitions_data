        "additional_details": "As an animal lover holidaying in Greece it's brought to my attention the distressing number of strays here. However, Greece's new laws do include pet track & trace using a DNA database, forbidding breeding 1 animal more than 6 times & 1 litter per household rule to non breeders, records of animal abusers to prohibit them from future owning of animals & finally if no breeding is wanted neutering will be mandatory. I feel these laws should already be in place in the UK & our animal laws are outdated.",
        "background": "Improve animal welfare by placing a ban on online animal sales, reduce pet shop sales, prohibit importing pets, introduce a database of animal abusers resulting in forbidding abusers to own animals again. Make animal registering mandatory & record all medical history since birth.",
