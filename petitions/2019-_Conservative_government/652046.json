We consider that this effectively excludes small businesses from using the APIs directly because access is only cost-effective through large corporation intermediaries. We would like Government, in this example, to ensure small businesses can access open banking APIs, and anybody can access their own banking data directly, for free and without a difficult authorisation process.",
