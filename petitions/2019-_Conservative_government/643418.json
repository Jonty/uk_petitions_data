        "additional_details": "There are too many cases where courts are ordering children to have contact or live with perpetrators of domestic abuse. This can have a huge impact on the children and victims of abuse.\r\n \r\nA Government review of how child contact cases involving victims of domestic abuse are handled should look at whether the courts are giving the child's welfare priority, and taking any domestic abuse sufficiently seriously.\r\n \r\nAdditional support for victims of domestic abuse involved in family court proceedings would help ensure they can access the advice and support they need during and after these proceedings.\r\n",
        "background": "I want the handling of child contact cases involving victims of domestic abuse to be reviewed, and victims given more support. The child's welfare is meant to be the main consideration in decisions about contact, but in some cases involving victims of domestic abuse we believe this doesn't happen.",
