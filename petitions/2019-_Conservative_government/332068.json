A conviction for breaching the Wildlife and Countryside Act is sufficient proof that an individual cannot be considered responsible enough to own these weapons and therefore a mandatory ban from owning them is a rational course of action and will serve as a more effective deterrent to those who might be inclined to offend.",
        "background": "Any person who is found guilty of offences under the Wildlife and Countryside Act should be automatically banned from ever owning a gun.  This would serve as an additional deterrent to those who continue to flout laws designed to protect British wildlife.",
