        "background": "Unlike rehabilitation services for a Stroke or Heart Attack, there is no formal care pathway for Cardiac Arrest Survivors across the UK. Everyone affected by involvement in a Cardiac Arrest, and the provision of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, must have access to ongoing, personalised support.",
