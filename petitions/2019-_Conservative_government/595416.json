Contraception is taken to voluntarily to alter a natural bodily function; medicines, vaccines and other treatments or interventions prevent involuntary illness from a malfunction of the body or protect it from foreign elements e.g. bacteria, viruses, irritants etc. Minors may not understand issues surrounding treatment, such as need for, risk, being in trial phases etc.; parents must be involved.",

However, it can be used for children to consent to other medication or medical interventions without their parents\u00b4 knowledge or consent; that is dangerous and wrong.",

The Gillick competence test applies as a result of case law, and is not set out in legislation.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling on the Government to require parental consent for all medical treatment for children aged under 16, if that's what you want to happen."
