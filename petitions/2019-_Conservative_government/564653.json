        "additional_details": "They caused me to have a missed 4th degree button hole tear which then developed into a rectovaginal fistula resulting in me needing a colostomy. The frightening thing is that I am not the only person in the UK that this has happened to and there are many women suffering from birth injuries which are the result of a Forceps delivery. I and many others feel that a review into the use of forceps should be done immediately to see whether or not they should be banned.",
        "background": "After the Ockenden review it is very apparent that Forceps can be dangerous to not only babies but also mothers. I know this from my own personal experience of having a forceps delivery.",
