        "additional_details": "To stop the spread of covid 19. If a student picks up the virus and takes it home to a vulnerable person they could die. If teachers aren't vaccinated aswell, they can pass it between classes and potentially die from covid and then there wouldn't be teachers about.",
        "background": "I strongly believe that sending students back to school and college without even the teachers being vaccinated is ridiculous. It is to dangerous to send them back with the risk of either the students getting covid or them passing it to the teachers, who are key workers and them getting really Ill.",
