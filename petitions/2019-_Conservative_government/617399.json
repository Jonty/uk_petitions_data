        "additional_details": "Having more people trained in basic life support is the key to potentially saving and preserving life. Too many people die each year due to conditions that if they were to receive early basic life support such as cpr they would\u2019ve survived. At the moment bls isn\u2019t compulsory in school but we believe if it was more lives could be saved each year. The main reason behind this is that a key part of survival in cases such as cardiac arrests is early detection, early compression and early defibrillation.",
        "background": "Make teaching basic life support part of the core curriculum in school to be taught to all those in year 8 and above.",
