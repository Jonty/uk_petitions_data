        "additional_details": "It is ludicrous that someone who has had such a short stay in the role is eligible for full benefits the other end. The reason for such a short period is in the role is for their failure which will have cost the country, why should we continue to pay for them even though they have provided nothing but pain for us. I believe that brining in a minimum period of two years in post should be sufficient to earn such a benefit. I want to see this introduced for all (past and present) who can claim.",
        "background": "Ex-prime ministers are allowed to claim up to \u00a3115,000 in expenses against the Public Duty Costs Allowance and have a fixed pension. With Liz Truss' very short term in office (44 days) I call on the government to bring in a minimum term of two years in post prior to a PM being eligible to claim them",
