If the Government created Statutory Advocacy services for veterans these could provide one to one support and reduce the negative mental and physical impact experienced by some when they need to engage with organisations such as Government departments, service providers, charities or Local Authorities.",
        "background": "We believe there is a need for a new support service that understands the unique challenges of the Veterans community. We would like the Government to work with Veterans and Local Authorities to create a national advocacy support service for UK veterans, to better support veterans.",
