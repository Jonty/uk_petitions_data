        "additional_details": "We want Pakistan on the Green list because data show low rates cases and deaths. Government of Pakistan are controlling their borders really well with India  . Many people want to go to Pakistan for a holiday, see parents and loved ones. As Pakistan is controlling the pandemic well, having to keep Pakistan on red list is unfair and no longer being justified. Don\u2019t treat Pakistan same as India as prime minister Imran Khan has managed covid situation way better than many advance countries.",
        "background": "We would like the government to put Pakistan on the Green list just like the other countries that were added on the 24th of June 2021. We want government NOT to treat Pakistan as Indian region. Pakistan has controlled covid situation well and low rate of covid cases it self a biggest evidence..",
