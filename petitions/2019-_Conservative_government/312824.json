Measures can be put in place to reduce risk during COVID-19 but the banning of family to say goodbye is unfair. You are asking alot of the British public to give up their freedom to save lives, all I ask is you treat every life as if it matters regardless of the current pandemic.",
        "background": "The government should not allow any local authority to ban mourners attend a funeral services. Restrictions could be made in terms of numbers and the 2 meter spacing. Everyone has the right to a send off. Especially in these tough times where family cannot see loved ones before their departure.",
