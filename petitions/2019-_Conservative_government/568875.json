        "additional_details": "I would like the Government or Parliament to allow students to cancel their rental agreements because it is grossly unfair that they should pay for accommodation, and in most cases for heating, lighting, water and other services that were included in the rent, when they have been told that they cannot return to the accommodation bar a few exceptions. They are now in the position of paying for amenities they cannot use, but unable to pay for amenities in the places they are living.",
