        "additional_details": "Obscene profits are being made from covid-19 vaccines and treatments by a very small number of pharmaceutical companies. Unlike energy companies, patent protections mean there is no \"free market\" operating, and it's effectively a monopoly. Meanwhile, millions of people across the UK are facing poverty and having to decide whether to spend their money on \"heating or eating\". It's time to help address this imbalance via a windfall tax on these companies.",
        "background": "A small number of very large companies are effectively operating a monopoly on covid-19 vaccines and treatments. A recent estimate suggests Pfizer, BioNTech & Moderna were making combined profits of over $1000/second. The proceeds of a windfall tax could be used to address the cost of living crisis.",
