        "additional_details": "Universities' inability or failure to adapt has meant students\u2019 grades have faltered and mental health has deteriorated, resulting in an inaccurate reflection of students' capabilities. Giving the opportunity to retake this academic year without charge will allow them to get the learning experience they were promised, and carry on their degree or graduate with the grades they deserve. Another year of the Maintenance Loan will also need to be granted to allow students to afford living costs.",
        "background": "The majority of university students have had most to all of their teaching over Microsoft Teams since September. In a lot of cases, this has been an inadequate form of learning, especially for practical-based courses where the use of special equipment/software hasn't been made available.",
