Many people are entering these stores for counter service without masks and waiting inside for food and drink. \r\nThe customers who purchase from them being penalised in some areas (Derbyshire police officers recently classed takeaway coffee as a picnic which is non essential). This is surely the fault of the stores being open, many with multiple locations within the same town, rather than the customers who purchase the coffee?",
