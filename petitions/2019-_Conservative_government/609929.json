        "additional_details": "NATO's response is timid and not enough. Tobias Ellwood MP, who served in the British Armed Forces, explained this well: \"History will ask why [the] West didn\u2019t do more if Kiev falls... Why we didn\u2019t use our NATO hard-power deterrents, the one Western asset that Putin fears. This was not harnessed, and we\u2019re now seeing the consequences of that... We failed to recognise that Ukrainian security is European security.\" NATO should use its hard-power deterrents, including a no-fly zone over Ukraine.",
        "background": "In the words of Tory MP, Tobias Ellwood, the UK and NATO has to assist Ukraine militarily and to be \"far more front-footed\" in relation to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. NATO has the clout necessary to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine, and the UK should lobby its NATO partners for such a measure.",
