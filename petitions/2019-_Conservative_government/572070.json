        "additional_details": "Government advisers warn that consumption of meat must be reduced to address the climate crisis. Health advice also recommends eating less meat.\r\n\r\nYet Government regulations force schools to provide meat-based meals, regardless of the damage caused.\r\n\r\nThis prevents local decision-making, and can impose additional cost - good plant-based meals can be significantly cheaper. \r\n\r\nRemoving this centrally-imposed regulation would allow schools to make decisions that are best for children and their future.",
        "background": "Government regulations require schools to provide meat-based meals at least 3 days each week. This prevents schools offering healthy meals that are best for their children.\r\n\r\nThe Requirements for School Food Regulations should be reviewed, and the requirement to provide meat-based meals removed.",
