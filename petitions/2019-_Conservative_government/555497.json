        "additional_details": "There is not enough power from protests and activists currently trying to stop this problem. There has been little progress. Also, they are being put at risk due to the dangers of protests within Saudi Arabia. The UK need to understand how poor quality of life can be for Saudi Arabian women. If this improved, there should be less asylum seekers and people trying to escape the country. Furthermore, abuse should decrease if there is nobody controlling what women can do or where they can go.",
        "background": "The UK should work internationally to pressure Saudi Arabia to reform the atrocious way women are treated. Saudi Arabia must be pressured to ensure women have their own rights, such as being able to freely travel without having permission from a male. This is a deep systemic issue that must stop.",
