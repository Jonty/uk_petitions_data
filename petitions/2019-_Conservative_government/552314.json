Our opening hours have been shortened to 10pm, last orders at 9.30pm (this is when most pubs take the most money) people are threatened with hefty fines for not wearing a mask, for standing up, for standing at the bar, for not using track and trace. Nobody wants to drink in these conditions. Its to much hassle. People are going to lose their jobs!",

Gas, electric, water rates etc. These bills are already astronomical. We've been financially slapped since reopening because of the restrictions.",
