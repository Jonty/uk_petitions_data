        "additional_details": "Over 95% of young females regularly face sexual harassment publicly in the UK. In a culture where this behaviour is normalised, no one is willing to make a change.\r\n\r\nNobody, male or female, should have to be comfortable with unrequested harassment. Sign this petition to let parliament review the nationwide issue, causing young people to be afraid to be outside at night, and reform the criminals that act in such a manor.",
        "background": "The government should review sexual harassment laws, around people being verbally and physically attacked or have unwanted advances made towards them.\r\n\r\nThis can include cat calling, wildly inappropriate requests or \u201ccompliments\u201d that often result in people feeling uncomfortable, or often afraid.",
