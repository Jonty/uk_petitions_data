They don't pay road tax as it is but we believe it is not fair that they also don't need to be insured. If all cyclists had a visible registration on their bicycles, like motor vehicles have to, then they could be more easily identified by CCTV or law enforcement if breaking the law. Such as going through red lights and riding on the pavements",
