        "action": "Extend local authorities' power to hold virtual meetings beyond 7 May",
        "additional_details": "The Government should allow local authorities to determine their own meeting formats. Mass indoor meetings will still be inappropriate in May and councils will have difficulty finding venues that allow social distancing. Although it has been challenging to set up virtual meetings and there have been challenges for those who are digitally excluded, there have also been successes. Council meetings are now open to wider audiences and many report that meetings are more inclusive.",
        "background": "Give every local authority the power to use meeting formats that work best for their residents, whether in-person, virtual or a hybrid system. The current power to hold virtual meetings expires from 7th May & the Minister for Local Government has informed councils that it will not be extended.",
