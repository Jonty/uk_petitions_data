        "action": "Raise the Pension Credit income threshold to equivalent of National Living Wage",
        "additional_details": "Currently, most single pensioners with a weekly income of more than \u00a3182.60, or couples with a joint income of more than \u00a3278.70 per week, are not eligible for Pension Credit. This leaves too many pensioners losing out on the benefits of Pension Credit by being slightly over the qualifying income threshold, which is too low. If the threshold was raised, this would ensure all eligible pensioners were able to receive an income equivalent to the NLW, helping to lift more OAPs out of poverty.",
        "background": "The Government should raise the maximum income threshold to qualify for Pension Credit each year to match the equivalent of the National Living Wage, which is currently \u00a3356 per week based on a 37.5 hour week.",
