        "additional_details": "The government's 'illegal migration bill' will disporportionately affect Black and Brown people from countries formerly colonised by the UK. The UK's history of colonisation and exploitation is reflected in the predominantly post-colonial states which are the primary countries of origin of those seeking asylum in the UK. The UK should recognise its moral responsibility to create a fair asylum system as a form of reparations.",
        "background": "Protect the right to asylum and open safe routes for all refugees. \r\n\r\nThe government should allow safe routes for people to reach the UK so that no-one needs to risk their life in small boats. This will be more effective and ethical than criminalisng, detaining and deporting people.",
