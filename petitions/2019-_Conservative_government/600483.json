        "additional_details": "In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic something has gone amiss. Parents are being told via schools not to send children if they are unwell, however if your child is off school you can still be fined without good reason. Your child can be sent home with a sniffle and this is still logged as time off. If they are unwell with a sniffle it is not always necessary to take them to the doctors. \r\n\r\nThe pandemic is a good enough reason to look at this problem and I ask you to consider removing this power.",
        "background": "If your child is missing school without a good reason your local council can fine you, so I'm asking for a petition calling for these powers to be removed.",
