        "additional_details": "The financial situations students face are having negative effects on mental health and studies, according to a report by Student Beans. They found that 29% of students receive under \u00a35000 of student finance per year, two-thirds less than someone on minimum wage (working 37.5 hours a week), despite similar expenditures to budget for.\r\n\r\nGovernment support should help ensure students can afford to continue their education, and aren't forced to leave education due to current concerns around short-term finances\r\n",
        "background": "Inflated living costs are exceeding means-tested student loans, so the Government should increase support by extending the Cost of Living Payment to all students in higher education. Most students rely on Government loans, and should be entitled to a top up to help with the increased cost of living.",
