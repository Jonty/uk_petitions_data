        "additional_details": "We believe deep funding cuts, plus inflationary pressures and increased service demand, has caused council \u2018bankruptcies\u2019 at unprecedented rates.\r\nResulting service cuts can cause damage to the economy, reduced crime prevention, increased joblessness, pressure on charities, and reduced support for vulnerable people.\r\nWe also think that closing much of the council funded arts sector rips the heart out of our country.\r\nGovernment bailed out banks to save the economy. Now bail out the councils.\r\n",
        "background": "As Austerity\u2019s funding cuts bite into council finances, they are in serious financial distress and falling like skittles. Nottingham, Birmingham, Woking, Thurrock, Northumberland, Croydon, Slough and Northamptonshire have declared \"bankruptcy\" (section 114). Many more have stated they are at risk.",
