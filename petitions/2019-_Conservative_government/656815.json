It will help all students have the same attire regardless of their financial situations. We also believe that this will benefit schools as it will allow them to follow the British values of equality. School uniforms are a requirement and it may set families back further in their financial troubles. But by removing VAT it could help families with difficult financial situations to be treated equally.",
