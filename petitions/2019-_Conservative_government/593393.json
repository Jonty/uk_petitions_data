She soon became part of the Warship Preservation Trust which sadly collapsed, then on the 17 March 2016 she became somewhat submerged. There is a solid passion for this momentous minesweeper to be salvaged or partially preserved, it is a significant piece of this great countries Royal History that should be proudly celebrated.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to discuss and debate the destiny of this somewhat submerged member of Royal British history. We ask them to discuss the possibilities of dutiful salvage or if salvage is not an option, the respectful breaking of this vessel.",
