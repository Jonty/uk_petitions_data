        "additional_details": "Regulations should be adjusted to better protect individuals in accidents: many current seatbelt warning systems for rear seat passengers are only triggered when a buckled seatbelt is then unbuckled, therefore it is easily defeated by simply never buckling the seatbelt in the first place.",
        "background": "We believe there is a disparity in seatbelt usage between front and rear seats in cars. New cars should be required to have occupant sensors in rear seats, which trigger a warning if the seatbelt is unfastened in an occupied seat. Currently, only front seats are required to have occupant sensors.",
