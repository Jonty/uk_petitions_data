        "additional_details": "Along with this change, the minimum wage for other age groups should be raised to match, for example 18-20 should be raised to \u00a38.20, under 18s to \u00a37.50 etc.\r\n\r\nThese changes provide a fairer living wage for students working part time alongside full time education, and prevents new graduates trying to get work experience from being underpaid.",
