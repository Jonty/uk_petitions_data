        "additional_details": "Commonly-available modern sound amplification equipment is powerful. It can even produce infrasound: frequencies below many but not all human hearing ranges.\r\nSound causes harm to circulatory systems, brain development in children, it significantly lessens quality of life and shortens lifespans.\r\n'One off' parties even if exceding 90dB noise levels are essentially ignored by both Environmental Health and Police at present.\r\nMeanwhile Antisocial Behaviour left unchecked, escalates along with costs.",
        "background": "Have the police investigate noise nuisance allegations instead of Council Environmental health.\r\nGive police back the power to enforce instant remedial action once at the scene, if sound excedes specified thresholds.\r\nProvide funding to police to help them do this job, perhaps through fines.",
