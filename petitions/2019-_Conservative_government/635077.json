People can't afford to have to pay a monthly fee of \u00a310/20 then pay for any treatment in top. Nearly \u00a350 for just a check up (\u00a324 with NHS). This is unacceptable. People are suffering with bad oral problems, resorting to them taking drastic measures! \r\nHelp us look after our teeth!",
