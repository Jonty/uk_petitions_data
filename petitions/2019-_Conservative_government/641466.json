        "additional_details": "The Investigatory Powers Act was put into effect in 2016, granting the Home Office the power to gather information from its citizens (e.g., emails, texts & calls, online history) - a blatant infringement of our privacy and security, regardless of our actions. \r\n\r\nThe Home Office has now proposed even further measures, requiring social platforms to circumvent encryption to access users' messages, prompting companies like Apple to threaten withdrawing their services from the UK.\r\n\r\nReamend this act.",
        "background": "The Investigatory Powers Act has always been criticised for the UK Government's seemingly lack of concern and consideration for the privacy and security of its citizens, but these new proposed changes are disgraceful. We demand you reevaluate them before our nation becomes a surveillance state.",
