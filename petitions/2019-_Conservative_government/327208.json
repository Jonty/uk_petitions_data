        "additional_details": "With many parents furloughed and struggling, Branded school uniforms costing around \u00a3200 per child, should be no longer a requirement of attending schools. \r\nThis will create a barrier to education if parents on 80% wages are unable to afford it, and many children may then not be able to attend education at all, or face detentions and punishments for something out of their control.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to ask the government to ban compulsory branded uniform due to the impact of Covid19 on families.",
        "background": "Ban branded uniform for the academic year 2020/2021, at least, preferably altogether, as Covids impact will be long lasting, with parents getting into debt to cover essential living.",
