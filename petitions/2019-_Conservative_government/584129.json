        "additional_details": "Recently my daughter has been refused access to all local schools. Special schools are not right for her, but she is too high need for EMS and mainstream. So where does she go - we have a gap in the system for some children.\r\n \r\nMore special needs provisions are needed for children who may not have a learning disability, and just need to learn in a different way. We need more funding in local authorities so children like my daughter are given the best shot at an education like any other child.",
        "background": "Changes need to be made so more funding is available for schools and local authorities to offer better provisions for SEN children, especially those who do not fit the criteria for special needs EMS/mainstream schools. So no other child falls through the system.",
