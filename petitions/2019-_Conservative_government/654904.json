        "additional_details": "We want the Government to not take any further military action against Houthis in Yemen, and not to join the USA's international maritime coalition. There have been widespread concerns that Israel\u2019s action in Gaza constitutes a war crime, and the majority of the UN voted for a ceasefire. We believe further military action or UK membership of this coalition will lead to more conflict, more deaths, and more ecological and environmental problems now and for future generations. Help stop this fight, do not add to it.",
        "background": "The current Prime Minister authorised airstrikes against the Houthi Rebels in Yemen as they attack the flow of ships in the Red Sea, as a response to Israel's attacks in Palestine. The United States of America has also launched a maritime coalition and the UK is joining.",
