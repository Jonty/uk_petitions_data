This measure helps relieve the pressure from them. The RAF airlift capability will allow transport with MERT elements. They can be housed temporary through the immigration system with removal of illegal immigrants overstaying in hotels.\r\n\r\nThe Russians simply do not care about civilian casualties, there is a humanitarian duty to care for wounded, the vulnerable and the young.",
        "background": "The situation regarding the Ukraine conflict has become far worse, it is only a matter of time before they are overwhelmed with casualties. The RAF could supply airlift from Poland to RAF Northolt and ferry wounded to hospitals. The Army Medical Reserves could be deployed to help treat the wounded.",
