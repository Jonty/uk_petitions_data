        "action": "Make NHS staff pay rises the same percentage as MP pay rises each year.",
        "additional_details": "Each year there is debate and controversy about NHS and MP pay rises. We often see MP's award themselves 11% pay increases whilst freezing public sector pay. This causes massive damage to hard workers in society and creates a clear double standard for MPs. This is wholly unexceptable as MPs are ultimately public sector workers too.\r\nI feel that by having this in place we can ensure that the people looking after us and our interests are all treated fairly.",
        "background": "I would like parliament to link MP and NHS pay rises. \r\nSo to clarify, this would mean that if MP's awarded themselves a 5% pay rise NHS staff get 5% pay rise the same year.",
