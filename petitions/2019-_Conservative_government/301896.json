        "additional_details": "As the government has the power to, I want target grades to be given to all secondary school pupils undergoing GCSE\u2019s as the grade they will get will not be the grade they can achieve, the target grades are a great middle ground and will support pupils health and safety and not force them to over work and stress while all around COVID-19 is scaring some people. Overall I think schools should be closed and if they do, schools will miss GCSE\u2019s so they should be given the target grades.",
        "background": "Amidst the hysteria of a worldwide pandemic, pupils of secondary schools who have to go under the stress of GCSE\u2019s should be given their target grades. I know that if my school closes my grade will be hindered greatly as I do not have the correct learning facilities at home to revise everything.",
