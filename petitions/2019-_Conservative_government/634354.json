        "additional_details": "Research has previously found that around 2.4% of the student population in the UK have autism - and less than 40% of these individuals complete their course at University. Those on the spectrum are nearly 10 times more likely to drop out of University. These statistics do not even consider those that are put off from applying to University. We believe universities still fail to truly cater for the needs of neurodiverse students. These statistics, and heartfelt stories, show that training and awareness is urgently needed.",
        "background": "I often hear stories of autistic students being let down by - i.e. reasonable adjustments not being granted, or staff treating them in a discriminatory manner. Through my research I found there is a lack of training. I'd like to see mandatory training for university staff at all universities.",
