        "action": "Ensure that the EHIC scheme remains available to UK citizens after Brexit.",
        "additional_details": "For many people with serious or chronic health conditions travel insurance can be expensive and insurers may refuse to cover certain conditions. If EHIC is no longer available for British citizens after Brexit it is likely insurance premiums will increase, and travel to the EU may no longer be an option for some. Switzerland, despite not being a member of the EU, still recognises the EHIC scheme. A similar arrangement should be possible for the UK.",
        "background": "The EHIC scheme has brought peace of mind and security of basic health care to UK travellers in the EU and vice versa. So far there appears to be no intent to ensure continuation of the programme post-Brexit. The UK must work with the EU to ensure that the EHIC scheme continues post-Brexit.",
