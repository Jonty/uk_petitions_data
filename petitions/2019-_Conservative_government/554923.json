        "additional_details": "Elected members deserve to be able to do their job without distraction: however, when the UK is in teetering on dramatic economic change, the representatives of the British people should not receive a pay rise.\r\n\r\nWe understand that all wages must rise with inflation. However, many will agree that MP wages, combined with expenses, may already be quite comfortable. To further this puts MPs distances them more and more from their electorate, which implicitly harms democracy.",
        "background": "We appreciate what MPs do for our country. But in this trying time, when both COVID-19 and Brexit will shake up the country, our tax money should not be siphoned from the NHS to MP wages in a proposed change in April 2021.",
