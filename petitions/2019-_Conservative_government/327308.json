Students who have completed GCSE's and/or A Levels are equally well equipped to tackle university and are more likely to remain in the UK and contribute their skills thereafter.",

The current 5-year residency requirement is arbitrary and prohibitive towards academically gifted but financially disadvantaged students.",
