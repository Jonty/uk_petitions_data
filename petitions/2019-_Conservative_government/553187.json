        "additional_details": "Being able to travel with a pet in cabin would avoid the stress of sending it as cargo. It would also be simpler and less costly. \r\nIt is Currently possible to bring pets into the UK by boat, ferry or the Eurotunnel without a fee so this should be extended to aircraft. \r\nOther countries allow in cabin pets and it would not affect the safety of the passengers or pose health risks to the UK.",
        "background": "It is currently prohibited to bring pets in cabin on flights into the UK. The only option is to bring animals as cargo in the hold which can be distressing for both the owner and the pet. It is also much more expensive.",
