        "additional_details": "There has recently been a report done by Sports England that states that only 23% of disabled people are able to do 30 minutes of exercise once a day 5 times a week due to restrictions placed on them by lockdown rules. With the current rules allowing able bodied people to go out for a walk and exercise once a day this is leaving disabled people behind. Not only is this somewhat discriminative, surely a healthier and happier amount of disabled people is better for the nation as a whole.",
        "background": "The government restrictions make disabled sport exempt from the lockdown rules. However there is a disconnect between this rule and those for facilities that would allow this to take place as they have to close under the rules effectively not allowing disabled people to stay healthy during lockdown.",
