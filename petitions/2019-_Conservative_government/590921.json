        "additional_details": "While we recognise that it is important for society and the economy to be able to return to more pre-COVID ways of working, we must remain mindful and aware of the continuing risks of COVID.\r\nIn order to allow the full opening of the economy, whilst also protecting the public and the NHS, a really simple measure is to maintain the requirement to wear a mask or face covering in enclosed public spaces. COVID is not gone, and we risk further mutations by allowing it to spread unchecked.",
        "background": "As lockdown restrictions continue to be lifted, we ask that the requirement to wear a face covering in enclosed public spaces is kept in place, to help protect the public and our NHS. Keeping this final measure in place will help prevent a severe increase in cases and reduce deaths.",
