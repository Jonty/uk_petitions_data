        "additional_details": "The TCA allows for the suspension of the agreement by either side if there are \"serious and systemic deficiencies\" by the other party \"as regards the protection of fundamental rights or the principle of the rule of law\". Both the EU parliament and the European Commission have recognized a serious breach of \"EU values, principles and law\" in recent Hungarian legislation that infringes the rights of LGTBQ people. The UK must use its leverage in the TCA to support LGBT rights in Europe.",
        "background": "The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) stipulates that both parties must respect human rights, the rule of law and democracy. The UK must suspend the TCA until EU member states cease anti-LGBT legislation, notably in Hungary.",
