        "additional_details": "Hospitals are closed to visitors and patients are faced with boredom lying in a bed.  Most hospitals have a pay by the day TV which is quite expensive and does put people off using them. \r\n\r\nKeeping them in touch with the outside world and what's happening is so important and an assistance to their recovery. Please consider covering the cost of the use of bedside TV and free newspapers to hospital patients during the Coronavirus restrictions. Thank you",
