        "additional_details": "This is something that was imposed by the government, understandably, but could be regulated properly without having to ban the sale of this product completely. It was made for a reason, and should be used for it\u2019s primary purpose. If someone is trying to pharmacy shop, they should flag up on a system, so they have to wait until their three months is up before they can purchase the product. Should also be linked to an address to stop multiple people buying it for one person to sell.",
        "background": "Went to get some cough syrup, was told they don\u2019t sell it anymore, there\u2019s a new product that doesn\u2019t personally work, has an ingredient my girlfriend is allergic to, had a discussion with the pharmacist and we agreed it is unfair those who need their medicine can\u2019t get it due to people abusing it.",
