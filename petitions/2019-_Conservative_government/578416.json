This can only be addressed by Cultural Competency training being rolled out across the police and other government agencies. Without specialised training, it is practically impossible to support, or risk assess black women. This often puts black victims at increased risk. ",

Police and agencies should have culturally appropriate training to better understand the cultural needs of black women affected by domestic abuse.",
