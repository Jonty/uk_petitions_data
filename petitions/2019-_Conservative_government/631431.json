        "additional_details": "Ramblers enjoy around 98% of unsurfaced countryside routes already vehicle free. With footpaths and Bridleways. Horses and cyclists have around 22% vehicle free with Bridleway access. It would appear the Government of 2006 folded to pressure from extremist anti vehicle groups. Legal and responsible Motorcycle trail riders for example, use hotels, cafe's and fuel on their weekends away. They contribute massively to the local rural economy and deserve to be treated fairly. 2% is not enough.",
        "background": "The NERC act 2006 caused incredible hardship to motor vehicle users who seek access from the unsurfaced countryside legal routes. Downgrading through this act removed the already limited legal access from around 5% to just 2%. We ask the Govenment to change Restricted Byways to allow vehicles again.",

This Act does not ban vehicle traffic on byways, but does give National Park authorities powers to control traffic on byways in National Parks in England and Wales.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
