This campaign could include signs and art around sports stadiums and the local area to promote anti-racism in sport. The Government should also create stronger punishments for those who are found being racist.\r\n \r\nWe want a better society to live in in the future. Too many people have experienced racial slurs at football games and we can\u2019t even imagine how those players must feel when all they are doing is providing entertainment and doing their job. We want a future where racism is in history and is not a part of our daily lives, as it is today.\r\n",
