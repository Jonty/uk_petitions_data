        "additional_details": "Students have not been given the education they paid for. They did not begin their degrees knowing this would happen and did not agree to pay for this standard of education, a standard they were told was inadequate when they were able to attend in person teaching. Most universities refuse to protect grades which will leave this graduating class at a disadvantage when competing with others for employment.",
        "background": "It is not at all fair to continue charging \u00a39,250 for an education equivalent to the open university experience. As the request to reduce this fee has been refused, removing interest on loan repayments, at least for the academic years 19/20-20/21, should be the next thing the government considers.",
