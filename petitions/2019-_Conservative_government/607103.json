I personally consider leasehold as an offend, where a person who pays mortgage has to go through lots of challenges created by freeholder to bully them. Leasehold is a direct attack on peoples\u2019 right to live freely inside their own flats. Leasehold is suffocating the leaseholders & making their lives havoc.",
        "background": "Government must pass a bill to end the leasehold system & make them freehold for all the people in UK. Maximum of freeholders are abusing, threatening & bullying leaseholders. They\u2019re paying huge amounts of money for those buildings\u2019 maintenance, mortgages, insurances and ground rents.Please end it!",
