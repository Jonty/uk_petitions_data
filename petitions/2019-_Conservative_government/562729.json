        "action": "Take back responsibility for funding free licences for over 75s from the BBC",
        "additional_details": "This petition is supported by Silver Voices, which has been leading the protests against the scrapping of free TV licences for the over 75s. Over one million over 75s' households are either refusing, or are unable, to pay the \u00a3157-50 fee. Many will have to choose between heating, food and their constant companion the TV. Poverty and loneliness will increase among older people as a result of this cruel policy. Both the Government and the BBC have broken their pledges to keep this benefit.",
        "background": "The BBC has proved incapable of managing and funding the concessionary licence scheme for the over 75s. It axed the scheme, ignored mass protests and has no democratic accountability. Government should be politically accountable for benefits, not a media company. Take back control.",
