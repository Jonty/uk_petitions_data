        "additional_details": "'Psychological experts' without the necessary qualifications and experience are sometimes instructed to act as expert witnesses in the family court, causing harm to the public. Unqualified and unregulated professionals should not be allowed to make diagnosis and recommendations for families. The media also uses unqualified and unregulated 'psychologists' to provide opinion on a range of topics on which they have little training or qualification. This could lead to large scale harm to the public.",
        "background": "The title \u2018psychologist\u2019 is not protected within UK law, as it is elsewhere.  Anyone can call themselves a \u2018psychologist\u2019. There are insufficiently qualified, unregulated people practising as \u2018psychologists\u2019 or offering 'psychological' therapy, potentially putting the public at risk of harm.",
