        "action": "Stop trans youth being outed in schools",
        "additional_details": "This new policy is very similar to the one made in some states of America which has eventually led to a huge rise in hate against trans people and many other laws enacted after this one putting trans people in the way of harm. Not only this but this policy alone endangers children's lives by having them forcibly outed to their possibly transphobic parents causing a significant rise in child abuse and children being disowned. This rise is something our care system can't currently handle.",
        "background": "There is a new policy being issued by Rishi Sunak and the Conservative government that allows trans youth to be outed to their parents by teachers. This needs to be stopped for the safety of trans youth",
