        "action": "Require mandatory training on ASD/ADHD and SEND for teachers",
        "additional_details": "Teachers are the proffesionals who see children every day. Currently many SEND children are identified as \"problems\" or \"naughty\" before diagnosis and diagnosis often occurs when things have reached critical points and other proffesionals brought in and notice the traits. If teachers were trained to identify and work with SEND and notice ADHD and Autism traits, for example, early, then it leads to earlier more effective management and support immediately creating money saving long term.",
        "background": "Under current circumstances teachers are not required to have this training. This can cause long term cost to other services due to later diagnosis when things do go wrong as well as SEND children treated and labeled as disruptive rather than having a SEND which effects children's self perception.",
