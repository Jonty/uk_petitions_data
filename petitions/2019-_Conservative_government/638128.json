Many of us with eating disorders can latch onto numbers, triggering negative thought patterns, filtering down to harmful behaviours that potentially put lives at risk.\r\n \r\nPeople desperately fighting eating disorders are constantly faced with barriers, such as calories on food packaging or menus, which can make it difficult for us to make healthy choices and take small steps towards recovery, which are vitally important for our physical and mental health.\r\n",
