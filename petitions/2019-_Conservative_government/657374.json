        "additional_details": "The Government is supposed to work for the people to ensure we have what we need. We believe energy companies are taking advantage of their position to supply a commodity people cannot live without. Companies are making substantial profits off people who have no choice but to pay high prices for energy. British Gas profits have increased from \u00a372m in 2022 to \u00a3751m in 2023. According to recent estimates, in the UK, 13% of households in England, 20% in Scotland, 14% in Wales, and 24% in Northern Ireland are in fuel poverty.",
        "background": "In recent years energy prices have shot up. This has been justified by Ofgem on the basis of increases in wholesale prices for gas and electricity, but with some companies making record profits we want the Government to review the energy sector, how prices are set, and what profits are made.",
