        "action": "Get Ofqual to re-evaluate their decisions behind GCSE and exam grades",
        "additional_details": "On 03/04/2020, Ofqual decided to release a publication which outlined how they will decide final assessment grades for GCSE, AS and A level students. Students have also been kept out with the results and material that will be used to decide these grades.\r\n\r\nSchools and colleges are also taking it upon themselves to give false information behind what will happen, including setting work with the pretence that it will contribute to grades. There is a lack of clarity between students and schools.",
        "background": "We want a fairer assessment of what will be done for those students impacted by the grades, not only Year 11 and 13, but those Year 10 students that were also due to sit examinations in 2020, or had coursework that contributed to the 2020 examination series.",
