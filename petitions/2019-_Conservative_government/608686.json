        "additional_details": "Poverty is endemic and impacts the lives of millions of families in the UK. Additional financial hardship for parents who have had their children temporarily removed by children's services is unfair and counterproductive to the principles of always seeking reunification for children with their birth families. This must change systemically to give all parents a fairer chance to create and sustain environments to support their children returning to them.",
        "background": "Currently, parents who have children temporarily removed by children's social care face sanctions in their benefits. This is an additional and unnecessary burden on parents attempting to get their children returned to them. Benefits should remain fixed until final arrangements for children are made.",
