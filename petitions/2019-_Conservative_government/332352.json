        "additional_details": "The Governments response to this recommendation is that a \"retrospective assessment of the EU Referendum is not necessary\". If the Government has nothing to fear of the potential findings then what harm would it do. And, if it does have something to fear, it is even more reason that an inquiry be held. The protection of our country should be the primary responsibility of the state. As a democratic state, the government must be seen to be doing its job. The state is nothing without public trust.",
