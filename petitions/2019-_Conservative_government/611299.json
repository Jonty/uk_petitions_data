        "additional_details": "The Government should set up a scheme to continue to fund their research in the UK, and to provide financial support for them while in the UK.\r\n \r\nHumanitarian reasons: Scientists and their families fleeing the war are in desperate need of support.\r\n \r\nScience diplomacy: Scientists in exile build bridges that provide benefits long after a war is over. The UK would profit long-term even from a temporary funding scheme.\r\n \r\nUK self-interest: Ukranian scientists are involved in international projects crucial for the UK. The war interrupts and delays their work for an unknown period of time. We should support them to remedy this disruption.",
        "background": "Hundreds of scientists are fleeing the war in Ukraine. They don't know when they will be able to return and continue their work. Often their research is crucial for projects in which the UK is involved. We urge the government to provide temporary funding to support these scientists in the UK.",
