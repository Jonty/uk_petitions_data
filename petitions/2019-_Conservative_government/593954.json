        "action": "Implement a ban on electric shock collars for dogs, and outlaw sales in the UK",
        "additional_details": "These collars have already been outlawed by one of the Devolved Governments as cruel and unnecessary, but so far not in England. The Government in 2018, announced a ban on the use of hand held remote-controlled devices in England as secondary legislation under the Animal Welfare Act. However, there has been a disappointing delay in introducing this legislation. In addition, these devices are still widely available for sale, especially online in the UK, and any legislation needs to include a ban on their sale",
        "background": "Enact and implement a ban, promised by the then Environment Secretary, Michael Gove on these cruel, pain-inflicting training electric shock dog collars, that cause unnecessary suffering to animals. This has been introduced in Wales already. Make their sale in the UK illegal.",
