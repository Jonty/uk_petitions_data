        "additional_details": "The Government has increased the restrictions primarily relating to education. Those wishing to take advantage of the stamp duty holiday should be given further time to take advantage of the scheme. With the population being encouraged to work from home & children being homeschooled, this will decrease the pressure on all those involved in the process. In addition, due to the new strain, it will allow more time to view properties safely.",
        "background": "The deadline should be moved to the 30th June 2021 given the recent lockdown. This will allow all parties in the chain who are adhering to the requirements sufficient time to conclude transactions safely.",
