I have lived in Runcorn for most of my life, and have worked there since 2008. I now travel from St. Helens and this has a real impact on my quality of life due to the unwarranted additional costs I incur each month.",

People coming to work in these towns are already directly contributing to the area by working there and spending money in shops etc, and to be charged \u00a32.00+ per crossing is too much.",
