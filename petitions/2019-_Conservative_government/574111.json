So instead of wasting sunshine while most of us are still asleep, let's enjoy it in the afternoon and evening during March.\r\nSunrise in Birmingham, (for example), would still be no later than 7:54am after 28th February, so any children walking to school should still be doing so in daylight - twilight would begin at 7:19am.",
