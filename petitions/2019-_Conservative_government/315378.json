        "additional_details": "Whilst a pay reshuffle happened under Hunt - some got 6.5% over three years - this is only 0.3% rise when inflation is taken into consideration to 2020/21. Also, this is short term planning - there's no evidence that this commitment will continue. Therefore NHS workers' pay rises will continue at 1%. For those at the top of bandings, this is particularly unacceptable. Coronavirus has shown how vital NHS workers are - the least they deserve is a wage that reflects their value.",
        "background": "NHS workers are vital to our country. Over the last decade their wages have barely increased - from 2011 to 2013 pay freezes, and since then 1%. This is below inflation, creating an effective pay cut and squeezing NHS worker livelihoods.",
