The public should be told why a litter tax is needed, as a consequence of irresponsible behaviour.\r\n\r\nI think this could help make our country less untidy. In other countries litter is hardly seen due to apparent better social behaviour and better methods to keep fields and roadsides clean. Look at any roadside or motorway verge, and see the levels of non-stop rubbish discarded. These items get into stream and rivers, and make our roads, towns and countryside so shabby. Use the revenue generated to create jobs and clean the country up.",
        "background": "A sales tax should be imposed on all products whose packaging can only be used once, such as drinks cans and plastic wrappers. The revenue should then be used to help clean up the environment and prevent plastics and other items getting into rivers and oceans. ",

In their report, MPs called on the Government to restrict the amount of plastic that can be exported from the UK. They also called on the Government to step up the enforcement of existing rules to prevent criminal gangs illegally exporting and dumping UK-produced waste.\u00a0\nRead the Committee's report reducing plastic waste (https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/31509/documents/176742/default/)\nRead a press release about the report (https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/52/environment-food-and-rural-affairs-committee/news/174191/mps-call-for-ban-on-all-plastic-waste-exports/)\nThe report follows a series of evidence sessions earlier this year, where the Committee questions representatives from charities, environmental campaigners and commercial trade experts. At these sessions the Committee explored:\nwhether the Government\u2019s current ambitions to reduce plastic waste were enough\nhow alternatives to plastic consumption can be identified and supported\nhow England's current plastic exports impact other countries.\nFind out more about the Committee's inquiry into plastic waste (https://committees.parliament.uk/work/1391/plastic-waste/) and read oral evidence from the Committee's inquiry (https://committees.parliament.uk/work/1391/plastic-waste/publications/).\nWhat is the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee?\u00a0\nThe Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee is a cross-party group of backbench MPs that scrutinises the administration, spending and policy of the Government\u2019s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.\u00a0\nFind out more about the Committee (https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/365/business-energy-and-industrial-strategy-committee/)\nFollow the Committee on Twitter (https://twitter.com/CommonsEFRA) for updates on its work.\n\u00a0\nThe Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee is a select committee.
