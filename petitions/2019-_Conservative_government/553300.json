        "additional_details": "The cinema industry generates \u00a31.25 billion in UK box office revenue alone each year. It provides employment to tens of thousands. Current Coronavirus guidelines have put a tremendous strain on the industry and led to numerous delays to film releases. Although these measures are unavoidable to protect public health this is leading to the closure of whole chains of cinemas and thousands of employees now face unemployment in an industry which will thrive again in the future if supported.",
        "background": "More support is required to protect cinema operators and cinema employees. With the recent news that Cineworld are to temporarily close, thousands of employees are at risk of job loss as the proposed Job Support Scheme is not a viable option for the industry.",
