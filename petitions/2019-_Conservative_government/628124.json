        "action": "Restrict domestic fireworks to low noise and for use on bonfire night/NYE only.",
        "additional_details": "Every year, many people, pets, horses and livestock are affected by loud fireworks that are not just limited to specific nights a year. Not only the noise, but fireworks can often end up flying into fields with livestock in, leaving cartons around as well as potentially causing significant injury. No/low noise would reduce the distress caused significantly and licensed events are usually advertised so families and animal owners can plan accordingly to protect themselves or their animals.",
        "background": "Only allow the sale of no/low noise fireworks for domestic use, and ban the use of domestic fireworks unless on Bonfire night or New Years Eve. Loud fireworks and displays on any other night should be at licensed events only.",
