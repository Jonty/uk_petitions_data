        "additional_details": "The production of synthetic fuels could help make transport carbon neutral, which would help the UK government reach their carbon dioxide emissions target of the Paris Agreement.\r\n \r\nDeveloping synthetic fuel that can be used by existing engines without modification would mean that those who enjoy driving petrol/diesel vehicles would be able to continue doing so in a way that won't threaten the environment.\r\n \r\nRefueling a car is much more time-efficient than electric cars, and much of the electricity supply used to charge electric vehicles is still produced by fossil fuel power stations.",
        "background": "Government needs to cut carbon emissions and the development and use of synthetic fuels could help. Synthetic fuels could help make transport carbon neutral so the Government should fund research and development into synthetic fuels that can be used by current car engines without modification.",
