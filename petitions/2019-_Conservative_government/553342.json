        "additional_details": "The Government should reform school food standards to require schools to make a variety of plant based meal options available on a daily basis. \r\n \r\nMeat and dairy products are often unhealthier and have a significantly higher carbon footprint than plant based equivalents.\r\n \r\nYounger people need to become more comfortable with plant based equivalents as it becomes increasingly important to move towards more sustainable living.\r\n \r\nIt is difficult for children to avoid meat or dairy based products without calling out their specific dietary requirements. This, despite it being thought that up to 75% of people are affected by lactose intolerance.",
        "background": "Many school lunches revolve around processed meat or dairy based options. Plant based meals are rare, if available at all.",
