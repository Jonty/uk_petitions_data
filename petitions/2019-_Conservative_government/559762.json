        "additional_details": "We have carried on throughout two lockdowns.  We have catered for those learning at home, taken care of the vulnerable and key worker children which has been a direct support for those working in the NHS and key worker roles.\r\nIf the Prime Minister would direct these closures, it would mean that all members of school communities in England would be able to quarantine long enough to ensure that they were COVID free before Christmas; making it much safer to visit older relatives.",
        "background": "Presently, all schools are open until 18th December, one week before Christmas.  We all have family that we have hardly seen this year due to COVID. We would like to be able to see them on Christmas Day so we would need to self-Isolate for two weeks.",
