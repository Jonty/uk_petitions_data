        "action": "Change the law regarding people carrying and using knives",
        "additional_details": "There are far to many people mainly teenage boys carrying knives as either a gang culture thing or as protection from other teens who they see as a threat or from a rival gang. We have tonight had a sixteen year old boy stabbed to death on his way home from school with four individuals arrested soon after. It is becoming an all too familiar story lately both locally and nationally and something needs to change to try to deter this from becoming an even bigger problem than it currently is.",
        "background": "I want the government to change the law and the sentencing handed down to individuals who use and carry knives including much tougher sentences for carrying and a minimum life sentence for killing someone.",
