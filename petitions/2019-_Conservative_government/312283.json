This is not means tested, as such employee's savings are not taken in to account and are protected.  This is not a fair outcome for the Self Employed that have lost their ability to work due. They should not have to use their savings when employed people do not.",

This means those Self Employed people that you have directed to UC for housing or income support who have savings need to draw down on their savings first.",
