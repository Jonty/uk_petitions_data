        "additional_details": "The WHO recommends a public health strategy in dealing  with the COVID19 epidemic which includes extensive testing, tracing of contacts and isolation of those exposed to the virus.  This proved successful in China, South Korea and elsewhere. In Vo in Italy this approach achieved complete elimination of the disease.\r\n\r\nCurrent testing in England is only sufficient to locate cases of the COVID19 disease in seriously unwell in-patients - too little to get NHS staff back to work or follow WHO advice.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, call on the Government to increase the\r\navailability of testing for live SARS-COV-2 virus, the cause of COVID19 (commonly called Coronavirus) to enable a thorough campaign of testing, tracing of contacts and isolation of those exposed to the virus and to carry it through.",
