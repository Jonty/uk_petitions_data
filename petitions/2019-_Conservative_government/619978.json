        "additional_details": "So many children suffer terrible anxiety about sports day.  This results in them either missing school and being marked down in attendance or feeling shamed or ridiculed by having to take part.  It's no different to making every child sit a maths/science test while everyone else (including other family members) watches who struggles and comes last. Please make sports day optional for those who want to take part. \r\nI want the government to make it optional so that children can confidently remain in school and chose to do something else that day. I hear over and over again the stress caused for so long beforehand and afterwards from sports day. There seems to be only the \"sporty\" children that enjoy it.",
