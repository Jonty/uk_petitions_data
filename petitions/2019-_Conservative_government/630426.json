        "additional_details": "Because some people think 2  male dominant breeds for eg a staffordshire bull terrier & a American bully will do whays in its nature, which is being the most dominant dog as a wolf and a pack of wolves, sounds nasty to people but it just makes people who don't know about dogs nasty, so they have no knowledge of dogs, as it is normal for 2 male dogs to see who will lead the pack, doesn't cause harm or turn nasty, seems nastier than it actually is, this is why I think we all need licences to own dogs",
        "background": "Make it a law to make sure if you own a dog you have to prove you know enough about all breeds to have a license, this should make only good owners with knowledge of dogs behaviour",
