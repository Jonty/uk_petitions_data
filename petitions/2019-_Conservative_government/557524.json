        "additional_details": "A second national lockdown is imposed to help slow the rate of COVID-19 spreading beyond the NHS's capacity to cope with cases. However, closing gyms, pools, dance and yoga studios is going to cause a mental health crisis that will be as detrimental to the NHS and will cause an overload of mental health patients needing to be dealt with over the Christmas 2020 and in to 2021 period. Classifying gyms as Essential Businesses under mental health reasons would save so many people.",
        "background": "Gyms, movement studios, swimming pools are allowing people to work out and keep our mental health in check. Just as food vendors are classed as essential businesses for physical health, gyms provide the same for mental health and should be classified the same way.",
