The system you have implemented isn't doing that it's making those people it's meant to help worse off. Change the payment calendar to 4 weekly instead of monthly, as at the moment extra payments in a month can make you lose entitlement. This month of zero UC isn't helping anyone it's meant to instead it creates or deepens poverty. Fix this broken system for once and all.",
