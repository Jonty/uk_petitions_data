        "additional_details": "As stated above. If a mandatory temperature check is made upon entering any store, the risk of an infected customer is less likely. I wish for the government to consider this because there are still people that feel unsafe about going into a store. Some stores have very poor policies in place in regards to social distancing and signage. A thermometer isn't expensive and the industry in question can easily afford to do this.",
        "background": "Some UK industries have been rolling out temperature checks on entry such as theme parks, bars and entertainment venues. It makes sense for this to be implemented in all stores for a safer shopping experience as there is no track and trace set up in the industry as yet.",
