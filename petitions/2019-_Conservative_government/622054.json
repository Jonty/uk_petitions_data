        "additional_details": "Certain airlines (e.g. RyanAir) are getting away with charging extra money for anything more than a small bag on standard-sized airplanes, and charging significantly more money if wanting to check-in bags (often outwith customers' control due to such vast differences in hand baggage policies between airlines). This is ludicrous and another way of squeezing money out of the poorest customers. Given the past two years of COVID-19 and now the cost of living crisis, any little money goes a long way.",
        "background": "All airlines should be forced to allow passengers one 10kg bag/suitcase of the same dimensions as cabin baggage. Similarly, any baggage being checked in should cost what it did at time of booking (e.g., if at time of booking extra baggage cost \u00a320, it should cost \u00a320 at the airport).",
