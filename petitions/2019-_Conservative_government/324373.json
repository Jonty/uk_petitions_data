        "additional_details": "During the current social climate, it is obvious more people need to be educated about the ways in which the Western world has impacted the lives of those living in the Eastern parts of the world. This impact is prevelant today and it is important to understand that the BAME members in their community suffer disadvantages due to this part of history. It will allow for greater understanding of cultures and open dialogue about race that is missing within British schools.",
        "background": "We would like the government to make the teaching of Black History in secondary school beyond Martin Luther King. We would like an entire history module dedicated to the Transatlantic African Slave Trade, Colonialism and The British Commonwealth and it\u2019s impact around the globe.",
