As a result the Covid safety measures implemented in gyms are thorough and effective. \r\nGym users are motivated to take care of their health so adherence  to safety measures is very high.\r\nThe great health and well being benefits of any type of exercise are well documented and gyms provide the facilities and supportive communities to motivate people to exercise regularly",

We dont want the government to automatically shut down gyms again along with pubs, restaurants and shops, but to consider the proven benefits of gyms to public health.",
