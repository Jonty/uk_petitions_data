This is also included in the summer months when the heating and hot water won\u2019t be used as much. We have also suffered from no heating and hot water for days during the coldest months of the year due to the demand of heating.\r\n \r\nOur council chooses the temperature of our hot water supply, meaning that we don't know if it\u2019s going to be too cold for bathing or our homes are going to be heated enough on the colder days/months.\r\n",
