        "additional_details": "Our wonderful NHS and Emergency Services are held together by a core of dedicated workers. However, many vital workers such as healthcare assistants, care workers, 999 & NHS Direct phone operators and hospital cleaners do not receive a proper living wage. The recent Covid-19 outbreak has shown us the value of these workers. The least we can do in return is guarantee a wage that prevents these workers from relying on food banks or second jobs to ensure their own and their family's well being.",
        "background": "I call upon the Government to pay all NHS and Emergency Services workers at least the Real Living Wage, calculated by the Living Wage Foundation. Currently, this stands at \u00a39.30p/h across the UK & \u00a310.75 in London. This new minimum wage should increase in line with increases in the Real Living Wage.",
