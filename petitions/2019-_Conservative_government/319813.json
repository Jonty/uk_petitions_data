For parents of primary school age children and below this will have presented a near impossible challenge with the potential for tension with all but the most understanding of employers.",
        "background": "This petition is for parents of children age 11 and below to be included as a protected characteristic under equality law, so parents of young children cannot be unfairly discriminated against, particularly at work and especially for redundancy programmes as a result of the coronavirus lockdown.",
