        "action": "Allow cats and dogs on the aeroplane cabin of flights to and from the UK.",
        "additional_details": "It is estimated that around 44% of UK households have pets. For many, pets are deemed as an extended family member. The current travel rules are too restrictive and prohibit travel to and from the UK. This is because placing pets with hold luggage is deemed as a non-viable option, as it has been proven that this is an incredibly traumatic experience for pets. We ask that the law be revised so that pets meeting a reasonable set of criteria be allowed to travel in the aeroplane cabin.",
        "background": "Change the rules around pet travel so that pets that meet a certain set of criteria i.e. have proper documentation and all their vaccinations, can travel in the cabin with their owners.",
