        "additional_details": "Across the UK millions of people will be facing an impossible choice this winter, will they choose to feed themselves and their children or keep them warm. The current government's plans go nowhere near far enough to help avert this crisis. The amount of windfall tax needs to be increased and applied retroactively for the entirety of 2022. Instead of creating policy with shareholders in mind the government needs to start thinking about those facing poverty this winter.",
        "background": "The current windfall tax only applies from when it was introduced and will not apply to the billions in profits that the energy companies have made so far this year. It is also a tiny 25% and should be increased to 50%. Use the funds raised to help those across the UK to cope this winter.",
