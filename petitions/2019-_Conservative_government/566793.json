        "additional_details": "During lockdown, I feel that with Covid-19, there is enough stress and worrying about catching and transmitting the disease to loved ones. Furthermore, online learning is a stress to all, with students not having motivation at home to work, therefore leading to a lack of work being fully understood. In my opinion school should be postponed till it is safe for schools to re-open and students have had the chance to have a mental break from schoolwork. Thank you and please consider this.",
        "background": "Online learning being used to teach while students or teachers alike are in lockdown or isolating from others due to Covid or other illnesses, but it is more of a stress-inducing task more than it is educational, which is why i feel a break from work is needed for students.",
