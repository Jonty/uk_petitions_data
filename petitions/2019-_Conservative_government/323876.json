        "additional_details": "There have recently been some disastrous effects from the poor disposal of these barbeques (see the recent Wareham Forest fire, fires in the New Forest, etc.). This has caused irreparable damage to the environment and nature. There have also been a huge amount of emergency service resources used needlessly due to the irresponsible users of these barbeques. These resources would be better spent on those who actually need it.",
        "background": "The government should ban the sale and use of disposable barbeques. They are a huge risk to nature and the environment, and are very rarely used responsibly. The local councils do not provide adequate disposal areas for these barbeques. This creates a huge risk to the surroundings when left.",
