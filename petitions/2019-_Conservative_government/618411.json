        "action": "Allow people to use Pepper Gas as self-defence",
        "additional_details": "Self defence in England is very poor. Every day we hear about people being bullied, beaten or murdered. We can stop this if we will have opportunity to self defence. We are living in times when danger situation happens even in small villages during the day. Millions of people could be saved if they will have something to protect themselves. I also know that if pepper spray will be in bad hands, or someone will want to make fun of it there is an option to prosecute that person.",
        "background": "We need to make sure people are feeling safe while walking alone on on the day and nights. Pepper spray can be used for self defence in danger situation and even stalking. We need make sure it will be used only for self defence and if this will be used against self defence, person can be prosecuted.",
