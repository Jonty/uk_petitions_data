        "additional_details": "My cat Nala was so cruelly run down by a car travelling 40mph+ on a busy road. The driver of the car did not stop to help nor call someone to inform them. This is the law for anyone hitting a dog with their car, but I\u2019m flabbergasted as to why this is not the case for a cat. Most cats are microchipped and their owner can be traced. I am confused as to why a dog is more important than a cat, and why the driver of the car should not be held partially responsible even if this was an accident.",
        "background": "The current law states that if the driver of a car hits a dog, they must report it. This should be exactly the same for a cat. The devastation this causes to a family is immense and the owner should have a right to know what has happened to their animal, and by whom.",
