        "additional_details": "The monetary needs of every arts venue in the UK should be thoroughly assessed by the British Arts Council, together with the Department for Arts and Sport, and money should be allotted to each to cover the running costs and losses of each theatre and venue.\r\n\r\nTheatres are not luxuries. They are homes of artistic expression: our heritage of drama. We would be poorer without them.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the uptake of recorded plays from the National Theatre and Globe Theatre that people need theatre.",
        "background": "All theatres have running costs, irrespective of whether productions are being staged. Many theatres are historic buildings requiring continual maintenance. Even with staff furloughed, costs still rise and there is no income until performances resume. Theatres are also part of our tourism industry.",
