        "additional_details": "During the Covid-19 lockdown, there has been a worldwide decrease in pollution levels, probably greater than could possibly achieved any other way. People have worked from home, many probably more productively. Investing in transport may appear to benefit the economy but at what cost? More roads just produce more traffic, more trains mean more people are likely to commute. Homeworking and video communications can remove the vast majority of travel. This would make the UK a world leader in this.",
        "background": "We would like to ask the Government to review and potentially cancel all planned transport investment and instead invest in better communications and business incentives to promote remote/home working.",
