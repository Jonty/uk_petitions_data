In particular, we're not sure what you mean by \"emotional support\". \r\n\t\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking for the Government to fund counselling or special support groups for single parents, or to fund catch-up tutors and classes for children of single parents, if that's something that you'd like to see. \r\n\r\nYou can find some information about support for single parents here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/support-and-services/advice-for-single-parents/ \r\n\r\nhttps://www.gingerbread.org.uk/information/you-and-your-childs-wellbeing/looking-after-your-emotional-health/"
