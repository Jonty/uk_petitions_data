        "additional_details": "Many people in the UK live on a hand to mouth existence and have no choice but to use an overdraft or borrow funds just for day to day living.\r\n\r\nDuring this time of self isolation and potentially restrictions of peoples movements and the possibility of lay offs there is a high chance that people will need support and help even more and I believe that the banks should not be able to profit from these hardships and should be protected.",
        "background": "From April 2020 the FCA instructed the banking industry to change the way they charge for overdrafts. Many responded by setting a 39 to 49% APR rate.  I would like the Government to ask the banks during the Coronavirus restrictions to waive, reduce and/or delay any increases in charges.",
