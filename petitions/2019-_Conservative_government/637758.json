        "additional_details": "At present the diagnostic screening and care from GPS is not only a postcode but also a GP lottery -many GPs still don\u2019t believe ADHD is a \u201creal\u201d thing. It is imperative that GPs understand ADHD & its Co-morbidities. Late/undiagnosed ADHD patients are routinely diagnosed with mood disorders such as bipolar/anxiety/depression with most being prescribed antidepressants for years sometimes decades for mental health conditions brought on by undiagnosed ADHD. ADHD is a disability which needs attention",
        "background": "GPs must be well educated in ADHD and how it presents. Where patients complain of anxiety, overwhelm, depression, fatigue that ADHD be considered as a possible diagnosis and that at the same time the patient is given the Mental health diagnostic check list form that the ADHD form is presented also.",
