        "additional_details": "There are many people who rely on local community centre visits and going to Church, Mosques, Synagogues etc to help with the loneliness many of our older citizens already encounter. The rest of the time, many often rely on their television or radio to feel like they are still in the land of the living. \r\n\r\nImposing self isolation at the same time as them having to arrange and pay for this is very ill timed. \r\n\r\nI therefore ask that this change of policy be delayed until April 2021 at the earliest.",
