        "additional_details": "As an educator myself, I understand the huge benefits of face to face teaching and the positive impact this has on a child\u2019s educational success. Unfortunately, due to the ongoing unprecedented situation, classroom based learning has not been possible. A significant amount of teaching and learning time has been lost (ongoing). This cannot effectively be compensated for by provided remote learning activities.By reducing the content, students will have the opportunity to sit their exams equitably.",
        "background": "A significant number of students will sit their final 2021 examinations. The outcome of which undoubtedly will be their passport, for many of their future life chances and successes. In order for this to be done fairly, it is imperative that the amount of content they are tested on is reduced.",
