The UN/ECE Reg. 79 is hindering the future of self-driving cars.\r\n \r\nWe believe that autonomous vehicles will be the future. All this regulation does is delay the inevitable. The UK could be at the forefront of autonomous car development. If the UK is the leader, manufacturers will have more interest in business here.",
