        "additional_details": "Introducing a third type of licence through the DVLA would allow people who are not medically able to drive an easy and convenient means of proving their age. Currently, the only means is carrying their passport, which is expensive and difficult to replace, and causes issues if lost (for example, just before a holiday. The other option would be to not risk going out, which is social exclusion). ID schemes that exist are not respected and bouncers/cashiers etc. only accept passport or licence.",
        "background": "Taking the example of visually impaired people, the current system means such individuals must carry their passport as ID - they are not legally allowed to apply for even a provisional licence to prove their age. These people are being denied the same ease and means of proving their age as others.",
