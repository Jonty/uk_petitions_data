        "additional_details": "Hospices and wildlife rescues provide crucial support on limited funds that they struggle to raise. This is an ongoing issue exacerbated since the pandemic, with their shops closing and sources of income and levels of volunteers being reduced due to the financial climate. Without hospices, families needing palliative support would be reliant on the NHS, already stretched beyond its limits. Without wildlife rescues continued care, a number of endangered native species could dramatically decline.",
        "background": "During the COVID-19 pandemic hospices and wildlife rescues are at threat of closing as no incomes from their shops etc. \r\n\r\nThey provide a vital service and at the best of times struggle to raise the necessary funds.",
