        "action": "Fund free travel for all UK students under 18 and half rate for students 18+",
        "additional_details": "We feel the Government should address this issue, given that travel can be expensive for students. In some cases, student travel expenses are passed down to their parents, which can cause additional financial burdens. We feel students in further education already face large debts due to the high cost of attending university, and struggle to earn what they need whilst studying. Funding 50% of their travel on public transport, will enable them to travel freely with less financial worries.",
        "background": "We would like the government to fund free travel on all government funded public transport for students under the age of 18. Understanding that this would be a big expense for the government, we would like to propose funding for half rate travel on public transport for all students over 18.",
