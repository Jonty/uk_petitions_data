If their sentence is 12 months or more, they\u2019ll be released on probation. A Parole Board is not involved.\r\n\r\nPrisoners can apply for parole if they have an extended sentence, or a fixed-term sentence for 4 years or more, or a serious violent or sexual crime committed before 4 April 2005.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for the above arrangements to be changed, but it would need to be clear what changes you wanted to be made.\r\n\r\nIf you started a new petition you'd also need to provide your full name."
