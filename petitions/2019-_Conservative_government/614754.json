        "additional_details": "Recently it has become very difficult to find access NHS dental treatment being offered by dentists. Many practices have very long waiting lists and others have fully stopped offering it.  NHS dental care provides reasonable and affordable dental care for people. While some can turn to expensive private care, most who can't afford treatment are being locked out of medical dental care.  This is now causing people to suffer in pain and children growing up with poor dental hygiene.",
        "background": "This petition is to compel all UK dentists to provide full NHS medical dental treatment across the country for patients. Allowing everyone to have an equal and fair access to affordable dental care.",
