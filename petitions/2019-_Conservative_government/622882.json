It is taxpayer's money that funds benefits and we have a right to know how the government is operating in regard to disabled people. Following Channel 4's Dispatches documentary 'Truth About Disability Benefits' and the horrific examples of disabled people dying, we believe the public's confidence in the DWP is at an all-time low.",
