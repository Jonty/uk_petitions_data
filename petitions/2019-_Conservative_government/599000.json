        "additional_details": "While we appreciate the new sentencing law, only 2% of Pet Abduction thieves are being caught and prosecuted. Funding could allow a dedicated officer in every Police force and District, for example, creating more time and resources to be made available for the victims of Pet Abduction. This should then deter the thieves to commit such crimes. Victims of Pet Abduction have been having to chase up leads themselves, which is then endangering their lives. We need more support from the police in such a difficult period of our lives.",
        "background": "The Government must ensure the police are provided with more funding to help them tackle pet abduction. While the sentencing law has changed, only 2% of pet thieves are caught and prosecuted. More funding needs to be available to help with enforcement. More dedicated police officers are needed.",
