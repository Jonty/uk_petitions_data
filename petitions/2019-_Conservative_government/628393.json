        "additional_details": "It is estimated that the UK's 13m+ unpaid carers save the treasury around \u00a3135bn per year. But many of them are weary and worn out and their caring responsibilities take a toll on their physical and mental health.\r\n \r\nA mini break, paid for by the Government, could help restore their energy and ability to keep on caring. We believe it's in the Government's own interest that unpaid carers keep on supporting the sick and infirm in the UK but often they need a break to keep going.",
