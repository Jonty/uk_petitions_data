        "additional_details": "E-scooters are becoming a menace on our roads, with several deaths already being linked to their use. How many more need to be killed before the government realise they are a deadly hazard? Illegal riders can be generally inexperienced and seem to think they own the road.\r\n \r\nThis way the rider will have some road experience and has undertaken a theory test and is aware of the Highway Code. Too many riders are reckless on illegal scooters or far too young. ",
