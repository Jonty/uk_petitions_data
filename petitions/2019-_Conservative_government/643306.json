People suffering from mental health issues who have built up trust with their doctors will be left without the support, Spouses with children, left alone when their parnters go away, and can't drive, will not be able to easily travel to a new surgery when needed. Bovington is in the middle of nowhere and already an inconvenience to most, taking accessible health care away will be ridiculously detrimental.",
        "background": "The MOD need to stop disadvantaging dependents of the serving. We are being thrown out of the medical centre and left worried that we will not be able to receive the same care when needed.",
