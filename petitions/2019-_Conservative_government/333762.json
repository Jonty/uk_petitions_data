This would include making decisions about any exemptions to a school's policy due to Covid-19.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petitions, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nPrevent schools from requiring uniform bought from specific shops: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/332196\r\n\r\nFund school uniform: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/329487\r\n\r\nYou could start a petition calling on the Government to prevent schools from imposing rules on a school uniform this autumn, if that is what you want to happen."
