        "action": "Temporarily ban the sale and use of disposable barbecues during lockdown",
        "additional_details": "As people begin to socialise with others outside but not at home, the use of these BBQs is likely to soar, posing an even greater risk to life and the environment and increasing strain on emergency services. \r\nDisposable barbecues are a well known danger, scorching the ground below during most uses and remaining hot for some time. Decimation of green areas by fire further accelerates climate change. This is in addition to their environmentally unfriendly single-use nature.",
        "background": "Countless warnings from fire services not to use disposable barbecues (and campfires) due to the risk of forest fires are being ignored. A local forest (Wareham, Dorset) has lost 220 hectares in a recent fire, taking over 150 firefighters to battle and there is an ongoing extreme fire risk.",
