        "additional_details": "As we all know, disabled people feel like they don\u2019t  fit in. If all children are taught sign language, this will allow them to feel more included as they will be able to communicate. Let\u2019s say for instance, you become a parent, and your child is born without hearing, or severe autism, or any other disability that affects their communication. How will you be able to communicate? You do not know sign language! But if you are taught it in school you will be able to communicate with your child.",
        "background": "Everyone at some point in their life will stumble across someone who can only communicate through sign language. But when that day comes, they will not know what to do as they will not understand. If sign language becomes a main subject, this will enable better communication throughout the world.",
