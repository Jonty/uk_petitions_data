We demand that more is done to look at how children were failed and how we can ensure this doesn\u2019t affect their longterm prospects. We demand that a detailed recovery plan is developed to make sure that children are protected from further stress and anxiety whilst supported to catch up with the curriculum, and not face a serious gap in learning. We demand DfE better uphold their responsibilities.",
        "background": "As a result of Covid schools were forced to close. The success of transferring learning to virtual rather than face to face varied greatly across schools and many children were left without any structured learning between March and September 2020 and our children are still being failed months later.",
