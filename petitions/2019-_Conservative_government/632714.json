The NHS is in dire straights, and we believe this money is being wasted on building new cycle lanes and narrowing roads.\r\n \r\nThe NHS is the pinnacle of the UK, this great country has needed the NHS to be free and to remain free. Let's do the right thing and give them the money to help get the NHS back to what it always has been, a magnificent service.\r\n",

There are roads that bikes can use quite easily but many chose to ride on pavements. We believe many people do not want these cycle paths.",
