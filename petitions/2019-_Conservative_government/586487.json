        "additional_details": "Children are being withheld from their 'absent' parents because the receiving parent can claim more money this way. Paying parents are to pay a percentage before any deductions/outgoings are taken, leaving them completely short and finding it very hard to support the family they live with. Receiving parents get to still claim universal credits,child benefits and live with a working partner.  They earn more than most do working full time leaving the paying parent with little money",

Make change so the receiving parent don't get more money if child spends less time with paying parent.Take into consideration outgoings before deductions are made Take receiving parents other benefits into consideration",
