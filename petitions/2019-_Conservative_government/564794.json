        "additional_details": "There is no possible way that students will be graded fairly following the appalling approach to this years \u2018adapted\u2019 education system. EVERY single student has been affected. At least 5 months of in class education has been missed for the overwhelming majority, along with a huge number not even receiving adequate online learning because of the lack of clarity and guidance from the government towards schools and colleges. Such like Scotland and Wales, we should NOT go ahead with exams.",
        "background": "Remove the current plan to go ahead with staggered exams and \u2018generous\u2019 marking. It simply will never be enough. The majority of England will receive terrible results as a result and will be detrimentally affected in their career ahead. Centre assessed grades are the current best opposing option.",
