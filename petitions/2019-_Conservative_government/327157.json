        "additional_details": "These reforms would have made many trans people's lives much easier, as we know from the changes already made in Ireland five years ago. The majority of the public responses to the consultation on reforming the Gender Recognition Act supported these changes.\r\n\r\nThis is another blow to our community during a difficult time.\r\n\r\nTrans people face a huge amount of abuse in their daily lives, just for being themselves. Across issues like access to healthcare, fair treatment in the justice system and the ability to have their voices and stories heard in public life, trans people experience profound inequalities.",
        "background": "We demand the Government reverse their decision to scrap the Gender Recognition Act Consultation and continue to work with trans led and trans-inclusive organisations, to fight for trans people to be able to live their lives with dignity and respect, and for acceptance without exception for us all.",
