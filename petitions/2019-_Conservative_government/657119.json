I have tried a wheelchair, electric wheelchair and mobility scooter and have had issues with all of them. An electric scooter works perfectly for me and I know this is also the case for others. If this law was passed it I think it would change the lives of many people.",

However, we risk being fined and getting penalty points. Allow blue badge holders to use personal electric vehicles on public land after an assessment.",
