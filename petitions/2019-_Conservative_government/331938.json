My income is actually \u00a331,620pa but because of the company car my child maintenance payments are calculated on my income and company car combined meaning my child maintenance payments are based on an income of over \u00a336,700pa. Also abolish the 25% tolerance rule is this not fair on many people.",
        "background": "Change the law on how an individual persons income is used for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. Currently payments are calculated based on income submitted from hmrc. This figure may include benefits like company cars  which in many jobs are issued as mandatory for the job.",
