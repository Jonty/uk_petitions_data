        "action": "Make it compulsory for supermarkets to offer free refillable water stations.",
        "additional_details": "Morrisons has set a precedent by offering free refillable water stations in more than 300 Food-to-Go sections, already reducing water bottle sales by 18% according to a 2020 trial (Yorkshire post).\r\nIt would help customers' health too. Sadly, refillable stations are not easy to find in our towns. Milk, gel and shampoo are widely consumed goods, and refillable stations would make a huge impact on plastic waste, reducing transportation costs and volume. Unilever, Palmolive, etc can afford offering this stations.",
        "background": "Make it compulsory for supermarkets and petrol stations to offer free water refills. This will encourage refilling and a healthier lifestyle, and discourage single-plastic use. The possibility of refilling milk/gel/shampoo bottles will substantially reduce single-use plastic use.",
