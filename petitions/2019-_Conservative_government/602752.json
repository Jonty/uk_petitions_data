We shouldn't need to go trawling through websites to find this information. And even then, companies can be ambiguous about their practices. As an animal loving nation, we have a responsibility to look after all animals. So if products are tested on animals, the public should know this at a glance of a product rather than having to go truth seeking regardless of the product purchased.",

This should be displayed as a clear universal symbol to prevent confusion and enable consumers to make a more informed decision on all product item purchases.",
