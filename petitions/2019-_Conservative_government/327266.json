Ghana is not only my beloved homeland, but it is also now one of the fastest growing economies in the world and is becoming a tourist destination. Whilst there is an existing second-hand industry in Ghana, the textiles being sent over in more recent times have been of very poor quality. The traders in Kantamanto market have found that the majority of the bales they buy are full of clothes which can\u2019t be used or sold.",
