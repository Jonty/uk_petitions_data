It would be well placed to investigate complaints of misconduct.  Investigations should be started at the request of Ministers, Parliament, any Regulator affected by a complaint or 1000 members of the public.  The results and any recommended sanctions should be published",

The Committee on Standards in Public Life should be given the job.",
