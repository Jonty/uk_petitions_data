Meanwhile almost 3 million rely on food banks, which often don't provide fresh produce. \r\n\r\nIncreasing the availability of allotments while filling streets, parks and other common land with fruit and nut trees should help reduce food poverty, improve public health and national resilience to the effects of climate change while increasing arboreal carbon capture. An awareness campaign should be used to encourage uptake.\r\n",
