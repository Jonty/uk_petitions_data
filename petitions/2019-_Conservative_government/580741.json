        "action": "Make self defence compulsory during PE for secondary school students",
        "additional_details": "Violent crime rates have increased drastically over the past year. Reports of sexual harassment and assault have skyrocketed. Children and teenagers are vulnerable yet they often have to walk the streets alone and unprotected against a plethora of threats. By offering secondary school students self defence classes at schools they will gain the ability to defend themselves, have more confidence when walking around and feel more comfortable when commuting across London and the UK.",
        "background": "We want our government to add an option for self defence to the physical education curriculum in secondary schools across the UK and give all secondary school students the ability to defend themselves against threats in a sophisticated and safe manner.",
