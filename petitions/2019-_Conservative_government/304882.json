        "additional_details": "There is early research from Korea and China suggesting that the only way to stop the spread of Covid-19 is to test every suspected case and and impose quarantines/ treat anyone with the virus. We do not have enough test kits to go round and this is why testing is restricted. Parliament or the Government are able to force this through if they feel it is in important in the battle against the Covid-19 pandemic. This is not an impossible task. It is a matter of companies re-allocating resources.",
        "background": "Test, Test, Test is the recommendation from the World Health Organisation. Currently testing is only for persons displaying symptoms and high risk persons. The govt should work together with the pharmaceutical industry to manufacture enough tests to be able to test every single suspected case.",
