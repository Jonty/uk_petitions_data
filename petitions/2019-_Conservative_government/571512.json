        "additional_details": "This should be made available to all NHS staff who have worked directly with Covid cases: cleaners, porters, nurses, doctors, mortuary clinicians, paramedics, etc.\r\n\r\nAn average course of therapy is six sessions.\r\n\r\nThe Government could make inter-governmental agreements with other Health providers and/or offer Vouchers for other private therapy practitioners (one full course, when safe to do so), thus boosting the therapies industry and giving therapists an opportunity to help our heroes heal.",
        "background": "Covid frontline NHS staff are facing deep trauma. \r\n\r\nTo ensure their physical, mental and emotional well-being, I call on the Government to make available 1 x Course of Therapy Treatment for every NHS staff member who worked on a Covid ward and to exchange it against any form of therapy they wish.",
