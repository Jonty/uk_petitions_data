        "additional_details": "Deliberate releases of balloons are common sights at celebrations. \r\nThese fleeting feel-good acts inflict long-lasting and potentially deadly consequences on the environment and wildlife. All released balloons return to Earth as ugly litter. \r\n\r\nThey kill countless animals, are a significant threat to wildlife, livestock and pets, which can be injured or killed from eating balloon fragments, getting tangled in long balloon ribbons or strings, or being spooked by the falling debris.",
