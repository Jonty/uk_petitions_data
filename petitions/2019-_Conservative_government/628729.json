        "additional_details": "House Sparrow, House Martin, Swift, Swallow, Starling, Herring Gull and other bird species associated with urban environments have undergone catastrophic population declines in recent decades. We believe the widespread introduction of physical barriers to nesting and roosting have contributed to these unsustainable declines. There are also animal welfare concerns, as birds can become trapped and die in nets. In those cases where the use of such technology can be justified a Government licensing should operate.",
        "background": "Bird spikes and netting have proliferated across buildings, trees and hedges in recent years. This has coincided with significant declines in bird populations as urban areas become ever more inhospitable to birds. We want the sale/installation of these barriers banned, except where licensed.",
