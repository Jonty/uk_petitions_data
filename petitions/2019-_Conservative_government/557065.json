There is a real risk of seeing serious self-harm; being assaulted; verbal aggression; witnessing suicide attempts. Whilst earning a low hourly rate, often around \u00a38-9 per hour, there is no requirement for employers to pay enhancements for working unsocial hours or in dangerous situations. Mental health workers should be paid a 17% allowance which is equivalent to HMPPS.",
