This eye condition remains stable throughout adulthood until the patient\u2019s in their 50s or 60s, so I feel this is an unfair reason to be rejected as the condition shouldn't affect until me after retirement.",

These conditions, such as macular degenerations, typically don\u2019t affect the applicant until later life, once the applicant is past the retirement age.",
