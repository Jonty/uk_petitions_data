We cannot reach our Paris Climate Agreements targets without ameliorating the emissions we are responsible for creating abroad. Deforestation is a huge contributor to climate change and must end if we are to tackle the global climate crisis. Currently only 27% of soy in the UK is certified as not being associated with deforestation and this is not good enough!",
