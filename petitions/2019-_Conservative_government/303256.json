When opposition ideas to ameliorate our suggestion are made floated in the press, they are made less likely to occur due to the political cost of conceding to the opposition.\r\n\r\nIf all parties were involved behind closed doors, with the committee collectively owning the final consensus, good ideas from the opposition can be executed and public trust in their conclusions can be enhanced.",
        "background": "Establish a non-partisan group -- in essence, a temporary unity government -- in charge of our pandemic response. They should see all the same data and receive all the same expert advice, debate their ideas in private, then collectively own their recommendations.",
