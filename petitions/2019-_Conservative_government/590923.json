        "additional_details": "The way the child maintenance service calculates the payment needs to be changed or even scraped. This is causing huge financial strain on parents who cannot afford the sum. I myself cannot afford to rent or purchase a home due to an IVA but yet the CSA are demanding huge amounts which are unplayable. If you also take into account that the receiving parent is usually getting state benefits on top this is a hugely outweighed and unfair system. The money paid is also not taken off the benefits.",
