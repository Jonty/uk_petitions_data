In December 21, HMRC closed their VAT and Corporation Tax phone lines on 3,10 and 17 December to help reduce the large volume of post that had built up.\r\n\r\nMTD for Income Tax has been delayed to April 2024 for sole traders and landlords, many years after intended. We fear the timetable is prone to further delay and changes to basis periods for sole traders have not been adequately thought out.",
