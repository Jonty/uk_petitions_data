        "additional_details": "Decisions about London don\u2019t only affect those living in it. People living outside London commute in for work. Tourists from the rest of the UK and abroad are also affected by decisions. Yet none of them have a say in who should stand as Mayor. Personal ego projects are affecting businesses in and out of London. This includes deliveries, retailers, cleaners and customers. London needs these people to survive. Road closures are affecting day to day lives of the disabled and elderly .",
        "background": "The post of Mayor of London was created 20 years ago. After 3 mayors all we have seen is money wasted. TfL is now being bailed out by UK taxpayers. Cross rail is a money pit. London Assembly has no control. It shouldn\u2019t be down to one person. London should be run by a non political committee",
