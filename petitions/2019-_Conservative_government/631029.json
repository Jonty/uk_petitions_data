        "additional_details": "Calls to prayer could also be objectionable to people who are of different faith groups including atheists, when they are enjoying their peace within their own homes/work/worship. We believe these calls infringe on individual privacy and enjoyment, yet councils, who employ abatement officers still allow loudspeaker/mechanical usage in many areas.\r\n \r\nWe believe allowing these calls to prayer is inconsistent with the Human Rights Act 1998, Article 8 and 9 and also legislation, \"Noise & Statutory Nuisance Act 1993\", \"Control of Pollution Act 1974\"\r\n",

We believe this is noise pollution, and should not be happening in our towns and cities.",
