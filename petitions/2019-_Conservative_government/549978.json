It's shameful and it make me appalled to be British.We have seen the impact that plastic is having on all our lives. It's time to start creating solutions in all the areas we possibly can and stop being weak. Be STRONG.\r\n GOVERN us and do it well. The British people have shown you how quickly we can adapt to things over the last few months. We CAN and we SHOULD live without plastic shopping bags.",
        "background": "The government just increased the charge for plastic bags in supermarkets to 10p. This is weak policy. It's is no hardship for people to carry shopping bags with them either in their handbags or in the boots of their cars. We can and SHOULD live without plastic carrier bags.\r\nBe brave. BAN THEM ALL!",
