        "action": "Add sociology to the curriculum at KS3 and oblige schools to offer it at KS4",
        "additional_details": "Sociology teaches students about crime, religion, gender, politics, class and race, among a plethora of other topical elements of culture. It also provides students with vital skills like critical thinking, contextual evaluation and data collection, presentation and analysis. These are comparable to those learned in science, maths and English. These are abilities which will be imperative for future generations to possess in order to tackle social issues and contribute to a progressive society.",
        "background": "The value and relevance of skills learnt by studying sociology in aiding society and students must be capitalised on, by introducing sociology as a KS3 national curriculum subject and making provision for sociology in schools mandatory at KS4.",
