        "additional_details": "Calorie counting is incredibly dangerous: not only is it inaccurate, but it is also triggering for eating disorders. Obesity is a very real risk but eating disorders have the highest mortality rate in the mental health sector. It is very easy to be consumed by exercise and restricting food or purging; people should be allowed to chose from a menu freely without worrying about what it means.",
        "background": "The Government has recently started a campaign to enforce the showing of calories on menus and labels and sometimes provide exercise guidance to burn off what you eat. This sort of information should not unavoidably visible- instead, it should be available for those who wish to see it.",
