        "additional_details": "I want the government to let all children of school age repeat their current year due to the coronavirus. I have been homeschooling my son but I am no substitute for a teacher. Even if the schools do reopen there are many people like me who live with relatives with underlying health problems who could not risk sending my child back to school as early as June 2020. Extend Child Benefit and all associated benefits that are linked to children & let the children get the education they deserve.",
        "background": "I want the government to consider letting all school age children repeat the current academic year due to not being able to attend. Give the children a chance to catch up on lost education, especially children with special education needs & also increase child benefit age by 1 year.",
