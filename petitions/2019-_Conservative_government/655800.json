The number of deaths in 2022 rises to a staggering total of 306, including dogs that were put to sleep due to \u201ctreatment costs\u201d or \u201cdesignated unsuitable for homing\u201d.\r\n \r\nAside from the unnecessary and preventable deaths, there is a lack of funding for rehoming centres, dogs are being sent to China to race, and we believe there is mass overbreeding and a lack of fair punishments for abusive owners.\r\n",
