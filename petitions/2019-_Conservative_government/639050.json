There are already requirements for this for health and social care staff.\r\n \r\nThe Oliver McGowan Mandatory Training on Learning Disability and Autism is the Government's recommended and preferred training package for health and social care staff. The training is available and has been formally evaluated. It has received funding from the Government and could easily be adapted to meet the needs of staff based in educational settings.\r\n",
