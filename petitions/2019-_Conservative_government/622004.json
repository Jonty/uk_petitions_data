        "additional_details": "There is a lot of racial tension unhealed from 500 years of colonialism, and recent events involving the mistreatment and killing of black people by the authorities. There is a lot of distrust and ill-feeling towards the Government among Caribbean British communities. The Government needs to make meaningful acknowledgements. August 1st should be celebrated here in the UK, as the anniversary of the commencement of the Abolition Act, by making it a national bank holiday.",
        "background": "The Commonwealth is made up of countries and people who have suffered the trauma of Slavery and Colonialism. Many countries across the Commonwealth have August 1st as a National Bank Holiday. The UK has fewer Bank Holidays than most places in Europe and we believe would benefit from this.",
