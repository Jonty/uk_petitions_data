        "action": "Stop any plans to extend the MOT test frequency",
        "additional_details": "The UK has the safest roads in Europe. To ensure motoring is as safe and cost-effective as possible, motorists must have their vehicle inspected and serviced regularly.\r\n\r\nData from the DVSA shows that one in three vehicles presented for an MOT test fail and 30 percent of those fail on brakes, a safety critical component. \r\n\r\nMoving to an extended testing period with an ageing vehicle parc would see more defective vehicles on UK roads and potentially cause more accidents and fatalities, as well as higher repair costs.",
        "background": "We would like the government to commit to not extending the MOT test frequency. Any extension would be a dangerous step backwards for road safety and ultimately cost hard-pressed motorists more money. Vehicle emissions remaining unchecked will also potentially harm the environment.",
