        "additional_details": "The urgent request for the Government to grant an amnesty to undocumented migrants (with no criminal records and residing in the UK for 5+ years) stems from several compelling reasons:\r\n\r\n- Deporting undocumented migrants will cost billions, a significant financial burden on the UK economy.\r\n\r\n- Past research has found that an amnesty has the potential to bring billions into the UK economy.\r\n\r\n- Undocumented migrants are only able to regularise their residence after 20 years, leaving them at risk of exploitation and modern slavery.\r\n",
        "background": "We want the Government to take the necessary action to grant an urgent amnesty to undocumented migrants with no criminal record, who have been living in the UK for 5 or more years, enabling them to live, work, and contribute to the UK without fear or limitations.",
