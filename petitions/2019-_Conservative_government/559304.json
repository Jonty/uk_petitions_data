        "additional_details": "Data suggests that over 60% of dogs show marked signs of distress when exposed to fireworks. Applied to the UK canine population that suggests that there are at least 5 \u00bd million dogs that are subjected to unnecessary fear and distress and RSPCA also believe that over 50% of horses get spooked, anxious during the same period. Not only animals, many parents will know the trouble that young children have with fireworks. The experience is unnecessarily troubling and we have capability to change it",
        "background": "Fireworks have become part of everyday life and this is a problem that wont go away so surely something has to change and with making silent fireworks compulsory - all can enjoy fireworks in the usual manner for many years to come. Would fireworks be bought if they had no light show as a result?",
