Access to some library books are not even available online, and some students don\u2019t even have access to a computer unless they can use the libraries.",
        "background": "Due to the outbreak from the Coronavirus, many Universities have shut for the rest of the academic year, making resources only available online. Without even allowing access to the libraries. The tuition fee should be lowered to accommodate the lack of resources students are now not receiving.",
