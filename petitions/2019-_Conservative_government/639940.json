        "additional_details": "The door security sector has seen a considerable rise in violence and abuse against door supervisors within the workplace. Feedback from the sector has shown that security operatives have seen a considerable increase in physical and verbal abuse within their place of work on most shifts. As we move towards the implementation of Martyn's Law, these workers will become an important part of the infrastructure in delivering this duty, playing their role in the protection of public spaces within the UK.",
        "background": "The role of door security has become even more important to community infrastructure, as a frontline of defence against counter terrorism, anti-social behaviour, harm reduction and woman's safety at night. We must give these workers similar protections against abuse to retail and emergency workers. ",
