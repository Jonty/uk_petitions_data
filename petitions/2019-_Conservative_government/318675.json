Particularly those that go across farmers land which contain live stock and or people\u2019s pets (horses). Farmers or land owners should have a right to remove any out of control animals from their fields. Extendable leads are in abundance, there is no need for a dog to be off a lead in this day and age, particularly when live stock and pets are at risk.",

I want the government to make it mandatory for all dogs to be on leads on public footpaths, bridleways and byways.",
