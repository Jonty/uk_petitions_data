        "additional_details": "We never had no where near as much flooding as we do now when the rivers were dredged on a regular basis. The sludge could be used on the fields as natural fertiliser the rivers would flow better, natural drainage all round. So much better for the environment and will save billions in insurance claims and no more devastated home owners losing everything year on year in flood areas.",
        "background": "Now that we have left the EU we should start dredging the rivers again to stop the flooding. Stop building on flood plains will also help with the natural order of nature.",

You can read more about this here: https://fullfact.org/online/EU-dredging-floods/\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling on the Government to ban development on flood plains, and review guidance on dredding of rivers, if that is something you want to happen."
