        "additional_details": "You\u2019re two years into a pandemic, and a full three decades into a constant trend in reducing hospital beds and rates of staffing the NHS and the only people who don\u2019t get what the problem is are seemingly the government responsible for the harm. Fund. The. NHS. The total number of NHS hospital beds in England has more than halved over the past 30 years, from around 299,000 in 1987/88 to 141,000 in 2019/20, while the number of patients treated has increased significantly. Do we need primary school children to properly explain to those in power what this means and what is required?",
