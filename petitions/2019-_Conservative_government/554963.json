        "additional_details": "Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) is currently disputed as it is not yet internationally recognised as independent. On December 10, 1991, a referendum took place with 82.2% turnout, of which 99.89% voted \"for\" the independence from Azerbaijan.\r\nAlthough it is governed by the Republic of Artsakh, a de facto independent state with ethnic Armenian majority, Azerbaijan has repeatedly attempted to take control through military action. Recognising Artsakh as independent would bring peace to the region.",
        "background": "The UK government should formally recognise the independence of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh). Independence from Azerbaijan will allow indigenous Armenians to live in peace in the region and allow for a peaceful settlement that is no longer a disputed territory.",
