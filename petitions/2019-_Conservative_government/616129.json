        "additional_details": "We want the Government to require all providers of after-school clubs to register with Ofsted, and be subject to annual inspections.\r\n \r\nMore than 80 safeguarding referrals have been made about clubs in school grounds in the past five years, according to information requests made by the BBC.\r\n \r\nThere is nothing more important than protecting our children. We believe the swiftest, most effective way of doing this is greater regulation. Leaving children in the care of unregulated individuals without any inspection is unacceptable. The effects of abuse can impact children for the rest of their lives.",
        "background": "Many after-school clubs are not regulated and of those that are, only 10% are inspected a year, meaning a provider may not be inspected for nearly a decade.",
