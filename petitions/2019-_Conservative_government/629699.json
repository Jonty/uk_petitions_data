        "additional_details": "The age of consent was raised to 16 in the Uk in 1885!The law says that 16 and 17 year olds can have sex but, as they are legally children,they are given more protection in law. It is illegal for an adult in a position of trust or responsibility to have sex with a 16 or 17 year old. We believe this should apply to all adults. All children deserve safeguarding and protection from adults who may exploit them. Currently anyone of any age can have sex with a child of 16! Please help us change that.",
        "background": "The age of consent should remain at 16 but only for 16-17 year olds. This safeguards children from adults who wish to take advantage. Adults over the age of 18 can consent to other adults but not anyone under 18.",
