        "additional_details": "Sir Patrick Vallance is Government Chief Scientific Adviser (GCSA). He says about 60% of people will need to become infected in order for the UK to enjoy \"herd immunity\" \r\n\r\nSir Patrick described self-isolation as \"really critical\" and \"a very key part of what can be done\". Self-isolation means that you stay in your room and stay there for 14 days.\r\n\r\nIf all NHS staff were tested for COVID-19 and then followed the government own advise for self issolation this country would collapse.",
        "background": "I want the Government to increase the wages by a reasonable amount for all NHS staff effective immediately in light of putting their own lives at risk working front line with life threatening viruses like Covid-19, MERS and SARS plus many others daily under massively increasing pressure",
