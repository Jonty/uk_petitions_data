        "additional_details": "At the moment, for your first licence, it is approximately \u00a326.25 for 6 months, then \u00a313.12 for 6 months. In 1 year, you have 1.5 years worth of a TV licence. Why do we need to be 6 months in credit, what happens to our money they hold on to and why does it not automatically get refunded upon death or turning 75? The licence needs to be affordable to all which at the moment, it is not. There is no legitimate reason for the double payments and it is discriminating against those in hardship.",
        "background": "We need to Government to abolish the 6 months credit from TV licence direct debit payments. People want to pay monthly but firstly need to pay for a years licence over 6 months. You then pay the normal \u00a313.12 for the next 6 months. You will always be 6 months in credit with your TV licence.",
