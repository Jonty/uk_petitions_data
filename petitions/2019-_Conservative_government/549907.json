        "action": "Allow driving instructors to sign off Learners Licenses due to COVID-19.",
        "additional_details": "If the Government doesn't take action to solve this problem thousands of people will be unable to get their Driving Licenses for a long period of time and in turn result it will delay any learners for years to come. It's in Driving Instructors best interests to ONLY sign off a learners license if they feel they are at an adequate PASS standard. Of course this measure would only be temporary until the backlog of Learners had been dealt with.",
        "background": "Due to COVID-19 plenty of learners who have passed their theory test and are at a pass level for a Practical Test are unable to book tests. A simple solution to this would be to adopt a similar policy as in the US where Driving Instructors (as opposed to Parents) can sign off learners licenses.",
