At the time of being Furloughed my daughter was 6 months old and I now feel privileged to have been able to spend that much time with my young daughter as many fathers never get to experience watching their children grow. I have been able to watch my daughter crawl for the first time, stand for the first time and start to develop her amazing personality. And now I've been able to experience this I'm left with the thought of knowing that many fathers will never get this opportunity.",
