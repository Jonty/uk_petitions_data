        "additional_details": "The reason why I'm asking Parliament to look into this is because many joggers are breaching the rules and potentially spreading the virus, putting extra strain on the NHS and staff and or endangering themselves and others whilst pursuing an activity the government is actually promoting. I'm not anti fitness but it must be done in the right place not on the public pavement which is meant for pedestrians.",
        "background": "I'm calling for this ban this because many joggers seem to think they are exempt from the two metre rule and at this time with coronavirus and new variants keeping a distance is vital to protect the NHS and protect each other is essential, but something many joggers don't seem to understand.",
