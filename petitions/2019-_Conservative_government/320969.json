        "action": "Make medication free from animal ingredients and animal testing!",
        "additional_details": "As some companies prove - taking Covid19 vaccines direct to human trials, or using stem cells, cell cultures or \"organ on a chip\" - there are numerous scientific options for testing which don't require the abuse of animals. Also, cultured alternatives to animal-based ingredients can be used.\r\n\r\n\"Anti-vaxxers\" use animal exploitation as an excuse to avoid essential vaccines. Veganism is becoming more popular. There is a demand for animal free medication and that will only grow in the future.",
        "background": "The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 is 35 years old and very out of date. Science has progressed past animal abuse. Please update the ASPA to remove the requirements for animal testing, and ban the inclusion and use of animal ingredients within medications (including vaccinations).",
