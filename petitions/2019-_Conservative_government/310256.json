        "additional_details": "Govt has guaranteed those laid off 80% of salary to stay home.  Today something similar will be put in place for the self employed.  NHS workers receive full pay if in isolation or sick. Social care workers are amongst the lowest paid in society, yet are expected to continue working, with poor PPE provision, and only entitled to SSP.  Clapping at 20.00 on 26 3.20 is very nice, but doesn't pay the bills.  Actions speak louder than words or clapping, we in Social Care are worth more than this.",
        "background": "Social care workers should be paid 80% of salary if in self isolation or if they contract the virus.  They are putting themselves at risk daily.  Most social care workers only qualify for \u00a394.20 per week",
