        "additional_details": "It is almost heartbreaking that while holiday makers can go to any of the amber or green list countries, we seem to be forgetting that the UK comprises a high number of ethnicities from countries that may be in the Red List. We cannot even visit family back home as schools break, because most cannot afford the hotel quarantine on top of pricey airline tickets and PCR tests. At least have the humanity to allow us to return to our homes when we return and quarantine there.",
        "background": "It makes sense to now ease the forced hotel quarantine for uk citizens who return from red list countries. This is a very very expensive option and it is highly unfair that double-jabbed UK citizens be forced to pay \u00a31750 for a forced hotel stay when they have their own homes to quarantine in.",
