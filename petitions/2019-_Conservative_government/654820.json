He lost his fight for life on 11th January 2023.\r\n \r\nHe was attacked in broad daylight, in front of many children that just finished school. The weapon? An everyday kitchen knife.\r\n \r\nWe need to change this now! We are calling on the Government to introduce new legislation that will impose mandatory sentences for anyone found carrying knives unlawfully.\r\n",
