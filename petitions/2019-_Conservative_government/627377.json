This year already, prior to bonfire night, there\u2019s been a horse who has jumped out of its field onto a motorway, injuring himself and a driver as he landed on a car. \r\nThere\u2019s been dogs that have ran away from their gardens or on walks because they have been terrified, not to mention the dogs that sit at home barking and shaking with fear. \r\nThere\u2019s wildlife animals who can\u2019t escape it.",
        "background": "Discontinue the manufacture and sale of fireworks to the public and only allow organised displays. \r\nIn addition, only have silent fireworks at these displays; silent fireworks are able to be made and there\u2019s no reason why people can\u2019t enjoy shows without the awful noise that terrifies so many.",
