        "additional_details": "Legalising the recreational use of marijuana ensures safe access, replacing risky sources. Over 1.5-2 million monthly users exist, despite the status of marijuana being a Class B drug, highlighting demand. Compared to alcohol, marijuana is safer; switching from alcohol to marijuana could save innumerable lives. Therapeutic and medical benefits further underscore its value, aiding those without access to medical licenses or \"rare\" conditions who still need assistance.",
