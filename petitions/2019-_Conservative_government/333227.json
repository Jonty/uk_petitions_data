        "additional_details": "We believe this because: stress is a leading cause for depression and anxiety and can have a long lasting, detrimental impact on the student's mental health. Creating an average from all the smaller tests would give a more accurate representation of the student's ability and reflects on the effort and work they have put in over the 2 years in preparation for their GCSEs. This benefits universities, as they are given a better image of what the student is actually capable of rather than how much information they can cram in for the exams, and also for future employers as it gives good insight into their work ethic.",
        "background": "Our goal is to have the GCSE exams spread out throughout the year instead of having all of the exams in two weeks. It would be beneficial if we spread the exams out and made them into smaller, more frequent and topic based exams rather than big exams with topics all thrown together.",
