Whereas sometimes bullies themselves need help and support, we believe that the current guidance for schools on dealing with bulling is vague, especially where it continues after intervention and verbal warnings. The Government needs to ensure that it\u2019s not the victims of bullying who are made to move schools or suffer daily if they don't.",

After these warnings, they should be excluded at every further incident with permanent exclusions for repeat offenders. ",
