        "additional_details": "Current statutory polices include Behaviour, Special Educational Needs, and Sex & Relationships. Despite the rise in children's mental health referrals, there is no specific policy relating to the mental health of students. Students with poor mental health often fall behind in learning and attendance. Whilst some schools are inclusive of their approaches, this is unfortunately not to be said for all.\r\n\r\nWe must begin to develop our understanding and awareness to meet the needs of new generations.",
        "background": "Introduce a specific policy for schools which follows the Mental Health Act 2017. \r\n\r\nThis policy should promote inclusion and reasonable adjustments, with the aim to ensure pupils with significant mental health needs can access education regardless of their limitations.",
