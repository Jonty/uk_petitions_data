The idea that some lives matter less is the root of all that is wrong in the world. A government that does not act for and on behalf of its people, no longer serves the peoples interests and by this very definition it is declaring itself an enemy of the people. Your rights end where mine begin. Our Human Rights are not up for debate.",
        "background": "We The People demand the UK Government stops the reformation of the Humans Rights Act and the dangerous changes it proposes. Throughout human history we are reminded of the atrocities governments can make when a select few have too much power and believe its acts for the people. We the People say NO",
