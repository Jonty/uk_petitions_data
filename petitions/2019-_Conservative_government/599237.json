        "action": "Give all local authorities the power to operate their own bus services",
        "additional_details": "Private sector bus operators are failing to provide adequate public transport bus services.  They have allowed their business model to become dependent on subsidies from council tax.  Over 3,000 routes have been cut.  Current legislation prevents most local authorities from operating \"traditional\" bus services.  We call upon the government to change the law so that local authorities can provide the public transport services which people need.",
        "background": "We want Parliament to return to local authorities the power the run their own bus services, with fixed routes and timetables, either alongside private sector operators or in replacement of them.",
