        "additional_details": "We would like Parliament to take this into account because our local community have been affected by the many new housing estates because they have been built on precious green spaces while there is an empty town centre that is in need of an urgent renovation and the local council have focused their spending on additional housing rather than the foundations such as roads and education that are needed to support the influx of new homes.",
        "background": "We want Parliament to acknowledge the people in local communities and involve them in discussions when it comes to spending on new housing compared to local services such as education, roads and towns, and a constant and open discussion between local MP's and the community on the topic of spending.",
