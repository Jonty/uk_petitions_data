        "additional_details": "Priti Patel stated 2 reasons for the NHS migrant work visa extension.  One was in order to help fight COVID-19 without distractions of visa deadlines.  The second was to show gratitude them for risking their lives for this country.  We stand by these two key intentions but feel that the gratitude falls short. \r\n\r\nReward for risking your life should not be limited to only those with a specific visa deadline and surely they\u2019re are worth more than a 12 month extension?\r\n\r\nPlease reward our NHS workers.",
        "background": "Please reconsider the decision to extend visas for NHS workers as announced this week.\r\nInstead offer NHS migrant workers tackling COVID-19 the right to permanently reside in the UK despite their visa deadline to show sincere gratitude for putting their lives at risk for the UK in it\u2019s time of need.",
