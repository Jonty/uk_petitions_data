        "additional_details": "The BBC now look like being incapable of becoming impartial in the eyes of many so they do not wish to watch the BBC but still be forced to fund it. If someone wishes to read the Daily Telegraph they are not made to fund the Guardian and vice versa. At present the current arrangements regarding the TV licence in effect impose that the equivalent of the theoretical unfair analogy above regarding newpapers.",
        "background": "Alter clause 363 of the Communications Act 2003 to make the \"TV Licence\" a \"BBC only Licence\" so that those that support the BBC can still watch it and become its sole funders, leaving those that do not wish to watch it free to watch other TV channels live without having to fund the BBC.",
