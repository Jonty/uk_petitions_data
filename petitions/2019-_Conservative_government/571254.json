People need to be convinced by having scientific and other green technologies back the change. Biodegradable products made out of natural materials would need to be more widely used. This could result in different products being grown and harvested to make them. To support people working in these industries who might be put out of a job, I would expect the Government to ensure that transition training is provided to help these people secure green jobs.",
