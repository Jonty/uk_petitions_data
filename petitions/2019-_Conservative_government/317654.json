        "additional_details": "It would be unfair to stop the chance of an individual getting their driving licence considering the unprecedented and unexpected times making driving tests unavailable. An extension of theory tests would provide individuals a fair chance of taking and possibly passing the test after the current situation is over.",
        "background": "Contact DVSA and come to decision of suitable extension date for ALL theory test passes. This being as some may expire within or just after lockdown and no tests have been made available because of virus. Without extension some will expire and individuals would not have had the chance to take test.",
