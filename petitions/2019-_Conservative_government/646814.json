        "additional_details": "The Government should do this because there has been a massive increase in people suffering with mental health since 2020. The age of people suffering is becoming lower and people should not feel uncomfortable at work because they have a mental health condition! The lack of care by many employers and the fact that many employers don\u2019t have any regard for support someone with mental health is disgusting. 1 in 4 people in the UK will experience a mental health problem each year. Let\u2019s support people being able to work.",
        "background": "We want the Government to require employers to do compulsory mental health training. Every employer MUST know how to help and support anyone with a short or long term mental health condition. From experience, employers often can\u2019t support someone who is suffering. This is unacceptable!",
