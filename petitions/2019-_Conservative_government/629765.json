Counselling is particularly suitable for mature students with more life experience. The loan could make significant number of people employable up until retirement.",

It should be included in the list of subjects eligible for second degree loan like nursing, midwifery and dietetics are.  This is to make counselling therapy easily accessible for all who need it and to meet increasing demand.",
