        "additional_details": "Many people live with chronic pain. It affects your mental and physical well being.  Exercising in water is the only relief and it strengthens muscles and gives joints a rest. Weight control is essential to managing the conditions. Swimming can be the only way to avoid weight gain if mobility is poor. It is documented that swimming pools being open have not contributed significantly to Covid cases and it is an activity that is Covid secure. Please help those in pain and allow them to swim.",
        "background": "During lockdowns and all future tier restrictions people with particular medical conditions should have access to water and swimming to alleviate their pain and keep them physically and mentally well. Swimming pools should not be required to shut.",
