They have advised the government has stopped all testing and do not know when they will be carrying on. We need to all be tested if we feel we have symptoms so we can rule it out or stop it from spreading. How will we know if we are possitive if the Government will not test us anymore? And if we do self isolate for 7+days and do not have the virus and then we catch it do we get paid SSP again?",
