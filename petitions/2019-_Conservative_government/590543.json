I know people that have been selling their house for over 1 and a half years due to the buying pulling out 6 months later due to the fact that they have changed their mind or they have found another house they prefer. Loads of other countries do things differently, an offer\r\nIs legally binding.",

If you want rules on house sales to be changed in a different way to the above petition you could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
