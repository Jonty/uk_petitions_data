It\u2019s predominantly made up of small businesses, there are no mass redundancies but the potential for thousands to loose their livelihoods. \r\n\r\nIn addition, couples are being put under tremendous strain both mentally and financially as they battle the continuous uncertainty around this. \r\n\r\nMore regular reviews based on relevant evidence would be welcomed by all.",
