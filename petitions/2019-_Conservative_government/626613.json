        "additional_details": "Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love Chinese culture and the Chinese people. I also know that not all Chinese people are bad and do not, in any way, truly support hate against the Chinese people.\r\n However, animals are sickeningly mistreated in China. Human rights, for instance, those of the Uyghur Muslims, are shockingly abused in China. The air in Beijing is severely polluted.\r\n The only way that the Chinese Government will ever improve things is if they are heavily pressured monetarily and politically.",
        "background": "In China, dogs are blowtorched, strangled, beaten or even cooked alive for their meat. Cats are also slaughtered horrifically. Bears languish on farms where their bile is taken. Animals are skinned alive.\r\n Human rights are disgustingly abused and the environment is polluted for profit in China.",
