        "additional_details": "The practice of \u2018dynamic pricing\u2019, where the base price of a ticket is increased according to demand, is tantamount to profiteering. The starting price must be calculated as the minimum needed to achieve sufficient profit to stage an event. Applying \u2018dynamic pricing\u2019 subsequently is simple greed. It is socially irresponsible and may encourage people to get themselves into financial difficulties because of an obsession with meeting their idols.",
        "background": "The practice of \u2018dynamic pricing\u2019 should be legislated against by the Government or Parliament before it becomes the new normal for ticket sales.",
