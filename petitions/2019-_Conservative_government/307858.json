        "additional_details": "The government should implement provisions for students who are taking GCSEs or A-levels in 2021 because due to the school closures they will miss a large portion of their courses and will likely struggle to catch up in time for their exams. It wouldn\u2019t be fair on them to make them sit an exam that they missed a large portion of teaching through no fault of their own, so I think that their exams should also be cancelled or at least have lower grade boundaries to make up for this loss of education.",
        "background": "The government should implement provisions for year 10\u2019s and 12\u2019s exams, after they will miss vital teaching due to COVID-19 and school closures. Whether this would mean cancelling their exams like the 2020 exams, or lowering grade boundaries, we should do something to make the exams fair for them.",
