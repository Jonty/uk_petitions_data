        "additional_details": "Today I had a dental emergency, I contacted the dental practice I registered with under NHS only to be told, I had been removed due to lack of regular visits. Lot of my work friends have similar stories. People those who do not visit regularly do not take time. Appointments are assigned only when the public asked for one. Therefore, it is not a good reason to remove irregular users under the guise of practice being 'full'.",
        "background": "Regular 6 months visit to the dentist is only an advice, not a law to obey. Infrequent service users do not make waiting lists significantly longer. Like with the GP service, an individual should be able to decide when to attend the NHS dentist registered with.",
