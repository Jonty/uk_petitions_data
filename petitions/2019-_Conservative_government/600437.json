        "additional_details": "I want the the government and parliament to protect NHS workers and protect individuals by not forcing vaccinations on them without having a choice. I want NHS workers to feel protective and trust the government , NHS workers have worked so hard during pandemic and putting such pressure for millions of people is disgusting and totally horrific. Many NHS workers work long hours and work so hard, they should keep on doing that and should feel comfortable receiving vaccine in their own time",
        "background": "We want the government to protect NHS staff and not to introduce mandatory vaccinations causing thousands of people becoming unemployed. It is not lawful for this to take place and it is wrong forcing NHS workers into taking the vaccine. Why only NHS and care workers what about everyone else?",
