Mandatory life sentences do not adequately allow for sentencing to reflect individual circumstances. Further, treating intended GBH that results in death as murder rather than manslaughter is not fair, as they had no intention to commit murder.",

Mandatory life sentences should also be revoked, with a tier system similar to Canada and the US.",
