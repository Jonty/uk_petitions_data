        "additional_details": "Football is our National game & fans are systematically exploited & inconvenienced for the benefit of television companies & the football authorities. If 2 northern clubs are contesting a semi final why should they travel to London? Parliament calling for change will send a clear message to the FA which they will have to respond to.",
        "background": "We want Parliament to pass a motion calling on the FA to hold FA cup semi finals at neutral grounds as they used to. Wembley must now have been paid for & using it for semis discriminates against fans of Northern clubs & means many fans can\u2019t afford to go. It also causes significant travel issues.",
