One option many take is to own a property during their time in the job. However, we believe this shouldn't be treated as capital in the same way as second homes for owner occupiers - it is the only property those people own and often they will have a mortgage on it.",

We want the calculation to be reformed to account for those who need to own a property for when they retire or leave their job.",
