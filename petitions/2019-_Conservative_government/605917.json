        "additional_details": "It is wrong to take the rights of anyone away. The vaccine does not stop anyone catching it or passing it on. It would also show that the government are listening to the people of the UK (for once) especially the NHS frontline staff by stopping this from happening. It feels like the Government is trying to run the NHS into the ground (as a lot of staff will leave) so they can privatise it. We all need to live with this virus, as we live with flu, and get on with our live.",
        "background": "They were good enough to look after Covid patients, including Boris,\r\nputting their own lives at risk, witnessing the worst cases and get paid pittance, to be thanked by taking their rights from them.",
