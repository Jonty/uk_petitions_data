        "additional_details": "Adding Pakistan on red list but leaving out countries with a far worse COVID 19 record (e.g India) has nothing to do with any scientific or fact-based measures. Giving no criteria for this decision, it reflects foreign policy bias and unfairness to Pakistani community in the UK. Cost for a trip to Pakistan has jumped from \u00a3500 to \u00a33000. Govt should not use Covid to unfairly earn from certain community and not supposed to be biased for a particular community of the region where others are exempt.",
        "background": "We want Pakistan to be removed from the red list of UK Travel ban countries as it is unfair and puts many under extreme burden whereas other countries in the same region are exempted",
