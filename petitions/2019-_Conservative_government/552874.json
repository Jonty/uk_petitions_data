        "additional_details": "Local, independent & family run business are already taking a hit in sales due to COVID restrictions. A lot of people don\u2019t make purchases if they can\u2019t try something on.\r\n \r\nThis is may be crucial to some small independent business staying in business. Particularly in specialised clothing areas, where clothing fit is crucial to the end user\u2019s safety e.g. motorcycle clothing.\r\n \r\nPeople are just going online to big businesses with free returns, and the high street will just keep getting hit hard.",
        "background": "Current guidance states that fitting rooms should be closed wherever possible. This should be changed to allow changing rooms to be opened in a COVID-secure way.\r\n \r\nChanging rooms can be sanitised after use, and when clothing etc is tried on, it will be easy for staff to monitor and quarantine.",
