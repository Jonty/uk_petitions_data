        "additional_details": "1. We are creating an epidemic of LongCovid (69,000 children suffering according to ONS 11/11/21, a 30% increase on previous month). A single dose offers little protection.\r\n\r\n2. Covid is a novel virus. We don't yet understand the long-term health implications, so should apply the precautionary principle. There are worrying emerging indications of neurological, immune and vascular damage, even in 'mild' cases that may pre-dispose to degenerative & auto-immune disease in the future.",
        "background": "The Pfizer vaccine has now been approved and rolled out for 5yrs+ in the US, with Europe anticipated to follow by early December. In the meantime, Covid is rampant in UK in children, yet there are appear to be no plans to make the vaccine available to 5-11y/os, or to offer a 2nd dose to 12-17s.",
