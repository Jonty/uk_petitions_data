        "additional_details": "There is talk of local authorities adopting this ridiculous over the phone malpractice that is inevitably leading to misdiagnosis, loss of confidence in public health and mental health. For example, a local surgery I attended had no FIT tests to screen for bowel cancer, yet they have enough COVID tests to last years. This needs addressing at government level as if nothing is done, people are dying on the back of this ridiculous set up.",
        "background": "All other professions are now back at work and doctors seem to have adopted an over the phone service. Doctors cannot spot many serious illnesses over the phone and it\u2019s time, like the rest of us, that they resumed full time face to face appointments. It\u2019s time they moved on as we all are.",
