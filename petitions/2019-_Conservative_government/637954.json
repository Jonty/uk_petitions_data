        "action": "Give the CAA powers to fine airlines for breaching consumer laws",
        "additional_details": "Thousands of people in this country are routinely denied their rights each year through unfair tactics by major airlines. For example, the right to be re-routed is often made impossible to make use of.\r\n \r\nThe CAA has routinely threatened legal action against major airlines for breaching consumer laws, but we believe that at present there is no clear and effective deterrent.\r\n \r\nLarge corporate businesses should abide by the same laws as everyone else. We believe the threat of large fines would incentivise them to comply with consumer law.",
        "background": "We want the Government to establish a legislative framework to allow the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to heavily fine rogue airlines which trample over consumer protections. The CAA should be able to impose fines itself, rather than needing to take enforcement action through the courts.",
