        "additional_details": "Keeping students in school for an extended period following evidence being provided to exam boards is pointless and has no affect on the GCSE grades.  Work being done in Secondary School settings after the submission of grades will not be used as evidence towards A Level qualifications or apprenticeships, so therefore is totally unnecessary.  Time away from school during the summer will give 16 year old students, a much needed break for relaxation and respite, following a difficult year.",
