        "additional_details": "It is simply unacceptable for the Government not to implement the 2019 review's recommendation of reducing tuition fees. Not only do current tuition fees ignore the decline in quality of education over the pandemic but current fee levels are helping to alienate low-income students who cannot afford these tuition fees, and do not want to take out student loans. Reducing the fees would be an great step in the right direction for diversity and inclusivity in higher education.",
