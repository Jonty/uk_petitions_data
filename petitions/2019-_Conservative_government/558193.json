        "action": "To not suspend driving tests and training in the UK",
        "additional_details": "The government need to no suspend driving training or tests. Theory certificates should be extended and if they feel they need to suspend them, additional tests should be put in place along with funding. Majority of those learning to driving or taking tests are students on minimum wage, unable to keep paying to \u2018start over\u2019. The delay in tests and training is unfair. Furthermore keeping schools open being more dangerous and more pay out on travel.",
        "background": "With the recent government announcement it\u2019s been said that all driving training and tests are suspected. This shouldn\u2019t happen after the delays and issues it caused last time. As well as it being safe in comparison to things staying open.",
