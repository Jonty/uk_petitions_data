        "action": "End immunity & let alleged war crime victims sue states like Russia in UK courts",
        "additional_details": "It is high time to amend the State Immunity Act 1978, to enable alleged victims of war crimes, crimes against humanity and terrorism committed or sponsored by States (included by not limited to Russia) to sue such states in the UK courts and to get compensated from the assets held by those states and their central banks in the UK. UK and its banking system should not be used to support war crimes and terrorism under the guise of sovereign immunity of pariah states.",
        "background": "Russia is accused of committing war crimes in Ukraine by indiscriminately shelling residential areas and killing civilians. Currently, as a sovereign state, it can only be sued by victims in Russian courts, and Russia\u2019s and its Central Bank\u2019s assets in the UK cannot be used to pay alleged victims.",
