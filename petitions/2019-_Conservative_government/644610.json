Blanket reductions in speeds are increasing congestion, increases pollution due to higher times spent in built up areas and frustration from drivers espicially when cyclists and pedestrians are not following safety rules",
        "background": "I want a referendum on any recommended speed limit changes and a probationary period of 6 months on the existing 20mph limits in wales and have specific rules depending on counties not a blanket country wide reduction. We need as the voters to have more control over the speed limits",
