        "additional_details": "Having been personally affected by alcoholism and addiction in my family and friendship circles, I can see the desperate need for funding to improve access to addiction services for addicts, but also for access to support for their families. Lockdown has made is very clear that we need resources in society to help addicts begin and sustain the journey to recovery. Families, including spouses/partners of addicts, also need more robust support services as addiction is truly a family disease.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to recognise that addiction is a mental illness, a disease, and it must be tackled urgently. Addiction services should be brought back to the NHS, with addiction specialists reinstated/sourced. Raising the tax on alcohol could aid to bring funding to addiction services.",
