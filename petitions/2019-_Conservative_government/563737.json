        "additional_details": "The current 'no claims bonus' method is an entity that can not be used across two vehicles simultaneously owned by the same driver. \r\n\r\nIn contrast, any claims made by drivers are required to be declared on ALL vehicles owned concurrently - regardless of the vehicle defined in the claim. \r\n\r\nWith many individuals owning and operating more than one vehicle, either for business or pleasure - the current insurance architecture actively seeks to increase revenue and discount abilities of the owner.",
        "background": "We request a review and modification of car insurer practices, to introduce a fairer approach to multi vehicle ownership that is less weighted to the insurer, and more balanced to safe and considerate drivers with a record of no claims.",
