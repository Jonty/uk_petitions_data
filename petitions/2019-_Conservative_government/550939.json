        "additional_details": "People fleeing their own countries found themselves in already near unlivable conditions in Moria, but fires destroying Europe's largest refugee camp have left people there with nothing and no option but to sleep on streets and in car parks. This includes babies, children and pregnant mothers. Europe has agreed to take just 400 children (3% of the camp's population) in total with Germany, France, the Netherlands and Finland already committed. The UK needs to step up and bring this number higher.",
        "background": "Several European Countries have committed to taking in refugees left without shelter following the fires in the Moria camp on Lesbos. The UK should be committed to joining them.",
