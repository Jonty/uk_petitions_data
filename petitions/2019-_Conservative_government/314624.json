        "additional_details": "The DVSA are a governing body therefore the only way that we as learners can get help with this matter is through the government and parliament. We understand why there is a rule in place for the validity of Theory Tests however, given that MOT testing has been suspended surely there is no more risk to the roads if our Theory Tests are given an extension due to the current extreme circumstances.",
        "background": "During COVID-19 those who were ready for their Driving Test are losing out as their Theory Tests are running out every month this carries on.\r\nWe want the DVSA to extend the 2 year validity on theory tests that have 6 months or less from March 2020 as learners should not lose out due to Coronavirus.",
