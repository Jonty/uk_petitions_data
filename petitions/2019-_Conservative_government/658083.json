        "additional_details": "This struggle is not unique to my family; it's shared by thousands of families with non-verbal children across the country.\r\n\r\nMakaton provides a vital communication bridge for those who cannot speak. Yet, despite its importance, it's not a compulsory part of the primary curriculum in our schools. This lack of education leads to isolation and misunderstanding for non-verbal individuals.\r\n \r\nIn the UK alone, there are approximately 700,000 people (1% of the population) with autism - many of whom might benefit from using or understanding Makaton (National Autistic Society). Moreover, around 7% of children aged 5-16 years have speech and language difficulties (RCSLT).\r\n \r\n",
        "background": "Many children rely on Makaton, a language program using signs and symbols, to communicate. However, they face a significant challenge, many people are unable to understand what they are saying. ",
