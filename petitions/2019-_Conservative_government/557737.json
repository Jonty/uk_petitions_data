        "additional_details": "The economy is being irrevocably impacted by lockdowns with rising numbers of unemployed and failing businesses.  Deaths from covid-19 are mainly in the older age groups ( average age 82 years old) therefore advice on how to shield should be given to those vulnerable groups whilst the rest of the population get on with life. Eventually herd immunity will be reached or the virus will mutate into a less virulent pestilence so we can live with it as we live each year with standard flu.",
        "background": "Continue with local short term restrictions in areas of rising hospital admissions do not implement national lockdown on the 5th November.\r\nAllow food establishments to close at 11pm so that they can support two evening sittings. \r\nGyms stay open in all tiers to support physical and mental health.",
