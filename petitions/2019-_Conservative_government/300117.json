        "additional_details": "The UK government has repeatedly misled the public that granting full citizenship to BN(O)s would violate the Joint Declaration. However, the truth is, as elucidated by Lord Goldsmith, it would not. \r\nChina has declared the Joint Declaration a \u201chistorical document that no longer has any realistic meaning\u201d. Undoubtedly, the human rights situation and rule of law in Hong Kong are now at stake. BN(O)s have a legitimate expectation to live in a civilised society and under rule of law.",
        "background": "The UK government should act on a report published by the House of Commons\u2019s foreign affairs committee on 5th November 2019 and a motion passed by the House of Lords on 24th October 2019 which urged the UK government to grant full citizenship to British National (Overseas).",
