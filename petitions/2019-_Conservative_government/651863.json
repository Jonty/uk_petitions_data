        "additional_details": "The poor statistics and regular lack of positive outcomes for service personnel who go through the Service Complaints process is clear evidence that there needs to be change. Serving personnel can face multiple roadblocks during the service complaints process, which we believe is often due to staff officers passing the buck, not challenging senior officers for fear of it affecting their career, and a lack of care for the role. This lack of courage goes against military values.",
        "background": "The Armed Forces Service Complaints process is largely managed and staffed by serving Army, Navy or Airforce personnel which can hinder how effectively complaints can lead to challenging the rank structure. I think it needs to be replaced by an independent civilian body.",
