        "additional_details": "Anxiety and Depression are the  number 1 mental health problems in the UK and what's more worrying is symptoms and signs are not tangible.  According to the NHS, exercise is a \"magic pill\" against these conditions and gyms need to stay open even in the toughest lockdown conditions. All members we surveyed cited mental health benefits of training during lockdown. In addition it will help save jobs in a \u00a35bn industry that could suffer it's worse decline in history if closures keep happening.",
        "background": "Review and change the rules so that gyms and exercise facilities can remain open to serve the public in their physical and mental wellbeing journey.  Those who are dedicated to keeping themselves and their families healthy should not be punished.",
