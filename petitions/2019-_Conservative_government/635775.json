        "additional_details": "I truly believe everybody in this world no matter who you are deserves to raise a child so why does BMI dictate whether you can bring a child into this world or not? \r\nSo because one woman's BMI is higher than another woman's but have the same condition how does that dictate whether you can have a baby or not. This is why I personally think it should be scrapped for good.",
        "background": "My personal experience with Polycystic ovaries i have being declined numerous times for fertility treatment from my doctor and the NHS even though i lead a healthy lifestyle and work within the fitness industry. I want to scrap BMI for other woman like myself who need help.",
