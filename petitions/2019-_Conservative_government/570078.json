And a matter that they should be responsible for, the 'Regulating Higher Education\u2019 2013 Report called for the improvement of regulation of Higher Education in England. This is more important in these unprecedented times where a universal approach enforced by legislation will be most fair, as discretion from universities creates a varying experience for students leaving some worse off.",
