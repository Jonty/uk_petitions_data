        "additional_details": "If we are able to report and ban the selling of transphobic, anti-lgbt or other discriminatory merchandise then we are lessening the control of bigoted people. Even something as simple as making it possible to report transphobic merchandise can make a difference. No one should be able to make a profit off of discriminatory and hateful ideals. LGBT+ people, especially trans people, must be protected. And this is something small that could help.",
        "background": "We need the Government to ban distributing and selling anti-lgbt, especially transphobic, merchandise. It's extremely damaging to trans people. Hate should not be profitable and the equality act must be updated to include discriminatory merchandise.",
