        "additional_details": "Creating an online school system could help many families with children having mental health issues or refusing to enter school. Those unable to afford private online schooling can get left behind by the current system, which can worsen mental health conditions or lead to punishment for absenteeism. By offering an alternative way of schooling, we can help avoid these social issues. It could also help those with prolonged illness to learn while unable to attend.",
        "background": "Increasing numbers of parents are homeschooling their children, often due to mental health reasons. In-person schools can be overwhelming and difficult for many students with autism or mental health conditions. Instead of punishing absenteeism, online schools should be offered as an alternative.",
