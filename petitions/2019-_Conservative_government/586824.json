Loud speaking, shouting and laughing pose greater risk than quiet singing according to PHE guidance in \u2018Guide to Safer Singing\u2019 document. Science HAS however shown the remarkable health and well-being benefits of singing. Large economies are also affected through venue hires etc.",
        "background": "Choirs, with all the necessary mitigations in place, should be able resume singing together indoors in multiple groups of six immediately, to continue to support the communities in which they are based, and particularly for those that rely on choirs for their well-being or to combat isolation.",
