If they are repeating offenders then ban from keeping dogs due to irresponsible behaviour and endangering other animals and humans. \r\n\r\nMany dogs are walked off leash in public built up areas and this leads to other animals being attacked or unwantingly approached. It makes it harder for owners who have reactive dogs to walk their dog safely, especially when being approached by dogs with poor recall.",
