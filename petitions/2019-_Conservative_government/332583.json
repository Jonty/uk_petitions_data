        "additional_details": "You should be giving all these nurses in the UK a pay rise for the amount they work. Their are people out there with no where near a degree to these amazing nurses and yet they get paid more. They should be giving at least 5% pay rise especially after everything they have done these past few months.",
        "background": "Nurses in the UK have worked under sweat tears and heartache over these past coming months, even saved Boris Johnson from dying. The wage they get is a insult for the hard work they do and the amount they achieve. If it was not for our nurses this country would not have a NHS system.",
