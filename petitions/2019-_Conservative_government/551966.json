        "additional_details": "More than 150 acres of rainforest are lost every minute. We contribute when we buy from a company whose products result in forests being cleared to produce things like palm oil. Often, we do not have control or we don\u2019t know.\r\n \r\nIf the government puts pressure on companies, they will change their practices. We know this because, after the ban of ozone-destroying CFCs, companies found alternatives quickly. We urge the government to take action before damage done to the biodiversity of our planet becomes irreversible.",
        "background": "The Government should ban the import of goods that are not sustainably sourced, such as those that contribute to deforestation and habitat destruction. This would pressure companies to become more sustainable. Products should need to be certified as sustainably sourced to be imported.",
