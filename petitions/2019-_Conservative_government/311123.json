        "additional_details": "Through years of staff cuts, minimal or no pay rises, increased workloads & stress NHS staff have and are stepping upto the plate during this pandemic. Businesses & public have provided staff with their thanks & kind gestures of food & drinks whilst on duty. Working on the frontline means they risk contracting the virus & passing it to their family. Many are living apart to protect their loved ones. The Government should show its appreciation with this tax break in May, June, July & August.",
        "background": "In recognition of the hard work and dedication that NHS staff have shown in responding to the Covid-19 pandemic in the UK as well as the daily risks they are under I would like the government to not deduct income tax from their pay in May, June, July & August 2020.",
