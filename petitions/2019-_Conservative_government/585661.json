It is already possible for inmates to have a computer games console, but decisions about entitlements and privileges for individual inmates is an operational matter for prison services, not the Government or House of Commons.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petition, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nProvide a Covid-19 recovery package for prisoners and their families: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/581689"
