The war in Ukraine has taught us that we must be self sufficient for future generations. Solar farms also significantly impact on a variety of vital wildlife while destroying countryside views in the process.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, it takes about 200 acres to generate the same electricity by solar panels as a single North Sea wind turbine.",

Instead the Government should facilitate solar panel uptake on commercial roofs and other currently redundant spaces like warehouses.",
