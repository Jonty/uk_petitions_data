        "action": "Ban the use of agricultural land for solar panels",
        "additional_details": "Taking valuable Grade 2 and Grade 3a land out of production for photovoltaic panels reduces available resources for food production. The war in Ukraine has taught us that we must be self sufficient for future generations. Solar farms also significantly impact on a variety of vital wildlife while destroying countryside views in the process.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, it takes about 200 acres to generate the same electricity by solar panels as a single North Sea wind turbine.",
        "background": "We want the Government to ban the erection of photovoltaic panels on agricultural land that is or could be used to grow food and plant trees. Instead the Government should facilitate solar panel uptake on commercial roofs and other currently redundant spaces like warehouses.",
