        "additional_details": "The government and/or parliament should make sure that everyone is educated about the negative aspects of British history, e.g. colonialism and slavery. The current curriculum includes the slave trade and the development of the British Empire. However, not all schools teach these topics, thus allowing people in this country to be ignorant about the horrible past of this country. It does not help anyone when schools and/or the government decide to censor certain parts of British history.",
        "background": "The current curriculum is white washed and pro Britain. It does not reveal Britain's involvement with racism and the negative impact it had in several countries. The current curriculum fails to educate everyone about colonialism and slavery and how it can affect minority groups today.",
