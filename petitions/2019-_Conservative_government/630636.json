Then I found out that this is easily done to other capsule medications that have two parts.\r\nThis can lead to direct manipulation of patient health by knowingly overdosing or underdosing, or inserting literally anything within a capsule",

This can include colour marks within a capsule that smear when a capsule is opened, or internal locking mechanisms that snap when a deliberate attempt is made to open a capsule.",
