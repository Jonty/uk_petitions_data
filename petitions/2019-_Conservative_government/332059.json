        "additional_details": "To make it easier for consumers to make a decision when buying a product. People who feel they are against animal testing, but have not actively researched every product they buy may use a product without realising it was tested on animals. Many companies use misleading product names, the word natural, for example, to give the impression they are animal friendly. Stating \u201ctested on animals\u201d would create clarity. I would not extend this rule to medical products as these are essential to health.",
        "background": "At present, if a product is NOT tested on animals it is often shown on the packaging. The consumer has to actively research products that do not display this information. Every product (cosmetics/cleaning products) should have to declare that this product is tested on animals.",
