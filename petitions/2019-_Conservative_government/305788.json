        "additional_details": "Unlike modern 'positive-pressure' ventilators, which push air into the lungs through a tube, Both respirators are a kind of iron lung. They are quicker to build and easier for untrained staff to operate than modern ventilators. Iron lungs are used in UK hospitals today.\r\n\r\nA low-tech (even manually-operable) bellows induces low pressure around the patient, causing the patient to inhale, then high pressure, causing the patient to exhale.\r\n\r\nSee more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Both_respirator",
        "background": "During a polio epidemic in the 1930s, Edward Both created a low-cost (under \u00a3100), quick-to-make (under 24 hours) ventilator for people with respiratory failure. The next year, the UK built 1,700 of the devices. Some are still in use today.\r\n\r\nThe UK should mass-manufacture these simple devices.",
