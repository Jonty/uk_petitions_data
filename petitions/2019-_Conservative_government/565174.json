The cat suffered terribly. The petitioner is aware that the RSPCA have come across many incidents and are asking retailers not to sell them. The petitioner is also informed of a person on a local pet rescue group who has asked retailers not to sell them but the request has been refused because \u2018the profit outweighs the suffering\u2019.\r\nA ban is called for.",
        "background": "Glue traps are available to purchase and are used to trap small animals, not kill them. They are not humane and because they do not kill they cause prolonged suffering.\r\nThey are indiscriminate traps that trap family pets.\r\nThe petitioner would like the government to ban the use of these traps.",
