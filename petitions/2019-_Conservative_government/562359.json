        "additional_details": "The Time to Change campaign works to change the way we all think and act about mental health problems. Despite the progress we\u2019ve made, many people still don\u2019t consider mental health relevant to them. They don\u2019t believe mental health problems are likely to affect them or people they know. the reality is that mental health can affect anyone. This is why we need campaigns such as this to continue, we need stamp out the Stigma and get people to change their attitudes towards this illness.",
        "background": "The Government should provide ongoing funding for national mental health campaigns. One campaign is due to close after 15 years on 31st March 2021 due to the Government claiming that it is not in the position to continue funding this very important cause. ",
