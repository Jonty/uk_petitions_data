        "action": "Do not pass Tier 4 Covid restrictions into law for Christmas Day",
        "additional_details": "The Government has made a number of poor decisions which led to the introduction of tier 4 on Christmas Day. Despite evidence of increasing 11-18yr old transmission, schools and colleges were kept open.  The second lock down was not a lock down, it wasn't followed or enforced. Government had the opportunity to introduce a two week tier 4 lockdown prior to Xmas day (two weeks before) so families could get together for one day, the government failed to do this.",
        "background": "Failure of government to appropriately respond to the Covid health emergency has led to an instruction for tier 4 areas to not mix households on Christmas day. We would like this to be guidance and not law.\r\nGovernment failings should never interrupt individual liberty during religious festivities.",
