Radio presenters are often to referred to as being like family. \r\nWhilst it is true that younger people consume more of their media online, they are also less likely to be paying the license fee and we feel that the BBC should continue to provide this unique service in it's current form.",

Local radio provides an essential service to it's listeners, is often the bedrock of it's community and the Bbc is unqiue in providing thisbservice. Please reconsider these cuts.",
