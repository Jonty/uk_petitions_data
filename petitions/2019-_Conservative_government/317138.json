        "additional_details": "Students should be able to carry on with their chosen path, rather than having a teacher/government awarded grade holding them back. Not having the standard pass grade (4) in English and Maths will be absolutely detrimental to students, meaning they will have to go through the stress of retaking these exams on-top of having sixth form subjects/college to focus on as well. Students with anxiety and mental health problems will find it hard to cope juggling A-Level subjects along side retakes.",

Students should be awarded the standard grade 4, in order to ensure they can carry on with sixth form/college. This would also avoid mass numbers of retakes.",
