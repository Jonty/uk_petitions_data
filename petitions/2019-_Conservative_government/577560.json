        "background": "The Government has forced the addition of ethanol in fuel to meet it\u2019s green agenda,  but these additives are destructive in classic vehicles and their corrosive properties destroy the fuel systems of older vehicles.  This can lead to fuel leakage and it\u2019s risk of fire as well as poor emissions.",
