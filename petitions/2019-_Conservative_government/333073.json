        "action": "Stop the government implementing new law on calorie labelling in UK restaurants",
        "additional_details": "Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of all mental illnesses, with 1 in 5 individuals dying. The new law, introducing calorie labelling in restaurants, cafes and takeaways, will have a dangerous effect on anyone who has ever battled disordered eating. Being forced to see the exact number of calories in every meal will be extremely triggering, and could lead to countless others developing harmful habits surrounding food and weight loss.",
        "background": "We want the government to consider the negative impact of calorie labelling in UK restaurants. Implementing this law would place those with eating disorders at risk, in addition to increasing stigma around weight, and reducing food to numbers. We ask that this law is not put in place.",
