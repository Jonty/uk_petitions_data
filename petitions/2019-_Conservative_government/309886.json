        "additional_details": "It would be a boost to morale and a sign of pride for people awarded the medal for their service to the community during the extremely difficult times we are going through. There is a tradition for medals to be created for those who have volunteered or been called to go into harms way or selflessly work for the benefit of the community during a time of crisis, the recent 'Ebola Medal for Service in Africa' is an example of this, and thus, I believe one should be created for this current crisis.",
        "background": "Many people and businesses are going above and beyond during the current Covid-19 crisis, their efforts deserve award and praise and as such a special medal like the Defence Medal should be created for them.",
