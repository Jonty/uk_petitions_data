The content of written responses, including whether to accept the request of a petition, is a matter for the relevant Government department.\r\n\r\nWhen a petition receives over 100,000 signatures it is entitled to be considered for debate. The timing of any debate is a matter for the Petitions Committee, and due to the suspension of Westminster Hall it is currently not possible for petitions debates to be scheduled as normal."
