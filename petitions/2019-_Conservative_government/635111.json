        "additional_details": "Many parents of separated families would love to have their children 50% of the time and care little about the financial situation. For the sake of 1-2 nights a year some separated parents are having to provide hundreds of pounds to the other parents whilst also having to provide in full a family home, clothes, food, school supplies and everything else their child requires. The system does not count these payments in any financial assessment which allows one to gain and the other to suffer.",
        "background": "Change the thresholds for paying parents down from 182 to 156. To allow those parents that have shared custody with difficult other parents to still have 6/14 nights in a 2 week threshold without being penalised for both caring for their child and maintaining a home for them.",

You can find out more about this here: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/336698/child-living-arrangements.pdf\r\n\r\nIt's not clear if you want to see changes to how child maintenance is reduced for parents who share care for a child, or for parents who have care of a child for at 156 days or more to not have to pay any child maintenance.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
