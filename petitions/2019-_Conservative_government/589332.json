There has been a number of unprovoked violent hate crimes been shared on social media over the past weeks especially in the merseyside area and there needs to be a change. The allowing of football and other sporting events to continue but pride be cancelled just shows the governments complete disregard for lgbtg+ people in favour of the straight majority.",
