        "additional_details": "The pandemic has effected my business personally allowing me to only make 10-20% of what i would usually be making on a monthly basis. \r\nThis is just my case. So many other self employed people are generating 0 income. \r\nNone of us knew this was coming when we set up our businesses, and yet we are written off if we have less than three years worth of accounts.  \r\nSurely there is something that can be done to help the self employed who don't qualify. How is this fair that we are dismissed.",
        "background": "For all self employed people who have less than 3 years worth of accounts there is no help out there for us. Most of us are unable to work due to facilities being closed amoungst other factors and its becoming impossible for people to survive this financially.",
