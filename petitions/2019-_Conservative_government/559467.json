        "additional_details": "Asthmatics such as myself are being charged hundreds of pounds a year just to be able to breath, for a condition we can't help or make better without the use of inhalers. Many people like my self will spend tens of thousands over a lifetime just to breath, a cost many people don't have and have never experienced needing an inhaler, taking breathing clearly for granted. In my life, my family and me have already spent around \u00a34,392, and in a 80 year life span I will have spent around \u00a317,568.",
