The general public don't.\r\nThere are millions of pounds of parcels going missing or damaged every year by these companies.Which is causing huge problems with retailers, customers and suppliers. Wasting time and money.The Courier companies don't care like they say, they already have our money. Parcels are being stolen and damaged due to serious neglect on their part.\r\nSomething needs to be done.",
        "background": "There is currently no official regulatory body in place to hold courier companies accountable for their infamously poor standards of delivery and customer service. More stringent regulations would ensure that they must meet these basic standards and allow complaints to be formally investigated.",
