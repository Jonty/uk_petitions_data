        "additional_details": "With survival rates decreasing rapidly when a cardiac arrest occurs it is imperative that a defibrillator is kept pitchside during all events. Having a defibrillator in a locker in the changing room which could be a couple of minutes away could be too far and life changing. Most grassroots clubs dont have these facilities and it is something that the government need to look into and make sure that funds are available for this to happen and people are adequately trained.",
