        "additional_details": "We believe Skilled Workers who have previously been on Family visas, including those who have gone through a divorce and still choose to stay in the UK as a Skilled Worker, show commitment to the UK. We think a fair ILR clock policy would acknowledge their resilience and not impose additional challenges during life events. Moreover, their cultural and economic contributions help enrich the nation, and we think this should be reflected in reforms to the ILR clock policy.",
        "background": "When moving from a Family Visa to a Skilled Worker Visa, the 5-year clock to ILR resets and the count begins anew. This can add undue stress for those facing major life changes like divorce. We believe this practice imposes unnecessary burdens, despite significant contributions to the UK economy.",
