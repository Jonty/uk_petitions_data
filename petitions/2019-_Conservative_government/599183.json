        "additional_details": "The reason this needs to happen is because the educational system within the UK is terribly inadequate when it comes to learning about Irish, Welsh, Cornish and Scottish cultures, it is important to highlight how those cultures have survived under a thousand years of suppression, how castles were built to control and keep check on the natives, how they were punished for speaking the native tongue, how they had to protest to get any TV and Radio services in their own language",
        "background": "To teach everyone within the British realm the true history of how the Celts were perpetrated against, we urge the British Parliament to dedicate a day to celebrate Indigenous People's Day to recognise existing Brythonic and Goedelic cultures and their right to be heard within the British union.",
