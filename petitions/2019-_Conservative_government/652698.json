        "additional_details": "The new income rules are ludicrous. Of course it will reduce immigration, but we need to focus on the bigger picture. Other things can be done to increase the efficiency of the country, things that may not be directly related to immigration. There are lots of skilled workers who will have no option of coming to the UK, leaving us with little economical growth. Setting rules which only allow rich people into the country would further increase income inequality.",
