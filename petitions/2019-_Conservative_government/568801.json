Due to the stay and work at home policies in place, MPs' expenditure allowances should be stopped and replaced with a minimum allowance that covers the cost of a standard return train fare and up to \u00a350 for food and drink. These expenses can only be claimed when attending the houses of parliament. As you keep telling us \"We're all in this together\".",
