        "additional_details": "This petition only calls for the UK Government to recognise the status of the Holodomor as genocide, not for retribution.\r\n\r\nThe UK Government has claimed that the Genocide Convention cannot be retroactively applied. However, this only applies to the punishment of a crime not previously specified in law, not whether the crime can still be applied to the event.\r\n\r\nThe Soviet Union Government of the day are dead, as is the Soviet Union itself, so cannot be punished for what they did.\r\n\r\nIt can, however, be recognised in law that the Holodomor was a genocide of the Ukrainian people through the deliberate policies of the Soviet Union.",
