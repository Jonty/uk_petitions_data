        "action": "Don't implement a ban on disposable vapes",
        "additional_details": "Disposable vapes provide help for adults who wish to stop smoking tobacco. It has been estimated that vaping is 95% less harmful than smoking. The main concerns the Government have with disposable vapes are some manufacturers marketing their products toward children, and the environmental impacts. I believe sales to children can be prevented via other measures, such as legislation to prevent minors purchasing age restricted products, for example Challenge 25, which is already utilised in retail settings.",
        "background": "It has been reported that the Government are planning to bring forward legislation to ban disposable vapes. I think that this is an enormous overreach by the state and encroaches on an individual's right to choose what they do with their own body.",
