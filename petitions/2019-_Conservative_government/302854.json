        "additional_details": "The government has taken a so far rather dormant approach to containment of COVID-19. Stronger measures should have been adopted far sooner. From the onset of knowledge of the virus travel restrictions and quarantine from affected areas should have been implemented. Moving forward we no longer wish for this governments delayed and weak response, with the nonsensical explanation that scientific advise is to continue a lack of action. We require actions to aim to limit the virus spread.",
        "background": "We need escalated action to slow our delay phase of COVID-19, such as adopted by other countries. Mandatory social distancing measures and lockdown period, travel restrictions and a ban on larger social gatherings and events. Also further focus on ventilator acquisitions.",
