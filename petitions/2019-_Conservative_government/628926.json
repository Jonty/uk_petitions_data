        "action": "Stop the expansion of the Ultra-low Emission Zone (ULEZ) into Greater London.",
        "additional_details": "The expansion of the ULEZ will be an incredible burden on the residents of London as well as commuters who travel into London every day, especially because we are in the middle of a cost of living crisis. The benefit of any expansion of ULEZ has to be proven without doubt by scientific facts, which are not present, and there must be a study done on its effects on people's lives. The ULEZ charge is effectively a fine on those who work in London and cannot afford a newer, ULEZ compliant car.",
        "background": "The Mayor of London has promised to expand the London Ultra-low Emission Zone into the whole of Greater London by August 2023. We firmly believe that the people of the UK, especially the residents of London and the Home Counties, desire that Parliament prevents this expansion from happening.",
