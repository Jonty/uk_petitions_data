        "additional_details": "There are serious concerns within the LGBT community about the level the proposed reforms, or lack thereof, will infringe upon the rights and freedoms of members of the Transgender Community. As an already marginalised community the proposals the minister has put forward further marginalise and endanger Transgender people in public spaces. The removal of proposed reforms for the Gender Recognition Process will also reinforce a traumatic system that a vulnerable community has to go through.",
