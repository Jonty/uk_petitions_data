        "additional_details": "It is clear that the NHS and social care staff's struggle against Covid-19 is of historical significance. This is of a magnitude only experienced in times of war and so - alongside any appropriate remuneration and future amelioration of NHS and care staff - there should be a permanent reminder of the sacrifices made by these key workers in a time of otherwise peace. It is appropriate that this comes from The Government given the status of the NHS and the funding history of other past memorials.",
        "background": "To fund the creation of a permanent memorial in a suitable site - perhaps outside a London Hospital or Parliament - similar to, and of the same status as, war or political memorials, to mark the lives lost of, and sacrifices made by, healthcare workers in the battle against Covid-19.",
