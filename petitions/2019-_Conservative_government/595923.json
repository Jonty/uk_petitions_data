However, information on one subject can be taught within a few hours and is dragged out to eight hours to suite vosa.  5 modules to learn such as first aid could have been chosen every year which made the scheme a debarcle.  Now we have a dangerous situation with covid, I think all courses should be online only, to be learnt at the drivers discretion.",
