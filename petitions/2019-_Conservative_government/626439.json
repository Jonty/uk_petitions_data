        "additional_details": "I would like to see a legally required, organisationally separate, guidance or support worker in place to help a carer who has been falsely accused get back on their feet. Also, for free re-education and counselling to be available to help those who feel they cannot return to care work to train in other professions. Finally, legally required fully paid leave for the time the carers are in counselling if they plan to return to work.",

To prevent other carers going through the mental health crisis I went through, I want a legal framework put in place to ensure that the wellbeing needs of a carer are met after a false accusation.",
