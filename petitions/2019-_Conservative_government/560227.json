        "additional_details": "Discrimination on this magnitude will lead to the restrictions on any persons who elect not to have a test or a vaccine. This is against our human rights. Government should pass a bill ensuring that our human rights are protected against corporations seeking to limit our freedoms based on medical grounds. It has never been allowed by law to discriminate on this basis however the stance recently announced by some firms clearly does this. Parliament need to act to ensure our freedoms in future.",
        "background": "The government should ratify that this is discrimination against the public on medical grounds. No person should have to show a medical status to access a variety of services. This is detrimental to human rights and coercing the population into taking the vax or test.",
