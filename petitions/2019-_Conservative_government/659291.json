        "additional_details": "It could create a positive effect on the environment as more people may want to ride their bike, which could lead to less cars on the road. This could mean that less carbon dioxide will be emitted into the atmosphere. Cyclists may also be better able to ride without the fear of getting hit by a car.",
        "background": "We want more bike lanes for cyclists who need to get places, such as get to trails, or get to work. This could help reduce car use, and so carbon dioxide levels. This could also mean road cyclists have less fear of getting hit by a car and may feel more inclined to go on their bike.",
