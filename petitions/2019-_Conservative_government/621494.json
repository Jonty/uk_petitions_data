        "additional_details": "The Sunday Law currently causes great inconvenience in peoples lives as it is the one day that most places are shut. For example, if someone needed something urgently delivered for the next day which happened to be a Sunday, this wouldn't be possible. If this law was eliminated, restrictions like this wouldn't exist, therefore making life easier. It would also be good for the economy as it means people can buy and sell goods and services more than before.",
        "background": "I would like the government to eliminate the Sunday law that currently prevents businesses from being open for more than 6 hours on a Sunday. Eliminating this law will allow businesses to be open the same hours on Sunday as every other day of the week.",

Sunday trading laws prevent large shops from opening to the public on Sundays, rather than preventing all businesses from operating.  Removing these restrictions would not affect Sunday deliveries or shipping.  Decisions on whether other businesses operate on a Sunday is a decision for individual businesses to make. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.
