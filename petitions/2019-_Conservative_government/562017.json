        "additional_details": "Currently there is only one specialised service available to help transgender children, GIDS (Gender Identity Development Service) commissioned by NHS England. I am a young transgender male and I am on the waiting list for GIDS. I am struggling massively with gender dysphoria, wanting to end my life on a daily basis, and cant get any professional help as of now when I need it, due to the waiting list of 2.5 years. I know that there are many other children in my situation and we need help now.",
        "background": "I would like the Government or Parliament to provide more services for young struggling transgender children as there is only one specialised service available at the moment, with a waiting list of over 2 and a half years.",
