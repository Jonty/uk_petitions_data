        "action": "Provide global climate leadership by ending any new UK oil and gas extraction",
        "additional_details": "The viability of our societies depends on limiting global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C above the pre-industrial era average. It has already risen 1.1\u00b0C. \r\n\r\nWithout deep carbon and methane pollution cuts (from burning fossil fuels) between now and 2030, the 1.5\u00b0C goal is unachievable. \r\n\r\nThe UK Government must show global climate leadership by ending any new oil and gas extraction and announce support for a rapid expansion of renewable energy and a plan for increasing energy efficiency of UK homes.",
        "background": "Greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning are choking our planet and putting billions of people at immediate risk. But the UK Government plans to allow new oil and gas fields to start up between now and 2050. The UK Government must change policy and stop any new UK oil and gas extraction.",
