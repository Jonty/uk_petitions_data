        "additional_details": "With the recent and past lockdowns preventing students from being in school and getting proper education, taking these exams will be extremely difficult. As it is international, UK students are competing against more advantaged students in other countries. Considering last years were cancelled at a much better point than students are currently in it is only fitting to at least reduce the courses or postpone the exams. These exams are crucial for many so taking them after this past year is unfair",
        "background": "International exam boards such as CIE have not been forced by the government to cancel their exams. They have recently announced that students in the UK will be sitting their exams at the normal time on the full syllabus. The government should stop this from happening by cancelling these exams.",
