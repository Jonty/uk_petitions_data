        "additional_details": "Sadly on 20th March 2020 our beautiful cat Ruby was hit by a car, the driver never stopped. While the driver carried on with their lives a part of our family lay dying, in pain & scared with nobody to comfort her. When I found my girl she was already dead, she died alone & the way I found her will haunt me for the rest of my life. So many people believe a cat is \"Just a cat\" but she was our cat and part of our family.",
