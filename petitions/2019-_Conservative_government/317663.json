They are under a lot of emotional stress due to new regulations affecting their degree and graduations, but the government has done nothing to support students in anyway.",
        "background": "Contrary to popular belief, financial assist for students is a rare commodity. Most students have lost jobs, don't receive finance and cant rely on family. Yet landlords are still expecting rent and have a legal right to take students to the small claims court over unpaid rent in a Pandemic.",
