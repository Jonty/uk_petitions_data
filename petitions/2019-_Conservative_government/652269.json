        "action": "Ban local authorities imposing 20mph speed limits on major roads",
        "additional_details": "While I agree with the 20mph speed limit on back roads, outside schools and hospitals, etc., because it can reduce the number of serious accidents and fatalities, imposing it on major roads can make it very slow, difficult, and frustrating to move from A to B. Drivers can become very angry and aggressive when a car in front of them is moving at 20mph. It can delay journeys from the school run to getting to and from work, and all the businesses and services that are reliant on the road network.",
        "background": "We want the Government to ban local authorities from using of 20mph speed limits on major roads, such as on A roads, main roads, dual carriageways, etc. However, the 20mph speed limit should be allowed on back roads, outside schools and hospitals, etc.",
