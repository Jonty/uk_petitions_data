The system is hugely letting children down due to waiting times. 3 years to wait to see a consultant is not acceptable. These children need the support now . Not in 3 years time. For an EHCP it's 12 weeks! Another 12 weeks on top of the 3 years they are waiting. It's time to change and the change is now!",

Same answer. No doctors, high capacity. Children are suffering in mainstream school  when they should be in a specialist school!",
