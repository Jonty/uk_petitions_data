        "additional_details": "Every morning the beaches and streets are littered with plastic cups that are given to customers by bar staff. The drinking establishments don't take any responsibility for this and the council have to pay to have the beaches cleaned. A lot of this plastic ends up in the sea before the council clear it up. Enforcing deposits for take away items has already been successfully adopted by festivals around the world and something has to be done about the litter problem we have here in the UK.",
        "background": "Food and drink establishments should be banned from giving customers single use plastic to take-away. If people were given cups, with an enforced deposit charge, this would give them incentive to return the items. This would clear up the beaches and streets as well as being far more sustainable.",
