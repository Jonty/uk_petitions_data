They have done their utmost to keep the entire health system running even when it was under the very real threat of being overwhelmed. Offering then a 1 percent rise is frankly an insult and in no way recognises their dedication and sacrifice. Failure to reward that service will risk driving people out of the NHS and may dissuade others from seeing the NHS as a career option.",
