Already Sadiq Khan, Mayor of London, has asked for a list of London statues to be removed.  Nelson perhaps, he opposed the abolition of politicianry.  Cleopatra maybe, she was a supporter of politicianry and Wilberforce himself, whilst he supported the abolition of politicianry he also opposed the emancipation of women and catholics.",
