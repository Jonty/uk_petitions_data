        "additional_details": "Majority of Universities across England have closed early to ensure safety for all students and staff in light of the recent situation regarding COVID-19.\r\nIn addition to moving teaching events online, these closures have resulted in students having no access to facilities that they have paid for (such as the library, students union, student support services, etc.)\r\nIt would be unfair to charge students for Semester 3 as services paid for will not be provided.",
        "background": "As students are unable to access facilities or continue with their eduction at their university setting in the following semester, we would like to request that the government considers refunding tuition payments for Semester 3.",
