        "additional_details": "I am in my 40's.  Been renting for 20+ yrs.  In this time, I've only defaulted twice on my monthly rent.  I (like many others) unfortunately have never had my bum in the butter (for lack of a better phrase).  No inheritance, no wealthy parents, no big salary.  I live hand to mouth.  I don't have surplus cash each month.  If I had even \u00a3100 spare p/m, it would take me approx 25 yrs to save a 10% \u00a330k deposit.  I'll be in my 60's by then.  No bank is going to give me a 25 yr mortgage at that age.",
        "background": "I'd like the Government to implement 0% Deposit Mortgages for First Time Buyers that are renting or have been renting for at least 5 years.  If they're able to pay rent with little to no defaulting on their payments, they would surely prefer to be paying their own mortgage and not their landlords.",
