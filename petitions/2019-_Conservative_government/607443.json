You can read the curriculum content for these new subjects here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/personal-social-health-and-economic-education-pshe\r\n\r\nWe can accept petitions calling for changes to the new curriculum, but you'd need to be clear what changes you wanted. The curriculum is about what children are taught in school, so couldn't cover things such as whether parents choose to grow kitchen gardens at home."
