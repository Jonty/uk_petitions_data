Parks & High Streets are the main targets. Animals are being shot, maimed & killed for fun & left to die slow painful deaths. Adults are threatened with being shot on a regular basis & sometimes actually shot. Councils do nothing to stop this. Police are constantly being called out to the same people over & over again. It has to stop!",
