        "action": "Please prioritise essential retail workers for a vaccine.",
        "additional_details": "Workers have access to only basic PPE & handle interactions with the public often also failing to distance and wear masks. This also includes handling cash & produce touched by the public. Refusing entry & requesting exemption proof leads to conflict in stressful situations. By not prioritising critical workers whose children are in school & yet allowing essential retail to open, you allow pools of unvaccinated workers, the public & children to continue to transmit in these busy environments.",
        "background": "Consider a vaccination programme based on occupation as well as vulnerability. Critical workers, including essential retail staff, should be prioritised, regardless of their individual vulnerability. Essential retail supply chains are hotbeds of virus transmission & yet they need to be secure.",
