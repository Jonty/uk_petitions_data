        "additional_details": "NMOSD is a rare neurological condition, it is estimated that it currently affects less than 1,000 people in the UK. Disease awareness is vital to enable optimal patient diagnosis, support and long-term care.\r\n\r\nNMOSD can cause irreversible damage to the optic nerve, spinal cord, brain and brain stem. Lack of awareness often slows down the diagnosis process or leads to misdiagnosis. An acute attack, if left untreated, puts a patient at high risk of permanent disability or worse, death. Misdiagnosis is also of great consequence to patients. It's important that awareness among the public and health care professionals is increased, to enable prompt diagnosis, treatment and support to patients and their caregivers.",
