Implementing brexit is clearly secondary to the health and well being of the country and has already cost billions of pounds that could have been spent on our NHS and on emergency measures to combat this virus.\r\n\r\nThe government need to ask the EU to extend the transition period in order to deal with this outbreak.",
        "background": "Parliament and government need to take this opportunity and show some leadership by dealing with the Covid 19 /Corona Virus exclusively, and the consequences. It cannot do that at the same time as implementing brexit.",
