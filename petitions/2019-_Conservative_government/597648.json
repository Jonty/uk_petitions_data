        "action": "Export unused vaccines to Uganda before they expire and go to waste.",
        "additional_details": "Today, in the UK and across the world, vast stockpiles of covid vaccines are expiring and going to waste. Meanwhile, countries like Uganda are suffering due to dire shortages of vaccinations; leaving many to suffer and face an unjust loss of life. At present, only 0.9% of Ugandans have been fully vaccinated, in contrast to the UK\u2019s 66.9%. As a nation, we have the means and resources to help struggling countries like Uganda, and we must take action now to prevent any further loss of life.",
        "background": "This is an urgent proposal to export covid vaccinations to Uganda. The wasteful stockpiling that we are witnessing in the UK and worldwide is immoral, and needs to stop. By sending these spare vaccines to countries most in need, such as Uganda, we can stop this waste, and save millions of lives.",
