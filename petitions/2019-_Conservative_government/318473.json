        "additional_details": "I was astonished to hear Nurses have to pay \u00a3120 a year to be registered to look after people. Surely once passsing exams this would make them qualified. I am not aware of any other proffesion having to do this, a Mechanic doesn't pay an annual fee so they can repair vehicles, MPs dont pay an annual fee to sit in Parliment, no they actually get attendance bonuses. With this outbreak of COVID19 we are seeing nurses have put themselves at risk without the incorrect PPE caring for patients.",
