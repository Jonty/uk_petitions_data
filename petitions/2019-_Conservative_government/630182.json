        "additional_details": "English Literature is an outdated GCSE unless someone wants a career in writing. Studying Shakespeare etc doesn\u2019t encourage reading in some young people or interest the young mind. In my opinion, the subject bores young people who groan at the thought of having this lesson; this can encourage misbehaviour during lessons if  students don\u2019t care for the subject. The subject would be much more appreciated if it was a chosen GCSE where only students who enjoy English Literature are being taught.",
