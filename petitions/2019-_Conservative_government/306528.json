        "additional_details": "The Hospitality industry is worth \u00a373bn to the UK economy, boasts over 3m jobs and supports millions more.\r\nBy advising the public to avoid bars/restaurants etc without officially closing them down (meaning their operators can't claim against their insurance), condemning that industry to bankruptcy and mass unemployment. Therefore a set of measures needs to be taken to ensure there will be a solid reason with general concern that can help this industry shutting down temporarily",
        "background": "The UK government needs to take all the necessary measures to avoid major collapses in these challenging times therefore it needs to support the ability to claim insurance for a huge decline in trade",
