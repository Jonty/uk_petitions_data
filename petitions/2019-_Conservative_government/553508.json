Clearly, the groups at the top of the list (care home/health workers, older and vulnerable people) take priority, but school/childcare workers who cannot distance/use PPE should also be included.",

We could accept a petition calling on the Government to prioritise teachers, school and childcare staff for any Covid-19 vaccine.\r\n\r\nWe have also published the following petition, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nPrioritise keyworkers being vaccinated against COVID-19 first for free: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/316857"
