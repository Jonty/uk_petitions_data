        "additional_details": "Exams are prominent in the UK; they can decide people's lives, but I feel they are out-dated. The whole point of exams is to evaluate students\u2019 knowledge but by being forced to revise for them that purpose is defeated, after the test students often forget what they have just revised. Much of what you learn in school feels like a waste, therefore exams are unnecessary and we should get rid of them and opt for a different approach.",
