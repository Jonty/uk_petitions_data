        "additional_details": " \r\nEach year on average every household in the UK uses 4 rolls, which is 227,000 miles of wrapping paper. Due its shiny nature much of this cannot be recycled, and an estimated 83km2 gets put into landfill. This area would wrap Big Ben / Elizabeth Tower 260,000 times. This can easily be stopped.\r\n \r\nSeveral years ago there was a campaign to decrease the plastic packaging in Easter eggs and this was highly successful. Let\u2019s make this Christmas more recyclable than ever!",
        "background": "The Government should ban wrapping paper which cannot be recycled through normal paper recycling routes in all collection areas. This is a particular issue at Christmas, when a huge amount of non-recyclable wrapping paper is bought and then thrown away.",
