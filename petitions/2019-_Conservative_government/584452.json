        "additional_details": "So far, the UK has only sent 495 oxygen concentrators, 120 non-invasive ventilators and 20 manual ventilators to India. This is a minuscule number taking into consideration India\u2019s population size of 1.391 billion and their covid infection rate, which reached over 323,000 new cases on April 26th alone. It will remain in this country\u2019s conscience if we do not help when we have the resources to do so.",
