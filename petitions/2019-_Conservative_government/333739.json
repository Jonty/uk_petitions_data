        "action": "Implore Government To Fast Track The Employment (Dismissal & Re-Employment) Bill",
        "additional_details": "The Government should push this Bill through with all possible haste. This disgraceful practice circumvents all other legal employment protections and allows companies to blackmail (which in itself is illegal) employees out of their legally contracted rights. This was never the intention of the original legislation and is effectively a sordid loophole that should be closed immediately! Both British Gas & British Airways are using this practice currently to hold their employees to ransom!!!!",
        "background": "This is a Private Members Bill 132 2019/21 introduced by Gavin Newlands MP to prohibit employers using the disgraceful & immoral practice of dismissing employees and subsequently re-employing them for the purpose of diminishing the terms and conditions of employment.",
