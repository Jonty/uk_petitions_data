        "action": "Increase student finance due to increase to cost of living",
        "additional_details": "Facing ever-increasing cost of living, with rising prices making ends meet has become increasingly difficult. The average student spends over \u00a3800 per month on living expenses. Students are forced to take on jobs or rely on their families for financial support. This can have a negative impact on their studies & mental health. Increasing student finance would help alleviate financial stress. We ask the government to increase student finance, so our education or mental health isn't sacrificed.",
        "background": "Increase student finance for students due to the cost of living increase. Students are struggling to cover food, gas and electricity, travel, and clothing costs. Students rely on food banks, credit cards or borrowing money, others just can't manage and have to leave education and find work.",
