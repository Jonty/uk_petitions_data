        "additional_details": "Students currently in year 11 are the true tragedy of COVID. They have missed 18 months of their education and will be expected to sit their exams. The gaps in their education are to extensive to close the gaps adequately for them to get in to their chosen college courses. The government need to allow teacher grades to stand for the exam period of 2022 to give these children a chance at succeeding. If these children are forced in to a situation of sitting exams without any allowances then we are just setting them up to fail. There needs to be provision put in place so that all children sitting their exams in 2022 get the grades that their teachers know they are capable of.",
