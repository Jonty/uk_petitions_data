        "additional_details": "The probability for lash extensions to fall out unprovoked are very low- they are attached to your natural lash and the only way they fall out is when your real lash falls out during your natural lash cycle. If anything, a false lash would be easier to identify as a foreign object. Lashes help improve mental health, confidence and self love, they should be allowed in the work place and do not object to any health and safety regulations.",
        "background": "Change health and safety audits to allow people to wear lashes who work in hospitality/ restaurants. These workers are paid minimum wage and work most evenings and weekends, spending long hours at work. They should be allowed to feel confident and beautiful as lashes don\u2019t effect health and safety.",
