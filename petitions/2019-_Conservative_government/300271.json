        "additional_details": "Teaching is a tough job and comes with a lot of self control and determination. Teachers not only have to work a lot out of school hours for example: home work marking, assessments, preparing for the next day. They are expected to deal with frequent challenging behaviour from students. They must be alert, patient and reliable with their students throughout the day. Without teachers we would not have students...and without students we would not have future generations of an educated workforce.",
