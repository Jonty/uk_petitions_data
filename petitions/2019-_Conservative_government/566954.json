        "additional_details": "Also i just would like to point out as boris johnson said \"we have more vaccinated people right now than in the whole of uk combined?\" well if it is so effective then why cant GCSE students be given priority to sit the exams whilst vaccinated and go home because surely if the number of vaccinated people are a lot then in 5 months there will be hopefully more than a million vaccinated people",
        "background": "i feel as if it is not fair for GCSE students like myself and A-level students to not have our exams as last year a lot of people were underpredicted for their GCSE  and what i could really achieve the also these exams are a huge factor to deciding our future so do the right thing and rethink this",
