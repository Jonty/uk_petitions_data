        "action": "Cancel all exams for GCSEs, A Levels & BTECs and to base grades on classwork.",
        "additional_details": "The government should take action to cancel all these exams because a lot of students have missed a lot of content in learning which can\u2019t be condensed into a year with new content. The pressure it would have on students would be too much to handle and not forgetting the pressure it would have on teachers and the educational system. Every school and college have different rules in terms of how often a student/s comes into a educational setting and some have more learning time than others and this is not fair and not on a level playing field as education should be within this country, as we strive for equality we need to help the students and teachers by doing this.",
        "background": "With the current coronavirus pandemic having a massive impact on education and learning within schools and colleges. The government should follow Wales in cancelling all exam based assessments for 2021 and to base and predict grades from classwork and assessments.",
