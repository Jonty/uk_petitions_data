We cannot ignore the link between individuals concealing their identity in public with; anti-social behaviour, criminal activity and possession of knives and other offensive weapons. People do this whilst feeling secure that they are able to commit offences and remain unidentifiable. Our young people are losing their lives, and ruining their futures.",
