        "additional_details": "Great crested newts are a protected species, their numbers are declining. Currently they are protected through Annex II and IV of the EU habitats directive.\r\n\r\nAs the UK recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic we should lead the way for a green revolution for the environment and economy.\r\n \r\nThe Government should clarify whether it has any plans to remove protected species legislation for newts, which could lead to a further removal of environmental protections in this country and is the opposite of what is needed now.",
        "background": "During a recent speech from PM he said \"the newt-counting delays in our system are a massive drag on the productivity and prosperity of this country\" This is worrying, it sounds like he wants to remove protected species legislation and this could lead to degrading of environmental protection laws.",
