        "additional_details": "The countries surrounding Ukraine, including some of the poorest in Europe, have opened their arms to people fleeing the war. Most are women and children. The UK has been right to give support to Ukraine\u2019s military, but it now has a clear responsibility to help its people. Restrictions on Ukrainian nationals must be lifted immediately. A fast-track route should be created, with Ukrainians able to claim asylum without needing to travel here first. We must also support others hosting refugees.",
        "background": "The Russian invasion of Ukraine has caused at least 120,000 refugees to flee the country (source: UNHCR). The UK Government should immediately relax visa restrictions on anyone fleeing the conflict. Failure to do so would make the UK complicit in a humanitarian disaster. We must help those in need.",
