        "action": "All NHS frontline staff to receive a 10% pay increase once COVID-19 has settled",
        "additional_details": "I believe that this current situation/pandemic has left many people in a vulnerable position, none more so than those frontline workers of the NHS. Whilst businesses shut and people told to stay home, those workers will be the ones to show up everyday to fight this pandemic. The NHS has never been needed more than it does now, time and time again they go as the unrecognised heroes and I think a 10% pay increase is more than reasonable as a mandatory reward for those who unequivocally deserve it.",
        "background": "I want the government to have a serious look at increasing the pay for the NHS workers that are fighting this awful pandemic, frontline. Everyday they are at risk, and everyday they give us their duty and resolve without hesitation. They are the heroes in all this and deserve monetary recognition.",
