        "additional_details": "I worked as a Customer Service Officer at a large public transport interchange for seven years and saw how the local police struggled to manage the constant stream of incidents we reported to them.  This led to a heavy drain on their resources in a time before austerity.\r\n\r\nSuch a large, constant and daily ask for policing resources sometimes led to a difficult relationship between the interchange and the police.  \r\n\r\nWe had genuine calls for service and they had no resources to respond.\r\n\r\nWe need to get the police to mirror British Transport Police (BTP) who currently police the railways.  BTP have an excellent record on dealing with criminal offences in the rail station/train environment - lets replicate that with bus/tram stations and the people who work in the industry.",
        "background": "Specialised policing doesn't exist for bus/tram crew and the stations from which they operate. This void leads to a lack of understanding from the police around what happens in this public transport environment up to & including dealing with serious offences.",
