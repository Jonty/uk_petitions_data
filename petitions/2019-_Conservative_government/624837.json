Many have families around the world, especially in the UK, but are unable to safely, or sustainable seek refuge in the UK. 11,300 Afghans have been granted Indefinite Leave to Remain, through the bespoke visa schemes set up for them. The systems and processes exist we just lack the will to act. We have the opportunity to meaningfully act now.",
