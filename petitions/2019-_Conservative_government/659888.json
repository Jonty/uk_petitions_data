Student loans can become a burden on young adults and puts restraints on them progressing with equal opportunities.\r\n \r\nI think that student finance has become a cash cow for the Government. I personally believe that the current system is a method of targeting people at the earliest point in their career and constitutes institutional exploitation.\r\n",
