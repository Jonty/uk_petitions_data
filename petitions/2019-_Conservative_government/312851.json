        "additional_details": "It isn't fair to have extra time off work when we cannot leave the house or use the bank holidays like we usually would. \r\nBank holidays are important to everyone, and the UK would benefit from having them later in the year when we are out of lockdown and can enjoy them with our loved ones. \r\nIt would help the British economy to take them later in the year when pubs, bars and restaurants are back open and it would increase the country's morale after Covid-19.",
        "background": "Bank holidays are a huge part of British culture, but whilst we are in Lockdown, we cannot utilise them like we usually would with friends and family. The petition is to move the current upcoming bank holidays to later in the year when the UK is out of Lockdown.",
