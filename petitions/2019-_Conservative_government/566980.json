        "additional_details": "Students around England are being left unsupported, anxious and are paying small fortunes to take a course which isn\u2019t providing them the experience and qualities that they are paying for.\r\nThe government needs to address universities equally to how they have addressed primary and secondary schools. There has been no action from the government which supports tuition fees, accommodation fees, emphasis on university support, quality of work and a lack of empathy for student wellbeing.",
        "background": "University students need to be supported and reimbursed for tuition fees paid over the duration of COVID-19. Online teaching needs to be discounted. Expectations of students producing quality university work needs to be lowered during the pandemic as it has in primary and secondary.",
