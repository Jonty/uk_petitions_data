        "action": "End the use of horses by the police as a means of crowd control",
        "additional_details": "The current protests in London have highlighted how dangerous this practice is to 3 parties; the officers, protestors and horses themselves. Police officers that fall from their mounts are seriously injured and civilian protestors are at risk of severe injury by being trampled. It is animal cruelty to make horses perform a dangerous duty that they cannot consent to. This is an outdated practice that has no place in the modern age.",
        "background": "Limit the use of horses by the police so they are no longer put in danger by being used as tools to control or intimidate crowds. Allow for groups of no larger than 3 mounted officers to be used at a time. End the practice of gathering mounted officers to stampede into civilians.",
