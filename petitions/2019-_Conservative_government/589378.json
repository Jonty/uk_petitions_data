There was no prosecution as it happened on private land, even though all other relevant sections of the legislation applied in this case.\r\n \r\nFamilies like my own have received no justice just because of the location. The defendant acts just as carelessly or dangerously, depending on the offence, whether it is on public or private land, however this loophole in the law creates devastating consequences for families like mine.",
