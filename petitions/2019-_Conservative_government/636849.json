        "additional_details": "Despite their skillset, social care workers often only earn the National Minimum Wage. Community carers can find it hard to keep their essential cars roadworthy. We believe the Local Authority/Integrated Care Board rates paid to care providers give no scope to pay social care workers a fair rate or to provide safe practice. We implore the Government to provide ring-fenced funding to enable fair rates for care delivery using the learnings from the 2022 \u2018Fair Cost of Care\u2019 exercise.",
