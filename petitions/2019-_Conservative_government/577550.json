        "additional_details": "As a result of conflict, an estimated 20 million people depend on humanitarian assistance, and over 2 million children are acutely malnourished.\r\n\r\nThe UK Government have cited the financial strains of the Coronavirus pandemic for the reduction in funding. \r\n\r\nHowever, maintaining current contributions to the UN program would cost less then 0.04% of UK Government total Coronavirus support spending but create a disproportionately large impact - crucially our leadership will directly save lives.",
        "background": "At a time when the United Nations are seeking \u00a32.76bn in aid to prevent the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Yemen, the UK Government should reverse the decision to reduce their contribution from \u00a3214m in 2020 to \u00a387m in 2021.",
