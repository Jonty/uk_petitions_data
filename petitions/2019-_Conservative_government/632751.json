        "additional_details": "Every year the UK animal research industry experiments on around 3 million animals. These experiments can cause pain, suffering, distress and lasting harm, including on mice, hamsters, rabbits, cats, dogs, horses and monkeys.\r\n\r\nExposing sentient beings to such suffering is said to be essential for the development of medicines, vaccines and safety techniques because \"there is no alternative\". But there are alternatives, lots of them (organ-on-chips, organoids, animal free antibodies). Time to switch.\r\n",
        "background": "This petition calls on the Government to take the necessary steps - e.g., regulatory change, much greater funding for the development, validation, education and training of replacement science - to end the use of animals in scientific and medical research.",
