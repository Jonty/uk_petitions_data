FASD sufferers can struggle with everyday life. It can cause a range of conditions including lifelong learning disabilities, often requiring a specialist school if they can't cope in mainstream school. There needs to be more information for women so this doesn't happen to more innocent children. I don't want children to face this struggle.",
