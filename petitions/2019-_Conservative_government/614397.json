        "additional_details": "As stated before, the WHO has conducted studies into the carcinogenicity of meat. They have been able to conclude that processed meat is a Group 1 carcinogen, and red meat is a group 2A carcinogen. Group 1 means there's sufficient evidence to suggest it DOES cause cancer, and group 2A means it likely causes cancer. Other items in group 1 include plutonium, asbestos, and other, incredibly harmful products. Yet meat is available for purchase, and even advertised on television. This needs to change",
        "background": "Cigarettes are classified by the WHO's IARC as a group 1 carcinogen. This means they do cause cancer, and legally require a warning on the packaging. Processed meat is classified in the same group, and people are often unaware of the dangers it poses to human health, so should also have a warning.",
