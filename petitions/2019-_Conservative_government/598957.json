Without the carbohydrate data, they cannot calculate their insulin dosage - the majority will also not purchase. Diabetics are being discriminated against wherever they go to eat - even if they only want an ice-cream.",

It is totally farcical that, if you order a pizza you don't need to label it, but if it was on the shelf, you do.",
