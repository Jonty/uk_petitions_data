        "additional_details": "Farage has shown fortitude in the Brexit debate and led as a focus the British people in a way nobody else did. He even put his party's prospects in the General Election behind the needs of the Country when he withdrew candidates strategically. The UK needs examples of bravery and determination like his and the Country needs to honour such qualities in this time of needing unity.",
        "background": "Parliament should come together and put aside party differences to award Farage a knighthood in recognition of his bravery and determination to get the UK's sovereignty back. He has symbolised  Brexit and led from the front and has given back to Britain self-respect and strength of character.",
