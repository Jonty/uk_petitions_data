Germany closed its borders and has been testing tens of thousands of people - and it\u2019s handling the crisis much more effectively than the UK. Evidently, these measures must be implemented to allow the lockdown to truly be effective and allow us to return to normal.",

The lockdown currently in place is sensible but it is not effective without these additional measures.
