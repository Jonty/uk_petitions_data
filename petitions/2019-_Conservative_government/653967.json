        "action": "Ban the use of fireworks",
        "additional_details": "Fireworks cause pollution in the air, water, and land. They can contain chemicals and heavy metals that can linger in the environment for days and contribute to water contamination and acid rain. Fireworks can be a trigger for people with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), especially those who have gone through a trauma that included explosions, gunfire, loud noises or fire. Fireworks produce physical litter that harms wildlife and ecosystems, creating tremendous noise pollution that upsets our pets and local wildlife. Many companion animals go missing after fireworks displays. The noise of fireworks can cause fear and anxiety, making animals panic and injure themselves. Some lose their lives. Ban fireworks.",
        "background": "We are concerned about the outdated, unnecessary, and dangerous use of fireworks and seek to have them banned. The smoke/dust produced can contain various heavy metals, sulfur-coal compounds, and other noxious chemicals. Animals are negatively impacted, with many going missing and some dying.",
