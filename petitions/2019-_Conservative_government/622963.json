        "action": "Amend the dangerous dogs act to protect domestic animals when a dog escapes",
        "additional_details": "Where I live there has recently been a dog escaping its owners garden and as of 30th August it has attacked or killed 3 domestic cats of local residents whilst loose. The owner is unwilling to secure their garden sufficiently to keep the dog contained and is unapologetic as to the actions of their dog when it escapes. A situation where the owner can take action to prevent their dog becoming out of control but doesn't is willful neglect by the dogs owner towards other animal owners.",
        "background": "The Dangerous Dogs act should be amended to add protections for other pets and their owners when a dog is dangerously out of control and the owner could have prevented it. If a dog has escaped its owner, and harms another domesticated animal, the dog's owner should be liable for that.",
