We should not have to get to that level before we do the same. The NHS will have been terribly burdened (40% hospitalisation), infection will have spread and people will have died for nothing. The schools will have to close anyway. Early intervention saves lives and costs less in the long run.",
        "background": "Immediately close all UK places of worship and schools to cut the number of potential transmission chains for Covid-19. \r\n\r\nEstablish special high infection monitoring schools for the children of healthcare and other essential workers who cannot get childcare cover.",
