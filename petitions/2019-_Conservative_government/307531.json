        "additional_details": "Self-employed workers are surely just as important to the UK economy and its future recovery as employees of businesses are. Access to Universal Credit for the self employed is welcome but the payments do not go far enough. Most self employed people are suddenly going from their normal income to zero income yet with all their costs still in place. A Taxi driver may have to pay the entire monthly amount from universal credit on their car finance before food & rent.",
        "background": "Provide income payments to self employed workers similar to how the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme ensures employees have a reasonable percentage of their take-home pay. The payments should be both timely and as simple as possible to access.",
