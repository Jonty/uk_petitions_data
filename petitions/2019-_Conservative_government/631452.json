This may be a Christian country hence the longer school holidays for Christmas and the bank holidays for working adults but the country is much more diverse now and should be able to accommodate for other major celebrations in the community such as Eid and Diwali and Hanukkah .",
        "background": "The government should allow for a minimum of two days of authorised absence from school for festivals such as Eid , Diwali , Hanukkah etc to show they truly support other cultures and religions and what they celebrate .",
