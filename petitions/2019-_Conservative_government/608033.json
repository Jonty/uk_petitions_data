        "action": "Suspend the renewable energy tariff currently included in energy bills",
        "additional_details": "To suspend the tariff would not be a sign of us giving up on the possibility of living in a cleaner world, it would be a bold gesture by the government to suspend the tariff on a temporary basis until such time the energy prices are back to  a reasonable level as the proposed increases are excessive and the energy companies it is felt are taking advantage of the situation.",
        "background": "A suspension in the renewable energy tariff would help to take a great burden off the working population. I am currently on state pension  and like many others in this country I have paid my dues without question and deserve to reap the benefit of our hard work over 51 years.",
