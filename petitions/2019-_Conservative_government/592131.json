Shopping malls, businesses & homes have been burned, it is chaos. The army has been called in but is struggling to regain any control. Ambulances have been stolen, food supplies, businesses, medical supplies and infrastructure in KZN has been destroyed. Let parents come to the UK to stay with children who are settled here.",
