        "additional_details": "The proposal to fund for greener transport puts essentially an unfair tax on people who choose to work or have a business in Leicester. Many people work in Leicester but travel from further afield and are paying money for a system they will not benefit. Salaries will not increase to reflect this. Essential services will lose money to the council eg schools and other education settings. Money that cannot be spared",
        "background": "To stop the plan by Leicester council to introduce a parking levy of \u00a3550 per parking place per year. Either employers will have to pay or pass this onto employees. This includes schools losing money that sit in the proposed boundary.",
