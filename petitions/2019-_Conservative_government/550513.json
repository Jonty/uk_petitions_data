        "additional_details": "With the parent and grandparent super visa, eligible parents and grandparents can visit family in Canada for up to two years without the need to renew their status .The Super Visa is a multi-entry visa that provides multiple entries for a period up to 10 years. The key difference is that the Super Visa allows an individual to stay for up to two years on initial entry into Canada, while a 10-year multiple entry visa would only have a status period for each entry of six months only. Refer visa rules by Canada government and criteria as reference ,sponsor does most work",
        "background": "Parents for British citizens are treated differently if they reside in countries outside the EU and are not EU citizens and the current rules allow for the settlement of parents under ADR very difficult, so we are looking for a middle ground as it is done in Canada with SUPER VISA.",
