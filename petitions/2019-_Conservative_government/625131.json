There are insufficient regulations to stop trolling online and the laws to prosecute those who do it are unclear. This behaviour can lead to serious mental health problems and self-harm. People are freely able to make numerous accounts constantly using different new email addresses etc and have free rein to abuse and bully others online. Verification could help prove who is behind the trolling.",

For example, submission of a photographic ID. This would help improve online safety.",
