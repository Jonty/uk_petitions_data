        "additional_details": "This poses a huge threat to the public's health. Many animals carry serious diseases that can lead to pandemics. The global wildlife trade is medieval and outright wrong. The fact that animals are being taken from the wild into the UK legally is disgusting, but the fact that so many people are unaware of it is worse. Many animals end up dead due to the bad conditions throughout the journey. By making the global wildlife trade illegal we could prevent future pandemics and keep animals safe.",
        "background": "The global wildlife trade is currently LEGAL in the UK, this means that when people buy pets (particularly exotic pets) they may have been taken from the wild to be someone's pet. These animals are usually kept in bad conditions throughout their journey from the wild to the UK.",

There are already a number of rules and regulations relating to the import and keeping of animals.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling on the Government to ban the import of all exotic animals, or animals that are intended to be sold as pets, if either of those are something you want to happen."
