The Chinese authorities stated clearly not to recognize these people as British subjects and deny them of British consulate protection all together. Such unilateral actions on the Chinese side not only antagonize British national dignity and interests but also broke the promises of the British system of ways of life (judiciary and respect of human rights in particular) remains the same for 50  years.  Britain need to be seen, by the whole world, of keeping her side of the bargain and promises.",
