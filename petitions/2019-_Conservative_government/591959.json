These include:\nEnsuring that women are better listened to in the NHS\nBetter access to services for all women and girls\nAddressing the lack of research into women\u2019s health conditions\nBetter information and education on issues relating to women\u2019s health\nTargeted action on specific areas such as fertility treatment, pregnancy loss, and female-specific health conditions such as endometriosis.\nActions the Government has said it will take to help achieve these goals include introducing mandatory teaching and assessment on women\u2019s health for all graduating medical students and incoming doctors, and undertaking new research and data gathering to increase understanding of women's health issues.\nYou can read the Strategy in full (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/womens-health-strategy-for-england) on the UK Government website. The Strategy only covers England as government policy on health matters is devolved in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nCommitments on maternity safety and pregnancy loss\nThe Strategy sets out ambitions to provide personalised and high-quality care to women during pregnancy. It commits to publishing a new NHS England delivery plan for maternity and neonatal services with clear priorities for improving the safety of pregnant women and their babies. \nIt also sets an ambition to improve the support available to women and their partners who experience pregnancy loss, including supporting them through future pregnancies, and confirms the Government will introduce a pregnancy loss certificate to enable parents in England who have experienced a pre-24 weeks pregnancy loss to record this.\nRead more about the Strategy's commitments on pregnancy and pregnancy loss (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/womens-health-strategy-for-england/womens-health-strategy-for-england#fertility-pregnancy-pregnancy-loss-and-postnatal-support)\nGet involved in the work of the UK Parliament\nSign up to the UK Parliament newsletter (https://parliament.us16.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=3ad7e4c57a864f07e4db008c4&id=26d0645ea9) for the latest information on how to get involved and make a difference.\n",
