It shouldn\u2019t matter about a parent\u2019s postcode when trying to access vital bereavement support after baby loss. Providing a service nationwide would allow all parents to feel more emotionally supported with the birth of their next infant. This could be delivered through more training for community midwives.",

Such support should include functional equipment to monitor the baby over the first 6 months, and should be available nationally, regardless of location.",
