The petition was presented to the House of Commons by Afzal Khan MP on behalf of councillors representing wards in the Manchester Gorton constituency.\nRead the petition and the Government's response (https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2023-06-05/debates/23060554000074/PavementParking)\nThe petition asks the House of Commons to urge the Government to respond to the consultation 'Pavement parking: options for change' (https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/managing-pavement-parking/pavement-parking-options-for-change) and begin the process of implementing a default ban on pavement parking across England. \nIn response to the petition's request, the Government states that it recognises the importance of this issue to all pedestrians, and says it received over 15,000 detailed responses to the consultation, and that every single response has been analysed and the Government has been giving careful consideration to the findings.\nThe Government also said that it is working through options and possible legislative opportunities for delivering them, and that, in the meantime, local authorities have the powers to restrict pavement parking wherever there is a need, by introducing traffic regulation orders.\nWhat are public (paper) petitions?\nA public (paper) petition is a petition to the House of Commons presented by an MP.\nFind out more about public (paper) petitions (https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/managing-pavement-parking/pavement-parking-options-for-change) \nGet involved in the work of the UK Parliament\nSign up to the Your UK Parliament newsletter for the latest information on how to get involved and make a difference (https://www.parliament.uk/get-involved/sign-a-petition/paper-petitions/) \n",
