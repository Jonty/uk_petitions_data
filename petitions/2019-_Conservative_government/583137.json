We have a Council bus that regularly is unable to access roads to drop off children returning from their schooling. Our local Council appear to not want to do anything as the answer is \"IT SLOWS VEHICLES DOWN\"! On numerous occasions, if a fire engine was required to an address it would not be able to access due to the quality of parking.",
