        "additional_details": "Currently, students are already struggling to cover the costs of rent and other costs of living. The rise in cost of living at the moment and the huge increase in house prices means that next year almost all students will not have enough money to pay for their rent, let alone other living costs like food. Most houses are going up by at least \u00a330 per week which means that even people on maximum maintenance loans will not be able to cover the cost of houses prices with their loans.",
        "background": "Government must raise the amount of money students are being given in their maintenance loans otherwise people won't be able to afford to even have a roof over their heads. \r\nWhat plan you're going to put in place for students must be discussed.",
