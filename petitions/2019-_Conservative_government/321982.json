        "additional_details": "For years, as online purchasing has increased, I and millions of others have been increasingly misled about the goods we buy online. They often disguise the country of manufacture and the true name of the company selling and it's only when it arrives we discover where it came from. More often than not, the goods do not match the adverts and recovering our money is near impossible. We all know to whom we are referring. If we knew the true origin of the goods we could make more informed decisions",
        "background": "When purchasing goods, the public should be aware of where the goods have come from. All adverts, including Amazon and E-bay should show country of manufacture. A simple flag will do so we know what we are ordering and where it comes from",
