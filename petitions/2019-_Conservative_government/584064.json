        "additional_details": "It\u2019s an NHS service we already pay for and  British taxpayers should be entitled to access it whatever the reason\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s discriminatory: No other activity deemed \u201crisky\u201d by the government requires people to pay for testing eg if contacted by Test and Trace after a pub or cinema visit\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s more efficient and safer: The NHS testing system is well established and efficient.  Even at very low levels of uptake the private providers have failed to deliver a service of a similar standard\r\n\r\nIt balances health and economic risk:  By making testing free for British taxpayers it gives the travel sector a real chance to build itself back up and secure the jobs of hundreds of thousands of people who depend on it",
        "background": "When travel reopens, the government will require all arrivals to the UK to pay for compulsory COVID testing.\r\n\r\nThis petition is calling for British taxpayers to be allowed to access free NHS testing services.",
