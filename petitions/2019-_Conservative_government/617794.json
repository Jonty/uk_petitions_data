        "additional_details": "There was never a mandate to withdraw access to Single Market. Participation in the European Economic Area, similar to Norway and Iceland, would remove many non tariff barriers (NTBs)  which currently restrict trade through Northern Ireland and out of major UK ports, like Calais.\r\n\r\nUK Government maintain control of borders- There is no obligation to join Schengen. ECJ has no direct jurisdiction and payments are made towards programmes in which UK chooses to participate.",
        "background": "Tobias Ellwood has laid out plans to join the Single Market. Faced with problems around the Northen Ireland protocol and a union on the verge of breaking apart, it is important that Government discusses practical ways to improve the current EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA).",
