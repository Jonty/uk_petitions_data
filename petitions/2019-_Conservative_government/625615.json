        "additional_details": "During the pandemic many dog breeders where allowed to make thousands from breeding.  Money comes first and there is no vetting on who is purchasing these dogs. We now have a situation where many dogs are left at charities because owners cannot deal with the responsibility.  This could be avoided if owners were vetted and assessed first.  This could also stop the disgusting nature of heavily breeding dogs for money.  \r\n\r\nWe also have a situation with more dog on dog attacks which is passed to local councils which struggle to enforce any consequences for dog attacks.",
        "background": "I would like to see the Government introduce dog licences in order to maintain the health and wellbeing of dogs.  I would also like to see some sort of assessment done on the owner to make sure they are able to look after the wellbeing of the dog.",
