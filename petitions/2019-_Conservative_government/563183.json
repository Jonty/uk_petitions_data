        "additional_details": "England NHS Staff have not received 1 penny of that money - not 1p! Recently Scotland's Government have agreed to pay a \u00a3500 bonus to each and every one of their NHS front line staff ! Good for them - its what they deserve. So what about England NHS staff - we all clapped for them - but in reality whilst others got 80% on furlow to stay at home - the NHS front line staff put their heads high above the parapet and took the ultimate risk. Some of these front line workers are are on \u00a310/hour.",
        "background": "UK Goverment has spent 300 Thousand Million pounds supporting the UK economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. That is fantastic and very much needed. But then think though this - front line NHS staff in England have risked their lives every single day caring and protecting others, for no extra money.",
