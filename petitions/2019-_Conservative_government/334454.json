        "additional_details": "I would like this law to be changed so that any person involved in a serious or fatal accident has to stop and stay at scene and report straight away to help the injured on the road. At present the British law acts as an incentive for law braking drivers to flee the scene of the kill someone. If they do stay at the scene there is sometimes a risk of a higher sentence due circumstances like drink driving, stolen Car or another person admitting to the crime they didn\u2019t do.",
        "background": "At the moment the law allows that if someone who is involved is a serious or fatal car crash to leave the scene. They are required to stop , remain at the scene and give details but if they don\u2019t they are required to report the crash to the police as soon as reasonably practicable within 24 hours",
