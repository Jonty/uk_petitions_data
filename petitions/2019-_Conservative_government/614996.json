        "action": "Do not implement off-shore processing of refugees or asylum seekers.",
        "additional_details": "When off-shore processing programmes have been implemented across the globe we have seen several compelling reasons to oppose it's practice. It can be argued that it is morally wrong. Refugees need assistance not suspicion. We have a responsibility to help them wherever possible. Also, it places a larger financial strain on the Treasury and the tax payers of the United Kingdom. Lastly, it will most likely cause a rise in trafficking and illegal entry, the opposite of the Government's aims.",
        "background": "We believe that the Government and Parliament must realise that any kind of off-shore processing proposed by the Prime Minister is utterly unacceptable. We further believe, off-shore processing is abhorrent and in violation of international law, and various pieces of human rights legislation.",
