        "additional_details": "People still need to live, pay bills, support children if they have them, pay rent or mortgages, while trying to stay mentally stable during this time. A lot of people's stress and worries are about how much money they are losing if told to self isolate or are furloughed, losing a lot of their wage. Reducing the amount of income tax they pay will help those people that little bit more each month in the short term.",
