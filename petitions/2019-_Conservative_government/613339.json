        "action": "Ban camping site exemptions, give local authorities control & residents a voice.",
        "additional_details": "The Camping & Caravanning Club totally disregard local fears about new sites, making them unaccountable. On one site they expanded from 5 to 80 units, with one entrance & single-track access, no planning control despite objection from MPs & local authorities. Rural communities are habitually ignored & bullied. We have no hope of tackling our very real concerns for public health & safety & ask for government help to amend current outdated legislation & back councils to use an Article 4 direction.",
        "background": "Camping Associations abuse the benefit they have from planning exemptions. We want checks in place to protect our rural amenities, especially when the area & its infrastructure is obviously unsuitable. \r\nAmending the Caravan Sites & Control of Development Act 1960 will support achieving this goal.",
