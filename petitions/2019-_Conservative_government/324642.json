        "additional_details": "Notable Black figures have been confined to a narrow slice - October. This is highly unjust as they've played as vital a role in shaping the world we live in as their white counterparts. They deserve to be as venerated as their white peers.\r\n\r\nThe UK is made up of a diverse group of people many will go through school without seeing themselves represented at all. We want to change this. We believe that seeing themselves positively reflected will inspire a sense of worth & value in our children.",
        "background": "We would like Black history to be integrated into the curriculum & not just reserved for October. Schools nationwide should be teaching history inclusive of notable BAME figures.\r\n\r\nWe're taught a whitewashed history. It's only as adults & after digging that we start to learn otherwise.",
