        "additional_details": "Profiteering is morally reprehensible and is also directly and significantly increasing the risk to public health by limiting access to the most effective means of controlling this virus. By reducing the availability of hand sanitisers profiteers are directly increasing the danger to people in high-risk groups.\r\n\r\nIn normal circumstances the laws of supply and demand would be effective in controlling prices, but during this exceptional crisis direct intervention is required.",
        "background": "During the current pandemic many businesses are using auction sites to hugely inflate prices on basic items in short supply, particularly hand sanitisers.\r\n\r\nWe demand that the government immediately address this by whatever means is considered most effective and enforceable.",
