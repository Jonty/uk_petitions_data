        "additional_details": "In the UK 80% of us choose cremation, with around 470,000 per year. For every one around 245 kg of carbon and many pollutants are released. Cremation is an important option, but Human Composting provides an environmentally friendly alternative. Fuel is saved and the carbon and nutrients of the body are kept.\r\nUK residents deserve the full spectrum of deathcare options, allowing everybody the chance to have their final wishes met. \r\nTerramation should be legalised. Now!",
        "background": "Terramation, currently legal in Sweden & 7 US states, is the swift and eco friendly transformation of the human body into soil. \r\nMany feel a symbolic and spiritual significance of returning to the soil; they can scatter, plant trees with, or donate remains to ecological projects.",
