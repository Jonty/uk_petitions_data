It needs to be easier to park as there not enough pay-for-parking bays. if every bay was still able to be parked in by permit owners and pay and displays it would be fairer for those who 'need' to park like tradesmen and carers. Also the congestion is extortionate and unfair to cost more than the minimum wage. Disabled badge rules should also be the same within every borough to create a fair and easy to use system.",
