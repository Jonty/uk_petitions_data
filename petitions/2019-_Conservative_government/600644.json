Approximately 5-10% of all of the UKs dioxin emissions are on this night alone. As gunpowder is the main component, sulphur and metal oxides are emitted as well. \r\n\r\nIf the uk is serious about becoming net zero then fireworks must go to meet these targets as well as to remove the litter they cause as well as disruptions and upset to wildlife.",
