        "additional_details": "Wonder why small independent shops are angry it is because we have just three weekends to trade in our busiest two months of the year. Meanwhile supermarkets, garden centres, big DIY stores and the likes of Amazon can sell what they like.\r\n\r\nThousands of high street shops will not survive the loss of Christmas trade. Tesco and Amazon are able to sell toys, a 50+ year old toy shop can't.\r\nGood rules can't be prejudicial. \r\n\r\nYou can not permit unfair competition because a company sells food.",
        "background": "We want the government to permit all retail to open. It would be acceptable to limit numbers in all stores based on size.\r\nWe are seeing out of town and large stores becoming a magnet whilst Town Centres are dying.  This is causing a greater risk of spreading the virus than keeping people local.",
