        "additional_details": "The review should look at rethinking \"misbehaviour\" definitions to help prevent harsh punishments for minor infractions, fostering a healthier environment that is focused on learning and not rules. A review could provide an opportunity to look at how to create a fairer disciplinary system, benefiting students' well-being. A post-pandemic education system requires empathy. Advocating for this review is vital for a just and nurturing educational system. The review should also look at the benefits of adopting the approach by Wales of giving 24 hours\u2019 notice for after-school detentions to help promote transparency and minimise safety risks.",
