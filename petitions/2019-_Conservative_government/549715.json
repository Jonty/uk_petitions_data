        "additional_details": "I work in a coffee shop inside an office building in the City. Even if we really want to reopen and start to work there are not customers at all. Some companies are planning to stay working from home until January 2021. There is nothing we can do about this situation. I want to work, but we need customers (office workers), otherwise my bosses can not open and I am afraid that this problem will kill thousands of jobs in London, especially in areas like the City.",
        "background": "Small hospitality businesses inside office buildings are in a very bad and risky situation. Either the Government encourage the companies to go back and work from the office (under new health and safety guidelines of course) or the furlough scheme should be extended for these kind of businesses.",
