I am sad to see smaller surgeries closing, which might force patients into large collective practices where they may not benefit from such a personal relationship with or have the same level of access to their General Practitioner, rather than other healthcare professionals. We accept that some areas will choose and benefit from a collective model, but we believe it should be allowed to co-exist with the traditional general practice model. I don't think the public has been consulted adequately.",
