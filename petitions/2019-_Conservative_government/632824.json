        "additional_details": "Despite being one of the NHS\u2019s biggest success stories, breast screening is at breaking point. Without investment, it may no longer be the powerful, cost-effective tool for early diagnosis it\u2019s been for the past 35 years.\r\n\r\nWe need breast screening that is accessible to all eligible women and has enough staff and resources to offer the care women deserve, now and in decades to come.\r\n\r\nMore Government funding is needed to remove barriers to screening, support units, and modernise the programme.\r\n",
        "background": "Screening saves lives from breast cancer. But since the pandemic started, it is estimated over 1 million women have missed out on screening in England, and thousands may be living with undiagnosed breast cancer as a result. The Government must urgently invest in breast screening to prevent deaths.",
