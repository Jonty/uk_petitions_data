        "additional_details": "The Medical training is a unified noble profession worldwide.This training is done in advanced English especially those British colonised countries upto degree level. Many doctors are being wasted in the UK as they are forced to take another rigorous unnecessary English exam called IELTS. Allow doctors to go through the normal medical qualification exams and not first through IELTS.\r\nRedundant Doctors are out there to join the Covid-19 frontline and to ease the mounting pressure on the NHS.",
        "background": "Many foreign trained doctors have been stopped by IELTS(English language exam) from joining the UK workforce.\r\nThe NHS is lacking trained doctors especially during the fight against Covid-19. \r\nMost foreign trained doctors are either bus drivers, food vendors, care assistants or have changed career.",
