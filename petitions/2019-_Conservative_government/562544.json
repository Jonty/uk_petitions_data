Teachers are working in a context where they can be exposed to minimum of 30 but sometimes 250 upwards households a day. In primary social distancing is difficult and secondary schools COVID infections are increasing (see ONS.gov stats 15-20Nov) . Teachers risk COVID exposure daily but should not be asked to put their families at risk over Christmas or pay upwards of \u00a3100 for a private test.",

Give each teacher a NHS PCR covid test at the end of Autumn term to minimise the risks to their family during the Christmas period by identifying those who may be asymptomatically carrying Covid",
