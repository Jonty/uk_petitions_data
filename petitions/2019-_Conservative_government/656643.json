        "additional_details": "My daughter was stabbed repeatedly in an assault that punctured her lung and left her scarred for life - physically and emotionally. Doctors told her she was lucky to be alive. Yet her attacker - although convicted of grievous bodily harm - walked free from court on a suspended sentence. Because the sentence was for only two years, it could be suspended. I don't want other families to go through the trauma we have, seeing a child's convicted attacker receive only a suspended sentence.",
        "background": "Amend the Sentencing Bill 2023 to include a clause abolishing suspended sentences for any violent crime with a weapon. Under current laws, an attacker can cause a life-threatening injury causing a permanent irreversible injury or condition and not serve time. We believe this is wrong.",
