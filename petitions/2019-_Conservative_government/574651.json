        "additional_details": "Those who have passed their theory deserve the right to have a driving test. At current, they are unable to  do so as the driving tests have been cancelled with no clear answer on when they will start back up again. This will affect many people who have worked hard to pass their theory and spent lots of money on theory and driving lessons, and be able to sit a driving test.",
        "background": "Extend the expiry dates of those who hold a current valid theory during the pandemic.  This would allow time for those who have rightfully passed this theory to attempt their practical test once the pandemic has eased  and society is back to running smoothly.",
