        "additional_details": "Some content for Y11 students has been cut, but no provisions have been made for Y13s.\r\nAlthough every student has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the current Year 13s have clearly been hit the hardest with many students unable to continue their education due to personal commitments (i.e. being a young carer) and a lack of reassurance given over the future of their educational careers.\r\nThis is a sensible proposal which will ensure exams take place and that Year 13s are respected.",
        "background": "As public opinion has shown, cancelling exams isn\u2019t the answer - but pushing them back by 3 weeks and assessing Year 13s on the full curricula isn\u2019t either. We call on the government to consider this feasible & rational option that will ensure exams take place & that students are treated fairly.",
