        "additional_details": "I believe that after leaving the military you are offered very little support, and it is very difficult to get a job. \r\n\r\nIn some cases, ex-military have pre-existing vulnerabilities post-discharge, homelessness occurs after Service, and they often suffer with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). \r\n\r\nProviding free public transport to Veterans will allow them commutable access to various towns/cities to interviews, and will also allow them to get their lives back on track, once released into the new big world.",
