        "additional_details": "4.3 million children (31%) are living in poverty in the UK. The 2010 Child Poverty Act was established, setting targets to reduce child poverty. The Government\u2019s Social Mobility Commission has predicted that child poverty rates will rise to 5.2 million by 2022. The 2016 Welfare Reform and Work Act abolished most of the 2010 Child Poverty Act. Since then, there has not been a specific Child Poverty Policy. We want a specific Child Poverty Policy to end child poverty in the UK.",
        "background": "We want the Government to create & implement a specific Child Poverty Policy that has clear aims to eradicate child poverty. It should contain targets and strategies along the lines of previous strategies, but aimed at eradicating - rather than limiting - child poverty.",
