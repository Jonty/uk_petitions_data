        "additional_details": "Section 4 of the Foreign Enlistment Act 1870 prohibits British subjects from enlisting in a foreign state's military while the UK is at peace with that state. However, this does not apply to enlistment in forces involved in civil wars, counter-terrorism, or internal uprisings. Since the Occupied Palestinian Territories aren't recognized as a state by the UK and Israel hasn't declared war, the 1870 Act wouldn't apply in this situation.",
        "background": "We call on the UK government to ensure that UK citizens implicated in violations of laws of armed conflict abroad are prosecuted. It's crucial that British nationals committing crimes overseas face trial in UK courts following a comprehensive investigation process.",
