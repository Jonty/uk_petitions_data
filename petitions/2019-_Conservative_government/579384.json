        "action": "Two penalty points to be issued to drivers of vehicles when littering from it.",
        "additional_details": "The reason for this is to stop litter effecting the enjoyment of the countryside. To stop endangering life from the workers who have to pick this litter up from busy roads, to ensure that drivers take ownership of their actions and that of the actions of others who are in their car. Litter can also effect ecosystems and endanger the life of animals. Having penalty points for littering from cars will help reduce the amount of litter and make people take responsibility.",
        "background": "I would like the police to be able to issue anyone who is under control of a vehicle 2 penalty points on their licence if litter is thrown from the vehicle they are driving. This should go along side the fine which is already in place and already enforceable.",
