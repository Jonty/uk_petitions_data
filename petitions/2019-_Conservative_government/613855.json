        "additional_details": "Total UK domestic electricity consumption = 103.8 TWh. Installing solar panels on every house in the UK would provide 60.52% of our total domestic electricity consumption. Between April and September, solar generation would exceed all domestic electricity consumption. Dangers regarding nuclear power plants are well documented, as well as upfront cost & security risks. Fracking causes air water & sound pollution, for these reasons we believe solar power to be better and worth the extra funding. ",
        "background": "We ask the government to provide grants to all households that wish to install solar panels and battery storage. For those on the lowest incomes we ask that the grant cover the full costs of installation so the household does not carry any financial burden.",
