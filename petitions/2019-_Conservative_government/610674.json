        "additional_details": "The proposed changes include increasing the loan repayment period from 30 years to 40, lowering the income threshold for loan repayments from \u00a327,000 to \u00a325,000, and potentially imposing eligibility requirements to access student loans based on GCSE Maths and English results. If brought into force these proposals will massively negatively impact already disadvantaged students.",
        "background": "We ask the Government not to go ahead with their current plans for changes to student loan terms and eligibility for students who will enter university in 2023. We believe these changes would be harmful and discriminative.",
