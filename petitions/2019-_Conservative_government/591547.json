It is not as though this figure is likely to be more than a \"one off\" increase.  This would be a matter of \"changing the goal posts\" because of a one time larger cost.  The pensioners in the UK already receive a pittance compared with other countries in Europe and also have to pay into the system for more years in order to qualify.  Scrap this very bad idea - it is a non-starter and a vote loser.",
