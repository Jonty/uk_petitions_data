        "additional_details": "In the first lockdown small business needed the help of the Gov to survive and the Gov listened and gave BB loans to SME\u2019s to see them through the lockdown. We are now on our 3rd and longer lockdown. SME\u2019s need further help to survive as most will have used the BB loans in the first lockdown if not by the second. Most would not be able to afford another loan even if it were offered. SME\u2019s make up a substantial part of the UK economy so we must protect them. I call for BB loans to be written off",
        "background": "I call on the government to write of bounce back loans for SME\u2019s as part of another rescue package. Do not plunge small business into further debt, help them by reducing debt so they can survive this pandemic and keep the economy alive.",
