That\u2019s not to mention the requirement of a category C1 license in order to drive an emergency ambulance. All of these \u2018essential\u2019 places which have managed to remain open (with similar safety challenges) will eventually need more drivers including hospitals, if only to cover sick.",

This includes the C1 category test required to drive most ambulances. I feel like they could be done in a controlled manner",
