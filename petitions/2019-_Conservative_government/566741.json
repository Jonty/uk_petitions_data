        "additional_details": "2020 was a tough year for young people, many of whom feel isolated from their friends, family etc, which has had a detrimental affect on the mental health of many people. young people should not be banned from seeing those who are important to them and should be allowed to see at least one or two people in an outdoor public space, to allow them to feel loved and with someone they trust.",
        "background": "The Government should allow younger people to see friends in small groups in outdoor public spaces, so that younger people are able to see people from other households in person, which could help support their mental well-being or other issues.",
