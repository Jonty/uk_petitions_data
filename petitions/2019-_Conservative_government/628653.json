We believe the current scheme should be extended to cover all girls and women in educational settings, including staff, apprentices and higher educational institutions.\r\n\r\nResearch shows that 40% of girls have used toilet roll because they couldn\u2019t afford period products. Similarly, 49% of girls have missed school because of their period.\r\n \r\nThis is the future generation that is being affected!\r\n \r\n",
