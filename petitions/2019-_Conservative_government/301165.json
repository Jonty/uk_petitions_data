        "action": "To legislate to enable routine video recording and broadcasting in civil courts",
        "additional_details": "This petition follows on from the welcome revelation that broadcasting will be permitted in the Crown Court. The video recording and broadcasting of civil proceedings would greatly enhance transparency and the principle of open justice. Most civil cases are already recorded by audio, thus it is difficult to envisage why video recording would not be possible. Recordings could also assist practitioners seeking to appeal a case, aid in professional development and could inspire aspiring lawyers.",
        "background": "This petition calls for legislation to enable routine video recording and broadcasting in the civil courts of England and Wales. Whilst sought for all proceedings, it is considered that all cases in courts of record and all appeals (including the County Court) should be the minimum starting point.",
