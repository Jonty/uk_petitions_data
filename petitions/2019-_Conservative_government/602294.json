        "additional_details": "The Greek Government has recently implemented compulsory fines for those who chose not to take the vaccine. This is both troubling, and outright unconstitutional, not to mention its almost certainly in violation of international human rights.\r\n\r\nNobody should suffer negative implications, such as fines, arrest or boycott, due to their freedom of choice. It is wrong.\r\n\r\nHenceforth, we ask that you do not introduce a fine penalty for those who chose not to take the Covid 19 Vaccine.",
        "background": "With the coronavirus pandemic continuing, many members of the public still choose to be unvaccinated against \u2018Covid 19\u2019.\r\n\r\nNobody should incur negative implications as a result of their free choice, which is why unvaccinated members of the public should NOT be fined or restricted financially.",
