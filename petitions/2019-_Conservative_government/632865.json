        "action": "Ensure student nurses are paid for placement hours",
        "additional_details": "Currently, Student Nurses are expected to complete 2300 hours of clinical placement throughout the three years of their program. This is part of the Standards for pre-registration Nursing programme from the Nursing and midwifery code of conduct.\r\n\r\nStudent Nurses should be paid for their placements. Although they receive a non-repayable NHS grant and Student finance this doesn\u2019t always cover full costs. This is putting a strain on student nurses who have to juggle part-time jobs and studying.",
        "background": "The Government should require student Nurses to be paid at least minimum apprentice rate for hours they partake during their studies. This would provide them with less worries of working part-time alongside placement shifts therefore, they would have more focus on their studies.",
