        "additional_details": "Currently, having a record of a custodial sentence on a DBS, no matter how historic or role relevant, can make it difficult for ex-offenders from finding employment in many sectors, regardless of personal progress and positive rehabilitation. This dramatically limits a persons prospect's for employment and career development, reducing their ability to earn and develop knowledge and skills..",
        "background": "Currently records of all custodial sentences are released through standard and enhanced DBS checks, until a person reaches the age of 100. We want these arrangements to be reviewed, with a view to limiting disclosures to what is necessary to safeguard others, based on the severity of crime.",
