        "additional_details": "A student nurse at the university of York and has fallen victim to the injustice caused by SFE\u2019s current evaluation process. The organisation has shown ignorance to the complications of their household, and as a result they are only receiving the minimum student finance \u2013 far less than the amount they are entitled to. This lack of understanding has caused unnecessary financial stress and it is unlikely that she will be able to complete her degree under the current circumstances.\r\n\u00a0",
        "background": "The way SFE is assessing how much finance students are entitled to is making it harder for those from less privileged backgrounds to undertake and complete a university degree. SFE needs to understand that a student\u2019s financial situation cannot be directly assessed using only their household income.",
