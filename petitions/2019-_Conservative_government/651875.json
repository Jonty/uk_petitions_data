Many elderly or disadvantaged people do not use or have the ability to use online banking or apps and printers. To be in a situation where some banks are now taking choice away and charging customers \u00a35 for a paper statement is unacceptable. We believe that for banks making huge profits due to interest hikes set by the Bank of England to then withdraw services so vital to thousands of people is not acceptable.",
