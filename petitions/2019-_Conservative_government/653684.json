        "additional_details": "Skilled Workers holding a visa up for extension may have already spent years living and working in the UK. Many would have built a career and become an important member of their company. To lose the ability to sponsor them because their sponsor is unable make a large salary increase at the time of visa extension would mean the loss of vital knowledge and skillsets built over many years. We believe this would be unjust for those who uprooted their lives to contribute to the UK economy.",
        "background": "Skilled Worker Visa holders already working in the UK should be exempt from meeting the salary income threshold increase when they apply to extend their visa. Current income thresholds should apply, so visa holders can extend their visa if they continue to work for the same sponsor in the same job.",
