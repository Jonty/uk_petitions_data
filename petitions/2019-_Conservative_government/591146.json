        "additional_details": "The government has changed the rules on all pension increases over the years to stop it keeping up with real increases. David Cameron decided on a way to keep the state pension being eroded and maybe to get votes , but it was a fair way of doing it. Because this year wages have increased a reasonable amount that means the state pension will increase by the same amount as well.The government does not like it, saying it\u2019s to much and costly.The state pension is something that the working population has paid into and will continue to do so , past and present , remember that the state gets some of it back in taxes , so the cost is not as great as said , something else that does not seem to be calculated into the cost .",
        "background": "To allow pensioners to have a decent state pension and stop interfering in what private pension schemes can give , you can\u2019t have it both ways .",
