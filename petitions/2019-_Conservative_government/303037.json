        "additional_details": "Reducing social contact will reduce the rate of spread of the virus, so \"flattening the curve\", reducing the load on the NHS and more - ultimately reducing the number of deaths and related suffering.\r\n\r\nBut the *forced* closing of schools would put strain on families, impacting incomes, employers and beyond.\r\n\r\nSo, allow parents to decide and educate at home - some are in a position to do this without significant negative impact. Even if numbers are small, this will slow the spread of the virus.",
        "background": "As an urgent interim measure, allow parents to choose whether to keep their kids at home. Some families can handle this. Actively promote action.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, facilitate education at home during this period, through, for example, more educational TV programs and websites.",
