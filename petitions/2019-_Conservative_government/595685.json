        "additional_details": "People of colour are x12 more likely to be arrested for cannabis offenses compared to others. Decriminalisation would remove racial bias. Underfunded police can reallocate time to more important issues. Legalisation is already favoured in public opinion. YouGov 2021. Covid caused financial damage, cannabis offers large tax revenue, like alcohol and cigarettes suggesting we could raise \u00a31bn annually. Jobs would be created, demand for benefits would fall & payroll taxes would increase.",

The war on drugs is ineffective, expensive & racially biased. Legalisation offers the opportunity for large tax revenue, ensure safe consumption, & creates jobs",
