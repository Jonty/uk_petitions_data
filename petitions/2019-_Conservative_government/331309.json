        "additional_details": "I want the government to do this because homophobia is still a problem in the UK and the history of lgbtq+ isn\u2019t being taught in schools. If it was then the youth of today would be educated and they can help educate others. There are lots of people in the UK that aren\u2019t aware why pride is such a big celebration or the history of homophobia.",
