        "additional_details": "Whether buying tea in a cafe or clothes in a shop, everyone needs the toilet at inconvenient times and access to facilities should be simple and easy. However, wide-scale public toilet closure by commercial businesses has caused inadequate provision with COVID-19. This public health issue concerns and affects everyone as we all use toilets. However, it causes greater distress, discomfort and humiliation to those suffering incontinence like children, pregnant women, the elderly, and the disabled.",
        "background": "Accessing the toilet should not be a luxury, it should be a public right. We urge the government to introduce legislation requiring all commercial businesses to re-open their closed public toilets - allowing people the invaluable right to public access, particularly for those suffering incontinence",
