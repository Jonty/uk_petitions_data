        "additional_details": "In the current Pandemic, many people have lost their livelihoods, businesses have shut down or reduced considerably. This makes almost impossible for Int'l students to earn their livelihood in UK and the burden is passed on their families to pay their fees. The family's are already relying under intense financial pressure and this would result in many students deferring their courses or leaving them altogether and start a course in their home country which is at considerably less tuition fee.",
        "background": "The Govt. should ask Universities to charge less than usual int'l fees and peg it around \u00a39000 considering that face to face learning is not likely to begin until Sept 2021. In order to not burden the Int'l students unduly and help UK retain the best talent, the Govt must take necessary steps.",
