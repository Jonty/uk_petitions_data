        "additional_details": "By becoming privatised this risks commercial decisions determining what is commissioned. \r\n\r\nChannel 4 currently has the freedom to produce shows that are culturally balanced, hard hitting and informative - programmes that may not be commercially successful with the advertisers but important to produce nonetheless.\r\n\r\nPrivatising the channel risks subjecting it to the whims of advertisers - producing shows based on if they can make a profit rather than doing it for an informative purpose.",
        "background": "The Government have announced they intend to push ahead with the privatisation of Channel 4, and this will be included in May\u2019s Queen\u2019s Speech.\r\n\r\nThis plan must be abandoned and Channel 4 kept in public hands.",
