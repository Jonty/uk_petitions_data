We respect the UK government and its policies. If they want to keep Pakistan on the red list, then so be it. However due to huge diaspora of Pakistan in the UK it is humbly and respectfully submitted that the hotel quarantine rule is replaced with house quarantine on the next review if it is decided to keep Pakistan on the red list.",

Nevertheless they can abolish the hotel quarantine for the fully vaccinated UK residents and Nationals and change it to house quarantine Instead.",
