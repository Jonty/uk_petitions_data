The delay of exams may jeopardise and hinder the students\u2019 performance in the next stages of their education, which could affect their futures in the long-term. \r\nI am positive there is a better way to safely stop the spread of COVID-19, whilst helping our students through this harrowing time. \r\nThank you.",
