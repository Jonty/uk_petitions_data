        "additional_details": "We have recently lost our mother, and have to arrange a funeral, but the quote we have received from a funeral director for a basic service is thousands of pounds more expensive than what we will receive through the funeral payment. It is not fair that we will have to make up the additional cost of her funeral, and we want these payments to be increased to cover the full cost of a funeral.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, many children rely on their parents for financial support, and making children eligible to bereavement support payments would help them avoid financial hardship when a parent passes away.",
        "background": "People in receipt of certain benefits can get help with the cost of a funeral for a close relative. However, this does not usually cover all of the costs of the funeral. Additionally, bereavement support payments are only available to partners, and not the children of the deceased.",
