        "additional_details": "The Government needs to re-open gyms due to high demands from the gym users to get in and keep active. It is highly unfair that the pubs and restaurants have been told to open safely, but why can not gyms open with safety measures? This needs to be revised and help all the UK gyms and leisure clubs to re-open.  We are not asking for favouritism we just want Equality. The gyms are modernised to have all the safety measures in place, so please revise this and open all the leisure clubs and gyms.",
        "background": "We would like you to re-open all the gyms in the UK with the appropriate safety measures in place. Gyms should be a priority to re open due to your health and well being. People are encouraged to be fit, healthy and active but have no where to do such excercise? gyms could go into administration.",
