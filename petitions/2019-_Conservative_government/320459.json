        "additional_details": "Our children need support with transition, its unfair to expect a child to go straight into full time education when they've missed vital foundation stages. \r\n\r\nIts unfair to expect our year 6s to go straight to secondary without some opportunity to decompress & discuss their worries and settle their mental health issues. \r\n\r\nBUT is june the appropriate time to start this? The Government should cut short summer holidays and have this transition in August when risk should be lower.",
        "background": "I understand that schools and childcare are essential for those key workers fighting COVID but the rate of infection is still high, the death rate is still high, if we send more children back to school now it could undo all that we worked for by risking a second peak and puts the families at risk.",
