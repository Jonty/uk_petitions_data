        "additional_details": "Not every employee in the education system will think the same, we are individuals, not every department will interpret legislation the same. Which is why other public service providers in the UK have internal complaints procedures which can be escalated to an independent ombudsman before reaching court. This would look to resolve any education issues. Why wouldn't we already have this in education when we have it in health & banking? I think we can all agree children's education is equally important.",
        "background": "Children's education is time boxed. Too often an issue arises where parents, schools, LEAs can not agree or fail to comply with legislation on an individual basis. The only recall is via the courts. With many improvements to education families need an efficient escalation process to resolve issues.",
