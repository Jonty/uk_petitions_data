        "additional_details": "It is a disgrace that a Government Bailout should even be considered to corporations that have more wealth than most countries in the world. Finances should be going towards, Delivering food to the elderly if they cannot get to the shops, help people pay their rent or mortgages, sick pay for self employed so they can afford to eat, shuttle services for people self isolated to get food deliveries once the supermarket deliveries are all booked out, medicines and stock for hospitals and staffing.",

A city wide infrastructure to handle the effects of the pandemic, stave off further development and support communities and public services on the ground to get through this difficult time.",
