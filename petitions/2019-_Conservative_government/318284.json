        "background": "The Government needs to create a department to monitor and prosecute reckless reporting that has and still continues to cause fear, hatred and division between the British people.  \r\n\r\nAll \u2018News\u2019 reports by mainstream media outlets via any platform must be proven as 100% correct before being aired.",
