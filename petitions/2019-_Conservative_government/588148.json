        "additional_details": "Motorcycle and moped tests can be hard to pass, and stressful, especially if it is the participant's first time. However the exercises are necessary to be a safe rider. Therefore, we believe it would be better and safer for participants to have a training day, practicing the exercises multiple time with the goal to be able to do them perfectly by the end of the day, like a CBT.",
        "background": "The Module 1 motorcycle and moped test requires participants to complete a series of exercises with no more than 5 minor faults. It would be more beneficial for the participant to have a day where they can learn how to complete the exercises properly. This would also make the process less stressful.",
