        "action": "Retain the UK's use of the metric system for measurements",
        "additional_details": "The Imperial system is an outdated, nonsensical system when compared to the metric system. Metric units are more organised and easier to understand, convert, and use. Returning to the Imperial system is foolish, when most people under 40 cannot understand these units. Most of the world uses the metric system, so why would we purposely distance ourselves from such a standardised system? Why make our lives harder for no reason apart from sheer and useless jingoism?",
        "background": "In post-Brexit Britain, it has been announced that the Imperial system of measurements will return in various instances, such as shops. I want to urge the government to reconsider this, and instead implement a more committed transition to the metric system, in line with most other nations.",
