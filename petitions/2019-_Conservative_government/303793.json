        "additional_details": "As Boris Johnson said, many will lose loved ones. The virus is meant to peak in early May which is exam season which means many students and their loved ones will continue to suffer during the season so the fairest thing to do is to give students their predicted grades as many will not be able to do exams and many will suffer trauma. This will effect their exam grade so they will be more deserving of a grade their teacher or professor believes they should receive.",
        "background": "Ensure that Uk students don\u2019t have to do their exams in the time of this pandemic and that they get their predicted grades.",
