        "action": "Enforce legal requirements for welfare standards in all UK animal sanctuaries.",
        "additional_details": "With yet another case of animal sanctuary cruelty in the news; horses in terrible states of neglect, starvation and death unseen for months. With regulation and checks this would never have got to this stage, the owner could have been stopped, helped and many animals would not have suffered. There are many cases of animal hording under the guise of rescue and also people using rescue to get the public to give them money; that money often not going to the animals. Regulation would prevent this.",
        "background": "To bring about a UK standard set of minimum requirements that all animal sanctuaries and rescues must adhere to. Regular checks by vets and welfare officers with the power to close and rehome animals if those standards are not met. Perhaps a certificate or award yearly if these are met.",
