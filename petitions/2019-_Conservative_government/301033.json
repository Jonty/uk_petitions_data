        "additional_details": "The Government should explore options for making NurOwn available to treat MND. Either early availability / approval of is sought or access to treatment that, at the latest, coincides with FDA approval. An Accelerated Access Review (AAR), Accelerated Assessment (MHRA), Accelerated Access Collaborative (NICE), a clinical trial and collaboration between the NHS and drug company are different means of expediting availability and access to NurOwn for the treatment of MND in the UK.\r\n \r\nInclisiran is a drug that in January 2020 had not yet been approved in the UK or EU. In January the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care approved one of the world's largest drug trials in a collaboration between Novartis and the NHS, with the latter funding and overseeing treatment.",
        "background": "No effective treatment exists for 5,000 sufferers of MND in the UK. NurOwn is in the final months of Phase 3 of a US FDA regulated clinical trial. Phase 2 data indicated NurOwn was safe and demonstrated signs of efficacy at low doses.",
