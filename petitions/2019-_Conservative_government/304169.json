        "additional_details": "Without doing this no business can claim on it\u2019s insurance and therefore will die forcing thousands of people out of work, being unable to pay their rents and mortgages. It is not fair to protect the multi million pound insurance industry and let already struggling retailers, restaurants, bars and theatres die. You need to do the right thing!!",
        "background": "We need you to force us to close: by just telling people not to attend you are screwing over hundreds of thousands of jobs and businesses who can\u2019t claim on their insurance. It is not right!!",
