        "additional_details": "We would like the Government or Parliament to enforce this action due to the growing fear among hotel workers, cleaners, Guests etc. The ability to focus or concentrate is affected in addition to the growing fears of the Corona-virus. In our view, the government and health officials around the world are more 'reactive' rather than 'proactive'. This will result in more spread as time is given for the virus to do so. We hope to come to an agreement as soon as possible in a timely manner.",
