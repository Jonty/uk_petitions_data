        "action": "Cancel student nurses' student debt, and never remove the bursary again.",
        "additional_details": "Third Year Student Nurses are going into practice early, risking their lives to support the NHS response to the Covid 19 epidemic.  They are the first cohort that had no access to a bursary to support them while training. When the bursary was removed, the Government was warned repeatedly that student numbers would plummet, and they have. The bursary is now being reinstated, but the third year cohort are qualifying as nurses at this terrible time, saddled with debt.  They deserve so much better.",
        "background": "We ask the Government\r\n- to cancel all student nurses' student debt.\r\n- to ensure all student nurses receive the bursary when it is reinstated this September.\r\n- to promise to never cancel the bursary for student nurses again.\r\n- to apologise for taking nursing students for granted.",
