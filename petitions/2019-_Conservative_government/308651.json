        "additional_details": "It is unfair that only A-Level students get their examinations cancelled yet BTEC students do not get their coursework cancelled as well. Some of the unit requires teamwork in Science or Business for example, in experiments and group presentations. BTEC students who are taking their course in a year are most affected by this and the work towards their qualification is heavily disrupted.",
        "background": "Exempt students from coursework if they are taking the course in a year as over half of the units requires group work and exams, a good example of this is in the BTEC Business course. Push forward the deadline of any coursework for those who have been studying any BTEC courses for over a year.",
