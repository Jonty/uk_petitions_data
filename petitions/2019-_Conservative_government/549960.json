        "action": "Make a decision now on a revised curriculum for 2021 GCSEs and A levels.",
        "additional_details": "These students have been teaching themselves using online materials provided by the teachers, often without additional support from the teachers. Many children will not have had access to the technology required to do these lessons and will therefore have fallen behind. It is not fair on either the teachers or the students to make them work even harder to make this time up. If each subject was reduced by one unit, the schools can focus on supporting the students to achieve their proper potential.",
        "background": "A level and GCSE students taking exams in 2021 have missed out on five valuable months in school. We are petitioning the Government to reduce the curriculum for next year's exams now so that 2021's A level and GCSE cohort don't suffer unnecessary stress from more Government indecision and u-turns.",
