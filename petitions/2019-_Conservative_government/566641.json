These teams would allow students to have somewhere to go when feeling overwhelmed and give them guidance on how to deal with any anxiety or stress caused by schools. It would also make sure that teachers are more educated on how to deal with a struggling student. This team should had a certain amount of free periods in which students can go and see them.",
