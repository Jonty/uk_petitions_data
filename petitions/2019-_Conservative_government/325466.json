        "action": "Ban the use of horses within the police force for crowd control.",
        "additional_details": "Police horses are an incredibly inefficient way of dealing with crowd control. When used forcefully they create panic and stampedes, as well as putting both the officer and the horse at serious danger of having an accident. The type of events that police horses are used are usually highly volatile and situations can change in a moment, it is not safe for anyone involved, or the horse itself, to leave part of the responsibility for dealing with these erratic situations to an animal.",
        "background": "I am calling on the government to ban the use of service horses within any police force or by any public service as a means of crowd control. Horses in the police force should be used solely for either search and rescue missions or ceremonial roles.",
