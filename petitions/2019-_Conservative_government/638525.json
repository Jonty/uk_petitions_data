        "additional_details": "Suicide is the biggest killer of under 35s in the U.K. and university is a time when students are potentially living away from home for the first time and when they can struggle with this step to living independently and managing studies too. By asking the government to make it compulsory for all universities to record student suicide rates- it can help each university receive more information on how to prevent suicide and give a clear indication which universities have higher rates.",
        "background": "Half of U.K. universities do not record their rates of student suicide, which we believe is concerning. This information could help identify where students are struggling and the reasons for this. I am asking the government to make it compulsory for universities to record student suicide rates.",
