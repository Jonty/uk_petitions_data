        "additional_details": "By weighing children you are implanting into their brains early roots of an eating disorder, and I\u2019m speaking from experience. When I was 10 years old I was made aware of the fact that we were going to be weighed. Starting from that day, I began unhealthy habits I thought would make me loose weight and started excessive exercising and under eating. Then after growing older and speaking to the people around me about their experiences. I realise how triggering this event has been for everyone. I dread the day my younger sibling will have to go through this.",
        "background": "Completely stop the weight checks of primary school children that categorises them into underweight, healthy and overweight. This is when school nurses come in and measure the height and weight of the child.",
