        "action": "Bicycles to have insurance, licence, identification plate and pay road tax.",
        "additional_details": "Bicycles can cause serious and expensive damage to cars if there is a collision. If a bicycle is involved in an accident they can ride off or give false contact details and there is no way of finding them again. Cyclists should also take a test to show that they are competent on the road and should be able to receive fines and points like any other road user and cyclists should also pay a Vehicle Excise Duty like all other road users.",
        "background": "As bicycles now have greater rights on public roads and in some cases have priority over cars, the petition asks that bicycles have similar conditions as cars and motorbikes, i.e. take a road competency test, have insurance and have an identification plate.",
