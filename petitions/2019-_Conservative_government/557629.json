        "additional_details": "The Government's definition of 'non-essential' is superficial and not all-encompassing. Although not selling food or medicine, these shops still create employment, preserve livelihoods, are valued by communities and sell goods that improve morale; therefore they are undoubtedly 'essential' in more ways than one. Furthermore, when closed due to lockdown, their trade is absorbed by larger supermarkets and online businesses, creating unfair competition and risking their survival in the long-term.",
