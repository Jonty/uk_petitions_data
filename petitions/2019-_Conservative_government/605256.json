        "additional_details": "My 11 year old in year 7 has to sit for 6 hours wearing a face mask without breaks. I could not do this as an adult. She has to sit in  the classroom and all communal areas, which is effectively the entire school. Her face becomes sore and mask smelly and her glasses steam up on a regular basis. Masks with wires suitable for those wearing glasses have doubled in price. You must give children the choice and not allow schools to force this upon our young children.",
