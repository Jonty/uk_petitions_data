        "additional_details": "The DWP Christmas bonus for benefit claimants is a measly \u00a310 - hardly enough to cover the costs associated with holidays. It is almost insulting to be presented with an amount of money this small - the equivalent of 76p before inflation - when many of us are already living hand to mouth and in constant fear of getting our benefits reassessed or revoked. Disabled and low-income people deserve better.\r\n\r\nhttps://inews.co.uk/news/uk/dwp-christmas-bonus-payment-benefits-claimants-value-today-money-376995\r\nhttps://metro.co.uk/2019/12/20/the-governments-10-christmas-bonus-is-an-insult-to-disabled-people-11928104/\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/christmas-bonus",
        "background": "The Christmas bonus was introduced in 1972. Since then, inflation has lowered the cost of the pound significantly, yet the \u00a310 number remained the same. With inflation taken into account, the bonus should actually be around \u00a3130. We want the Government to account for inflation in these payments.",
