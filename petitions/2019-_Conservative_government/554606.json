        "additional_details": "The reasons why we would like the Government to make a change is because we feel that they are shutting out other races and this is setting  a bad example to students. This is because it is teaching them to not recognise the importance of everyone. We also feel that this is why the levels of racism are extremely high in schools across the country and further influences children that this is okay. Finally, people of colour should get the recognition that they deserve.",
        "background": "As GCSE students we would like the Government to adjust The Curriculum in order for it to be more diverse in Culture. We feel that the Curriculum doesn't notice other races enough. For example in English GCSE students have to learn about 15 poems and not one of them is written by a person of colour.",
