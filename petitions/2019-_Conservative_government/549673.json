        "additional_details": "Aged 20, I was injured in the RAF leading to metal in my spine and 20yrs of chronic pain. In 2007, I took VUK to tribunal following a decision of a pension at 6 - 18% less able than a healthy 29yr old. This tribunal awarded 60% disability. In 2016, I began with sensory issues in my limbs. In 6 months, I was hospitalised 3 times and diagnosed with Functional Neurological Disorder from 16yrs of pain. I applied to VUK to have my pension increased due to my pensionable condition. After 45 months, I still await a tribunal for 4 other claims made, all whilst I deteriorate. My oldest case is at 1365 days and counting. The DWP processed PIP within 8 weeks including medical. How can VUK not manage this?",
        "background": "I request that VUK is subjected to a full audit to determine cases which have passed set deadlines, the reasons for this failure and procedures for expediting cases to tribunal.",
