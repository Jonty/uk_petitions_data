        "additional_details": "The current package of financial assistance is grossly unfair; whilst  salaried employees get 80% of their salary and effectively have a 3-month paid vacation, and those who have been self-employed for more than a year can not only claim 80% of their income but also continue to earn as much as they can, those who are in their first year of business and who may have incurred substantial start-up costs, have been unfairly ignored and will face significant financial hardship. This cannot be right?!",
