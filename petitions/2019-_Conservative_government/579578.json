        "additional_details": "Part 3 of the Bill includes broad powers for the police to curtail rights to peaceful protest. This is an insidious method to further dictate what movements can gain traction at the expense of the public good.\r\nAbuses of police power and reach are already cause for concern where social justice is sought, especially in contrast to assemblies without goals of social justice. \r\nThese additions are a betrayal of the public, uphold systematic oppression and will incite more public harm, remove them.",
        "background": "Part 3 of the PCSC Bill 2021 includes broad powers for police to curtail rights to peaceful protest: enhanced restriction of protests/assemblies, harsher sentences for charges, and even limitations on single acts of peaceful protest etc. We demand that Part 3 of the Bill be scrapped in its entirety",
