        "additional_details": "Many pupils are being required to stay at home on a regular basis and especially now during the current lockdown. Not all will have access to laptops, computers or other facilities but most will have access to the BBC in some way. BBC4 is only used after 7pm which leaves many hours of unused airspace that should be made available for education in this time of need. The BBC are offering limited educational programming, as are other broadcasting platforms that require a financial subscription. The BBC is already covered by the licence fee. The station has been utilised in the past for the Olympics... it should be used now.",
        "background": "BBC4 currently runs it's programming from 7pm daily.... this leaves alot of empty airtime during the day that could be used to provide curriculum based programming for pupils and students required to undertake home schooling. This could apply during the current lockdown and beyond.",
