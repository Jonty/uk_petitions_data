        "additional_details": "TV and film production companies are taking advantage of Support Artists. They pay little but expect a lot. Support Artists can\u2019t survive on low wages, and many are deterred from entering the Arts due to the low pay and few opportunities. They are also expected to start work as early as 7 a.m. and finish as late at 3 a.m. Unsociable hours, often in cold, wet conditions isn\u2019t common. They are then expected to pay for a taxi home. They might only get one or two jobs per week, or even per month.",
        "background": "Most Support Artists are expected to work up to twelve hours for \u00a3111 per day. This works out at \u00a39.25 per hour. An agency will take a 20% cut leaving the Support Artist with a mere \u00a388.80. They are also expected to pay for their own transport costs and often their own costumes.",
