        "additional_details": "Student nurses and midwives work full-time hours on placement whilst having lectures, tutorials and assignments, this makes it hard for students to take up paid work without burning themselves out or putting themselves behind in their studies. As a student nurse we provide full care to patients and perform the same duties as clinical support workers and nurses and therefore we should be paid to ensure we can survive and provide for our families whilst massively contributing the NHS.",
        "background": "As a student nurse working full-time during the coronavirus pandemic, it has only highlighted the important role that we play in the nursing team to ensure patients receive adequate care and our efforts should be reflected with a salary as we are risking our lives daily and supporting the NHS.",
