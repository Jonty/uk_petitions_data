        "additional_details": "Colonialism is the foundation of modern racism across countries around the world. However young people are not educated on its true impact on countries but instead 'White Washed' to put a positive face on attrocious acts. This must change if we are to build the multicultural society we want as a country and educate British youths on the privilege some have over others. By doing this we can educate people on how to be anti-racist and with further work from the government stamp out racism.",
        "background": "Restructuring education specifications on colonialism in schools across the country. Colonialism is not something to be proud of and it's true effects on societies across the globe should be known. Britain's colonial past still influences modern day racism and it must STOP.",
