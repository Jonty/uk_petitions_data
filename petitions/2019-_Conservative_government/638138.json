To continue to receive that benefit we need only stay alive yet the nurses who together with doctors keep us alive (literally in my wife's case when she needed heart surgery and then treatment for cancer) have been offered only half that amount for nurses and no offer at all to doctors.  We did not clap three years ago to support hedge fund managers and bankers",
