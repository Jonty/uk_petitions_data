        "action": "Legalisation of some widely used illicit substances and safe spaces in cities",
        "additional_details": "This would not only make the consumption of drugs, an already common occurrance, much safer, but it would also be a great tax opportunity, allowing more money to be spent on important matters like education rather than combating drug use. Along with this, scientific research of these drugs would be made much easier and we can discover the true benefits and drawbacks of each. This would provide more jobs in research and development but also create more jobs in the safe spaces (e.g. trip sitters)",
        "background": "Legalise substances such as marijuana, LSD, and Psilocybin mushrooms, provide spaces around towns and cities for safe consumption similar to pubs, boost scientific research of these drugs and provide more employment opportunities.",
