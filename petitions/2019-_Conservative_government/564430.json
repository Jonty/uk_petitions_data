        "additional_details": "Many are suffering terribly both mentally and economically. The Government messages had been clear that some form of Christmas was going to occur. This has been taken away in an afternoon and without any debate in Parliament. Decisions made so late in the day need to be debated as soon as possible. Parliament could sit in the run up to Christmas to debate these stringent measures curtailing the moment of millions.",
        "background": "Tier 4 restrictions have been imposed across large areas of London and the South East. This has been completed without any parliamentary scrutiny. The Government has stated a vote will be held in January 2021. However this is too little too late for many.",
