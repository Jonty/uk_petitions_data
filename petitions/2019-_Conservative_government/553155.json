If you fill these places, you won't have stupid teenagers running around the closed sites, wasting police time, because people will be living there. Less squatters, too. Just ask some surveyors to ensure the place is habitable, give them cupboards and extra walls where needed, and allow the COVID Marshalls to reside there. Pay them fairly and I am sure it really will help.",
