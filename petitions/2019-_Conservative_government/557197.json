He can exercise recreationally outdoors with one other person playing as a pair or two ball. The nature of the game means that it is naturally socially distanced. To ban golf played in pairs is illogical when the Government is encouraging and wants people to take unlimited exercise.",

Prohibiting it played by two players is illogical",
