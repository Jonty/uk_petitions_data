        "additional_details": "Prepayment customers have to pay more for energy than those who pay by direct debit, which is unfair given that those on prepayment meters are likely those who can least afford higher unit prices. If customers use emergency credit, the debt is taken from future top up payments, making it hard to get out of debt. We believe suppliers of energy have been overcharging those who can least afford it. The Government should provide more help.",
