        "action": "Allow learner drivers to drive in England with a member of their own household.",
        "additional_details": "Because of the pandemic, there is already a significant backlog of learner drivers waiting to do a test, this blanket ban will mean that learner drivers will potentially miss out on months worth of driving. This will inevitably result in learners taking even longer to pass their practical tests once restrictions are lifted. The ban doesn't even make sense as driving in the car with someone of your own bubble possesses a nonexistent threat to others as long as you stay in the car.",
        "background": "Under current lockdown restrictions, there is a blanket ban on all learner driving even with members of your own bubble despite the fact that in Scotland or Wales, you can do so for essential reasons.",
