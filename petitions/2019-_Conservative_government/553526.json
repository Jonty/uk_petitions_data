        "additional_details": "Time and again the Prime Minister or their allocated deputy wastes the time of the House and of the public by refusing to answer questions set to them by MPs. Instead, the PM or nominated Minister at the despatch box often makes no attempt to address the question, all too often facing their own MPs rather than the Speaker, playing to their audience, ignoring the question, refusing to answer, and descending into farce.\r\n\r\nWe insist the Speaker holds them accountable, and enforces answers.",
        "background": "The behaviour of ALL members of the House is a matter for the  Speaker, including during PMQs. As such we call on the Speaker of the House to chair these sessions with rigour, particularly ensuring answers are given, not avoided. Some Members may feel this is a pantomime, but the electorate do not.",
