        "additional_details": "the news and media shows paedophiles having very lenient sentences that don\u2019t match the heinous crimes. A child\u2019s life is ruined forever and yet the predator is free to hurt again and do repeatedly. Judges are passing sentences that the public are appalled and disgusted with. We want the Government to make sure that these judges pass longer and tougher sentences with chemical castration and a guarantee that this Government is doing all it can to save our children and future generations",
        "background": "Paedophiles get lenient sentences and judges give community service or rehabilitation that fails! Longer prison terms for possession of illicit photos and child porn and chemical castration for repeat offenders. Judges who often give lenient sentences that don\u2019t fit the crime to step down from cases",
