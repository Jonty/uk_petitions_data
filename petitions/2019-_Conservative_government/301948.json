For an overseas nurse on a three year contract thats almost \u00a31,900 in addition to their tax and NI contributions. The NHS is under staffed and relies on the dedication, devotion and sacrifice of thousands of overseas nurses, doctors, assistants, cleaners and so on coming to the UK. Raising the charge is an outcry and unjustified, and could potentially lead to staffing shortages in the future.",
