        "additional_details": "This would serve the dual purpose of reducing waste and helping those experiencing or facing hunger.\r\n \r\nThere are multiple reasons why we need to act on food wastage and poverty. The rising cost of living is hitting families hard when it comes to providing for young children, and indeed parents themselves working longer and harder to meet rising bills. Requiring supermarkets to donate food stuffs would help enable those in hardship to collect unused food stuffs, reducing waste and helping to tackle hunger.\r\n",
