        "additional_details": "As a passionate animal lover and advocate for animal rights, I am deeply concerned about the rising of breed-specific banning. The solution shouldn't just be to ban breeds, when it is likely another breed will be used for these same reasons in future. Growing up, I have spent many years of my life trying to be a voice for the voiceless, but I can't make these changes alone. It is time the government stopped blaming the wrong end of the leash.",
        "background": "There are other solutions and this petition aims to bring attention to these issues and urge authorities to reconsider their stance on banning specific breeds while reinstating dog licensing programs and training requirements.",
