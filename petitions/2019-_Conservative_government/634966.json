        "additional_details": "Sunscreen is a necessity rather than a luxury, but trying to find an eco-friendly sunscreen can be a time intensive task which could be easily remedied by banning those that contain harmful chemicals to aquatic life. This ban is a small change that could have a huge impact. \r\n \r\nHawaii was the first nation to ban sunscreens containing oxybenzone and octinoxate in 2018. Palau, US Virgin Islands, Key West, and Bonaire are all in the process of banning toxic sunscreens. We need to do the same.",
        "background": "It is estimated that 14k tons of sunscreen end up in the oceans each year. We want the Government to ban sunscreens that contain oxybenzone and octinoxate, which are harmful to aquatic life. These can cause coral bleaching, fish infertility, and impair photosynthesis in algae.",
