She had done her theory test  and passed but is only valid for 2 years , but has now been told she is unable to book her driving test as there is a waiting list of 2 years  due to the pandemic . Young adults like my daughter should not have to wait two year just to get her full driving license when the pandemic was not her or many others like her fault . The DVLA needs financial support so they can then recruit more driving test instructions to help clear the back log on the waiting list",
