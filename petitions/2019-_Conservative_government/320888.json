        "additional_details": "Higher taxes & pay freezes would demoralize people after this terrible virus. Cancel all new road building and encourage people to work from home and stagger working hours. New roads can increase traffic because people think their journey time will be shortened. People should be encouraged to use public transport or bikes. Air and noise pollution caused by cars should also be reduced. Higher taxes will affect everyone, new roads will affect considerably less.",
        "background": "I don't want my children to be burdened by the huge debt this virus has caused. After this crisis more people are likely to work from home as companies have invested in technology to enable this so there should be less traffic. Work hours could be staggered reducing traffic & the need for new roads.",
