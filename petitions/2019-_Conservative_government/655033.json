        "additional_details": "The attack (and hostage taking) on 7 Oct 23 by Hamas was horrific. Israel's response to eliminate Hamas has been severe, and only limited warning has been given to the civilians (many of the over 25000 deaths are children and women). Children should be given special protection under International Humanitarian Law.  Safe havens in Israel (outside Gaza) could help prevent so much suffering; would be in keeping with IHL; and could also help prevent the conflict spreading in the Middle East.",

Israeli academics have proposed such safe havens (The Guardian 1/11/23) to be run by the UN/Red Cross; financed by the international community and protected by Israel.",
