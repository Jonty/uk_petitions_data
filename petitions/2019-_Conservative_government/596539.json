        "additional_details": "About 1 in 8 women in the UK are diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime. If it's detected early, treatment is more successful and there's a good chance of recovery. You may be eligible for breast cancer screening before the age of 50 but only if you have a very high risk of developing breast cancer usually identified by testing for BRCA gene. But for many this is not an option, putting the responsibly onto women to recognise changes through self-examination leading to later detection",
        "background": "Women in England aged 50-71 are automatically invited for breast screening every 3 years. However with BC rates increasing and more women aged 30-40 not receiving diganosis, there is a clear need to reduce the automatic invitation age. Especially for those with a strong family history of cancer.",
