        "additional_details": "A level and GCSE Students already disadvantaged by Covid; they have not received any teaching since March. Within days of results suddenly students have mock results as a back up but  not estimated teacher grades? The majority of students work harder after mocks. What about further teaching they would have received to improve grades? Teachers know the difference in performance between mocks and actual grades. They know student\u2019s individual circumstances. Their assessments should be counted.",
        "background": "Change grounds for appeal to include teacher predicted grades. We know mock results rarely reflect final grades but this is the only appeal for students. If your teacher cannot be trusted to know your likely result, who can? Minimum grade award should include teacher recommended grade.",
