In this modern day of equality more fathers take day to day care of their children and if both parents have parental responsibility there is no reason why shared care orders should not be the starting point in all cases where CAFCAS deem safe. The current system means fathers spending months with limited access to children.",

Shared care should be the starting point until final hearing date.",
