        "additional_details": "As stated in a published policy paper, the Home Office intend to use electronic tags to monitor the whereabouts of certain people seeking asylum in England.\r\n \r\nThe plan treats asylum-seekers like criminals, and could be detrimental to the mental health of people who may already be vulnerable and have escaped persecution and violence elsewhere in the world. The Government must end this pilot now.",
        "background": "The Government should recognise the inhumane nature of tagging asylum seekers, and end this pilot now. We believe tagging people, many of whom may be vulnerable, is unjust, and shows contempt for those seeking refuge.",
