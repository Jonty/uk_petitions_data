Having asked when the owed monies for those 3 months would be paid, I was then informed there was no back payment.\r\nHaving been awarded the basic universal credit component during this time, this does not help pay for the additional costs needed, the costs of which the disabled element is meant to pay for. Backdated payment is needed",
