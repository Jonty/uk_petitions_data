        "additional_details": "I'm a disabled young woman living in Worcestershire who has had to have an agency company alongside my own carers since the pandemic. My impression is that care staff are prepared to care for the elderly, but caring for a disabled young person is significantly different to an elderly person. Especially if we're able to communicate in ways elderly people may not be able to. I have had some personal experience where agency staff don't know how to treat me appropriately.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to fund training for care providers on how disabled young people should be treated. I feel care providers are more aware of the needs of the elderly and staff don't know how to treat disabled. It is quite different caring for a young person than an elderly person.",
