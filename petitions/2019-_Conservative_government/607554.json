        "additional_details": "The Government has legislated to ban smoking in many workplaces and public spaces in the name of public health.\r\n \r\nAlcohol consumption has many detrimental effects including diminishing the ability to make decisions and increasing risk-taking behaviour and the list can go on.\r\n \r\nAs with smoking, alcohol has no place in a modern work place environment therefore legislation is needed to formally ban it in all workplace situations. This ban shouldn't affect customers in hospitality settings.",
        "background": "In light of recent news events and it currently being up to employers what alcohol policies to have in the workplace, I feel it is time to bring the issue of drinking in the workplace into the 21st century and formally ban alcohol consumption both at work and in all work spaces.",
