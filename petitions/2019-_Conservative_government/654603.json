Additionally, maintenance of local roads are a matter for individual local authorities, not the UK Government or Parliament.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling on the Government to introduce new requirements for local authorities to maintain roads to a certain standard. We could also accept a petition calling on the Government to provide additional funding for road maintenance, either for local roads or national roads."
