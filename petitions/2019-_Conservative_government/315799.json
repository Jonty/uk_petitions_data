        "additional_details": "As a public sector the NHS don\u2019t get the wage they deserve. The hours each and every Doctor and Nurse puts in to help people in difficult times to ease their pain, or the care they receive to help them recover. We need the Government to realise that without the dedication of humans working in the NHS, we wouldn\u2019t be where we are today.",
        "background": "The NHS over the last month has shown us how amazing a service we have in the UK. We take for granted the NHS service on a daily basis until times like this, when we need and expect NHS to help us. Now is time for the government to realise the NHS and reward them with a pay rise they deserve.",
