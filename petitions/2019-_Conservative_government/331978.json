        "additional_details": "It makes application system less affordable for students. Due to Covid-19, Universities closed the campuses, students do not have access to many facilities which they paid in their tuition fees that affect studies, such as library, study rooms, computers, Internet etc. Students were not reimbursed for the unavailability of these services. In Addition, the government is going to increase NHS surcharge which It is extremely unfair and clear exploitation of foreign students who wish to study here.",
        "background": "Stop the increase of NHS surcharge which comes into effect in October from \u00a3300 to \u00a3470 for all international students. We look forward to receiving a response from UK government to make sure that international and EU students feel welcome to come and study in this country.",
