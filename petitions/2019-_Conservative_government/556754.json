It will also have a detrimental effect on residents and businesses that rely on access to their properties on these roads.\r\n\r\nThe proposed closures are also a temporary measure to meet targets quickly, where as the alternatives proposed, given more time, will offer a permanent solution to reducing air pollution in this city.",
