        "additional_details": "Government needs to help protect police officers carrying out their duties who are there to help the general public. It is clear that the fact there seems to be no real consequence to any crime nowadays, including assaulting a police officer which years ago was a line in the sand even with real criminal's, is resulting in the breakdown of common decency and society. \r\nTheir respect and authority needs to be re established before it is beyond repair.",
        "background": "In light of  increasing assault's on police officers and the general disregard to law and order  I would like the Government to introduce immediate legislation stating that any physical assault on a police officer whilst on duty is punishable with a mandatory minimum 2 year prison sentence.",
