        "additional_details": "Minds of students were relaxed, then mental health has been ruined again by these stress inducing mini exams being introduced. It\u2019s not fair on the students that have missed over 8 months of schooling now, and it will cause them to panic and not show their full potential. It isn\u2019t fair on us. We need to help year 11 and 13. If the government even cared for them, they wouldn\u2019t cancel GCSEs just to create mini exams which will just cause as much pressure as before!!",
        "background": "GCSEs were cancelled for a reason, so why are you trying to make mini exams. Don\u2019t do this to all the children who are struggling, have you even considered what is happening to them at this time too? It\u2019s more than unfair. There was a reason exams got cancelled, so don\u2019t make more.",
