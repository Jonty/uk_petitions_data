        "additional_details": "I have saw children of primary school age, in uniform outside schools using these. This is not a healthy lifestyle to promote and with a ban on flavours and packaging, use of the devices by a minor may decrease. Issuing packaging with more warnings and compulsory reporting should a parent or guardian be buying the devices for children. I would like to see the government take action on this immediately.",
        "background": "Disposable E-Cigarettes are becoming more desirable to children, they are attracted to the colours of the packaging and flavours. I'd like to see them banned from shop displays, forced to use bland colours and packaging, banning \"exotic\" flavours, in line with conventional tobacco and cigarettes.",
