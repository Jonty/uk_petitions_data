This should enable relief to the NHS with fewer people to treat, and ease anxiety among those who fear for their lives, whilst others go on as 'normal' unaware of the danger still posed to others.",

Many are stil shielding themselves, getting very sick, or dying due to a lack of immune response to 2 vaccines. A booster vaccine could enable a satisfactory immune response from those with lowered immune systems.",
