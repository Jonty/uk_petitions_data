This archaic model of registering deaths needs to be transformed for the modern world.\r\n\r\nSuch a shift in public policy can open a new terrain for understanding life in the UK on many levels. The information is also critical to supporting research in a range of key fields. \r\n\r\nWe cannot rely on anecdotal media reports to paint a picture of ethnic disparities in death, we deserve the data.",

We all have the right to know so that we can explore ways public policy may need to be shaped around possible disparities.",
