Spreading falsehoods is simply not acceptable and sets an appalling example to the country. \r\nMP\u2019s should be treated no differently to Company Directors when it comes to the truth. There is no merit in providing MP\u2019s protection by means of Parliamentary privilege when it comes to the truth. If MP\u2019s are not honest they are deceiving the public whom they serve.\r\nSome members of the public cannot determine what is true or false. They will continue to believe falsehoods unless there is a public retraction and apology.",
        "background": "Any MP making a false statement or claim should be required to make a full public retraction and a full public apology. \r\nMany companies operate a \u20183 strikes and out\u2019 rule. Implementing a similar rule for MP\u2019s would discourage those perpetrators who repeatedly use this form of tactic.",
