        "additional_details": "Making the vaccine mandatory takes away our freedom of choice. If you make the vaccine mandatory to NHS workers you are most likely to lose health care workers making our NHS more understaffed. We are already overrun. And if we do not have freedom of choice it will change our opinion on the system.",
        "background": "It is against our human rights to make the vaccine mandatory.. the public and NHS should have a choice when it comes to putting something they do not know anything about into our body. People within the NHS have their own reasons as to why they do not want the vaccine.",
