        "additional_details": "Medical units in the British armed forces provide crucial support to our troops and can assist the NHS in times of need. Operation Rescript, during the COVID-19 pandemic, involved thousands of personnel supporting the NHS. This demonstrates the essential aid our military can offer. With troop levels reported to be at a 200-year low and an anticipated 28% reduction in the Regular Army's size by 2025, compared to 2010, we believe preserving this vital capability is imperative to maintaining stability and wellness at home and abroad.",
        "background": "We petition for the UK Government to commit to no drop in personnel numbers below current levels for all military medical units. This includes the Army Medical Services, the RAF Medical Services and the Royal Navy Medical Services.",
