        "additional_details": "In our own experience, having paid leave once securing a special guardianship order would have been invaluable. It would have enabled us to give our Niece and Nephew the consistent and quality support that they required following the death of their Mother. It would have also alleviated the stress of working whilst adjusting to our new circumstances. It is time for special guardianship to receive the recognition and support that it deserves.",
        "background": "Special guardians are not entitled to any paid leave. Whereas adoption leave gives the person up to 52 weeks off work, with statutory adoption pay for 39 weeks. Becoming a special guardian is a life changing transition and paid leave would ensure that adults are able to support children.",
