        "action": "Abolish the Sunday Trading Act 1994 (allowing stores to open later on Sundays)",
        "additional_details": "The motive behind the intial implementation of the Sunday Trading Act has arguably been made redundant in the past 30 years. Rather than entirely abolishing it, placing a Sunday trading tax is likely to solve the issue of households being unable to shop whilst also generating income for the government (at the expense of large corporations who are willing to pay.) Specifically, a wind-fall tax or progressive tax, instead of a consistent tax, would remove any negative impacts on businesses.",
        "background": "Longer opening hours on Sundays would allow us to avoid bad situations that would easily be solved by an open supermarket. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also likely to encourage people to shop in stores rather than online, boosting dying shops and bringing back more jobs after Covid.",
