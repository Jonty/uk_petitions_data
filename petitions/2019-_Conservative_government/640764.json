        "additional_details": "Because it\u2019s not fair on the owners and their family\u2019s to loose a member due to other bad owners. A lot of breeders as well also do everything by the book and pay their taxes from the money they make off the dogs. It\u2019s not fair to take that away either. People have changed their lives with these dogs. ITS NEVER THE DOG ALWAYS THE OWNER. BAN THE BAD BREEDERS AND OWNERS NOT THE BREED. If a chihuahua had a body the same size as an XL they\u2019d be the most dangerous breed. But it\u2019s overlooked cos small",
        "background": "Actually come in to contact with the breed and understand how good a breed they truely are. They\u2019re gentle giants with other dogs , animals and kids. Majority of the dogs are for looks and show nowadays. Barley anyone has intention on using these dogs for anything bad. It\u2019s the owners. Not the dogs",
