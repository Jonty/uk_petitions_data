        "additional_details": "Parents may have concerns about returning children to school whilst there is no protection against the virus. A decision to open schools will be strongly influenced by economic and political factors, not only the health and wellbeing of citizens. School authorities have the power to compel parents to send their children to school. Failure to do so can result in punishment including fines and even imprisonment.\r\n\r\nIt is wrong to punish parents whose primary concern is the safety of their families",
