But when they fall as they are currently there appears to be a Feather approach to reducing prices. To that end I am calling on you as a member of the working class and as a labour follower to establish a pump watch consumer monitor to ensure fair prices at the fuel pumps that are in line with wholesale prices.",
        "background": "we are seeing prices at the pump\u2018s reach a record new level of almost \u00a32.00 per litre. This means that the average family is paying at least \u00a316 more to fill up the tank than a year ago, and in rural areas are seeing traditional pumps prices having to find at least an extra \u00a320.00 more.",
