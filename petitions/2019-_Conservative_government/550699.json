        "additional_details": "The UK Nightlife and Music Industry is being simply left to one side and ignored.  Whilst many are demanding action in the form of re-opening clubs and venues, it is apparent that this is some time away yet.  If it is not sensible to open then a support package should be given to venues that are still unable to open.  This support package should be of 3  measures. 1. Security from the threat of winding up. 2. Financial support in the interim. 3. The ability to change their trade temporarily.",
