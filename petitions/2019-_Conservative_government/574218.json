        "additional_details": "Pet shops in the uk advertise many rabbit cages which do not meet the minimum size required for the well-being of the animals. Cages from as little as 4.6 sq ft are sold as a suitable home when the minimum requirement for a rabbit is 8 sq ft. Consumers trust pet shops to be advertising correct care information for the well-being of their pet. It is the law to meet the rabbits welfare needs and by selling these cages pet shops are giving misleading care guidance/encouraging that law to be broken.",
        "background": "Under the Animal Welfare Act 2006, rabbit owners are required by law to meet their rabbits\u2019 welfare needs (RSPCA). Pet shops sell numerous cages that don\u2019t meet these requirements with some cages being as much as 50% smaller than needed. This encourages improper care & threatens the animals welfare.",
