        "additional_details": "If the Government made the scheme tax-unregistered (as in the Judiciary Pension Scheme) then senior staff will surely be more willing to undertake extra clinics, extra operating lists and contribute to the reduction in waiting times which have grown significantly since the pandemic.\r\n\r\nIt is perversely punitive that staff who undertake additional sessions can be faced with a tax bill of more than what they earned for those sessions.",
        "background": "The NHS pension scheme should be \u2018tax un-registered\u2019, so the annual allowance and lifetime allowance don\u2019t apply. The tax bills resulting from annual pension growth can leave senior staff choosing to take on LESS work to reduce their tax bill - work they would have otherwise been willing to do.",
