        "additional_details": "In Jan 2023 many stamps will no longer be valid. This will mainly hurt older people, disabled people and those on a low income. These people may not know about the changes or, like me, may have bought lots in advance when they were cheaper. I'm disabled and bought a lot in advance so I'd have some even when I'm unable to go out. I doubt I'll be able to find all of mine before Jan 2023. It's unfair to expect people to use them up before then or trust the replacement service to not lose them.",
