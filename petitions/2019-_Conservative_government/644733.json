        "action": "Reconsider the Prime Minister's watering down of crucial net zero policies",
        "additional_details": "The rolling back of climate policies will be detrimental to the UK's progress towards net zero as well as disruptive to industry. By delaying the introduction of key measures we are shortening the amount of time we have to act and adding increasing demand to future governments and the British people to meet net zero in a shorter period of time. Industry has been preparing for the agreed initiatives and will loose confidence in the stability and reliability of UK policies if changes continue.",
        "background": "Rishi Sunak claimed that his changes were in the spirit of 'democracy', but the general public has not been given the opportunity to express their thoughts on his removal of crucial climate initiatives. The changes proposed should be debated in Parliament and consulted on with climate experts.",
