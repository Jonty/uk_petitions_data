        "additional_details": "Students were affected severely by covid in 2020. It was the year, most started their first year of GCSE\u2019s. Lockdown meant students missed out on over half a year of learning, nearly a full year. Currently, students still miss out on a lot of learning due to isolating and not having the right access to school learning from home, or they do not understand the work as better. By providing leniency on the GCSE\u2019s for 2022, students will have some sort of reassurance.",
        "background": "Year 11 students who will sit their GCSE\u2019s next year should have less topics to cover or extra help or lower pass marks",
