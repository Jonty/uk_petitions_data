        "action": "Increase the Childcare tax free credit per annum, and review every few years.",
        "additional_details": "In the SE, fee increases are close to 40% from 2018 to 2023. That would equate to \u00a33200 TFC per annum now. \r\nIt is an invaluable resource to working families, but it should not remain a stagnant amount. The cap should be reviewed and increased urgently in balance with an average fee increase felt across the country, and an agreed timescale to continually review the cap moving forward to avoid stagnation. This will enable working parents to remain in the workforce, and support childcare providers.",
        "background": "The current year cap is \u00a32,000, but this has not kept pace with the rate that nurseries are increasing their fees. This amount was set in 2014 when this was first agreed in parliament. In 2023, parents are in a position where they might exceed the cap even just sending their child 2 days a week.",
