Unless there is a recording, it is not possible to get the evidence required. This  in other happens courts, such as Crown and Family (Civil), so when a Court has the ability to impose such sanctions, we believe the Right to a Fair Trial should involve recording.",

Magistrates have the power to imprison defendants for up to 6 months and without a record, defendants cannot prove issues such as perjury on oath.",
