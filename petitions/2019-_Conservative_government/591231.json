        "action": "Allow people with COVID antibodies to travel back to the UK without quarantine.",
        "additional_details": "There is medical evidence to suggest that having the vaccine is of no benefit to those who still have antibodies from having had the virus previously. Those who have had the virus and have antibodies are unlikely to catch the virus and/or spread it to others, similarly to those who have had the vaccine. Therefore, it would seem sensible to allow those with antibodies to travel without quarantine as opposed to just those who have been double vaccinated.",
        "background": "It has been reported that from 19th July 2021, anyone who has been double vaccinated can travel back to the UK without quarantining. I would like this to be extended to those who can evidence  antibodies, whether that be from the vaccine or from immunity due to having already had the virus.",
