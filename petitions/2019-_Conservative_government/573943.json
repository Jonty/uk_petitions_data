Life has improved for hundreds of thousands of Myanmar people.\r\n\r\nEverything happening now stands against the values that we ourselves pride ourselves on as a country. \r\n\r\nThey have had their access to social media blocked to stop them reaching out for help imternationally and to suppress protesting against the coup which the people are against.",
        "background": "The British goverment should impose strict sanctions against Myanmar until the democratic goverment that has been elected by the people is released from prison and put back into office. \r\n\r\nDemocracy should always be defended from any type of oppression.",
