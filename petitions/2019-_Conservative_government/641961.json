        "additional_details": "Whilst we agree that the UK should be energy independent, we do not think granting more offshore fossil fuel fields is the answer. We should be trying to move away from our reliance on fossil fuels, and be focusing on being more energy efficient.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, windfarms could be built out at sea, generating local energy and employment for the area. Meanwhile, investing in retrofitting solar panels on houses, schools and council offices could allow communities to generate energy themselves.",
