        "additional_details": "The NHS is a source of pride for the people of this country, yet the level of funding over many years has been far from adequate. It goes without saying that the current state of our health care system is not fit for purpose. The coronavirus pandemic has exposed many shortcomings and the fragility of the system putting lives at risk. Many people are worried and concerned about the future of the NHS therefore a swift and robust action is required to bring it up to the standard that every citizen of the U.K. expects and deserves.",
        "background": "The Government should review its spending policy and make the NHS an utmost priority. The people should be reassured that the Government has learned the hard lesson during the current pandemic and will subsequently work assiduously in order to implement much needed changes.",
