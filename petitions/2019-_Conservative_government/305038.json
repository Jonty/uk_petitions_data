        "additional_details": "The government would have the power to tell universities to give the opportunity to cancel/refund students accommodation due to the promise of in person lectures/seminars being impossible in the current environment. This would be Helping with families financially during the COVID-19 epidemic, and allow for a fair outcome that the last weeks from a certain date do not need to be paid my students who have left.",
        "background": "Due to coronavirus affecting universities, they have  gone digital, therefore many students have returned home for safety, and primarily left due to lectures & seminars being cancelled, which is the prime purpose of university halls. Instead, accommodation is not essential as previously listed.",
