        "additional_details": "I would like all subsidies for MPs to be stopped, and for there to be a limit placed on the amount of expenses they can claim. To continue to subsidise MPs meals is an affront to the ordinary citizens of the UK, many of whom are in dire financial straits because of the current Government\u2019s failures. The daily payment for members of the House of Lords to simply turn up should be means tested, and benchmarked against the average salary for an NHS nurse.",
        "background": "MPs are eligible for subsidised meals in the Member\u2019s Dining Room, with starters at around \u00a33 and the most expensive main course costing just \u00a38.04. This is completely immoral when people having to use food banks to survive.",
