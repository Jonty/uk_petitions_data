        "additional_details": "This is something that individuals can\u2019t do on their own as there is so much we don\u2019t know about our food. For example, one avocado may come from a well established tree, whereas another may come from a source that has had to cut down trees to plant a new avocado tree and so would be a worse choice for the environment. Even if all fossil fuels were stopped tomorrow, the planet will still heat up by 2 degrees by the end of the century if we don\u2019t change how we eat.",
        "background": "A third of all climate damage is caused by what we eat whether through deforestation, air miles, or methane emissions. By putting scores on food (like nutritional information) consumers can make a big difference to their carbon footprint by choosing lower scored foods",
