        "additional_details": "It is common sense and the right thing thing to do. Enforcement of applying rate increases to current accounts would be relatively easy to manage. Also the means and resources to ensure such enforcement would be proportionate the benefit received by the public from having that extra interest earned in their current accounts. My own mortgage with HSBC has increased by \u00a3135 per month (\u00a31620 in the last year) yet my related current account has received no rate increases during the same period.",
