Also, if teachers think children are struggling they could contact parents and discuss where, when  and what subject they need more help on. This should be generally available for secondary school but there could be extra add ons for Primary schools to get them started for SATS.",

Students should be provided with at least the three subjects: Maths,English and Science",
