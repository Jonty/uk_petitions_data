        "additional_details": "When MPs are debating issues in the Commons Chamber, their attention should be focused entirely on the issues at hand. Unfortunately, many MPs use this time to tweet, text, and check their emails, wearing away the seriousness and integrity of engaged, rigorous debate. Law is debated in Parliament, not on Twitter; and MPs who are uninterested or distracted simply cannot be trusted to make informed and careful judgments about important issues.",
        "background": "There is no good reason for Members of Parliament to be tweeting, texting, or watching videos during debates in the House of Commons. The Speaker of the House of Commons should ask MPs to leave the Commons Chamber if they are caught using a mobile phone.",
