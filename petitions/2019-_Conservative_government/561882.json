        "additional_details": "In the current climate, the government have publicised that they will be freezing the pay of the very people that kept the country running and to some extent, in the PM\u2019s case, alive.  It is a huge kick in the teeth and absolutely hypocritical to those key workers that continued to work, during a global pandemic, putting their and their families lives at risk, to keep the most vulnerable safe and well, that MP\u2019s should still be allowed to claim the pay rise and it should be stopped.",
        "background": "The current government administration have frozen public sector pay as a consequence of government spending following the coronavirus pandemic. Yet MP\u2019s will currently still receive their 4.1% pay rise, more than any rise given to the public sector this year, equating to \u00a33,300 per MP.",
