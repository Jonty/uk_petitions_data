The spike in demand from jobseekers outweighs supply of jobs. Lack of savings to fall back on due to low income.\r\n(2) Food supply/delivery underpins the UK's survival. If zero hours workers take time off, they risk losing \"informally contracted\" hours on return. Rent freeze provides basic financial safety so they can take time off if needed.",

Universal Credit (UC) is too impractical(1), and those in the food industry need guaranteed financial security, for the health and economy of our country(2). Landlords have mortgage freezes.",
