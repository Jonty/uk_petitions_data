        "additional_details": "The request to stop the plan of increasing UK family visa income requirements to \u00a338,700 might stem from concerns about potential exclusion of certain families due to financial barriers. The call could be for the government or parliament to reassess the proposed income threshold, considering its impact on families, especially in terms of diversity, inclusivity, and the ability to reunite with loved ones. Advocates may seek a more balanced approach that ensures families can be together without facing excessive financial burdens or restrictions.",
        "background": "I urge the Government or Parliament to halt the proposed increase in UK family visa income requirements to ensure fair access and support for families wanting to reunite.",
