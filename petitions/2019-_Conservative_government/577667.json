I personally believe that psychology is just as important. \r\n\r\nPsychology could help people with a mental disorder to:\r\n\r\n\u2022Understand the behaviours, emotions, and ideas that contribute to their illness and learn how to modify them\r\n\r\n\u2022Understand and identify the life problems or events that contribute to their illness and help understand which aspects of those problems they may be able to solve or improve\r\n\r\n\u2022Regain a sense of control and pleasure in life\r\n\r\n\u2022Learn healthy coping techniques and problem-solving skills",
