        "additional_details": "During this pandemic hundreds of thousands of people, in the course of maintaining continuous residence have a hard decision to make. Return to their home country to care for their parents and family or stay in the UK to maintain the continuous residence status. The uncertainty of a next lockdown or the fear of being stranded overseas and then having to prove what happened creates yet another source of anxiety affecting mental health of many. Allowing an exception is the only humane option.",
