Insurance companies will make an online sale in minutes and then force anyone who doesn't want to renew into a 40-minute call centre queue, only to be given another hard sell.  This should not be lawful!  Brick and mortar stores are not allowed to make you queue to get out; they may only rely on the value of their product.  All companies must abide by this standard.",

If it was sold to us online, we must be able to cancel it online.",
