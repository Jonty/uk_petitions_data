I want to celebrate the equality and diversity here in the UK, yet this is another example of the hatred in our society. We should not stand for it! I know many trans people and have seen first hand how hard it can be to change thier legal gender and the problems this can cause them. Its not fair and its not right!",

Why should we allow and justify the fight for somone to legally be who they were from birth in 2020 Britain.",
