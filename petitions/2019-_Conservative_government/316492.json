In many cases (on coaches and older buses) there is not even a screen to protect them. If a driver is asymptomatic, they are also at risk of contaminating their passengers. Whilst public transport is still allowed to function, the spread of the disease cannot be contained effectively and the government are putting lives at risk.",
