        "additional_details": "Many pets are affected, terrified or even killed by loud, unexpected bangs from fireworks and can be too scared to go outside if they need to. If it were law that all fireworks only go off in set times on officially recognised celebration nights then owners would be better prepared by walking and toileting pets before and after without  worrying when the next bang might be. They would also know when they need to prepare most for and make sure their pets are best looked after during these times.",
