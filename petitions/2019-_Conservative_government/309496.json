Other people may even be avoiding the news bulletins altogether.\r\nThis way, more people would see the info and warnings and it could help them to understand the severity of the situation, and the importance of adhering to the restrictions.\r\nMaybe these types of \"adverts\" (broadcasts) would get the point across better to those who are trying to find loopholes in the new measures, or ignoring them altogether.",
