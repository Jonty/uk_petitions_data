        "additional_details": "I have currently worked the last 20 weeks as a domestic on A&E helping out during these unprecedented times. Myself and other non-clinical staff have placed ourselves on the front line, and have all either put ourselves at risk of getting the disease, or have actually had it ourselves.\r\nDomestics/ Housekeepers and Portering staff are some of the main non-clinical staff who\u2019s jobs include transporting Covid Patients, cleaning their rooms and ensuring the patient gets food and drinks.",
        "background": "The Government should act to ensure that non-clinical staff are seen as valuable and essential members of the NHS. A pay rise for their actions during these difficult times would not only recognise their efforts, but also thank them for the risks they have placed themselves, and there families in.",
