If you register on an unlisted database, not only can you be fined \u00a3500 but your pet\u2019s microchip will read as unregistered when scanned.\r\n\r\nThe Government should introduce a single database of microchipped cats and dogs, and make it compulsory for chips to be checked at 1st veterinary appointment.",

There are 13 microchip databases on the government list, independent commercial enterprises, different processes & no interest in creating a central standardised register!",
