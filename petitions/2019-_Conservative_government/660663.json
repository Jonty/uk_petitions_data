We believe fundamental rights to freedom of religion, belief and security are being infringed.\r\n \r\nWhile the UK gives aid to Pakistan to promote freedom of religion or belief, we believe attacks on minorities are rapidly increasing. We think relations with Pakistan need to be reviewed urgently.\r\n",
