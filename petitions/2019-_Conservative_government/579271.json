        "additional_details": "On the 200th anniversary of the Greek War of Independence, Parliament should reflect the UK\u2019s long history of friendship with Greece by legislating for the return of 'The Parthenon Sculptures'/'Elgin Marbles'. Whatever the legalities of Lord Elgin\u2019s removal of the Marbles, there can be no denying their cultural importance to the Greek nation. The Marbles' return would be a fitting gesture of the UK\u2019s affection and respect for Greece and its people with which to mark this important anniversary.",
        "background": "Parliament should legislate to amend sections 3 and 5 of the British Museum Act 1963 in order to permit and direct the return of the Elgin Marbles from the British Museum to Greece.",
