        "additional_details": "There are increasing reports about biased teaching in schools about the British Empire which focus only on the negative. It is important that students are provided with a fair and accurate account of the empire's history, which includes its role in ending slavery and its role in defeating the Nazis in WWII. We ask the government to make it compulsory to ensure that the positives, as well as negatives, are taught by teachers who choose to implement it in their teaching.",

As well as slavery, this should include:\r\n1) How Britain spent 150 years of its existence wiping out the slave trade\r\n2) Role in defeating Nazi Germany in WWII\r\n3) The spread of democracy, rule of law & education.",
