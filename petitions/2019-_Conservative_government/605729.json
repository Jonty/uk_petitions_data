There should also be a system where for unpaid parking fees should not result to ccj. Any court letters should be recorded on delivery and visible to state that it\u2019s not a scam. Most people ignore as they are not sure if it\u2019s a scam. How are people meant to progress financially if they are given ccj over a parking fee. Some people can\u2019t afford to pay these private companies fees.",

The prices they charge are disgusting and the fact the government are allowing this to happen is disgusting to say the least.",
