        "additional_details": "By imposing the wearing of masks we could be in danger of psychologically damaging the current generation of children in schools. \r\n\r\nWe have already seen children returning home in distress as a result of the COVID measures that schools have been forced to implement. \r\n\r\n2020/2021 has been traumatic enough for children, and given the low health risk to children posed by the school environment, we feel it is only right that the wearing of masks should be a personal choice.",
        "background": "To ensure that children and teachers can thrive in the school environment, we ask the government to not make it mandatory for pupils and staff to have to wear a face mask in classrooms.\r\n\r\nPupils and staff should retain the right to chose for themselves whether wearing a face mask is necessary.",
