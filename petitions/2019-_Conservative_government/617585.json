        "additional_details": "Recent, worrying developments in the behaviour of ministers have demonstrated the weaknesses of the current Code. \r\n\r\nPrime Ministers have changed the Code at will, for example in 2015 & 2022, when requirements to follow international law and to resign upon breaking the Code were removed. \r\n\r\nThis shows a lack of accountability at the heart of the UK Executive. Through an Act, a Code could finally be enforced by Parliament and the Judiciary, making ministers accountable and protecting democracy.",
