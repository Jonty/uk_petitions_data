We believe that would be the most more coherent and democratic approach to abolish these practices.\r\n\r\nThus, where 30% or 40% of the value of the fee would benefit the citizen and the remainder would contribute to the Government fund. On the other hand, it would be an excellent means to encourage correct road traffic behaviour and culminate the unfair penalties.",
