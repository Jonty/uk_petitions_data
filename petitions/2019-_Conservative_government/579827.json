There are plenty of veterans who have serviced for 1/3 to 1/2 of Her Majesty\u2019s reign yet are not entitled to wear the medal yet they probably served longer than most of those currently serving who will be entitled to receive the medal.  The Platinum Jubilee is momentous achievement and all of Her Majesty\u2019s forces, should receive any potential award",
