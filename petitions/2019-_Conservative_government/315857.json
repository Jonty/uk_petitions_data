Not being in school is both educationally and socially detrimental to our children.\r\n\r\nThis aids those trying to juggle work and educating their children at home and the self-employed to make up for lost income due to Covid-19 over summer.\r\n\r\nRemote learning is not comparable to children being in school.\r\n\r\nThere is not a necessity for children to be at home again so long over summer after being so during the Covid-19 lockdown.",
