        "additional_details": "Not only is this accidental breeding being a problem for behaviour, the rescue centres cannot rehome dogs needing emergency help because of the extreme rise in unwanted litters. Working in an rspca charity has made me see how many owners aren\u2019t aware of the common life threatening illnesses un-neutered females can face.\r\nLet\u2019s not make a decision because it\u2019s the easiest one to place. Please support the change in dog breeding instead. \r\nBreed specific banning has proven to not be effective.",
        "background": "Let\u2019s ban the irresponsible owners who take in dogs with unknown background history and have accidental breeding. \r\nThanks to responsible breeders and owners, certain unwanted traits aren\u2019t in every specific breed\u2019s bloodstream but there is a massive rise in out of control and unplanned pregnancies.",
