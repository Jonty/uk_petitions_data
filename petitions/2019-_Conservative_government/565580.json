        "additional_details": "We feel as if the government should allow the public to do this due to the fact it is us under the most stress and strain due to all of the lockdown rules. We have had 3 tier systems (not all called tiers) and none of them have worked. Renaming a system that doesn\u2019t work, doesn\u2019t make it work. Suicide rates are as high as they have ever been. We feel as if Boris Johnson is no longer the National leader we need during these times.",
        "background": "Allow the public to choose a more suitable PM in this time of need for the country. Changing how the lockdown restrictions work and messing with people\u2019s mental health isn\u2019t fair on the public and feel as if there\u2019s a lot of candidates that can do a better job of keeping the country safe.",
