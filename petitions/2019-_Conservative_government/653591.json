Dog owners of ALL breeds would benefit from this as well as the banned type dogs who are suffering from the uneducated and un responsible owners actions. \r\nWe need to get all councils across the UK to provide spaces owners and their dogs will be safe in and give the dogs a life they deserve and some freedom within a controlled and safe environment. \r\nThere are plenty of non banned breeds who need safe and secure spaces too",
        "background": "I would like to propose a partnership within councils and landowners to create safe secure field spaces to allow dogs to have freedom to exercise in light of the incoming ban as these dogs very muscular and high energy, keeping them on leads isn\u2019t going to provide sufficient exercise for them.",
