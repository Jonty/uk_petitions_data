        "additional_details": "I have Bipolar and part of the reason why I am still here today is because of the Mental Health First Aiders in my workplace, however have been in another job with no first aiders and have ended up being sectioned. I truly believe that if there was some-one there to support and help this could have been prevented. Can you imagine how much we can stop a crisis happening and how much money can be saved due to people not going off long term sick. If we had trained Mental Health GP's this would help",
