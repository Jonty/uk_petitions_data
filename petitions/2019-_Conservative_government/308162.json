However, those that are self-employed, independent contractors and other overlooked alternate workers are not entitled to any such fair equivalent compared to that of employees \u2014 only an amount of Universal Credit equivalent to Statuary Sick Pay, barely enough compared to the 80% wages pay. Majority of these workers may already be without work due to Coronavirus, e.g. no need for services, and will have difficulties financially due to a feasible amount of support from the government, which is significantly lower than that offered to employees/permanent workers.",
