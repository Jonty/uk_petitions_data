        "additional_details": "The UK is being ill served by a system that creates limited options in party and/or individual as parliamentary representatives, and creates a mythical mandate to those who 'win' via ever reducing numbers in total. Despite this the 'result' is too often accorded a significance out of all proportion to the will of the majority of committed voters; by those invested within all Houses, and multitudes of hangers on outside, especially media. A true sense of representative vote value is needed.",
        "background": "As far as I am aware, in elections, the ballot papers offer a selection of candidates with various platforms, party affiliations, manifesto claims, etc. And they, currently, are the sole choices.\r\n\r\nIf none appeal, 'spoiled vote' is inadequate to assign to voters  dissatisfied with the choices",
