        "additional_details": "The cost of living crisis is already impacting pet ownership with many rescues, including the RSPCA, seeing a spike in pet abandonments. The RSPCA has reported an increase of 25% abandonments from the same time last year.  The charity reports that more pets are being left unneutered, not microchipped, and not receiving medical care when they need it.",
        "background": "VAT is 20% on vet treatments and medications and this can mean the difference with pets getting care or not, or having treatment delayed leading to suffering. Putting aside the moral obligation, pet owners have legal requirement to get the appropriate vet care for their pets - it is not a luxury.",
