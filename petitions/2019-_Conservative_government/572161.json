        "additional_details": "During the briefing tonight (25/1/21) the government was asked if NHS England staff would get a bonus, like Welsh and Scottish NHS staff already have. In a round about way, the government responded that they wouldn't, as it wasn't what NHS staff wanted. How would they know what we want? Of course we want a bonus! Claps don't pay the bills, and we have all worked so hard, and sacrificed so much during this incredibly difficult time, do we not deserve any reward or recognition?!",
