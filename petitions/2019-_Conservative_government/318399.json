        "additional_details": "I feel there were serious error of judgement early on on the virus epidemic that cost lives and put further people in danger. The lack of transparently of the government\u2019s decisions of when to lock down schools and commercial enterprises, the fiasco of the GOVERNMENTS response to the EU\u2019s joint procurement service for PPE. The woeful lack of urgency surrounding procurement of correct number AND  items of PPE. If people died due to ministerial decisions being delayed or the wrong decisions made.",
        "background": "We insist on an independent judge led public enquiry into the government\u2019s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to \u201cherd immunity\u201d, influence of political advisors on scientific advice, study of COBR and SAGE meetings minutes, power vacuum on government whilst PM ill and more",
