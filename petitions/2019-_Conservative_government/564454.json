The price of public transport, and especially trains, means it is often not affordable to many people, leaving those who need them most unable to access public transport. The Government should increase funding for public transport so that this becomes cheaper than private transport, and more accessible to all irrespective of income.",

This does not make sense and within the context of global warming and too much pollution which is damaging people\u2019s health. In order to reduce the number of cars on the road the Government should make public transport cheaper.",
