        "additional_details": "Because of this families are struggling especially when they are in poverty. Uniform donations are not enough and often don't have the right size for people. We feel its better if students have the option to wear what they want since it encourages expression and leaves families in poverty with extra money for food and clothes which they can wear all the time.",
        "background": "I would like it so that families shouldn't feel pressure to buy uniform as it is very expensive. It's often at least over \u00a3100 only to be worn for a year or two. The bigger sizes get more expensive which is an ongoing problem for people in the plus size community.",
