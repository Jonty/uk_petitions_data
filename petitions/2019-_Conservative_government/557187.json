        "additional_details": "Mothers who have given birth in 2020 have had to experience isolation, lack of socialisation and mental health struggles as a direct result of Lockdowns. They have been unable to attend some classes that would normally run, cutting social interaction for babies and mums - an integral part of the first year of life. 13 weeks extra pay will help mums have extra time with their baby without worrying about finances or going back to work immediately.",
