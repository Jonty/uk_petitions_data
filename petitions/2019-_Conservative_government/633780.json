We need to follow the example of countries like Spain, so sick pay is available for menstrual pain from day one.\r\n \r\n1.5 million UK women and those assigned female at birth are currently living with endometriosis with around 2 in 3 women developing at least 1 fibroid at some point in their life, causing severe pain, which is both mentally and physically challenging yet they are often expected to work, and may not be entitled to sick pay!\r\n \r\nIt is about time that we start recognising that women's health, especially severe menstrual pain, is something that can mentally devastate a women and it\u2019s something that we cannot change. We do not choose this.\r\n",
