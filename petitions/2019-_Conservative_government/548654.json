        "additional_details": "As children grow up, celebrities are adorned, Hollywood is admired, BBC aspires young lives, Idolising pop-stars, VIP figures - a child has dreams. A child will find solitude, guidance, a 6th sense when they admire to be like some famous in the future. Unfortunately, there are too many adults willing to commit hideous sex crime acts on children, women and even men. These people should not be able to profit, gander support, or be allowed to perform in the U.K, to protect our children.",
        "background": "I would like to see all registered sex offenders around the world be prevented from publishing media content, by means of vocal talent/lyrical ability, in the UK. Music has a deep connection to people and emotions are used to express. Merit by revenue should not be given to Registered Sex Offenders",
