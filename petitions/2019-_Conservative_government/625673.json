        "additional_details": "We want the Government to schedule a UK-wide referendum on current polices and targets to reduce emissions (by 2035 and 2050) and ban vehicles that are petrol and diesel (2030) or not zero emissions (2035). By having this referendum it will once and for all allow all political parties to see the direction that the majority of people in the UK wish them to take. No party, government or parliament should be able to pursue a direction of policy that is unwanted by the majority.",
        "background": "The main parties have similar polices on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and phasing out vehicles that are not zero emission, depriving the public of an opportunity to dissent. We believe these policies are unwanted, unsustainable and intrusive, and the public's view must be heard.",
