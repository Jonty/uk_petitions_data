        "additional_details": "There are poor countries across the world who have no hope of being able to afford to buy Covid vaccines, even at cost price. Even the COVAX programme will only help a small proportion of people in these poor countries. We need to help as many people as possible. By providing the vaccines we can help to reduce global health poverty. Giving the vaccine rather than money will ensure the money is spent in the way intended rather than being \"wasted\" on other things and thereby reduce corruption.",

These vaccines to \r\nbe sent to poor countries for them to vaccinate their people. This would be in addition to other programmes including \u00a3548 million committed to WHOs COVAX.",
