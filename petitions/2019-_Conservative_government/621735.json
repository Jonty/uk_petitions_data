It is a way to keep a horse without paying the usual expense responsible owners incur. The welfare of the horse is not taken into consideration. All horses should have access to shade, fresh water and company as they are very social animals.",
        "background": "Make chaining horses in fields or by the side of the road illegal. They are often tethered for weeks with no access to shade and very often without water.",

Deciding whether to take action in relation to such an offence would be a matter for the police and Crown Prosecution Service, not the Government or House of Commons."
