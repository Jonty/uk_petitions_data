Short Breaks services continue to share HAF lists with users despite this mainstream provision being inaccessible to SEND children. \r\n\r\nFor SEND children - who also benefit from year-round enrichment and socialisation -  Short Breaks direct payments are wholly inadequate, because there are so few activities that these children can access in the holidays.",

Government needs to provide meaningful support to these children throughout the year, equivalent to what is specified in the Holiday & Activities Fund provision for low income families.",
