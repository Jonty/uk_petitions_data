Students lose a significant part of their housing allowance over four years. As the affected population grows from 4 to 9 million, it will impact England's economy significantly. The government must consider these economic effects whilst they continue addressing air pollution in these areas.",
        "background": "I would like the Government or Parliament to ban petrol, diesel and hybrid vehicles entering ULEZs areas. If you really care about the air being polluted, vehicles should be stopped outright and not be charged whatever the price is.",
