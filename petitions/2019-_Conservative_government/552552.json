        "additional_details": "Law enforcement should remain impartial - the UK is a very diverse country with a multitude of different races so it is vital that our police force have a suitable awareness of unconscious racial bias to lessen the effects of discrimination within our society and ensure members of the public feel safer. It is equally important to confirm that individuals in the police force aren\u2019t suffering from any mental conditions which may negatively affect their performance or role as a police officer.",
        "background": "Psychological exams and implicit racial bias training for those looking to join and currently in the UK police force should be made a compulsory measure. Racial training can ensure police officers are aware of implicit bias and psychological exams can determine one\u2019s suitability for the job.",
