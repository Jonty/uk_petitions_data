        "additional_details": "By allowing a temporary ceasement of rental clauses prohibiting pets during the Covid-19 crisis this will result in individuals renting, who are in a position to do so, short-term foster animals. This will reduce mental health and anxiety disorders associated with lone working and will increase animal welfare and reduce the strain on already overburdened animal shelters as more animals are donated. This is a change that will have a significant impact on mental health & animal welfare.",

During this time the number of animals in rescue shelters will  increase as will mental health disorders.
