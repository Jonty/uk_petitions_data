        "action": "I would like you to open Hair salons before July.",
        "additional_details": "The reasons why I want to start this petition is because the government are contemplating to let sports fixtures open behind closed doors at the start of June, but a great deal of sporting games are close contact or are contact sports, so how can you authorise for sports fixtures to go ahead when you can not social distance the players 2 metres apart. So why can't hair salons open before July, when they can operate social distancing measures to keep them selves safe and their customers safe.",
        "background": "I would like the government to open hair salons at the same time they allow the non essential retail industry to open (1st June). The majority of hair salons are small sole trader businesses that are finding it hard to survive. Also hair salons come under retail and not hospitality sector.",
