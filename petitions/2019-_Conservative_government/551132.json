Swim England have stated that 44 swimming clubs in total have had substantial price rises by one provider alone.\r\n \r\nAmateur swimming is under threat. Swimming benefits young people in so many ways, from tackling obesity to improving mental health. For example, according to Swim England, swimming saves the NHS \u00a3357m every year. It would be a monumental shame if swimming became one of leisure\u2019s \u2018forgotten activities\u2019. Who is going to win gold medals for Great Britain at the Olympics if swimming is gone?\r\n \r\nPlease let us keep swimming, by supporting swimming clubs during Covid-19.",
