        "additional_details": "The age at which the NHS pension can be claimed should not be linked to the state pension age, and instead should be set at a realistic age based on when staff are able to physically and emotionally fulfil this role.\r\n\r\nAs a student nurse starting her career in 1989 I was given a pension age of 55. With the pension changes in 2015 my pension age increased by 12 years. Fortunately due to the  McCloud judgement I am now in a position to claim all but 3 years of my pension at age 55. However, without this judgement I could not have continued to work as an NHS nurse until age 67/68.  The UK already has a recruitment and retention problem with nurses which is not helped by having an unrealistic NHS retirement age.\r\n",
        "background": "NHS nurses with a pension in the 2015 section can only claim their NHS pension when they reach state pension age (currently 67). Nursing is a physically challenging job and we believe a retirement age of 67 isn\u2019t fair.",
