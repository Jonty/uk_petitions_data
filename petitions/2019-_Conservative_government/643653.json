        "additional_details": "Since 2018 the UK is one of the only countries to still do this, we look outdated and very out of touch. We need to recognise that although the change is the small, the impact is huge on certain individuals and has become more of a hindrance than a help eg shift workers, children's sleep patterns etc etc",
        "background": "Vote to stop the changing of the clocks as we have moved on in technology and no longer need to do this. More modern technology to allow farming activities to continue whatever the weather or lighting. The changes messes with shift work, sleep patterns and is unhelpful and totally unnecessary.",
