        "additional_details": "The world is trying to reduce its use of single-use plastic, and the British public are now charged for single-use carrier bags in supermarkets. However on an almost daily basis some charities post single-use plastic bags through people's doors, which are unsolicited. This is bad for the environment and a risk to pets.\r\n \r\nThis is at odds with the charge on plastic bags in supermarkets and should be addressed, both to reduce nuisance mail and to protect the environment.",
        "background": "The Government should prohibit the delivery of plastic bags, where these have not been requested. Many charities bulk mail plastic bags, for use to give donations, to households across the country. This contributes to harm against the environment, and can also be a risk to pets.",
