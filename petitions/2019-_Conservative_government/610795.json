        "additional_details": "The current 2-hour limit on working on a school day is too restrictive. Many employers require staff work at least three-hour shifts. For example, lifeguard jobs for young people often consist of 3 hours at 4pm-7pm. This should not affect education because its out of school hours. And with the continued 12 hour weekly limit school children will not be working everyday. A three-hour shift could also be finished before the 7pm deadline. Allowing an extra hour shouldn't make any difference.",
        "background": "Allow 16s and over to work 3 hours on a school day, rather than the current 2. The current maximum of 12 hours a week during term time should continue, so they can't work every day. Allowing them to work 3 hours would increase the range of shifts they can do, and increase opportunities for work.",
