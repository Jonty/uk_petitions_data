        "additional_details": "This petition aims to fight age discrimination against women who wish to start a family later in life. The current limit is 42, which does not consider the increasing number of women who choose to delay motherhood. The decline in birth rates is also a concern in the UK, and this petition aims to address this by supporting women who want to raise a family later in life. By removing the age limit, women would have more control over their reproductive choices and would not be forced to choose between having a career and starting a family. This would create a more equitable society and provide equal opportunities for women of all ages to start a family.",
        "background": "Fertility treatment on the NHS should be funded for women aged over 42 to support delayed family planning. Women used to have children in their early 20s. Nowadays, many women are now waiting until their late 30s or even their 40s to start a family.",
