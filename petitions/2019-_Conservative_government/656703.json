        "additional_details": "We are concerned by proposals from some that the State Pension age will need to be increased to 71, meaning many people have to stay in work for more than 50 years before becoming entitled to a State Pension. The older generation should be allowed to enjoy the time they have left in peace and comfort after giving much of their lives to employment. Please spare a thought for them and commit to not increasing the State Pension age.",
