        "additional_details": "It would be safer for the prisoners and for the prison staff. The prisoners are doing a greater punishment as they are confined to their cells and not even aloud out to exercise.  Meals are being missed. Prisoners are dying from this! 3 prisoners have died in the UK so far from Coronavirus. Imagine what this will be doing to their mental health as-well as the worry of their loved ones. Less prisoners in prisons would take pressures off prison staff.",
        "background": "Release all UK prisoners that are doing short sentences of 6months or less not just the ones who have 2 months left! And let them self isolate at home with their loved ones. This is a pandemic and lives are being lost. This is effecting the prisoners mental health aswell as the families.",
