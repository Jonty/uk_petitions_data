A benefit to station staff so they know who they are in the event of an security alert.\r\n\r\nSpotters would scan their card at the barriers and be able to access the platforms. The card would only be used to practise trainspotting and not valid for train travel.\r\n\r\nThey\u2019ll be faced with security checks to ensure that they\u2019re not on a police watchdog or have a criminal record. Their cards would be cancelled as they maybe a threat to the Public.",
        "background": "Trainspotting is a hobby which is open to all ages & only requires a notebook & a pencil, or a camera to record photos/videos of trains.\r\nAt some stations there are ticket barriers. This means spotters are encountering these to pursue the hobby. If a railcard was introduced they\u2019ll be able to this.",
