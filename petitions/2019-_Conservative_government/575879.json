Children and schools will also benefit from visiting these places which are hard to reach by foot. All volunteers from every age or walks of life can help maintain pathways, planting and supervising the types of insects we are attracting, helping bring back endangered species. They should be open parks for all creatures to enjoy. Greener towns.",
