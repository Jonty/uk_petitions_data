It is affecting all Scottish competitions including British Showjumping, British Eventing and British Dressage. Also it is causing financial strain on riding schools, equestrian centres that rely on the income coming in for lessons and events. In England it has resumed with social distancing in place , we would ask for this to be able to resume in Scotland aswell to help the equestrian businesses start earning again after months of hardship.",
