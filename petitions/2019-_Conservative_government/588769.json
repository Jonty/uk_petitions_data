        "additional_details": "The government's concern is about user safety, primarily children's safety. However, it should be up to parents to protect their children from potentially harmful content online, not the government. The government is not responsible for everything.\r\n\r\nMost worrying is the government's intention to target 'disinformation' campaigns. To quote J S Mill:\r\n\"We can never be sure that the opinion we are endeavouring to stifle is a false opinion; and if we were sure, stifling it would be an evil still.\"",
        "background": "We believe the bill will (1) over-regulate the activities of content providers online which will stifle innovation and (2) lead to more censorship which will allow governments and corporations more control of public opinion and stifle freedom of thought. The entire bill should be scrapped.",
