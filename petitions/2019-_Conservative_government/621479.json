        "action": "Cap Fuel costs to 4% annually",
        "additional_details": "We need to act to prevent deaths from hypothermia and possibly hyperthermia. Furthermore people want to overload the grid to cut out circuits. Again this could lead to deaths as some people have life saving equipment at home plus no fuel means no heat or cooking leading to  illness and deaths from hypothermia during winter. Others may resort to more dangerous methods of cutting fuel costs. If they don't know what they're doing this would endanger their neighbours & community.",
        "background": "The energy companies profit hugely whilst we struggle to meet fuel costs. Please cap inflation to help out. At this time the shareholders need to accept smaller gains. The French government has capped the price rises to 4% during this crisis. Maybe we could cap to 6%.",
