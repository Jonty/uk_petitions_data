This is due to the traumatic nature of having to, not only relive their experiences in court, but face being questioned and challenged over what happened. This is a very traumatic experience and can lead to life long mental health issues. Having to return to court, for any reason, has the potential to be triggering and being back all the emotions and fears of not only being raped but being questioned in court.",
