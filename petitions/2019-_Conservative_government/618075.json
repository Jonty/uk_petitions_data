        "additional_details": "For survivors, their evidence in court is referred to as the \u2018second rape\u2019. This is due to the traumatic nature of having to, not only relive their experiences in court, but face being questioned and challenged over what happened. This is a very traumatic experience and can lead to life long mental health issues. Having to return to court, for any reason, has the potential to be triggering and being back all the emotions and fears of not only being raped but being questioned in court.",
        "background": "For the government to change the laws in regards to jury service so that a survivor of domestic violence or sexual violence, who has been through the court system, is automatically excused for life without the need to apply to the courts.",
