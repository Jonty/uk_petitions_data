        "additional_details": "Because we have laws in this country and uae has half a british population living there, also animals deserve to not suffer- they are domesticated. Cats and dogs are being bred and thrown away left to die on the streets of UAE, the rescuers are overwhelmed in their own houses not being able to afford to live. The animal cruelty is impacting everyone includign tourists, the numbers are rising in population, there is no neuturing schemes or animal adoption centres that can support. We need change.",
        "background": "I want to change and save the lives of animals in the UAE, I want the UK goverment to connect with the UAE goverment to raise awareness and make a positive life changing impact for the animals in need. Together we can reference the animal laws and rights we have in the UK to educate their goverment.",
