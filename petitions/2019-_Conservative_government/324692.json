        "additional_details": "Racism is still an important and rife issue in the UK today and education is the best tool to combat that. Teaching the youth about injustices that black people faced will help our future generations tackle racism, that still exists in covert ways. This petition has been inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement and the systemic and covert racism that many black people continue to face in the 21st century.",
        "background": "We would like to set black history into the British curriculum to make our youth more aware of Black British history and its consequences in today's society. The school curriculum today almost completely disregards the effects of colonialism and politicianry in the UK.",
