It can cause decades of trauma, requiring years of therapy to unpack and tackle. \r\n\r\nChild hitting is an illegal practice in Wales and Scotland. England should follow suit to protect its youth.\r\n\r\nChildren deserve the right to be protected from the physical and mental harm that arises from hitting.",
