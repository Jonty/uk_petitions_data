        "additional_details": "The United Kingdom is the place where a lot of EU students would love to study, a lot of them have big ambitions and are very talented. Unfortunately due to coming changes they will not be able to afford the costs with no help from Student Finance England.\r\n\r\nTo keep UK great and the high level of professionals, the Government should grant EU students to have \"home fee status\" if they held valid Pre-Settled or Settled Status before 1 August 2021 to make it fair to those who already are settled in UK",
        "background": "Due to coming Brexit and changes to funding on courses which start on or after the 1 August 2021, I want the Government to make EU students with Pre-Settled or Settled Status to be eligible for \"home fee status\", under-postgraduate and further education financial support from Student Finance England",
