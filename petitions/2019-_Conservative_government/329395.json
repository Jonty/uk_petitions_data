        "additional_details": "I ask Ofqual and all exam boards responsible for this decision to justify how these grades are \u2018generous\u2019 when final examination grades are almost always higher than grades obtained throughout the school year not to mention the majority of year11 & 13 students were unable to finish their courses due to the rapid spread of COVID-19. We ask Boris Johnson not to adopt this decision that could undo the effort and ruin the futures that millions of students have worked tirelessly for.",
