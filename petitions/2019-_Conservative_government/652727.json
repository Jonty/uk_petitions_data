        "action": "Re-consider the proposal to increase minimum income threshold for family visas.",
        "additional_details": "The proposed measures is highly likely to impact the most vulnerable people in society. Those on lower incomes and single income earning households. There is a significant risk of families being split up because it will be impossible for an household to meet the minimum income threshold. The proposal suggests that only the wealthy are permitted to marry a foreign spouse which is morally wrong & unjust. The Government must reconsider to prevent families from being adversely affected.",
        "background": "The Government must reconsider it's proposal to increase the minimum income threshold for family visas from \u00a318,600 to \u00a338,700. The proposal should be paused pending an in depth review of it's impacts on those families that could be severely impacted by this measure.",
