        "additional_details": "We think the industry is putting profit before safety. Vulnerable customers, often lacking digital skills, are losing access to traditional landlines despite serious concerns over the reliability of the new system, lack of emergency back-up, and potential costs for households. Some alarms and telecare systems are incompatible with the new system. Silver Voices and Digital Poverty Alliance want the two systems to work in parallel for at least five years so that vulnerable people are not forced to transfer prematurely. ",
        "background": "The Government should work with Ofcom & the major telecom suppliers to review the timetable for the switch to digital telephone lines. We believe that doing so by 2025 is totally unrealistic if vulnerable customers are to be protected. The new internet-based system should be phased in over 5+ years.",
