        "additional_details": "I believe all bus drivers in the UK should have the right to drive in bus lanes using their personal vehicles whether they're working on the day off simply because we are bus drivers the bus lane belongs to us.\r\n\r\n I believe this is our rights as we are already bus drivers getting to work or home after work in the traffic sometimes can take hours but if we can freely use the bus lane we can cut time therefore I get to work earlier or home quicker to our families",
        "background": "I would like the government and parliament to discuss allowing all UK bus drivers to use bus lanes freely all year around including holiday bank holiday ect",
