        "additional_details": "Currently there's no regulator overseeing heat networks, so customers don't have the rights standard gas and electricity customers have.\r\n You can't switch supplier if you're unhappy with the service or price. Providers are usually contracted to supply a site for 25 years or more, there's little incentive to offer a deal right for customers.\r\nIt is vital the government acts quickly to keeps to its promise to regulate heat networks and give customers the rights they need during this energy crisis",
        "background": "The Government promised to bring in new regulation to oversee heat networks and ensure  customers get the same rights as other energy customers - but there's no sign of it yet.\r\nThis legislation is needed urgently, especially with today's energy price crisis.",
