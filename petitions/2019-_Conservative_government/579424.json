        "action": "Urgently review the Sovereign Grant to support the recovery of the UK economy.",
        "additional_details": "Over the last year the Royal Family have had lower expenditure and outgoings on account of reduced public duties and engagements. Ordinary households have had to manage on lower incomes. Going forward, many sectors are facing a pay freeze. It will take many years to recover and the government need to review all areas of spending.\r\n\r\nI am certain Her Majesty would want to do play her part in the recovery and would accept that a review and reduction of the Sovereign Grant is wholly reasonable.",
        "background": "A sensible reduction in Sovereign Grant would mean money saved and redirected to other areas of the economy, including  the NHS, education and social care. A clawback of Sovereign Grant for the last 12 months and a freeze going forward is therefore fully justified.  Finances need to be prioritised.",
