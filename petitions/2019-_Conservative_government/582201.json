If a woman pretended to be on the pill then the man would not have consented to sexual intercourse. Women should be accountable for these crimes.\r\n\r\nMen need justice too!",
        "background": "Spurgling is the female equivalent of Stealthing. It is defined as: where a woman pretends to be on the pill. If a man removes a condom during sex then this negates a woman's consent. So, the same should be said of a woman who pretends to be on the pill because, a man would not have consented to sex",
