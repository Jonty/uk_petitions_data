        "additional_details": "A \u00a33.40 pack of pads has 13 inside, which depending on the girl could cover her per month (excluding the need of night-time pads). A normal cycle happens every month, 12 x \u00a33.40 is \u00a340.80 per year for one woman. But what happens if she has two teenage daughters? That price goes up to \u00a3122.40 per year. But what if she is only earning minimum wage? Her already low salary deflates to \u00a314957.60 from \u00a315080. If her period ends at 50, she will be paying \u00a32000 for sanitary products just for herself.",
        "background": "I want the Government to make pads and tampons free to all women and girls in the UK. I believe it is unfair and sexist to make females pay an average of \u00a32.80 for tampons/pads in the UK.",
