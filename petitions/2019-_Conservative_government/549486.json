        "additional_details": "I would like this to be deliberated due to months of online working without the face to face support and guidance of teachers. Myself and many others are worried for our progression this academic year, especially concerning exam results as we will have to over compensate for the gaps in our knowledge. Exams are stressful enough without the added pressure due to a lack of confidence in our knowledge.",
        "background": "During lockdown year 12\u2019s had no choice but to study from home, creating huge gaps in knowledge. I am asking that year 12 content is not focussed on and for exams to be centred around topics studied in year 13, where students will receive face to face learning.",
