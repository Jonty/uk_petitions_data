        "additional_details": "Today (20/04/21) the government announced a further cut of 78% to the UK's carbon emissions compared to 1990s levels. Yet with every new target announced and scheme introduced to cut emissions, very little seems to be said about actually taking CO2 out of the atmosphere. That is why I and so many others wish to see the government embark on a massive nation wide tree planting scheme, and Parliament legislating for it. Trees are a crucial tool in adsorbing and sequestrating CO2, lets use them!",
