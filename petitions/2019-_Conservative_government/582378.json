        "additional_details": "Parliament needs to intervene in the Sewell Report as it is of such central importance to race relations in the country - and by extension to peace, stability and progress in our communities.\r\nFurther, this report has brought the UK government into disrepute.\r\nIt therefore needs to be intervened upon. Where found to be in breach of procedural compliance in relation to the role and job of a commission, eg, omissions and errors, these need to be corrected and the report revoked and withdrawn.",
        "background": "There has been national outrage against the Sewell Report, with wide ranging, wholesale deconstruction of findings and conclusions, as well as named contributors either disassociating themselves or asserting that they had not been properly consulted. Evidence from others has been withheld.",
