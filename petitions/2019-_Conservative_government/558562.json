        "additional_details": "Cancelling driving tests and lessons is affecting both students and instructor\u2019s mental health, students ability to find employment and instructors and students ability to earn a wage. Schools and universities are allowed to remain open where social distancing cannot always be facilitated and students are not required to wear masks at all times. Driving lessons and tests have been made safe with PPE and are only one hour long, shared by two individuals. The risk of COVID-19 transmission is minor",
        "background": "Driving tests and lessons are a form of education and optional to partake in unlike school and university. Students and teachers can choose to participate at their own risk. Tests and lessons have been cancelled during the November 2020 lockdown and we are asking you to reinstate them.",
