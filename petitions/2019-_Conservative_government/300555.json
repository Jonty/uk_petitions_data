This virus is mutating, reactivating and not only affecting the elderly. The current death rate is 4 %, with admissions into Intensive Care at 10 %, but still early days. Without extreme measures we will see considerable loss of life not only from COVID-19, but those who require emergency treatment from other life threatening conditions.",
