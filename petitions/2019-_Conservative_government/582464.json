        "additional_details": "I want the government to do this because pets can escape from even secure environments and even if the owner realised the pet had escaped straight away it could be too late. If a pet is injured by a vehicle the vet bill can be quite costly which isn't fair on the owner if they don't realise their pet has escaped from their home and if the pet was to die not only do they lose their pet that could even be there lifeline but they also have to pay quite abit of money to cremate the pet",
        "background": "I believe it should be made a criminal offence to knock down someone's pet and drive away ie hit and run of a pet. If the pet was to accidentally to escape from their home or garden and someone hits the pet with their vehicle they should pay half of the vet bill if not the full vet bill.",
