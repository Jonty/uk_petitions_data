        "additional_details": "These off-patent, non-branded (generic) medicines can be made very cheaply but the NHS often has to pay very high prices for them because some companies are \u201cprice gouging\u201d (http://gouge.co.uk). The CMA has fined some companies, but several years too late, and hospitals can be forced to cut other services to pay for essential drugs. Introducing competition could help reverse this, increase employment in the UK, and guarantee a secure supply of these drugs (particularly important post-Brexit).",
