Up to 70% of Lebanon\u2019s economic output may be effected. Over 150 have been killed. 80% of the Lira\u2019s value has been lost since October, Silos of wheat and grain have been destroyed worsening the country\u2019s famine with toxic nitric acid in the air. We urge the British government to show compassion and help our Lebanese counterparts.",
        "background": "Much of Lebanon\u2019s crucial Beirut port has been completely decimated, the country had already been in a deep famine and economic crisis. This tragedy has plunged 300,000 people into homelessness and injured many thousands. Lebanon\u2019s healthcare system is completely overwhelmed and needs urgent help!",
