        "additional_details": "There are currently too many barriers restricting children and young people\u2019s access to mental health support. CAMHS lacks the capacity to meet demand at the level at which it is needed and in a timely manner. In addition, we believe there is too much bureaucracy and form-filling, restricting school staff\u2019s ability to secure mental health support for children quickly\u2014particularly at the early stage before a child reaches crisis. Thirdly, we believe CAMHS doesn't always reach, or meet needs of, ethnically diverse and multi-faith communities, owing to social stigma about going \u201coutside\u201d home or school for support, particularly mental health support.",
        "background": "Each school needs full-time qualified counsellors. Taking action to tackle anxieties and mental health issues early may improve school attendance. I think the Government is too reliant on unqualified practitioners and is relying on the charitable sector to provide support in schools.",
