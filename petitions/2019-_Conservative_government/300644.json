        "additional_details": "The United Kingdom has a justice system which aims to protect people and property. In most cases people regard their pets as members of their family, therefore they shall be entitled to rights similar to those of humans. Tougher sentences should be implemented for those who neglect/abuse animals as animals cannot defend themselves and do not have the mental capacity to understand why they are subject to neglect/attack, this therefore makes them vulnerable.",
        "background": "Those convicted of animal abuse or neglect shall receive tougher sentences. A compulsory lifetime ban for neglect/abuse and an unlimited fine and a maximum of 10 years imprisonment for neglect/abuse resulting in grievous bodily harm/death of an animal in their care.",
