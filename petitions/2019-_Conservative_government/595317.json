        "action": "Include those Afghan nationals trained in the UK as Cat 1 under the ARAP.",
        "additional_details": "Afghan nationals trained in UK military establishments have taken on great personal risk whilst committing to UK values overseas. Training alongside British Soldiers and Officers they have made invaluable contributions to UK efforts in Afghanistan. \r\n\r\nDue to the changing situation in Afghanistan these individuals are currently at very high risk. Many have already received threats to their safety. \r\n\r\nWe must honour the same values they have embodied by allowing them to seek refuge in the UK.",
        "background": "The Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP) offers relocation or other assistance to Locally Employed Staff in Afghanistan. \r\n\r\nThis policy does not extend to those Afghan nationals trained in the UK. We are petitioning to include them into the ARAP policy, as Cat 1, at risk individuals.",
