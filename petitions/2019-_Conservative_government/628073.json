        "action": "Stop Equality Act 2010 change of gender to biological sex: keep trans folk safe.",
        "additional_details": "Our lives should be seen as valid, our rights should not up for debate, we deserve not to be erased. The toilet fiasco - that trans women shouldn't use womens' toilets - is comparable to 60s US: black and white people couldn't use the same toilets because whites might 'catch diseases' and 'jeopardise their safety.' Trans people no longer feel safe in this country (https://www.stophateuk.org/about-hate-crime/transgender-hate/). Sunak's policy is not about safety of \r\n cis women, but trans erasure.",
        "background": "I want Parliament to debate this issue and vote to block Rishi Sunak's proposed amendments of the Equality Act 2010. Gender identity should be marked explicitly as a protected characteristic within the Equality Act.",
