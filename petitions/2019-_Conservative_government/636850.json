        "action": "Prevent schools from \"outing\" transgender students to their parents",
        "additional_details": "We want this to be ensured because it is dangerous to transgender students. To many students, a school is a safe place where struggles with identity can be accommodated and supported. Many students will choose not to tell their parents until they are ready because their household is unsupportive and may cause harm to them as a result of that identity. It should be the decision of the student to gauge that, not a member of staff at a school, unaware of the student's living conditions.",
        "background": "We want to ensure the government does not provide guidance to schools on how to \"out\" a transgender child to their parents. Allowing a child to make a judgement on coming out to their parents, based on their own perceptions of their living situation.",
