        "additional_details": "On Dec 14th 2020, Nadhim Zahawi MP said 'there are no plans for vaccine passports'. He continues to deny the Government has plans despite reports that people who have received the Covid-19 vaccine will be offered a certificate proving they have been vaccinated as part of a government-funded trial.\r\nThe Government must be completely clear to the public about the use of vaccine certificates& their intentions, which will undoubtedly affect societal cohesion & effect the economic recovery of Great Britain this year & into 2022.",
        "background": "We want the Government to commit to not rolling out any e-vaccination status/immunity certificate to the British public. Such certificates could be used to restrict the rights of people who have refused a Covid-19 vaccine, which would be unacceptable & against our human rights.",
