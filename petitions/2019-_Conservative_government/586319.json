We fully understand that the media have freedom of press to report on whatever they choose and that media is the way to communicate/inform citizens on current affairs that affect them personally or indirectly, but we feel as if there is a way to inform people on current affairs without damaging the lives of the subjects of the articles.",

We would like to ask that you take an interest in further restricting the press\u2019 reach and help us to prevent damage to the mental health of the subjects of their stories",
