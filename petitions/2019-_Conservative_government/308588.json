        "background": "Currently NHS staff (Doctors, Nurses, Allied health care practitioners etc) are either ineligible or have to pay extremely high prices to park at the hospitals where we work.\r\n\r\nIn these exceptional times where we will be working long antisocial hours free parking should be available to NHS staff.",
