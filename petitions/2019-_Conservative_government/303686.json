        "additional_details": "It is now clear that we face a national emergency in meeting the challenges of the Covid 19 virus, and all unnecessarily distractions should be removed forthwith. The crisis is likely to last at least a year. It is vital that we stick with the status quo during that time. The Government and its agencies need  to concentrate all their effort on dealing with the pandemic and it\u2019s economic and social impacts.",
        "background": "In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, industry commerce and state services do not need the additional uncertainty of leaving the EU single market and customs union at this time. We therefore ask that The Government immediately request an extension of the transitional period into 31.12.21.",
