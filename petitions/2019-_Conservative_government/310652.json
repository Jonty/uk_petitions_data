        "additional_details": "The General Pharmaceutical Council has wrongly denied many pre registration pharmacists from practicing in light of COVID-19. This is a partition to put pressure on the council to reconsider their stance on this and offer an alternative way of assessing the pre registration students in a time of a global crisis. This can be done through completed competencies, approval to practice from tutors and completion of the 52 week training period, furthermore if need be an additional internal assessment.",
        "background": "The Pre-Registration Pharmacy assessment has been cancelled denying more than 3000 potential Pharmacists into the healthcare system this year. The exam was never a normality and introduced in the last decade and a half meaning as it stands many Pharmacists practice without sitting it.",
