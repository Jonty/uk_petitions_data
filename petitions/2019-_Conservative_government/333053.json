        "action": "Reverse the decision of mandating calorie labels in restaurants and takeaways",
        "additional_details": "The move from the government to publish calorie counting endangers millions of people's mental health- not just those that suffer from eating disorders, by promoting the idea of food as transactional. Eating disorders have been exacerbated by COVID, illustrated by a 73% rise in contact with the charity BEAT. This will only paradoxically create unhealthy relationships with food in wider society and evoke guilt and shame in a society where diet culture is rampant and mental health is underfunded.",
        "background": "We would like the government to reverse the decision of publishing calories in restaurants, cafes and takeaways. This is an incredibly damaging decision for everyone, especially those who suffer from eating disorders and perpetuates both the idea of obsessive calorie counting and unhealthy habits.",
