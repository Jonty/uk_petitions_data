        "additional_details": "First time buyers, often encouraged by government \u2019help to buy\u2019 schemes are trapped into hefty, annual management fees controlled entirely by housing developers. Some charge annual fees of \u00a3150, others near Exeter - a hefty \u00a3250! Buyers have no choice but to sign up for this in their deeds and young couples who have worked hard to afford their house deposit are forced to pay the costs of all maintenance. Freehold should mean no estate maintenance costs-BAN THIS IMMORAL PRACTICE IMMEDIATELY!",
        "background": "Stop local authorities from allowing new housing developments, but saving money by not adopting the new roads and allowing developers to force the house buyers to cover the maintenance costs themselves  - costs that should be covered by their council taxes. BAN THIS COVERT, UNFAIR PRACTICE NOW!",
