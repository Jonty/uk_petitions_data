        "additional_details": "Flashing is a known trait of a sexual predator and one of the first signs of a potential rapist. Flashing, virtually, can build their confidence in sexual perpetrations. When the offender sends these non-consensual photos, when not asked for by the recipient, it is identical to flashing someone in public. If they get a criminal offence on record for this it could prevent them from developing into involvement in worse sexual offences. Flashing is a sexual offence, so why is it normalised when virtual?",

Some containing captions like, \"I know you want it\", and \"You can't handle this\". This is a duplication of one pulling their trousers down in public, and uttering these phrases, otherwise known as flashing.",
