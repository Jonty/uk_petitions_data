This has allowed many to save money, catch up on sleep, and spend more time with their families.\r\n \r\nReduced activity, particularly commuting, resulting from coronavirus has had substantial environmental benefits. Air quality has improved dramatically in many areas, and much wildlife has been able to flourish.\r\n \r\nThis is the best time to make permanent changes and move forward.",
