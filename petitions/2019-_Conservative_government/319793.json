        "additional_details": "The coronavirus outbreak, and associated restrictions on movement, has resulted in large numbers of people working from home. This has allowed many to save money, catch up on sleep, and spend more time with their families.\r\n \r\nReduced activity, particularly commuting, resulting from coronavirus has had substantial environmental benefits. Air quality has improved dramatically in many areas, and much wildlife has been able to flourish.\r\n \r\nThis is the best time to make permanent changes and move forward.",
        "background": "The Government should require all workers to work from home unless they are unable to do so. People can be significantly healthier and happier working from home, and banning all unnecessary travel to work should benefit both the environment and our mental health.",
