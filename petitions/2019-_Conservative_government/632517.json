        "additional_details": "In too many cases parents struggle to get local authorities to assess their child  for an EHC plan, or are unable to provide the evidence local authorities want - in part because of long waiting times to access children and young people's mental health services.\r\n \r\nEvery child deserves an education, but until the needs of all children are quickly and correctly identified, this will not happen. A Government review could identify failures in current practice, and measures to ensure that support for children with special educational needs is provided in a timely manner.\r\n",
        "background": "We want the Government to review how local authorities support children with special educational needs. This should include how assessments for EHC plans are conducted, and support for children waiting to be assessed. We believe too many SEN children are not getting the support they need.",
