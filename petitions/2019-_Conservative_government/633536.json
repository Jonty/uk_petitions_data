        "additional_details": "I recently lost my cat in a road collision, Athena, who was my best friend. She was a stray from Cyprus when I found her back in 2019. She was hit by a driver who was speeding significantly in what was a 30mph road. They didn\u2019t stop and left her to die on the side of the road. Hopefully by creating this law it will encourage people to drive more safely as well as be more compassionate towards animals.",
