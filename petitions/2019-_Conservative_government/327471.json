A dog, like a child, is totally dependent on it\u2019s owner and their choices. Choosing to hurt the dog to correct it when there are other options must be considered inhumane. Please consider if, what amounts to torture of a dog, is acceptable in our society and should it be outlawed under the Animal Welfare Act",
        "background": "These collars are designed to control dogs by inflicting pain. There are many painless alternatives which makes this practice outdated. Please ban choke and pronged collars because their use can cause harm and is cruel and unnecessary punishment.",
