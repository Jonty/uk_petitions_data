        "additional_details": "I want this to happen because I see homeless people begging for money and as food rises like meal deals it becomes a struggle to many people . This act could save people from starving as well as being in poverty. This simple act can be a struggle however would lead to more people buying meal deals making it fair to other companies who do not like the idea. If this is done then we can ensure that it will save many homeless people of the british population from losing out on everyday needed meals.",
        "background": "In the recent years meal deals have become overpriced because of cost of living crisis. This has led to people not being able to afford the cost of meal deals. Example: Tesco in 2022 had meal deals for \u00a33 however after the cost of living rose, tesco meals also rose to a large price of \u00a33.90.",
