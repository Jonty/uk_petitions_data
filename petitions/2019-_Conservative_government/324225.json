        "action": "Reform curriculum in schools to cover more on black British history & literature",
        "additional_details": "With the Black Lives Matter movement gaining support globally, it's time to reform how future generations learn about these issues. From the baby boomers down to Gen-Zers, many have admitted to a lack of understanding on issues affecting BAME communities. History and English classes should be where children are taught this and much sooner. Introduce more books addressing topics affecting BAME communities, written by BAME authors, and teach about black British history in-depth outside of October.",
        "background": "Black history in schools is dominated by American history, focusing on the Civil Rights movement and its activists. Little is said for British abolitions, Notting Hill Carnival's origins, or the impact of key politicians on changing Britain. More literature from black authors is also widely needed.",
