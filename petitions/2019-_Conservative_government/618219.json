        "additional_details": "I feel like this is a necessary change as the cost of living is affecting EVERYONE, especially those who are struggling to heat their homes and and find a meal for the day.\r\n\r\nThose who commute to their place of work and small business owners are reliant on fuel, and may have no alternative.\r\n\r\nWith this system, the government can still have sustainable income with tax and fuel duty. This will also help encourage fuel companies to keep their prices down when pricing their petrol and diesel.",
        "background": "A variable tax model will ensure that the price of fuel doesn't change so that when fuel prices soar like they have, consumers don't feel like they're exploited.\r\n\r\nFor example, when the price of fuel rises, lower the tax rate. When the price goes down, raise the taxes so that prices are fixed.",

For example, it's not clear what you would want to happen if the cost of fuel was higher than the \"fixed price\" you want to be set. It's also not clear what price you want the Government to seek to maintain.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
