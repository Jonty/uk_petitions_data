        "additional_details": "I am a self employed wedding photographer. In August 2019, I made the decision to leave my PAYE job as my business was excelling.\r\n\r\nFor 1 year and 2 months, I have been 100% reliant on my self-employed income. I, and many others falling through the same gap, are therefore 'most reliant on self-employment income'. \r\n\r\nWe are requesting a change in the eligibility or a new grant to assist those who can prove they left PAYE prior to the pandemic. You hold this information. Please use it to support us.",
        "background": "The SEISS requires trading profits to be at least equal to non-trading income. This is 'to ensure it is targeted at those who are most reliant on self-employment income.'\r\n\r\nHowever, thousands are excluded who ARE fully reliant on self employment income, after leaving PAYE jobs prior to UK lockdown.",
