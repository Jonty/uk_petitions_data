        "action": "Reduce the residential speed limit to 20mph in England",
        "additional_details": "89% of pedestrian and 83% of cyclist casualties happen on urban roads. Slower speeds mean fewer collisions and a lower risk of fatal injury. Research has shown that a 1mph reduction in average speed can reduce collision frequency by 6%.\r\n \r\nIf a pedestrian is hit by a vehicle at 20mph, they are far more likely to survive than if they had been hit by a vehicle travelling at 30mph.\r\n \r\nLower speeds mean fewer particulates and greenhouse gases emitted, therefore fewer negative air quality impacts.",
        "background": "The Welsh parliament, Senedd Cymru, have recently backed plans to reduce the speed limit in residential areas to 20mph in Wales and we ask that residential speed limits across England are reduced to 20mph too to save lives and improve the quality of life for people in residential areas.",
