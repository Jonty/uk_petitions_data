        "additional_details": "As it stands, if there is equal day-to-day care for two or more children, each parent can receive Child Benefit in respect of at least one child. However, if there is only one qualifying child, only one parent can claim Child Benefit. Child Benefit also can't be split equally if there are an odd number of children. I think this is extremely outdated and does not reflect a common approach to parenting, where parents share the day-to-day care of a child equally.",
