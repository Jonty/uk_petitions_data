        "additional_details": "Parliament should amend the Blue Badge process so that centenarians do not have to make a case for eligibility for a badge based on disabilities. The process requires private information to be gathered and submitted. This can mean asking busy GP surgeries to provide lists of medications. It can also mean the individual having to disclose private medical information to strangers (carers or advisors). The process could be improved, cheaply, by making blue badges automatically available to centenarians.",
        "background": "I want Government to alter the automatic eligibility qualifications for the blue badge scheme so that people who turn 100, who have not already got a blue badge, qualify without having to justify why a badge is needed. This is demeaning to proud and independent people and can waste NHS time.",
