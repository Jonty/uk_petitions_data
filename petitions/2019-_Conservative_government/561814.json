        "additional_details": "We have seen an alarming amount of discussion around how many different places are considering only allowing people in if they can prove that they have had a C19 Vaccine\r\n\r\nThis is tantamount to coercion which means that people cannot freely give their consent to the medical procedure of having a vaccine and this would be in direct contradiction with the Nuremberg Code and UNESCO Bioethics and Human Rights\r\n\r\nGov do not give us our rights, they are there to protect them so we ask them to do that now",
        "background": "We call upon the Gov to pass a Bill as a matter of urgency before 31st Dec 2020 to prevent any leisure facility, airline, work place or public or private body discriminating against anyone on the basis of their vaccine status as this would amount to coercion meaning free consent cannot be given.",
