        "additional_details": "There should be a sense of empowerment when young individuals start working so that they can pay for their own needs/ wants. The independence/confidence that they develop should not be affected by being taxed; to feel as making more money as a young person is a negative thing instead of positive can cause infliction due to the amount of taxation. By the law being changed it would reflect positively on young people and encourage them to work harder not to be afraid due to rate of tax. 18 is the legal age to vote therefore should be the legal age to be eligible to be taxed.",
        "background": "I want the government to change the law. As \u201818 being the societal and legal norm of transition from youth to adulthood\u2019 it should be the legal age to be taxed. The maximum of \u00a312,500 that a young person can make before being taxed should be dismissed.",
