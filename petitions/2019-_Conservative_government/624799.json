        "additional_details": "I want the government to introduce a cap on third party car insurance prices for all motorists who have no more than 6 points on their licence, less than 3 fault claims in the last 5 years and want to insure a standard vehicle (for example up to a value of \u00a3100k) regardless of their occupation, age or address. Also make it illegal for insurers to refuse to offer such an insurance for anyone. If anyone wants TPFT / comprehensive that would be on top of the government regulated prices.",
        "background": "Third party vehicle insurance is the minimum legal requirement. This should be regulated by government to stop insurers from unreasonably hiking prices for some people.",
