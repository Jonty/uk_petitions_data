        "action": "Allow gyms to remain open in \"very high\" risk areas",
        "additional_details": "There are fewer opportunities to exercise outside when the days are short, and the dark and wet nights make activities like running and cycling more dangerous.\r\n\r\nExercising in a gym is not a social interaction. Gyms have in place robust social distancing measures, limiting numbers allowed in at any time, cleaning of equipment before and after each use, and contact tracing of all members.\r\n\r\nData shows that the infections related to gyms make up a fraction of a percent of cases across all settings.",
        "background": "Keeping fit is a vital part of staying healthy and having the best chance against COVID-19. With autumn upon us, days are getting shorter, colder and wetter. Exercise is just as important for mental health, especially when people are isolated in the dark days of winter.",
