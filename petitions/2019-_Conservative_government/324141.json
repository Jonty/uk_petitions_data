        "action": "Black History and Racial Studies to be compulsory in primary school curriculum.",
        "additional_details": "The Government stated in 2017 \"schools have the flexibility to teach these topics [Black History] in ways that are appropriate and sensitive to the needs of their pupils.\" This is not good enough. Schools are subjective to the extent they are willing to teach and shouldn't the need of all pupils be the freedom to learn about black history? UK prides itself on being a multiracial nation yet racism still wins. To introduce Racial Studies as a compulsory subject is a step towards a better society.",
        "background": "Racial Studies, with a heavy focus on Black History should become a compulsory subject in all primary schools. Religious Studies is already a compulsory subject yet religion is a choice and race is a foundation. So why are choices being taught before foundations are even acknowledged or understood.",
