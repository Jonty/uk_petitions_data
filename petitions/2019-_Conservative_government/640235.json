        "additional_details": "The last three years in higher education, with many classes cancelled or online, and the great upheaval in their lives as a result of Covid have been a terrible time for the current cohort of students.\r\n \r\nIn addition the ongoing lecturers' strike and the non-marking of final papers, dissertations etc. means this cohort of students has not had the university experience they expected, and this could have a lasting impact on their future.\r\n \r\nThe least the Government can do is absolve them of the huge student debt they have amassed in this time.\r\n",
        "background": "Due to the terrible impact of Covid and the state of the economy over the last three years, we want the Government to write off student loans for all university students graduating this year. This is a simple process as Student Finance England has all the required information.",
