We believe this must be taken seriously, with changes to legislation to broaden this offence, so that there is no ambiguity as to whether an offence has been committed. We hope this can result in actions being taken against perpetrators before their actions escalate.",
        "background": "Indecent exposure, intentional or not, should be classed as a sexual offence. No-one should expose themselves in public places, and in the event that they do so, they should not be able to claim they weren't intending to cause offence. We believe the current law provides too much leeway.",
