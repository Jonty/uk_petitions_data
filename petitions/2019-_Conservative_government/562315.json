        "additional_details": "Universities offer financial support for emergencies to people suffering as an effect of the COVID-19 outbreak. Once they apply, they are met with barriers. If students struggle, they have no immediate access to help.\r\n\r\nDespite vacancies slowly being on the increase, they took a massive decline. People age 16-24 currently have a decrease in employment. Between 25-64, there are increases in employment (ONS). Students are struggling to afford rent, and organise rent strikes in order to combat this.",
        "background": "Increase maintenance loan payments to students struggling due to the lack of job security because of COVID-19. This is because there is no financial support given to them. \r\n\r\nInstead, students are made to rely on parents' or their universities' emergency loans, both of which are heavily limited.",
