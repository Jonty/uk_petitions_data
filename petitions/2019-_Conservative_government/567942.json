        "additional_details": "Years 10+12 are at an immense disadvantage as the content is not being covered adequately to an exam standard. Two lockdowns have disrupted the learning of these years and it\u2019s unfair that they have to sit these examinations with little knowledge on what\u2019s to be tested. Many students\u2019 mental health is being negatively affected due to the pandemic and the added stress of the exams which they have not earned sufficient knowledge for. Remote learning is not effective in terms of exam preparations.",
        "background": "We would like GCSE\u2019s and A-Levels to be cancelled for Year 10\u2019s and Year 12\u2019s respectively. This is due to the two lockdowns that have caused their education to be hindered massively. So therefore, it wouldn\u2019t be fair for them to do their exams, we would like them to be cancelled.",
