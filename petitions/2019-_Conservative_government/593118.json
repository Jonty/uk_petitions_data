The only way we can ensure that species such as Hedgehogs and Red Squirrels will still be here for our grandchildren to see is to properly address the level of protection afforded to our native wildlife and \u201clevel up\u201d how we treat the nations most-loved animals.",
        "background": "Proposed revisions to the Wildlife & Countryside Act would only guarantee legal protection to critically endangered animals, removing protections for endangered, near threatened, or vulnerable animals - all of which could be at significant risk of extinction. These protections should stay in place.",
