If equality is such a huge deal, it\u2019s something we\u2019re so proud of and trying to achieve, why is equality for deaf people not fought for? Not acknowledged? \r\nDeaf people suffer- in being misunderstood and it all boils down to one thing: the lack of ability we have to communicate. \r\nAnd yet, this is something we can change!\r\nIntroducing BSL into our curriculums will bring change and development in the UK!",

If they argue that there\u2019s no space, we would suggest to remove Modern Foreign Languages. Learning a language is a choice. A want. \r\nBeing deaf is not.",
