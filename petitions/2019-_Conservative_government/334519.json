        "action": "Save the wedding industry! Do not require wedding guests to wear masks",
        "additional_details": "The wedding industry is on it's knees. Small & large business alike are clinging on to their last few 2020 clients, & many will not survive to next year if they lose these. With the uncertainty and already strict limitations on weddings & receptions, requiring guests to wear face masks is over zealous and dehumanising for such a deeply personal event. More than being very distressing for couples, it is the final nail in the coffin for businesses who will lose their final clients",
        "background": "The government should remove the requirement for all wedding attendants (other than the bride and groom) to wear face masks from the covid-19 guidelines, as long as social distancing is maintained and everyone is registed for track and trace. They are not required in pubs so why weddings?",
