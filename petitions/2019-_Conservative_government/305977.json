        "additional_details": "Not everyone has equal access to technology, quiet place to study. The situation is stressful enough and students do not know how to prepare for new examination rules that Universities propose to do at home online. Also idea of examination at home would be unfair to some students and surely there will be students taking advantage of their friends and families knowledge to pass. Students believe that only fair option is to cancel examination in 2020 all together.",
        "background": "To cancel the examination for University students of any stage and progress them to further years considering learning outcomes achieved during online and face to face sessions delivered. The examination can be replaced by submitting further coursework online.",
