        "additional_details": "Firstly, cycling lanes create a more safe environment for cyclists. This will encourage more people to cycle rather than drive which is beneficial for peoples health and the environment. Furthermore, it will benefit the governments publicity by getting closer to the net zero goal. Finally, the cycling lanes and safety encouragement will prevent cyclists from getting injured which is significant because of the popularity of cycling around the High Peak/Derbyshire",
        "background": "I would like the government to fund the construction of new cycling lanes in Derbyshire. In addition, I would like them to fund advertisement to promote cycling safety and cycling in general.",
