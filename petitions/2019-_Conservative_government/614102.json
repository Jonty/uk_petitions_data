        "additional_details": "Nadine Dorries MP claims \"government ownership is holding Channel 4 back from competing against streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon\".\r\nIf that is the case, why do Channel 4 themselves say the decision to move forward with the sell-off is \"disappointing\" and ignored \"significant public interest concerns\"?  Stop this now to help preserve what's left of British broadcasting culture, particularly at a local level.",
        "background": "Reject the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport's proposal to privatise Channel 4.\r\nThe UK has a proud history of innovative public service broadcasting that is being seriously eroded by ill-conceived Government policies.",
