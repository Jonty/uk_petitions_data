Where a parent post photographs of themselves and their children as a happy family but in reality don't spend any time with their children. Parents should have equal responsibility to look after their children, unless they come in to a different arrangement between themselves. No child should be separated from their parent. Unless and of course, if there is an evidence of an abuse than for the Court to decide who the children should live with.",
