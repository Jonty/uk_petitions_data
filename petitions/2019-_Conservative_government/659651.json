        "additional_details": "We believe one of the biggest risks to CBT riders are vehicles passing to close and too fast while on the roads, on a 125cc bike on A/B roads the bike can struggle to hold the current speed limit and then becomes slower moving traffic that ultimately gets overtaken (often too close). A higher power bike could hold the speed limit and help reduce the over taking need and with that rider being older and having a full driving licence they could have a much better understanding of the road and conditions.",
