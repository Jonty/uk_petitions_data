        "action": "Stop teens being generalised negatively in the media",
        "additional_details": "The media shares negative news as a fear factor to gain more viewers. news stations often share news about \u201cmischievous and dangerous youths\u201d which gives teenagers a bad representation. They place small groups of reckless teens in the main public view which forces other generations to generalise and fear young adults. I am a teenager myself and I have witnessed people who have treated me differently because of my age, such as being watched closely in shops which made me feel uncomfortable.",
        "background": "I would like the UK government to create a new law to stop news stations categorizing teens when reporting a story that is negative and can make people fear or change their view of young adults.\r\n\r\nThis can benefit self esteem and stop older people from being prejudice towards young adults.",
