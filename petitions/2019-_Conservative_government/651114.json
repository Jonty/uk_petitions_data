        "additional_details": "As a new mother I try to take my baby out as much as possible. This is difficult to do when there are so few baby change facilities that have toilets. If you need the loo whilst out you have two realistic options when there is no toilet in changing room and your baby isn\u2019t able to walk yet: risk your buggy being stolen and holding your child whilst you use the loo, which is both impractical and can be unhygienic, or risk having an accident in public if you can\u2019t get home in time. This needs to change.",
        "background": "Mothers and fathers may be alone when out with their babies therefore it should be mandatory that baby change facilities have a toilet as regular public toilets often don\u2019t have room to accommodate buggies, meaning parents can struggle to find a toilet that they can use.",
