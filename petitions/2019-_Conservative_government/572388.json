        "additional_details": "Ending this culling would prevent around 30 million unnecessary animal deaths per year. It would also have a positive environmental impact, reducing the carbon footprint of the poultry industry as energy would not be wasted on incubating and killing male chicks. The UK should take the moral and technological lead on this issue alongside many other European countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information:\r\nhttps://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/08/ethical-eggs-could-save-male-chicks-mass-slaughter",
        "background": "Around 30 million male chicks are killed in the UK each year by gassing or shredding immediately after hatching. Technology which can determine the sex of fertilised eggs exists and is in use in many countries. There is no longer an excuse for this cruel practice.",
