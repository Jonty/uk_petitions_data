        "additional_details": "This would avoid the is unseemly optics of MPs cheering defeating a 1% below inflation rise for nurses only to have an above inflation 3.1% rise awarded to them. This way, the regularly lauded essential workers of the health sector would be rewarded in line with the policy makers.",
        "background": "I want each pay award given to MPs and Ministers to be mirrored in pay awards to all NHS staff. Now that Westminster\u2019s pay awards are independently awarded by IPSA, we should also depoliticise pay in the health sector.",
