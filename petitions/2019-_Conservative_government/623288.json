        "additional_details": "For women like myself who conceived via artificial insemination, it is important to be protected legally to avoid devastating legal battles with donors in the future. Pre-conception agreements aren\u2019t legally binding but still costly for some. Having a pre-conception agreement in place also protects the mental health of donor conceived children as it may detail, if agreed by the recipient and donor, that the child is able to meet or at least know more about the donor before the age of 18.",
        "background": "A pre-conception agreement should be free, legally binding and allow a sperm donor to sign away legal rights as a parent, just like they would at a fertility clinic. This would ensure no future child custody/financial issues arise when a single woman or couple conceive via artificial insemination.",
