        "action": "Hold a national referendum on the UK joining or leaving the CPTPP bloc.",
        "additional_details": "Holding a referendum on the CPTPP is an effective way to ensure the decision reflects the will of the people. It allows citizens to directly express their views, making the decision more legitimate than one made solely by politicians. It increases transparency by informing citizens and reducing the risk of hidden agendas. Joining or leaving a trading bloc can significantly affect citizens, and a referendum provides them with a direct say in how their lives will be impacted.",
        "background": "A democratic process should reflect the will of the people and is necessary for important national decisions such as trade policy. The UK public was given a choice on whether to remain or leave the EU bloc and so now the people should be afforded the same choice with a Referendum on the CPTPP.",
