        "action": "Amend rules on indoor sports to allow players who turn 18 to finish the season",
        "additional_details": "The 'rule of six' puts the future stability of sport under threat, with clubs unable to field an U18 team throughout the season. Without a change to this ruling, club sport for U18s will be decimated. Incredibly the same group can compete within school sport throughout the year, yet barred from competing at the weekend for club. This anomaly exacerbates the frustrations faced by this age group and undermines their mental health. It must be corrected for basketball, netball, volleyball and many other indoor sports.",
        "background": "Under the current rule of 6, U18 Club players of indoor sports are excluded from participating in youth leagues, immediately upon turning 18 yrs old. We want the Government to amend this ruling to allow these players to complete the season with their Club, as was previously the rule prior to Covid.",
