The lack of pre and post natal support, including cancellations of antenatal classes, Midwife and Health Visitor appointments cancelled and the limitations during labour have been hugely distressing. Women on statutory maternity are surviving off \u00a3148.50 a week whilst the majority of the UK benefit from 80% of their wage up to \u00a32,500 on the furlough scheme - which is now confirmed to be extended until March 2021.",
