Instead we're expected to stand and watch the coronation of King Charles, spectators rather than participants in the process of deciding who represents us in this role. \r\n\r\nDuring a cost-of-living crisis the coronation will cost the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds. The monarchy stands against our most cherished principles and is bad for our democracy.\r\n\r\nIt's time for a referendum.",
        "background": "With the accession of King Charles, falling support for the monarchy and a need for a better democracy, it is time for a full open debate and a referendum, to decide if we should move to a parliamentary republic with an elected head of state.",
