It's illegal to ride on pavements and children under 10 are not subject to penalties. It's on the police discretion to issue penalty on the adults accompanying children on pavements. It's not safe for children under 10 to cycle on busy roads as they are not confident riders. Children cycle slow and therefore are not a threat to the pedestrians. The cycling adults ensure the children and pedestrians safety.",
