        "additional_details": "Freezing business rates will enable businesses to use the twelve months post reopening to manage and plan for the onslaught of rent obligations plus arrears placing their business back on an even financial footing. For a typical smaller businesses on low margins and for whom rent and rates make up a major proportion of operating expenses, such an approach will be the difference between financial sustainability or widespread closures and the associated social and economic consequences.",
        "background": "Most property based businesses have been closed or partially closed for the last twelve months. Rents would have continued to be due and whilst many landlords may have exhibited forbearance during the lockdown, they will expect rent payments to resume, including arrears, once trading commences.",
