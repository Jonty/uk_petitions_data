        "action": "Allow the Hospitality trade to sell takeaway alcohol during the Nov Lockdown.",
        "additional_details": "The government allowed Hospitality venues like restaurants, bars and pubs to continue in the trade of Takeaway alcohol during the March lockdown. These venues are trained in responsible supply & consumption and shouldn't be unfairly forced to closed. \r\n\r\nWe'd appeal to the government for these venues to be treated the same as off-licenses and allowed to continue with takeaway trading, where licenses allow. Not only will this help those businesses to survive, it also provides the consumer choice.",
        "background": "Hospitality venues during the previous lockdown caused by the spread of COVID-19 were allowed to continue in the trade of takeaway alcohol subject to their licensing.\r\n\r\nParliament should allow this trade to continue in the latest announced lockdown, to help these struggling businesses to survive.",
