In some cases CWI was installed in unsuitable homes, leading to mould and damp. Some residents claim a pre-installation survey of their home was not carried out.\r\n \r\nBy addressing the grievances outlined in the petition, the Government can demonstrate its commitment to upholding the rights and protecting the wellbeing of citizens, restoring trust in the legal system, and providing support to those affected.\r\n",
