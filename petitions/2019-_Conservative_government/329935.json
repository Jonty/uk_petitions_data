The 2m rule has also been reduced for some venues to allow to reopen. But weddings are not aloud to have a meal, drinks or reception. This is not fair, if the public who do not know each other are aloud to drink in a pub and eat in a restaurant but family and close friends are not aloud to celebrate a wedding in the same way.",
        "background": "The government has laid out new guidelines that advise against wedding breakfasts, drinks and receptions. But they were allowing restaurants and pubs to open with guidelines in place. \r\nWhy cant weddings be the same as long as social distancing is adhered to with social distance measures in place.",
