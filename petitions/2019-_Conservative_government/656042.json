        "additional_details": "We urge the inclusion of cats in the Road Traffic Act 1988. As cherished members of households, cats face increasing risks on roads. This amendment would establish clear guidelines, ensuring responsible pet ownership, setting speed limits in relevant areas, and holding accountable those who harm cats. We need to prioritize their safety and harmonize our communities by acknowledging the importance of feline welfare in our legislation.",
        "background": "Im forming this petition to gain cats equality alongside other animals in the road traffic act 1988, as they are currently as seen as ferrel animals, which means people can drive off in a hit and run without any repercussions.",
