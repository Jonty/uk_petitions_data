        "additional_details": "Schools have implemented social distancing but it is not that safe as we are still sitting in small classrooms in big numbers. In lining up, students are still very close to each other and during lunch, students have to sit next to each other. Schools aren\u2019t taking enough precautions. In spring, when lockdown was first implemented it seemed very effective. We had to stay at home unless very necessary which helped the cases go down. Also, flu season is coming up and many people can easily catch it and become severely ill.",
        "background": "Recently, COVID cases has spiked back up again, the numbers showing that there has been an increase. We need to have a second full Lockdown to ensure that COVID isn\u2019t a threat again. We need implement safer and tighter restrictions again as this helped a couple months ago.",
