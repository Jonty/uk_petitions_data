        "additional_details": "As there are likely to be cuts to bus driver jobs due to lower passenger numbers or staff with time off due to close contact with passengers, there will still be a need, and potentially a greater need for lorry drivers due to the panic buying and stock piling, and any waste that needs collecting, there are all sorts of different items and goods that are transported by lorries. Allow bus drivers to drive vehicles of a different kind that are usually about the same size as buses to help.",
        "background": "I'd like the government to change the rules to allow holders of PCV licences to drive Class 2 vehicles with the extra amount of additional training needed, to help cope with demand for supplies and waste collections etc.",
