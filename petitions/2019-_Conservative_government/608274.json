        "additional_details": "It is not \u2018green\u2019 to bring it in by tanker from the USA. It is political madness to expose ourselves to supplies from overseas. \r\n\r\nThe rising cost of natural gas need not be a global problem for the UK. We surely have enough to be self-sufficient. The transition to 2050 is a marathon, not a sprint. Common sense needs to be applied to managing the transition. The solution to the fuel crisis is supply, not convoluted subsidies. It is time Government adopted the old business maxim - Keep It Simple Stupid! (KISS).",
        "background": "The Government should commit to developing natural gas from UK sources as a central part of its energy policy, including north sea production and fracking. As part of the transition to non-fossil fuels, Natural Gas will surely be required for decades before 2050. ",
