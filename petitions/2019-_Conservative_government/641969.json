The driver left the scene in a dangerous manner, leaving our nephew fighting for his life with catastrophic head injuries, from which he lost his life 2 days later.\r\n \r\nThe driver received a 9-month prison sentence which we feel does not match the crime committed and the loss of our nephew, and does not serve as a warning to other drivers in the future.\r\n",
        "background": "We would like the minimum and maximum sentences for death by careless driving to be increased, as we believe current sentences do not match the loss of a loved one, and are not an adequate deterrent to prevent drivers from careless driving, which can lead to fatalities.\r\n \r\n",
