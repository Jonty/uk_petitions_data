Im self employed and my business is shut, im not employed, universal credit doesnt even cover my monthly council tax. I can file a return for 2019-2020 but that is no use apparently. My monthly outgoings are around \u00a31250 and currently i have funds to only last 1 month.",

Especially the ones that are newly-self employed and have no tax returns or earn less than 50% of their income from self employment. I have gave my current situation below to help understand.",
