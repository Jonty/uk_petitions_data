        "additional_details": "We want the government to allow pubs and restaurants to be able to sell takeaway alcohol which it currently isn't planning to do:\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-national-restrictions-from-5-november?fbclid=IwAR0V4zMg-diAK_Ag4dGrI0X7jSDXMGwMcxB6MVvorXPnXaLbChka4X1K5M0#businesses-and-venues\r\nBy allowing us to do this it will reduce any waste product that we have already paid for and also we can carry on purchasing from local breweries, helping keep others in work and open, too many will close!!",
        "background": "It has been announced in the guidance notes that although Pubs and Restaurants can sell takeaway food, they will NOT be able to sell takeaway alcohol. Supermarkets are still allowed to sell alcohol, so what is the problem? Yet another example of hurting the pub industry!",
