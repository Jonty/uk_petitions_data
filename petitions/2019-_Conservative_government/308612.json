Some flights are indeed cancelled but this results in some remaining flights becoming extremely busy. There is no chance for passengers or crew to practice social distancing. Certain airline crews are being forced onto unpaid leave if they are worried about exposing their loved ones to the virus or concerned about becoming ill while abroad. It\u2019s time to stop.",
