There is no equality in a loss of independence and safety.\r\n \r\nBecause most ambulances cannot carry electric wheelchairs and patients may be placed in a hospital wheelchair, patients should also have access to staff in case they require assistance to get to somewhere else and to alert them to their worsening condition.",
