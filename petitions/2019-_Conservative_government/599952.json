        "additional_details": "With one in three UK teenagers feeling \u2018ashamed of their body\u2019 (Guardian, 2019), two in five girls aged 11-16 saying they have seen images online that make them feel insecure or less confident (Girl Guides, 2021) and almost three in ten adult men aged 18 and over feeling anxious due to body images (MHF, 2019), it is clear that social media platforms are perpetuating a false perception of body image and beauty standards, which is having a detrimental impact on the population.",
        "background": "Government should #RecogniseBodyImage as a priority in the Online Harms Legislation. This would require social media companies to recognise body image in their community standards, to foster healthier and realistic representations of body image, and require this content to be regulated.",
