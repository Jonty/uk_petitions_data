They pay themselves minimum wage, but then earn dividends from their company - which are from all profits already taxed (Corporation tax) at 19%. But the dividends (government incentive!) are taxed by a further 7.5% (or 32.5%) in the self assessment.  \r\nThese workers are being excluded from Government help during COVID-19. You are supposed to help SUPPORT SMALL COMPANIES- not help in their demise!",
