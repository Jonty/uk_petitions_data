We believe there are far too many asylum seekers in, and coming to, the UK, and we do not want them here.\r\n \r\nWe want all asylum seekers to be relocated to a third country, irrespective of where that is, or their home country.\r\n \r\nThe Government should withdraw from any international agreements, and pass legislation to prevent any legal challenges, that could prevent this policy.\r\n",

We want the Government to send all asylum seekers to Rwanda or another third country, or return them to their home country, with no exceptions, and no asylum seekers to be allowed to stay in the UK.",
