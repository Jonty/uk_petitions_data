        "action": "Home carers for the clinically vulnerable be given priority for covid vaccine",
        "additional_details": "Given the current epidemiological situation in the UK, all evidence indicates that the best option for preventing morbidity and mortality in the initial phase of the programme is to directly protect persons most at risk of morbidity and mortality. Without being vaccinated at the same time as the extremely vulnerable the home carer remains at risk of exposure to infection with COVID-19 and of transmitting that infection to susceptible vulnerable patients outside of health & social care settings.",
        "background": "JCVI advises that first priorities for COVID-19 vaccination programme should be prevention of mortality and maintenance of health and social care systems. Home carers across the country caring for clinically vulnerable should therefore be prioritised at same time as health carers & social care staff",
