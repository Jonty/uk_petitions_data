        "additional_details": "Students are losing valuable time and a lot of money because of factors they have no control over.\r\n \r\nCOVID has seriously affected 2 valuable years of university education by resulting in online learning. Many students have had little to no access to university resources and are still expected to pay for full tuition fees.\r\n \r\nNow with everything back to normal students are losing education to strike action. Again we are expected to continue to pay full tuition fees.\r\n \r\nTuition fees are mostly around \u00a39,000 per year! Most courses last 3 years. That's \u00a327,000 to pay for. Students shouldn't have to pay for education that has been so severely disrupted.\r\n",
