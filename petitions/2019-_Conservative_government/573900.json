        "action": "Demand an End to Investment in New Coal Mines",
        "additional_details": "The Woodhouse Colliery site in Whitehaven, Cumbria, is the first deep coal mine to be approved in 30 years. The site will release 0.4 megatonnes of CO2 equivalent into the atmosphere each year - not only increasing global emissions but also having a negative impact on the UK\u2019s legally binding carbon budget unless we can stop it. The Whitehaven mine is a national, not a local issue. We need the Government to take action and overrule Cumbria County Council's decision.",
        "background": "The Government should intervene immediately to stop a new \u00a3165m coal mine in Whitehaven, Cumbria. The proposed mine contradicts our leadership of COP26 and the Government must therefore withdraw planning permission and direct investment to alternative low carbon methods of producing British steel.",
