        "additional_details": "We welcome recent changes to the Model Tenancy Agreement, our governments acknowledgement of the importance of pets to people. \r\n\r\nSadly, this is not enough; we call on government to go further. Without legislation landlords can still include blanket bans. Pets have played a key role in positive mental health during the pandemic. The trauma of having to give up a pet when moving home must end.\r\n\r\nChanges in legalisation would open doors for love and companionship for humans and animals.",
        "background": "We ask the government to introduce formal legalisation that takes a fair & balanced approach to pets. We call for an end to blanket no pet clauses in tenancy agreements, protecting existing human companion animal relationships & reflecting our pet loving nation. Every pet deserves a loving home.",
