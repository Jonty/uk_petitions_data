        "additional_details": "The legislation favors larger firms and closes the market to SME's.\r\nPrivate legislation does not include open tendering unlike the public sector that causes SME's to be excluded.\r\nThe legislation does not take into account the risk taken by genuine SME businesses.\r\nThe legislation has closed the majority of the market with firms not taking individual risk based decisions but applying blanket rules.\r\nPractitioners are now regarded as employees but usually with far less rights and benefits.",
        "background": "Discuss IR35 focusing on the impact on SME's who are excluded from tendering on projects with private firms and are now impacted by blanket rules where private firms are refusing engagements or demanding they operate through PAYE regardless of circumstances.",
