Instead of equipping them with these vital skills, memory based assessments and evaluation based on repetition are what is valued most. Future generations need a learning environment that focuses on developing curiosity and learning from mistakes, rather than a one-size-fits-all mindset. Children need preparation to succeed in a future they are going to build.",
