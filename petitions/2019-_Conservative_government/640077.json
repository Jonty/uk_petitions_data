        "additional_details": "Everybody has a right to a education, and by not licensing a wheel chair vehicle because TFL has made this decision is unfair on many parties involved.\r\nWorking in the transport industry for years and meeting with many of the students and their families I see the importance first hand.\r\nI see how the vehicles give the children/young adults a chance of a normal daily life to attend school and interact with others. The vehicles are only there for the good of the disabled why take this away",
        "background": "Many Wheel chair uses children/ adults are transported daily to and from school or college.\r\nThe vehicles are a important part of daily life for them.\r\nMany vunerable passengers need to travel with equipment and buying new electric vehicles like TFL want is unfair treatment",
