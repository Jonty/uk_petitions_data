        "additional_details": "I qualified in aesthetics but no longer practice due to injury. There is no standard rule book for practitioners to follow, and for many treatments and methods practitioners are able to use their own discretion, which we believe is ridiculously dangerous. I\u2019ve seen children injected, treatments completed with no documentation, clients suffering complications like vascular occlusions, migration and necrosis of the skin due to incompetence and lack of knowledge. People are getting qualifications after one day of training.",
        "background": "We want the Government to create a national regulatory body for aesthetic treatments and clinics. This should issue PINs for aesthetic practitioners, make completing regular CPD a legal requirement and hold practitioners accountable when they break the law.",
