        "additional_details": "In Yellowstone park wolves were eradicated but this left many problems for wildlife. Without wolves beavers couldn\u2019t build dams, fish were unprotected, rivers were eroded. Elks overgrazed. But when biologists reintroduced wolves it had an amazing effect on the ecosystem. Mammals came back, songbirds sang again, beavers built dams. The world isn\u2019t as picturesque without wolves. The ecosystem suffered without wolves. Imagine what\u2019ll happen to Sweden? For a bunch of cattle. Is it really worth it?",
        "background": "I want Government and Parliament to talk to the Swedish government and ask them to not cull any wolves. There are only 480 wolves in Sweden. Do you want innocent animals to die? It breaks a law set by the EU to protect endangered species. 27 countries agreed to this. Why would we do for cattle?",
