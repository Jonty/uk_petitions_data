        "additional_details": "There have been various complaints by members of public about noise and dangerous driving in public places. Drivers have no where to go to socialise and meet up in big groups because it just gets shut down. Where as, if a drag strip opened up for events, say once a month, this would solve this issue. It will be a safe place for drivers to race and it can bring profits for event creators and Blackpool council. A fee will be paid each month for using the strip.",
        "background": "A group of car enthusiasts would like the opportunity to create events at Blackpool airport. We think it is in the best interest to the public and Blackpool council that the airport can be used as a drag strip for drivers.",
