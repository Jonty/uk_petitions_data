        "additional_details": "If you have a child who requires a different fit of trousers for example (plus fit/slim fit/tall) this isn't always possible with compulsory branding, same for skirts and tops. Our local high school said the logo was introduced due to the length of skirts. The skirts are now shorter than ever as girls can only buy the specific school branded skirts, 2 lengths isn't always adequate!",
        "background": "Research has shown that compulsory school uniform costs up to \u00a3300 per child, per year. Schools are increasingly requiring logos & school/house colours on items which could otherwise be bought in supermarkets at a hugely reduced cost. While most areas have uniform exchanges it is all unecessary.",
