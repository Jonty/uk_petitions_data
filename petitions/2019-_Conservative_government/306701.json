This would safeguard the future of families and reduce some of the burden on the nation's resources.  It would also let older people, (who cannot currently offer practical help due to self-isolating) contribute to the country's effort to get through this.\r\nThere will unfortunately be deaths of elderly people due to this virus, and inheritance tax will place an economic burden on their families at a point when they are least able to pay.",
