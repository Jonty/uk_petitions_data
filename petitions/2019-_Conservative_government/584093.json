        "additional_details": "We want more marginalised groups to have the choice to pursue postgrad education. Your educational trajectory shouldn't be dictated by how much money you or your family has. The government have a responsibility to ensure that people who want to continue with their education past undergrad level have more scope to do so, without having to worry about how they will get money together to pay for their fees. SFE only partially funding a large majority of postgrad courses is elitist & unacceptable.",
        "background": "We want all student finance loans to cover the individuals chosen course. We want to abolish the massive funding gap that exists for students and their families that cannot afford to make up the rest of their fees. Increase funding",
