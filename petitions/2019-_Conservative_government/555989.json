        "additional_details": "I would like the government to do something like this as there are so many people in this country struggling for accommodation, struggling for food and clothes, yet nothing is done so if even just \u00a31 was taxed off people who earn \u00a33,000+ a year for that purpose only we could help eradicate these problems and slowly get them better and make our economy much more viable.",
        "background": "I would like the government to introduce an additional flat rate \u00a31 income tax for all UK taxpayers earning over \u00a33000. Taxing \u00a31 a year off all citizens aged 16+ would let this money go towards eradicating UK problems such as child food poverty, homelessness, charities etc.",
