Religious hatred needs to be continually challenged to prevent any places of worship being targeted across the UK. Furthermore, we need to prevent the rise of civil unrest and lack of multi-faith cohesion. People of any faith should feel safe.\r\n \r\nBy prohibiting protests outside places of worship, we are taking a stance as a nation ensuring people feel safe attending their place of worship, which should be safe havens and not sites of aggression from protestors.",
