        "additional_details": "Around 180,000 people died during the pandemic after testing positive for Covid-19. A recent study in Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health into mortality and austerity found that there were 330,000 excess deaths in the period 2012 to 2019, and that these are largely attributable to austerity policies. This figure is nearly twice the figure of those who died after testing positive for Covid-19 during the Pandemic and we believe this needs a Public Inquiry to learn the lessons from the effects of Austerity.",
        "background": "Set up a Public Inquiry into the estimated 330,000 excess deaths for 2012 to 2019 that research has found are largely attributable to austerity. This should be similar to the Covid-19 Inquiry into the 180,000 deaths in the UK of people who tested positive for Covid-19 during the Pandemic.",
