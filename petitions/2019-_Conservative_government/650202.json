        "additional_details": "Environmental Impact:\r\nSpray deodorants contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other aerosol propellants that contribute to air pollution and harm the ozone layer. Studies have shown that these chemicals can persist in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nHealth Concerns:\r\nMany spray deodorants contain potentially harmful chemicals which have been linked to allergies, respiratory issues, and skin sensitivities. The inhalation of aerosol particles can also pose risks to respiratory health.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, call upon the UK government to take immediate action to ban the sale and use of spray deodorants in the United Kingdom. We present this petition with strong evidence and concerns about the environmental and health impacts associated with these products.",
