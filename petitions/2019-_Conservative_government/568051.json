        "additional_details": "Pupils at colleges and schools need education and knowledges to be able to reach the grades they want for their jobs or courses. Pupils have already missed enough school so why should we loose more. I would understand if nurseries were shut but if children who do not need nursery can open for the younger children who tend to not be aware of social distancing , then theirs absolutely no reason why something can not be organised for pupils in schools and colleges to get the education they need.",
        "background": "The government should consider that if nurseries are able to open for children who don\u2019t need it , high schools and college should be allowed to\r\nOpen for essential education and teaching for what they need towards their grades and future. The schools and colleges needs to open if nurseries can",
