        "additional_details": "Adult education has been impacted very significantly across England over 2020/21. The combination of local restrictions in autumn 2020, national lockdown and reduced hours at Job Centres has had a particular impact on courses for those with lower skill levels or who are unemployed and has disrupted college ability to meet this year\u2019s targets. Colleges have been advised to not use the Job Retention Scheme (JRS) for non-commercial staff, which could have reduced costs.",
        "background": "Support colleges by preventing the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) from clawing back any Adult Education funding. The Government should introduce greater flexibility on this decision since autumn 2020 to reflect the impact of disruption caused by the pandemic this academic year.",
