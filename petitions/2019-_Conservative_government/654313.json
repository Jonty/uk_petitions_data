For example, we could accept a petition calling on the Government to Stop car insurers considering age of driver when setting insurance policies.\r\n\r\nWe have also published the following petitions, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nEstablish a Commission to investigate extortionate Car Insurance price rises: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/644067\r\n\r\nPlace a Cap on Motor Insurance Premium Increases: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/649918\r\n\r\nIntroduce fixed prices for car insurance based on power to weight ratio and age: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/646793\r\n\r\nWe only reject petitions that don\u2019t meet the petition standards."
