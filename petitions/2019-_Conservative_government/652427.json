        "additional_details": "My sister passed away in April 2020 from a blood clot which we believe was caused by the contraceptive pill. She had not had a check-up for the 18 months she had been on the combined pill. If she had received regular check-ups the clot could have been caught and she might still be here today. Her name is Riszka Szymkowska and she was 22 years old.",
        "background": "We want the Government to review arrangements for the prescription of contraceptive pills, with a view to improving patient safety. Currently patients can easily get repeat prescriptions without seeing their GP or having any health checks. This can mean risk factors are missed.",
