        "action": "Abolish daylight saving time and make GMT the de-facto permanent time",
        "additional_details": "People are tired of this futile twice-yearly action, as it has no advantages for their physical or mental health, particularly since there is a large section of the population with social anxiety. The most egregious example of this is in the United States, where many states risk having permanent DST, and their residents are suffering greatly from its side-effects, including unnatural darkness and an increase in dangerous driving and/or RTAs. Full GMT would prevent this from happening in the UK.",
        "background": "Help put an end to the pointless biannual clock-switching ritual, as it serves no practical or logical purpose and is actually detrimental to people's health and wellbeing. Solar Time has been active since 2019 and is allied with the International Alliance for Natural Time to abolish DST worldwide.",
