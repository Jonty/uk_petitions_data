        "additional_details": "There are many legitimate reasons why MPs may be unable to physically attend Parliament, to attend debates and vote. We believe constituents are penalised and their voices silenced by the current system. The House of Commons should update its processes to take advantage of new technology and join the ranks of more progressive countries' parliaments. We believe the current system, as well as endangering public health, is unfair for MPs with disabilities, illness, caring responsibilities, and those not based near London.",
