For international students, getting enrolled in a UK university is beyond the adventure of a new land to live but it is a stepping stone to a brighter future and an effort to gain student experience. \r\nThey were hoping for a festive launch of meaningful career, now they are sitting jobless in deserted dorms and attend classes in Zoom. Some spirited young people have fallen ill.",
        "background": "The universities have shuttered residence halls and moved courses online. The resources provided by university (labs, libraries) \r\n are closed or heavily restricted. The students should be reimbursed of their tuition fees and all current students should be included in Post Study Work visa scheme.",
