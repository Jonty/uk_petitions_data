        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to maintain aircraft used by the RAF because in the not too distant past, iconic aircraft have been put out to pasture when it might have been possible for them to be upgraded rather than retired. Aircraft such as the Tornado, and the Hercules. The Typhoon is also going to be replaced. I appreciate the UK have always been advanced in the aircraft we have produced but we want there to be more of a focus on reducing, recycling and reusing. I am not of the opinion that cost is the issue.",
