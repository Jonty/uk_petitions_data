Some will not have been in the UK for half their lives by their 25th birthday, and the amount of time it takes to get leave to remain, as well as how long the application itself takes, means that some won't have been lawful residents long enough to access student finance. \r\n\r\nThe BBC article 'Raised in the UK, barred from university' (23/06/20) shows the damaging effect this is having on a generation of young people.",
