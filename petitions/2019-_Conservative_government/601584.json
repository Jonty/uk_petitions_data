        "additional_details": "Currently children aged 12 - 16 who have had a covid vaccination are not able to obtain a covid passport, as adults are able to do. The covid passport has a barcode which can be easily scanned by authorities in overseas jurisdictions. This makes travel abroad considerably more difficult for children in that age bracket. There appears to be no justification for this change of approach between adults and those who are aged between 12 - 16.",
