        "additional_details": "Past governments have failed to deal adequately with threats that are specific to women and girls. The resources allocated to dealing with such threats are inadequate. The result is a fundamental failure to protect over 50% of UK citizens. Parliament needs to act now to deal with a deficiency in funding, which is ruining lives.\r\nThe defence of the realm must include ensuring that women & girls can live freely and safely in their own country. Like other areas of defence it must be funded properly.",
        "background": "We call on Parliament to set up a new government Department for the Protection of Women and Girls, reporting to a dedicated cabinet Minister. The annual budget should be substantial to reflect the importance of this issue.",
