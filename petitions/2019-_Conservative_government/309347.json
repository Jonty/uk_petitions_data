        "additional_details": "According to current plans, employees on PAYE will be able to access around \u00a330,000 in support over a year, while the self-employed will only be able to access around \u00a34,900 in universal credit.\r\n\r\nThis is deeply unfair to the self-employed who make up 15% of the UK's workforce, whose industries have been brought to a standstill by the Covid-19 pandemic, who pay tax like everyone else, and who like regular employees will need to provide for themselves and their dependents in the months ahead.",
        "background": "Like Norway, the UK government must introduce a grants system that treats the self-employed fairly: The government should give grants to the self-employed topping up their net monthly income to 80% of their average net profit, as determined by their past three years of tax returns.",
