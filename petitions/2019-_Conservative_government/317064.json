        "additional_details": "The sector will collapse without the full support we were originally promised.  We are expected to stay open, or become bank staff to allow key workers to work, while we look after their children.  We are also a vital key worker but are continually being overlooked, underfunded and disregarded.  Who will look after the children if the sector collapses.  We need to keep going.  No one wants to make a profit but we need to survive, we are just as important as NHS and other critical workers.",
        "background": "Give us the full funding promised, increase funding rates, allow staff to be furloughed without percentages of funding.  Allow charity settings access to grants, as they dont qualify as they do not pay rates or vat",
