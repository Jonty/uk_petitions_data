        "additional_details": "A \u2018carbon charge\u2019 would encourage industries and organisations to reduce their carbon emissions, and could raise billions for the UK economy. The Government can ensure the charge does not unfairly impact those who cannot afford to pay by using some of the money raised to support low income households through the low-carbon transition. The UK should also utilise its position as host of COP26 and the G7 summit to drive global progress on carbon pricing.",
        "background": "Air pollution kills 64,000 people in the UK every year, yet the Government provides annual fossil fuel subsidies of \u00a310.5 billion, according to the European Commission. To meet UK climate targets, the Government must end this practice and introduce charges on producers of greenhouse gas emissions.",
