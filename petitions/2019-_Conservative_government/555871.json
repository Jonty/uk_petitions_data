        "additional_details": "Parliament can not justify members receiving free meals when they are refusing to extend the free school meals system over the holidays. No child is responsible for their own hunger. No MPs are hungry. Not only this but the hunger of children has been greatly exacerbated by the government\u2019s mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic, forcing many many households to rely on benefits, food banks and charity to feed their families. Free food for MPs can no longer be justified.",
        "background": "MPs can afford to pay for their own food. They should not be scrounging off the state at a time when hundreds of thousands of children are being refused free meals during school holidays.",
