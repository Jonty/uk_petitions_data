        "additional_details": "Students who do not live in residential halls are still expected to continue rent payments. The reason for students in housing away from home is to have suitable accommodation near to their studies during term times. As all universities are no longer open, most students have returned to their homes, making the expectancy of usual rent unjust.",
        "background": "The Government and Parliament would help students who have to continue payments for housing, regardless of the vast majority returning home. The success of this petition would require landlords to accommodate to the new social climate, and thereby abolish or reduce rent for the upcoming months.",
