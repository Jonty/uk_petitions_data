        "additional_details": "In Yemen 24 million people require urgent humanitarian assistance, 12 million of whom are children. 3 million are suffering from acute malnutrition. A child dies every 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nYemen is not only facing war and famine, but had been extremely vulnerable to COVID-19 and cholera. \r\n\r\nThe Saudi Government has issued air and sea blockade to prevent assistance. \r\n\r\nThe UK must use its influence with Saudi Arabia to press them to adhere to the current ceasefire and ongoing peace talks.",
        "background": "The UK government should immediately cancel all arms export licenses and transfer of weapons which might be used in Yemen to commit serious violations of international humanitarian law.\r\n\r\nEnd all military assistance the UK is giving to Saudi Arabia and other coalition partners.",
