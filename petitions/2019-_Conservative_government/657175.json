        "additional_details": "As signatory to the Genocide Convention, the UK Government has a duty to prevent a genocide. We believe the Government has acted contrary to its duties and may be complicit in potential war crimes. This could have global repercussions for UK citizens. Public concern and horror is evident. We believe the will of the people is for an immediate ceasefire/humanitarian aid, not for support of Israel. We believe current policy undermines public trust, and that the Government has double standards when its position on Gaza is compared to its actions in support of Ukraine.",
        "background": "Establish a public enquiry to investigate the Government's decisions and support of Israel and its actions against the people of Gaza. This should investigate whether UK assets/intelligence/weapons were used in Gaza, and any advice on potential breaches of international law.",
