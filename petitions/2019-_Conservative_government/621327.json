        "additional_details": "This should ensure each child, regardless of their age or gender, can have their own bedroom without it impacting the homes parents can bid for, or reducing the amount of benefits they can claim. This could be hugely important for their personal development while giving family members adequate communal space for positive mental health. Benefits and social housing rules are based on 1 bedroom for two under-16s who are the same sex; or for two over-10s who are different sex. Same sex siblings can therefore have to share even with large age gaps, such as toddlers and teenagers. Parents sometimes give their room to a child and sleep in the lounge. Lack of personal space can increase potential conflict, increase stress, and reduce quality of life.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to change how Universal Credit and Housing Benefit are calculated, and require local authorities to allow families to bid for homes with 1 bedroom per child, so children of all ages and genders are able to have their own bedroom.",
