For example, we believe it doesn\u2019t facilitate a swift second opinion when warranted. A totally independent body must govern this and investigate complaints against all NHS staff and bodies and act as the \u201cfailures occur\u201d to minimise harm / pain / suffering and sometimes loss of life. I\u2019m driven to campaign for this change due to my own personal tragic loss. ",
