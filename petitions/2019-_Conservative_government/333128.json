        "additional_details": "Counting calories does not work and can create an unhealthy relationship to food, especially for those who already have eating disorders. Eating less and moving more may work for short term weight loss but the body fights back against it with a slowing metabolism and rising hunger. Research suggests that between 1.24 and 3.4 million people in the U.K. suffer from an eating disorder. Eating disorders have the highest mortality rates among psychiatric disorders, calorie counting will severely affect this group of people.",
