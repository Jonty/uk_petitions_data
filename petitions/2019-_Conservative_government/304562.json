        "additional_details": "Students rely on their termly loans and various other sources to enable them to study and live their everyday lives - some student loans are as low as \u00a33124 per year! This is not enough to live on without extra paid work. \r\n\r\nWithout additional support in this uncertain time, students need resources to continue studying, any disruption to studying can cause long term effects both at individual and industrial scales. \r\n\r\nInvesting in students at this time should be a prime priority!",
        "background": "Most students live off Zero-Hour contracts. The recent cancellations due to Covid-19 have caused many to lose vital income. \r\nStudents are calling the government and Student Finance England, SFE, to 'top-up' their student loans for term 2. This will allow students to continue studying into next term",
