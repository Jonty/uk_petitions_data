        "additional_details": "Due to world shortages of face masks, use of these has not been included in the public guidelines we are all following.\r\n\r\nIt is now accepted that the use of face masks, by the public, is an effective way of reducing transmission rates. This is now being made a part of the public response in other countries, notibly just two days ago in the USA.\r\n\r\nBy using face masks when out in public we will save thousands of lives, reduce the impact on the NHS and save our economy billions of pounds.",
        "background": "Using emergency powers, I would like the government to force all of us to wear face masks whilst out in public. This enforcement should be as a part of the government strategy to control the spread of covid19. Due to worldwide shortages, this should allow the use of home made face masks.",
