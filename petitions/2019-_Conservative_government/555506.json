        "additional_details": "Aside from the obvious physical benefits, playing tennis can positively effect the mental health of an individual. Tennis can improve critical thinking, mental alertness, and tactical thinking by making connections in the brain. Tennis also helps regulate serotonin\u2014a brain chemical linked to functions such as sleep cycle, appetite, and emotional state.\r\n\r\nEven seeing a socially distant smile at your local club can lift a mood which, in these difficult times, is invaluable.",
        "background": "Petition for indoor tennis activity to be permitted to continue, on the basis of its socially distant nature, the significant health benefits it delivers and the stringent hygiene protocols that venues have put in place.\r\nCurrent restrictions will significantly impact the future of community clubs.",
