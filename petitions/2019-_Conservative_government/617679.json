        "additional_details": "We want a new UK Parliament building to be built, and both houses of Parliament be moved to that building. We believe this will be cheaper than refurbishing the current Parliament. The location of the new building, and plans for the new building, would be matters for the Government and Parliament to consider.\r\n \r\nIn the past buildings costs have been significantly higher on completion than originally anticipated. For example the estimated cost of the Scottish Parliament was between \u00a310-\u00a340 million but its completion costs were \u00a3414 million. We are concerned that the costs of refurbishing Parliament could also increase. In any event, the current cost proposed cannot be justified, let alone in the current cost of living crisis. To force the taxpayer to foot the bill would be impermissible.",
        "background": "Preparations are underway for a programme, established by the Parliament by the Parliamentary Buildings (Restoration and Renewal) Act 2019, which could cost the taxpayer up to \u00a322 billion to refurbish the Palace of Westminster. This cost is clearly disproportionate to the taxpayer.",
