        "additional_details": "It has been in the past that buildings costs have been significantly higher on completion than originally anticipated, for example the estimated cost of the Scottish Parliament was between \u00a310-\u00a340million but its completion costs \u00a3414million. It is possible that a significantly low estimate of a building is made in the future. In any event, the current cost proposed cannot be justified, let alone in the current cost of living crisis. To force the taxpayer to foot the bill would be impermissible.",
        "background": "The Government is set to authorise a scheme which will cost the taxpayer approximately \u00a322billion to refurbish the Palace of Westminster, which was approved by Parliament by the Parliamentary Buildings (Restoration and Renewal) Act 2019. This cost is clearly disproportionate to the taxpayer.",

For example, you could start a new petition asking for the Government and Parliament to cap the costs of a new Parliament building to be built outside of London, if that's something that you'd like to see.
