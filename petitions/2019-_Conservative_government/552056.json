        "additional_details": "Online learning has dramatically impacted the quality of teaching and resources available to students however they are still required to pay the same amount charged for in person tuition. It is incorrect assumption that all students have access to wifi and suitable working spaces. Furthermore, the standards of online teaching are significantly poorer than in person, a fact agreed universally by tutors and students alike. The UK annual average cost of \u00a39,250 for tuition needs to be reduced.",
