        "additional_details": "It is an idea of my 9 years old daughter, Chiara, concerned for the environment and animals in the wild getting trapped in plastic waste from supermarkets and getting hurt. This petition is part of her campaign called \"Rabbits hate Plastic\". We feel that the UK can lead the world with recyclable packaging in supermarkets and help the environment. The Parliament should discourage the use of plastic as packaging from the shops and doing so reduce the waste and litter.",
        "background": "To make a law to discourage shops to use non recyclable plastic packaging for fruits, vegetables, pastry etc. by charging a small tax, like on plastic bags, on every single plastic packaging used. This should discourage the use of them and reduce waste and litter.",
