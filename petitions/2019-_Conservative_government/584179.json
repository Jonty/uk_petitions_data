        "additional_details": "Pregnant women are more likely to be admitted to ICU, and their baby is more likely to be born prematurely should they become infected with Covid19. According to a new study, women who have Covid symptoms while carrying a child are over 50pc more likely to experience complications. The Government must step up and protect these vulnerable women from Covid19 as a matter of urgency by prioritising them for the vaccine.",
        "background": "Pregnant women are being vaccinated in-line with their age bracket. This could mean waiting for a further 6 months before they are protected from Covid19. But research has shown that pregnant women and their baby are clinically vulnerable; they must therefore be vaccinated as a priority.",
