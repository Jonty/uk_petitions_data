They deal with cross contamination daily, have used gloves, sanitisers and sterile practice. \r\nMany studios had begun measures to be even safer than before. \r\nSo many may now have to close. People will loose their places of work and income.\r\nPlease revisit the judgement on this large part of the retail industry. \r\nI as a client of many wonderful artists and creatives feel this decision has not been looked at with the correct scrutiny. There is a huge culture and demand for tattoos and this decision could affect a big sector.\r\nI urge the government to readdress this issue with some urgency.\r\nThank you.",
