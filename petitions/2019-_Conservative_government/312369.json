        "additional_details": "COVID-19 crippled the world. We couldn't provide simple things like PPE equipment to the NHS quickly, leaving local people to create makeshift PPE equipment and distribute to their local health care sector. This has highlighted the need to start investing in our own country and to stop letting CHINA run our economy. We are due to let Huawei build 5G telecommunications in the UK and Chinese energy build Nuclear power stations in the UK. This has to stop now!! STOP RELYING ON CHINA FOR OUR NEEDS..",
