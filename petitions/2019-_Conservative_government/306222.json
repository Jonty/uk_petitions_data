        "additional_details": "Currently UK is in state of crisis due to corona virus. Many people are behaving irresponsibly and are stockpiling grocery. What started with just a few products has become a much bigger problem. Bare essentials like fruit and vegetable are also disappearing from supermarket shelves. This is leading to much bigger problem especially for elderly people and others like NHS staff who are busy serving others. We all deserves a solution and such behaviour should be criminalised.",
        "background": "Stop people stockpiling items of grocery and corona epidemic essentials like hand sanitizer. Anyone who tries to sell these items online or in person for profit should be fined EXCESSIVELY. People should be encouraged to report such incidents and online companies should be held accountable.",
