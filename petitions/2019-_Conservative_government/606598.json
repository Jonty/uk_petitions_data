        "additional_details": "The rules for this charge should be changed, so it is only paid if a household's income exceeds \u00a3100,000.\r\n \r\nCurrent regulation unfairly penalises families with a sole earner whose income exceeds \u00a350k a year. A family where both parents earn \u00a349k (\u00a398k household income) will receive 100% of child benefit. Family with one parent earning \u00a360k will effectively receive \u00a30 of child benefit. Worse off families with sole \u2018high earners\u2019 require more support in the form of child benefit. This unfortunately is not considered in the current legislation. Revise the rule to introduce a combined, increased threshold.\r\n",
