        "additional_details": "Many of these were sold as clean diesel and so on. It is atrociuos to put fines on vehicals to drive on road while they are taxed on road and drivers pay all kind of taxes. Its a source of income for council, tfl etc in millions/billions pounds. I am loan free and dont want to take a new load forces on me to buy a car. PLEASE stop fines immediately. Driver education and volunteer aproach is better than economically penalizing masses under pretext of clean air",
        "background": "Clean air zones are been put all over the country. When you speak to council they say goverment is asking them to implement zones all across. It is great idea but not on expense of road users when they bought these vehicals , they were legally allowed and sold in uk.",
