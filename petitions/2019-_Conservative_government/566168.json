        "additional_details": "Changing the times inbetween doses from 21 days to 12 weeks goes against manufacturers guidelines. There is no evidence based research to prove that lengthening the time to 12 weeks wouldn't be detrimental. It also violates the consent of the patients who have already received the 1st dose. Informed consent is important for any medical treatment including vaccines, in order for it to be informed consent the patient needs to be informed.",

Changing the time between doses violates the informed consent given by the patents who have received the first dose already. They received the 1st dose under the conditions they would receive the 2nd dose 21 days later not 12 weeks.",
