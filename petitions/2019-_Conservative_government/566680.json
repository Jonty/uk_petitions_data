Close the schools, turn the exams into coursework. Not only would that save lives but would make grading more fair as people are getting out what they put in, within their grades. \r\n\r\nwhy is everyone making it so difficult? people are dying and masks aren't enough to be keeping your children, friends, nurses, everyone safe.  Shutting the schools will save lives.",
        "background": "The government need to close all schools till there is a minimum amount of cases or until everyone has been vaccinated, to save everyone's lives. schools don't have to be open and exams don't need to happen, they just need to be adapted and changed.",
