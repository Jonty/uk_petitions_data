        "action": "Remove the ban on prisoners voting from the Representation of the People Act",
        "additional_details": "Denying voting rights to criminals who receive a custodial sentence is dehumanizing and hinders rehabilitation. It also means politicians do not take the rights, needs and interests of prisoners seriously enough. The Representation of the People Act should be amended to remove this ban and allow all prisoners (not just e.g. those released on temporary licence) to vote. Ultimately, voting is a human right, and it is highly unethical to restrict this for so many.",
        "background": "The UK\u2019s ban on prisoners voting was ruled to be in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights in 2005. There are a plethora of benefits to be gained from removing this ban: aiding inmates\u2019 rehabilitation; providing a connection to the outside world; and representing their views.",
