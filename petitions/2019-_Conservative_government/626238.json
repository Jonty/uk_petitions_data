(BBC 11/03/2020)\r\n\r\nNew hyper-fast fashion brands are making hundreds of thousands of different garments, with apparently no regard for the impact of production. These brands sell millions of garments to people who may never consider their impact due to the lack of public education on the topic. Mandatory labelling requirements would enable consumers to make ethical choices.",
