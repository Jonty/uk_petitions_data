        "additional_details": "The majority of those not wearing a face covering in England just don\u2019t want to. This puts the public, vulnerable and the NHS at risk of a Covid-19 peak.\r\nAn offical exemption card should be issued on a case by case basis to those who are unable to use a covering due to a medical exemption. If this can\u2019t be shown then it will allow businesses to refuse entry if a person won\u2019t use a face covering. This will then protect everyone and allow enforcement of your face covering guidance.",
