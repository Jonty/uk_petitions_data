Despite effectively losing access to NHS dental services, such people are taxed in the same way as those who are fortunate enough to still enjoy the services of an NHS dentist. Without a means to claim reimbursement, taxpayers without access to an NHS dentist are effectively subsidising a service to which they are entitled but cannot use.",
