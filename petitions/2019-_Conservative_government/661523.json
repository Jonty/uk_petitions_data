        "action": "Review the accessibility of employment tribunals for claimants",
        "additional_details": "Claimants who are neurodiverse or have mental health conditions can find employment tribunals challenging. This can be a particular issue where something unexpected happens - for example the judge presiding over a case changes without notice - or a situation feels stressful - for example when a claimant is required to swear an oath, or the press are present. I believe this puts claimants who are neurodiverse or have mental health conditions at a disadvantage.\r\n \r\nA review could identify reforms that could make tribunals more accessible and ensure that appropriate adjustments are made, such as providing tailored guidance.\r\n",
        "background": "We want the Government to review the accessibility of employment tribunals for claimants, and particularly those who are neurodiverse or have mental health conditions. This should look at challenges faced by claimants, and identify reforms that will make tribunals more accessible.",
