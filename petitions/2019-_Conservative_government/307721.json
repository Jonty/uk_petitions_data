        "additional_details": "The government pledged to pay 80% of all paye workers wages to protect the country's workforce from going under financially. All these people have to do, is stay at home and spend time with their children, minimising their social interactions with people outside their households. It seems unfair that staff on the frontline of this pandemic, the ones risking their own and their family's health to go to work, are only getting their basic wage. They deserve to be financially protected too.",
        "background": "Provide additional financial support for the NHS staff on the front line, that are currently over-worked, over-stressed and spending even more time away from family than usual to provide care and treatment to everyone.",
