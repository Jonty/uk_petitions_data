        "action": "Abolish the 5% VAT applied to domestic gas and electric bills.",
        "additional_details": "On the 1st January 2021, the Government wisely removed the 5% VAT from sanitary products as it could do so, now that the UK is no longer a member of the EU.  Axing this punitive tax on domestic gas and electric bills will help low income and families that are struggling to pay the bills. Also, it will help pensioners to keep warm and support cancer patients. Keeping warm is not a luxury. We call on the Government to do the right thing and axe this tax as a part of the Brexit dividend.",
        "background": "Now that the UK is free of the EU, the Government can now abolish the 5% VAT that is presently added onto domestic gas and electric bills. Keeping warm and working from home is not a luxury, it's a necessity.",
