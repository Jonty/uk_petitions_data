        "additional_details": "There are many issues such as peer to peer abuse, revenge porn and harassment that are traumatising teenagers. Many young people don\u2019t have people they can relate to or confide in. They need to be educated on a deeper level as the national curriculum isn\u2019t touching on real life situations enough. The youth need to know about the consequences of these issues for the survivors and offenders. If they hear it from people that have actually experienced these things they are more likely to listen.",
        "background": "The Government should provide additional funding to secondary schools to enable one-to-one coaching by mentors. These mentors could support students as part of their PSHE education, using their own life experiences.",
