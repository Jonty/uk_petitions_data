        "action": "Enforce anti-bullying education in all UK schools",
        "additional_details": "Whilst schools have bullying policies, they are rarely implemented until it is too late, when the victim has serious and lasting affects on their mental health.\r\nAll children should be taught about the harmful consequences for the victim including depression, anxiety, fear of social situations, school refusal, self harming and in some cases suicide. If a bully knew and understood the consequences and was taught to see things from the victims perspective, would they continue? Its worth exploring.",
        "background": "This petition is being done to help protect the victims of bullying. By providing anti-bullying education, this could not only benefit the victims but discourage the bullies from persisting with what could potentially lead to fatal consequences. \r\n\r\n\r\nEducation in schools is vital.",
