        "additional_details": "The Government should refund all or part of employee Pay As You Earn tax which had been paid through the Coronavirus Pandemic. People working throughout the crisis who have paid their fair share of tax in public sectors should be rewarded with a permanent pay rise, however this is looking increasingly unlikely. A tax refund for all Key and Essential Workers should therefore be looked at until the Pandemic is declared under control as a thank you for their dedication and professionalism",
        "background": "The Coronavirus Pandemic has affected so many people in many different ways. With furlough announced for so many employees, the Keyworkers and Essential workers in professions such as the NHS, care workers and supermarket staff, should be rewarded.",
