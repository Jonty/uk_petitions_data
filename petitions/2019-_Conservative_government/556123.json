At this stage in the year we don\u2019t even have the escape of our gardens, and we can\u2019t even buy some new pyjamas in my weekly shop. Children would normally be enjoying activities and time with friends during half term and we can\u2019t even get them a new book, board game or pack of Pokemon cards to occupy their minds or even pens and paper to help work their studies.",
        "background": "I want the welsh government to reconsider the ban on \u201cnon essential\u201d items in supermarkets. The government needs to lift the restrictions and give us access to clothes, books, study supplies/stationary and all other items deemed as non essential.",
