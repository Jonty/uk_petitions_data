        "action": "Reform maternity, paternity, shared parental & adoption leave and pay",
        "additional_details": "1) The gender pay gap is driven by women reducing time at work to care for children. Many young couples want to share work and childcare more equally but it's practically & financially difficult with the current gvt policy. Reform -> support more gender equal parenting -> enable more active fatherhood & empower women at work.\r\n2) Birth rates are worryingly low. Urgent action is needed so young people can afford to have kids. We need well-paid parental leave & affordable early childcare for all.",
        "background": "Simplify into a single, universal parental leave regime\r\nIncrease statutory parental pay (currently sub min wage)\r\nEnable more gender-equal parenting by increasing leave length for fathers/partners (current paternity is 2 weeks) & requiring any employer-enhanced parental pay to be gender balanced",
