So as the virus takes out \u201cthe weakest links\u201d society takes out the \u201cpoor\u201d. We gain nothing from hiding apart from a world with socioeconomic problems. Yes, some of us will be impacted by it. But whether we hide or not it\u2019s still going to happen. Going back to \u2018normal\u2019 will allow us to gain our lives back and the majority to be immune.",

And once exposed, we become immune. We understand the fatalities, as small as they are. But what does hiding and isolation actually solve?",
