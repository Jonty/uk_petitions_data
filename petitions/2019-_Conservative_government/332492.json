        "additional_details": "I would like the government to recognise the contribution and value of healthcare workers in the private sector. Many working tirelessly in Nursing Homes and Supported Living Services, facing the fear, grief and real dangers of Covid19. These workers often only earn the National Minimum Wage and don't benefit from good pension provision or annual salary increases. Many of their families are experiencing financial hardship as well as grief.",
        "background": "It isn't just NHS and social care workers who have died providing care to people with coronavirus. Many families of private Nurses, Carers and Support Workers are not eligible for this scheme. The lives and contribution of these healthcare workers are just as valuable as public sector workers.",
