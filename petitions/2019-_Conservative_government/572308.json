        "additional_details": "Over 100,000 people in the UK have now died within 28 days of testing positive for COVID-19. As more strains continue to emerge, the government needs to do more to deter people from spreading the virus.\r\n\r\nFor some, an \u00a3800 fine would take away their ability to feed their family. For others, \u00a3800 won't make a difference to their day to day life. By fining individuals a set percentage of their annual income, people in every tax bracket will be deterred from breaking Covid restrictions.",
        "background": "Currently, individuals are fined \u00a3800 for attending house parties of 15+ people. This doubles for each repeat offence to a maximum of \u00a36,400.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not enough to deter many people, particularly those with higher incomes. These fines therefore need to be based on individuals' incomes.",
