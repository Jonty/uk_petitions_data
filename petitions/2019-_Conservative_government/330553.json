        "additional_details": "If everyone subscribed to the plan, it would result in \u00a3620,000,000 more straight to the salaries of nurses and front line staff who are woefully underpaid. Divided by the number of nurses, it could result in \u00a3998 per year more per nurse, regardless of their rank. By allowing this tax to be optional, the government would not have to scramble around for more money for salaries; this budget would be earmarked for nurses.\r\n\r\nNumbers are based on absolute best case scenario, and would likely be lower.",
