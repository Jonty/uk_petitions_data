By avoiding limiting labels, the need for terminology pertaining to \u2018disability\u2019 will cease and likely lead to equality. \r\n\r\nThe UAE is at the forefront of changing this mindset with significant success: \r\n\r\nhttps://u.ae/en/information-and-services/social-affairs/people-of-determination",
