Few people will willingly leave without their younger family members. If the UK Government is serious about its role as a dynamic 'Global Britain', it should extend a hand to those whose democratic freedoms it guaranteed. These people are in need, not to mention skilled and wealthy. A clear path to citizenship is needed to provide certainty and initiate immigration.",
