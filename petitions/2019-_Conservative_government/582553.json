I would like the expenses to be justified e.g. I would like the Government to justify how a test and trace system cost \u00a337 billion.\r\n \r\nI think a full audit and review should determine if all spending and contracts were legitimate and best use of expenditure. For example, were the right companies given the proper contracts.",
