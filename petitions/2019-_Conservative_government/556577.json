        "additional_details": "As nurses, doctors and carers we maintain the populations well-being and health. Students working in this profession should NEVER have to PAY over \u00a39000 a year to help the sick and vulnerable. During COVID-19 students, retired nurses and doctors and so on all stepped up to help those in need, risking their lives in the process, and after a gruelling 12+ hour shift they have to pay to leave (the car park). We may not be able to get a degree for free, but hopefully basic parking whilst working.",
