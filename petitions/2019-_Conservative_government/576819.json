This would include education provided as part of the Government's plan to help young people in England catch up on lost learning due to the pandemic.\r\n\r\nIf you want the Government to make changes to the programme to help young people in England catch up on lost learning due to the pandemic we could accept a petition about this, but it would need to be clear what changes you wanted to be made."
