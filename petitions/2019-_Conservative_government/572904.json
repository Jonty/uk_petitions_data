        "additional_details": "In 2017 the UK government scrapped student nurse bursaries, meaning that student maintenance and tuition loans had to be taken out, leaving many student nurses with financial difficulties. The UK government in 2020 recognised that a bursary is crucial to supporting student nurses and have introduced a \u00a35K bursary. However they fail to recognise the hardships of the previous student nurses (2017-2020) and show no gratitude for the essential support they provided during the COVID 19 Pandemic.",
        "background": "The maintenance loan fees incurred by student nurses between 2017-2020 need to be waived. This is because they are the only student nurses who have not received any non-repayable financial help from the government and they were a crucial part of the NHS during the COVID-19 Pandemic when opting in.",
