Most couples have stuck to the rules, but as lockdown restrictions are eased, it\u2019s time to address this issue sooner rather than later.\r\n\r\nFor many, moving in together isn\u2019t possible for a variety of reasons - leaving 1000\u2019s of people across the UK unable to see their partner for what has now been, months. This needs to change as lockdown restrictions are eased.",
        "background": "This is having an effect on people\u2019s mental health. Such committed couples have now had to endure many months apart, severely struggling with their mental health.\r\n\r\nWith very little idea of how long this may continue, this needs to be addressed asap as lockdown restrictions are eased in the UK.",
