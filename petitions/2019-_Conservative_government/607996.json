        "additional_details": "London has introduced the \"direct vision system\" for all HGVs over 12 ton which is mandatory. At the very least introduce reversing cameras on all HGVs on the road, old or new. Why should London be treated differently to the rest of the UK? You wouldn't drive forwards if you can't see where you are going, so why drive in reverse unable to see where you are going?",
        "background": "Alot of articulated lorries do not have reversing cameras fitted. It's impossible for a driver to see what is behind the vehicle especially on a blind side reverse. Resulting in many serious and fatal accidents.",
