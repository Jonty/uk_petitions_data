        "action": "Introduce Ethnic Minority Input to British History into the National Curriculum",
        "additional_details": "Relaying an accurate representation of minorities in our history classes will act to ease racial tensions in years to come.  The minority contributions I would like to emphasise pertain to the role of the colonies in the First and Second World Wars. Followed by a focus on the 1919 race riots and Windrush generations, who were crucial in filling the post-war labour shortage. The topics described should be introduced at appropriate ages of schooling and not confined to any specific month.",
        "background": "Ethnic minorities have been documented in the British Isles for almost 2000 years. Yet, their representation in our history classes is negligible. The aim here is not to change history, but to complete it.  I propose the introduction of Black Romans along with an emphasis on minority contributions.",
