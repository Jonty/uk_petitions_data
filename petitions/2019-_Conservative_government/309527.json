        "additional_details": "Construction workers are at high risk during this pandemic. The need to carry heavy materials would not be possible to allow for a constant two meter distance from one another. A lot of sites don\u2019t have access to proper sanitary ware to enable workers to wash hands often. Sharing of tools and work materials makes the spreading of germs impossible.",
        "background": "Stopping all non essential work should mean stopping work for construction workers too. Construction workers are at high risk of contaminating and spreading coronavirus  due to having to work in close proximity to each other, sharing tools, as well as a lack of sanitary ware on smaller sites.",
