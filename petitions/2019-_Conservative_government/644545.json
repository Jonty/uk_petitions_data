        "additional_details": "The Subsidy Application should be published after the awarding body has decided in-principle to award a subsidy. An applicant should also be required to confirm that no relationships exist between the applicant and the awarder. The Government should maintain a real-time Register of all Applications. As it stands, openness and transparency only applies after the event, i.e. society only learns about the award after the awarding deed. This means competitors only learn about the impact on their market after the Award and the Damage is done.",
        "background": "We want the Government to require subsidy-awarding bodies to publish applications for subsidy before subsidy is provided, to improve openness and transparency, so competitors are aware of intervention in their markets.\r\n \r\n",
