        "additional_details": "This energy rebate scheme has to be paid back over 5 years making the installments subject to VAT which forces energy customers to pay more. Millions already manage their bills well and don't need this compulsory rebate scheme added to their bills. I don't want it & 1000s of others don't consent to it so please scrap it. The only benefactor of this scheme over the long term is the treasury not customers. Can you please scrap this compulsory rebate scheme which starts in October? Thank you",
        "background": "Rishi Sunak will force all UK households into debt with a \u00a3200 energy rebate in October which is compulsory.This is unacceptable force UK citizens to sign up to a government scheme without consent. 1000s on social media are so angry that they do not want to sign up to this scheme.MAKE IT OPTIONAL",
