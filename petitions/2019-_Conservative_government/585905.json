        "background": "The Government is proposing a bill that makes it near impossible to prosecute almost all cases of torture and war crimes 5 years after the offence. \r\n\r\nThus Bill may deny justice to victims of torture and reduce the likelihood of crimes committed by military personnel being looked into.",
