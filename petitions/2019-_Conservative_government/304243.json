        "additional_details": "Due to shortages doctors are currently expected to wear just normal surgical masks. It is not acceptable that Public Health England has downgraded the PPE for NHS workers, the advice being given currently contradicts the WHO and European guidance which says to use full PPE if you are exposed to coronavirus. Adequate PPE needs to be provided to hospitals as soon as possible to prevent the further spread of the virus amongst doctors.The government needs to act quickly to resolve this issue to ensure that there are sufficient resources for healthcare professionals or our ability to treat those who need medical support will be compromised.",
        "background": "Since the outbreak of coronavirus adequate PPE across the NHS has been running low putting healthcare professionals at increased risk. The PPE equipment should include at least FFP3 masks, a visor, a surgical gown and two pairs of gloves.",
