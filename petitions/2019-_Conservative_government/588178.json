        "additional_details": "In 2018 the UK Government permitted the export of over 32,000 tonnes of UK-manufactured banned pesticides, 87% of which are reported to have contained paraquat. With paraquat \u201cone sip can kill\u201d, and evidence is mounting of its numerous long-term health impacts.\r\n \r\nStudies suggest that almost half of these pesticide exports were sent to low and middle-income countries with far weaker safety regulations. It is irresponsible to assume that these chemicals will be used safely, and it is resulting in countless predictable and preventable deaths.",
        "background": "We want the UK Government to put an end to the export of UK-manufactured paraquat and other toxic pesticides. These are chemicals banned for use in the UK and 50 other countries due to the immense risks they pose to human health and the environment. The double-standard must end now.",
