        "action": "Extend availability of Post-Study Work Visa to students graduating in 2020.",
        "additional_details": "This year has seen losses to expected learning resources without any compensation. Starting with strikes in February, and then lack of physical facilities and learning in March alongwith the loss of student income has had an impact on international students. We pay approximately twice the fees (vs UK/EU) and we do not feel that our investment has been returned on fairly. It would be very helpful if the visa extension for next year is extended to students who missed out opportunities this year.",
        "background": "The Graduate Visa route scheduled to be introduced in 2021's graduating class should be made available to 2020's batch as well considering the damages to learning by COVID-19 and subsequently diminished returns on the international student community's investment in the education infrastructure.",
