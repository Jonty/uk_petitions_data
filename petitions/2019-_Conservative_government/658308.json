        "additional_details": "We think this could be a step towards responsible pet ownership and establishing a stable funding source for animal welfare initiatives, ultimately benefiting the entire pet-owning community. It could also promote responsible pet ownership and enhance animal health and safety. We think a pet licensing system is vital because relying solely on charity fails to embed animal welfare as a core societal value.",
        "background": "We think the Government should enact a nationwide pet licencing system, with fees based on the pet's size and needs. This initiative could fund animal welfare programs, subsidise veterinary care, and support neutering efforts to manage stray populations.",
