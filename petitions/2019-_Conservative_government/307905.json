This is very stressful when we can't  afford to pay our bills when we simply don't have the money coming in as we no longer have the hours to work. Please consider this it would help the people massively.",
        "background": "A lot of people have had their work hours cut and have even lost their jobs. If you cancel payment of council tax during the pandemic it would relieve a lot of stress and would help households out. If you won't do this will you cut the payment by at least half? This will help our country a lot.",
