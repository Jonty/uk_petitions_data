        "additional_details": "British people living in the EU at the end of 2020 lost their freedom of movement rights, country locking them to the specific nation they were in at the time. Many will have families from other EU nations and will not be able to return to those countries (or the UK) as a family. In working life these Brits now have to compete in a pan-European market with access to only a single area, reducing their opportunities and making them less favourable candidates in job selection.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to formally request from the relevant EU authorities: the freedom to move, work, study, and live around the EU, for British citizens who exercised their freedom of movement rights prior to the end of the withdrawal agreement transition period.",
