        "additional_details": "This proposal will allow the Government to gain powers over its citizens well beyond a reasonable period of what is necessary with this Coronavirus crisis.   The content of the Bill must be scrutinised in order to protect citizens & ensure their rights and civil liberties are maintained as far as possible.   The Bill must not take advantage of the Covid-19 crisis as a means to control citizens.  Reducing the proposed timescale allows Parliament to revue & debate the Bill as the crisis unfolds.",
        "background": "I want the Government and Parliament to look carefully at the length of term suggested with the Coronavirus Bill.  Two years is too long a period to introduce measures that will enable the Government to control UK residents  with new powers of arrest, detention, quarantine, burials!",
