We run a support group for ARFID sufferers and their families, and believe current support is inadequate.\r\n \r\nThe Governments should provide funding for training on ARFID for professionals such as school staff, medical staff, so that they can understand and the help sufferers need, and to increase availability of treatment for sufferers.\r\n",
