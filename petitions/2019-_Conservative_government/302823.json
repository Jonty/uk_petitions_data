I bought the last packet of nappies today in Aldi, and there was no baby wipes left. There was a young man getting upset in another shop because he couldn't find baby milk anywhere and he had none left. There is no toilet roll anywhere and the shelves and freezers in stores are starting to go bare. It is silly and it is putting families at risk due to not being able to buy the essential items they need.",
