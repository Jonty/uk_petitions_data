        "additional_details": "As of today, April 30th 2020, he has raised \u00a330 million for the NHS as the country battles the coronavirus pandemic. Today, on his 100th birthday, he received an RAF flypast by a Spitfire and a Hurricane. The two aircraft which won us the Battle of Britain. With the money he's raised Captain Tom is now helping Britain win this battle. He is a war hero twice over, having served in the last war and this rather different one. Please support this wonderful idea.",
        "background": "Trafalgar Square has always been where Britain's war heroes are honoured with statues. The fourth plinth is empty, it has no permanent resident. If ever there was a more deserving and publicly-supported candidate to have a permanent statue there, it must be Captain Tom Moore.",
