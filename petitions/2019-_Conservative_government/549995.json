        "additional_details": "The majority of students have been working hard over lockdown, in an attempt to catch up for lost time. Instead of delaying exams, we suggest removing content, allowing students to specifically focus on specific areas of their education and allow them to achieve the best grade possible. As a cohort, we are already competing against 2020\u2019s overinflated grades for university places and delaying exams would only deter students who feel that their summer will now be taken from them too.",
        "background": "It has recently been suggested that next years exams should be pushed back to allow for \u201cextra learning time\u201d, however as a student body, many feel that this is not the correct way to address the time lost as a result of COVID-19.",
