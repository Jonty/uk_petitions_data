This includes protests by those whose reasons for protest we may disagree with.\r\n\r\nWhile many in the UK support the role of a constitutional monarch, many do not. Differing views on how the country may be run or any other public issue, should be shared in public, not be removed from view by force.\r\n\r\nParliament should at the very least discuss these events.",
