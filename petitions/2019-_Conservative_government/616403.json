We have enough problems as it is without having MORE money taken off us, for services we don't even always receive.\r\n\r\nWe get taxed on everything and when I think about the things I could be spending money on instead of giving it to the government, it makes me feel depressed. The cost of living is rising so fast and people clearly can't keep up. This is not right, how can it be?\r\n\r\nWe need to stand together and fight for our rights. We need change to live a free life with access to more of our own hard worked for income and reduced stress levels, as mental illness is rising due to the demands and unfair treatment which has been normalised.",
