        "additional_details": "Inflation and underfunded pay rises for teachers have created put state schools across England under pressure. Basic provision like stationary, heating and SEND staff are being cut.\r\n \r\nWe think that pay rises for teachers are paltry when compared with inflation and undervalue the profession. Teachers' recruitment and retention is becoming increasingly difficult. \r\n \r\nWe think that lack of provision harms children's futures. Let's change this together.\r\n",
