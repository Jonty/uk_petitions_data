This is a closed shop designed to fill the pockets of the biggest clubs, which is damaging to the interests of the football pyramid, including grass roots clubs. There has been no consultation and no fans or governing bodies are in favour. the motivation is greed and self preservation rather than the wellbeing of the football family.",
