        "action": "Scrap legislation to force restaurants to introduce calorie counts on menus.",
        "additional_details": "It\u2019s estimated that 1.25 million people suffer from an eating disorder in the UK and putting calorie labels on menus will only add to the anxiety which such individuals face. Calorie counts in affordable chain restaurants will affect the working class disproportionately. People are capable of making their own decisions regarding the food they eat, and calorie counts will create unnecessary distress particularly for young people facing unfair societal expectations of how their bodies should look.",
        "background": "This new govt policy which affects businesses employing over 250 staff members will have a hugely detrimental effect on the mental health of those struggling with eating disorders and body dysmorphia. There\u2019s also no evidence that this policy will improve public health.",
