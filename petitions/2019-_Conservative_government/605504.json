        "action": "Organize a environmental conference with Heads of State to restore the Aral Sea.",
        "additional_details": "SLR will affect countless populations causing trillions of dollars of damage. Cutting greenhouse gasses will only go so far. I propose a new plan of action to slow and reduce SLR by restoring the Aral Sea! It doesn't take a genius to realize that if you take water out of the ocean that it will reduce its overall volume. Once the Aral Sea is restored it will help stabilize global weather patterns and also absorb CO2 from the atmosphere thereby slowing global warming, climate change and SLR.",
        "background": "I want the Government to start talks with climate and marine scientists and Heads of State to take action on Sea Level Rise (SLR) by proposing the construction of a pipeline from the Black Sea to pump sea water to the Aral Sea basin to thus restore the Aral Sea, thereby reducing the effects of SLR.",
