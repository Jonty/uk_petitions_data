        "additional_details": "It\u2019s unjust and without reason to not allow women\u2019s facial treatments whilst allowing men to have their beards cut. Salons are already cleanly places and a cleansed face for treatment whilst wearing a mask can be much more hygienic than a beard without a mask. The highest profiting treatments are those involving the face, and since that\u2019s not possible, many female-run businesses are suffering. Women are not being treated equal to men.",
        "background": "Barbers are currently, under lockdown rules, allowed to cut men\u2019s beards but beauty salons are not allowed to provide any facial service including waxing, eyelashes and threading. Many of these treatments could be done whilst the customer wears a mask. Clearly this is an issue of blatant sexism.",
