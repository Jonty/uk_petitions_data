        "additional_details": "The Government should increase pay for NHS workers as they deserve more and should be properly recognised for their efforts.\r\n\r\nI recently spoke to an NHS nurse, who works in a school, and she explained that many of her NHS nurse friends were single mums and had to go to food banks in order to provide for her children. She also stated that if her husband didn\u2019t earn the amount that he does then she wouldn\u2019t have become part of the NHS.\r\n\r\nThe salary is one of the main factors that can put people off of becoming part of the NHS. By increasing their wages the NHS should become stronger and better staffed.",
        "background": "We want the Government to pay NHS workers a more suitable salary for their efforts and skills. We would like the Government to increase all NHS workers wages by 5%. Despite the recent pay rise given to NHS workers, many feel they are not adequately paid or recognised.",
