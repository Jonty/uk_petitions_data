        "additional_details": "The zoos and wildlife centres rely on the revenue from paying visitors to keep them going. \r\nStaff are still working and looking after the animals.\r\nIf they are forced to close permanently due to lack of money, what happens to all the innocent animals? We as humans put them in zoos, it is our responsibility to make sure that they are not forgotten about. Allowing zoos and wildlife centres to reopen, providing restrictions on numbers etc are adhered to,  is completly logical and necessary.",
        "background": "Allowing non essential shops to open whilst zoos and wildlife centres that are predominantly outdoors with ample space for social distancing remain closed is ludicrous.",
