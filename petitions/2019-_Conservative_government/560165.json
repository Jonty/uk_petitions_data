        "additional_details": "I am very concerned that every year in the UK around 78000 people die and many more suffer debilitating health conditions because of smoking. Thousands of children are hospitalised every year due to the effects of passive smoking.\r\n \r\nMaking cigarette packs smaller and limiting customers to one pack per shopping trip could help reduce the amount of cigarettes they smoke, as it would require more time and effort to purchase the same number of cigarettes as before.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to require smaller cigarette packs (perhaps half the current size or less, so 10 cigarettes or fewer per pack) and only allow customers to buy one pack at a time. Taxes should also be increased to make them more expensive and deter young people from taking up smoking.",
