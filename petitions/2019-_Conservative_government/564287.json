During winter months it becomes increasingly difficult for people to consistently exercise outdoors. Closing indoor fitness facilities is extremely detrimental to those in need of exercise but struggle to find a suitable outdoor exercise. Indoor exercise is not often possible for those living in flats due to noise, lack of space and vibration due to jumping.",
