        "additional_details": "I think within reason ie not allowing inappropriate or offensive clothing we should be like the states and Canada where they allow children to school in their own clothes. Set up some school atire standards and let them wear smart casual to school. Eg non ripped jeans and clean top you can ban brands if you think that will help. \r\nThis will help children to express themselves more and make school more affordable to those on low incomes and reduce waste as no need to purchase school uniforms!",
        "background": "School uniforms are expensive to purchase and those arguments about it levels the playing field for rich and poor is incorrect you can tell who is in hand me down school uniforms and who always gets brand new uniforms! \r\nWithout government help towards school uniforms I think just scrap them!",
