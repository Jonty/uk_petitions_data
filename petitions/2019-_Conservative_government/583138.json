        "additional_details": "All too often people are the subject of racial and other abuse on social media, but are rarely brought to justice. It's proposed that social media users submit valid ID upon signup to prevent individuals using fake or anonymous accounts to send hateful comments, improving the traceability and allowing offenders to be prosecuted. This would also serve as a deterrent and help improve security on all platforms.",
        "background": "The Government should reform regulation of social media and consider implementing new legislation requiring ID checks, to help tackle abuse faced by users. This would help track down users who choose to use platforms to attack others, often breaching acceptable use policy with no repercussions.",
