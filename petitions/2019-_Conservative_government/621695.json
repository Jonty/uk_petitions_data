By scrutinising past events and decisions the inquiry would establish the facts, determine accountability and make recommendations. Motorists deserve to know why this happened. \r\n\r\nThe Government's new The Parking Code of Practice emerged in Feb 2022 only to be withdrawn (pending further consultation) after legal action from parking operators unhappy their charge cost was not increased to \u00a3120 and no additional fees could be added.",
