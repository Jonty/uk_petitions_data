        "additional_details": "Thankfully the UK now has reduced Covid cases. We are in a very privileged position having excess equipment. Sending excess equipment to places like India is right; Ethically-To do everything we can to reduce loss of life. Politically - To help build relationships with places like India. Scientifically - If covid exists anywhere it will travel everywhere. Financially - Strengthening relationships with other countries may lead to future trade. Historically - Centuries old links with the Commonwealth.",
        "background": "Thankfully Britain has seen reduced numbers of the Corona virus. Unfortunately places like India are going through their second wave of covid. I propose that the UK Government immediately lends/donates excess ventilators etc to countries going through humanitarian covid crisis e.g. India.",
