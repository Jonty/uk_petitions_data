It is unjustifiable for ministers to continue to receive such an exorbitant top-up on top of their (already generous) MP salary, and so Parliament should formally ask the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) to reduce ministerial pay to match that of a senior nurse.\r\nMP pay quoted from Parliament website.\r\n\u00a340,588 nurse salary quoted from nurses.co.uk",
        "background": "A UK Cabinet minister currently earns \u00a367,505 per year, on top of their MP salary of \u00a381,932. In contrast, the highest salary for a Band 6 nurse is \u00a340,588. This disparity needs urgent correction, by asking the pay body IPSA to reduce Cabinet Ministers' top-up salary from \u00a367,505 to \u00a340,588.",
