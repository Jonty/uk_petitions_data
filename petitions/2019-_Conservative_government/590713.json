There is still much to be learned about MCAS and the number of people suffering with this disease is increasing rapidly. In addition patients experiencing \"Long Covid\" are reporting many of the same MCAS symptoms. These patients need recognition of their condition and a concerted effort to educate A&E staff of the potential risk to life posed by MCAS.",

Thousands of patients are misdiagnosed every year even though MCAS is recognized by the CDC.",
