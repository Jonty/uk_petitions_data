        "additional_details": "Over the pandemic, key workers such as SIA-licensed security were an essential part of our everyday lives. Many of this group moved from Hospitality to Retail, in order to continue working.\r\n\r\nSIA-licensed security providers are a vital part of the night time economy and are an essential part of our everyday lives. Sadly they frequently face abuse and assaults as a result of the work they do, with too little protection provided under the law for them compared to the emergency services.\r\n",
        "background": "The Government should include security providers licensed by the Security Industry Association (SIA) as \u2018emergency workers\u2019 under the Assaults on Emergency Workers (Offences) Act 2018. This would ensure that SIA-licensed security providers are protected in the same way as the emergency services.",
