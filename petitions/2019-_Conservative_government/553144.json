We should embrace tradition and show politicians\u2019 importance with a fine hat. To be honest, there\u2019s no harm in incorporating this. In fact, there is only a benefit when incorporating this rule. These hats will show politicians that they are important and shall be treated with respect.",
        "background": "Politicians should wear hats. Hats like traditional top hats or a nice bowler hat. These hats used to represent importance, and I argue they still do. Politicians should show their capability and importance by wearing a hat.",
