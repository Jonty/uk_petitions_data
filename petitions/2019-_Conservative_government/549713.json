        "additional_details": "Stand-up comedy needs to be recognised as an art form that is both financially and culturally important to the UK.\r\n\r\nPurpose built comedy clubs are struggling to justify operating costs when they're not allowed to operate, nor do they have the funds to comply with the new guidelines that involve keeping patrons safe. \r\n\r\nBritish humour is recognised worldwide and we have produced some of the best comedians that have ever lived. We risk losing dedicated clubs and leaving a scar on British culture.",
        "background": "The last official estimate on the economic impact of the Edinburgh festival in 2015 suggested that it contributed \u00a3312m to British economy. \r\n\r\nThe government is dragging its feet when it comes to applications for the \u00a31.5bn rescue fund, so far efforts to ask for help have been largely ignored.",
