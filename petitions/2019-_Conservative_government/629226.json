For example, concerns have been expressed about racial bias, and we conclude from accumulating evidence that, for various reasons, it has now forever lost the profession\u2019s trust and respect. The regulation of the medical profession needs to be conducted by a distinctly different system, which is more consistent and practical, so retaining the confidence of the profession and patients.",

It\u2019s time to establish a different organisation, that can truly, yet efficiently, represent the needs of patients and doctors.",
