Such flexibility has helped maintain peace within a very divisive context.\r\n \r\nI don\u2019t believe that Remainers should have lost their EU citizenship rights, and believe that allowing these to be regained would go some way towards healing the binary, hostile atmosphere that has afflicted British politics.\r\n \r\nIt should only be offered to British citizens aged 18+ before the referendum vote and by application only.\r\n",

I would like the Government to negotiate with the EU to allow British citizens who were aged 18+ before the referendum to regain their EU citizenship.\r\n",
