As one of many first years that have started University during the pandemic, I don\u2019t feel as though students from any level are fully benefiting from a 'blended learning' approach. Many students studying STEM subjects don't have a single on campus lesson this semester. As adults investing thousands into our education to become doctors, teachers, etc, we deserve that our education be deemed as essential as those allowed to attend school/college.",
