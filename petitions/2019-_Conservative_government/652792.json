        "additional_details": "These changes will deny foreign workers the ability to come and work in our already chronically understaffed health and social care industry and deny the vast majority of UK citizens the ability to bring a foreign spouse to the UK to live with them, as only the top 25% of earners are able to meet the new \u00a338,700 requirement. The changes will also extend to foreign spouses already living in the UK with their partners potentially breaking apart loving families.",
