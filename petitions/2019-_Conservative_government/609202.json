However, if you are unvaccinated travelling in to the UK you must take 2 tests and self-isolate if you test positive. This is discriminatory. If you are in the UK 'track and trace' will come to an end. If you are travelling in to the UK, you will be tracked by a locator form. Again, this is discriminatory. The Government says it trusts the public to exercise personal responsibility, this must apply to travel too.",
