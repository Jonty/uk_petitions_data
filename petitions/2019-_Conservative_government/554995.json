        "additional_details": "Teachers are already expected to work as usual. We are asked to take transports in rush hours, mark books (while virus stays on surfaces for 28 days) and stay in a room with 28 students aged 12-18 for several hours. At a time where the government is asking us to be careful, having OFSTED preparation and extra meetings seem to be out of touch. We need to be able to focus on the kids' health and actual learning rather than new trends and paperwork.",
