        "additional_details": "Most students have a lack of education from teachers being off for the past few months and due to the high cases a lot of school have had to close down due to high numbers of cases or lack of staff. The students mental health should be put first, as the stress of taking an exam with a lack of time at school is unfair. Exams need to be cancelled as it is not fair that the cases are so high and self isolation decreasing lesson time is not being considered and exams are still going ahead.",
        "background": "The exams should be completely cancelled. Year 13s have had 5 months of education on hold due to Covid-19, and the cases are still extremely high. Most student\u2019s have self isolated and losing valuable lesson time. Some are losing up to 30 days of lessons due to self isolating 3 different times.",
