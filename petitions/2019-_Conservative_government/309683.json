        "additional_details": "For these workers social distancing isn't always possible, and contact with other individuals can be inevitable. Having necessary interaction with the public during an unprecedented time where the government is encouraging social distancing is a tremendous risk to the their health and safety, but also for their households. It is evident that many people will contract this deadly virus from simply doing their job, in order to keep the country running as smoothly as possible whilst saving others.",
        "background": "In the cases where those in vital job roles are unable to work from home, and as a result can not self-isolate; we are asking that you provide a form of hazard pay compensation. Take into consideration the severity for those who during this pandemic are indisputably putting their lives on the line.",
