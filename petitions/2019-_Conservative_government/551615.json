        "additional_details": "Some schools are still maintaining a class of 30 children which can make it impossible for them to put the 1 metre distance rule into practice. Though risks for children is low they may then pass it to elderly family members and relatives with medical conditions. Children cannot wear masks all day in school as this is unhealthy, so schools should introduce part-time hours for each year group, with smaller classes, and the rest of the work they can do online. Several schools have already sent whole year groups home to self-isolate. Cases are increasing and several cities are in local lockdown.\r\nTesting is a chaos!! It can take up to 2 weeks to get tested and get the results. Parents should not be fined if they are not happy to give their child to school due to the current conditions.",
        "background": "Schools should adopt a part-time attendance rota system. Children can be split into groups and go into school for half of the weekly school hours and study online for the rest of the remaining hours, allowing smaller class sizes at school.",
