        "action": "Make Furlough Mandatory For Supply Staff in the Education Sector",
        "additional_details": "Due to Lockdown, supply staff in the Education sector are without work. Their only hope is the Flexible Furlough Scheme. However, private supply agencies are refusing to furlough, citing contributions to Employers NI and Pension. In Lockdown 1, even though these costs were covered and 100% of the supply staff qualified, only 40% were furloughed. The government has invested \u00a3millions training up these teachers. Leaving teachers without an income will cause even more to leave the profession.",
        "background": "This petition seeks two actions:\r\n1) For the Employers NI and Pension contributions to be paid by the Government (as in the original CJRS).\r\n2) Make furlough, for supply agencies and umbrella companies in the Education sector, mandatory and not a voluntary scheme.",
