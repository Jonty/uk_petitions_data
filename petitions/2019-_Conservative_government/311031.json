        "additional_details": "UK scientists conducting research are on fixed contracts affected by CoViD-19. This includes postgraduate researchers who will get extensions - but this won't include living costs, rendering them useless. Many researchers and students desperately need extra time that is costed, allowing them to complete their important research despite the very significant impact of CoViD-19. This is a real and serious hit to UK science, and if the government can afford a rescue package, it should provide one.",

They are losing time and money that their funders (who are often charities) cannot afford to compensate them for. The government could provide a financial package to universities to mitigate this damaging hit to scientific progress.",
