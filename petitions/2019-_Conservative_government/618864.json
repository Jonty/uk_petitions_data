        "additional_details": "In 2019 16,884 cyclists were injured in road accidents, Including 4,433 who were seriously injured or killed.\r\n\r\nAlthough car occupants account for the greatest number of casualties each year, this is unsurprising as cars account for 80% of trips over 5 miles in Britain. By looking at casualty rates in terms of the number of casualties per mile travelled, pedal cyclists fall into the \u2018vulnerable road users\u2019 category, along with pedestrians and motorcyclists, who have much higher casualty rates per mile travelled than other road users.\r\n\r\nWe want the Government to invest in more cycle lanes as it would surely help traffic and cycle-related incidents decrease, and make cycle lanes more accessible therefore creating a more safe environment for cyclists.\r\nDo you now think it\u2019s time for change?",
        "background": "The Government should fund local authorities to improve the accessibility and security of cycle lanes, as we have seen an increase in traffic-related incidents involving cyclists in recent years. Investing in infrastructure related to cycle paths could help us with the issue we are facing.",
