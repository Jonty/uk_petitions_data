        "action": "Require Drive Through Food Outlets to mark packaging with vehicle registration",
        "additional_details": "Rural areas and communities are blighted by the irresponsible disposal of packaging from fast food outlets, people preferring to throw items out of the car rather than disposing of it properly.  \r\nOutlets claim to be doing their part by doing litter picking in the vicinity of the outlets, but this has no effect on packaging driven away in vehicles and ejected from vehicles into the countryside or gardens.\r\nIn this way Motorists could be held appropriately accountable",
        "background": "All packaging from Drive Through food outlets should be marked with the registration number of the vehicle used to make the purchase.  This marking can then be used to identify and prosecute those littering our countryside by throwing packaging from their vehicles.",
