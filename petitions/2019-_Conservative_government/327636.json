        "additional_details": "The largest humanitarian crisis in the world is in Yemen, with a cholera, famine AND coronavirus outbreak AND a war all happening at the same time. The United Kingdom is a country of power and government officials should use that power and voice that it has to help tackle this crisis. Ignoring the situation will only expose the true colours this government has to offer, and ignoring the cries and the blood that has been spilled only shows that you have sided with the oppressor. If we don't act now as a country, Yemen WILL go extinct, and this country WILL be part of the reason why.",
        "background": "Government must discuss and implement actions that can be taken to prevent the extinction of thousands of Yemeni men, women and children. Houthis - a Shia rebel group loyal to former president Saleh - and the forces loyal to the new Hadi government, has conflicted only to spark a devastating impact.",
