        "additional_details": "These ratings put horrendous pressure on teachers and we believe are not effective at improving school standards. It is awful that it has taken tragic recent events for this issue to be widely acknowledged and taken seriously by the media. A report card system would allow Ofsted to give nuanced and constructive feedback to schools to support them to improve, without the pressure of trying to secure a particular rating.",
        "background": "Abolish the ratings system for Ofsted inspections (where schools are graded \"outstanding\", \"good\", \"requires improvement\", or \"inadequate\"). Ofsted should publish report cards following inspections, but these should not include ratings.",
