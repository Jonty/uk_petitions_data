        "additional_details": "Ringing in the New Year 2021 two months early would be of infinite benefit to the United Kingdom. Much of the populace is traumatised by 2020 as it progresses. Each ping of a phone induces angst as we await whatever fresh hell is about to be sprung upon us. So why draw out this misery? Introducing 2021 early would have benefits across the board. It would improve economic figures. It would improve morale. And if we were really lucky, it would shorten the wait for the next Bond movie.",
