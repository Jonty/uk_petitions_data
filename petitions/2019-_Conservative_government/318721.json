        "additional_details": "If grade requirements are scrapped then anyone with extremely low grades could get into a top university which would not match the university's reputation. An example would be, if a university needs Biology as ab A level to do Neuroscience bsc, and I originally applied for psychology, since they are both subjects in a similar field, and if my grade is close to what they originally wanted, I get to study there. Thus, all students go through a clearing process giving motivation to all students.",
        "background": "I am a student who's exams have been cancelled just like everyone else's in the UK and like many, have lost motivation. The best idea is to scrap entry requirements from every university for just this year. What I mean by this is scrap subject entry requirements and not grade entry requirements.",
