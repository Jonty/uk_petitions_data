We think it is flawed and benefits the Government and not those that genuinely require help and income support.\r\n \r\nFarming is not a monthly business, it\u2019s barely yearly! You might sow in one financial year and harvest it in the next. We believe farming is not typical self-employment, your profit/income may not be determined on your hours or endless hard work but on uncontrollable factors.\r\n",
