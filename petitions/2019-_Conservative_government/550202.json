        "additional_details": "Occasionally Members of Parliament as well as non-Members have been found in contempt of parliament, for example by refusing to appear before a Select Committee or for failing to publish legal advice in full. \r\n\r\nBeyond admonishment, contempt of parliament rarely appears to have any consequences, even when it leads to severe disruption of parliamentary business. \r\nIn recent years, the House has been at increasing risk of improper obstruction and weakening of its functions. This needs to change.",
        "background": "Contempt of Parliament needs to be made a criminal offence, punishable by a substantial fine or imprisonment, depending on the severity of the contempt committed. The House needs to use its penal jurisdiction more assertively given how serious the interference with parliamentary function has been.",
