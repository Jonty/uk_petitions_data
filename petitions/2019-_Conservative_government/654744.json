        "additional_details": "We believe the country is at a crisis point regarding dental services. Many people simply can't register with any dental practice. There are accounts of people performing unsafe DIY dentistry, for example extracting their own teeth and using super glue to try to fix crowns and dentures. You might expect this in third world Countries but we are in 21st Century England. Let's make our country Great again by improving dental service for everyone.",
        "background": "We believe NHS dental services are at an all-time low. The NHS system is failing to meet the needs of many people who cannot afford private treatment. We want the Government to increase funding for NHS dental services so everyone can register with an NHS dentist and access NHS dental services.",
