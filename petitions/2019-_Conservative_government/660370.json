        "additional_details": "There are many national scandals where the Government has put in place compensation schemes, but it has taken years or decades for compensation to be paid.  We believe paying compensation to the beneficiaries of a victim's estate would stop the Government and other organisations being able to avoid paying compensation for these national scandals because the victims have died.",
        "background": "Many victims have been denied justice by dying before receiving compensation they otherwise would have received.  Their families and beneficiaries may have suffered with them because of the injustice, and its long-term consequences, but often aren't entitled to Government compensation schemes.",
