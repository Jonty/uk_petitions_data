        "additional_details": "This will mean the general public being inconvenienced on their way to and from work, for some people it will mean having to spend an absolute fortune to get taxis to and from work and it will also mean school children not being able to get into school and their parents having to take time off work. This is not on. We would all like an inflation-busting pay rise but public transport workers need to accept that we are in a cost of living crisis. They will just have to grin and bear it.",
