        "additional_details": "EasyJet have recently asked for \u00a3600Million government bailout which has been approved yet despite breaching the above laws they are still refusing to refund customers. Staff no longer have authority to process a refund with access removed. Refund periods have been amended by EasyJet from 7 days to 28 days and now 90 days. Taxpayers money should not be made available to EasyJet until they fully refund all customers and compensate all customers who have waited longer than 7 days for a refund.",
        "background": "The Denied Boarding Regulation (Regulation 261/2004 EC) states an airline must refund passengers within a max 7days. Similarly under Contract Law, their is an offer & acceptance based on T&C's at the time which cannot be amended later to suit one party unless both agree. EasyJet have breached both.",
