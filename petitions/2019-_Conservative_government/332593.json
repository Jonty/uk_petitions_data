Unlike Scotland where there is an enforcement in place. While trying to sell our home we have lost a buyer 3 times.  Most recently we have chased the process through for 5 months only for our buyer to have a change of heart the week before we were due to move. This has left us as a family in devastation.",

This is to ensure serious intentions of the buyer avoiding financial, emotional and mental impact if the buyer later withdraws.",
