Social distancing could not be managed in most schools and staff and pupils could spread the virus easily, in large numbers, as even though the peak has passed, the virus is still present.",
        "background": "Keep all schools closed until the beginning of September, when they would open normally for the next academic year. Instead of putting our country at risk of a second COVID19 wave, ask teachers to teach through calls and such, to improve education at these times.",
