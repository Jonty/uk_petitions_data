        "additional_details": "The Victoria cross is awarded \"for most conspicuous bravery, or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice, or extreme devotion to duty in the presence of the enemy.\"\r\n\r\nOur NHS is fighting a war against Covid-19, with every hospital in the UK a battlefield. NHS professionals are fully aware that not having PPE could kill them.\r\n\r\nAbdul Mabud Chowdhury and others are as brave as soldiers who risk their own lives to save other soldiers. They deserve the same recognition, as national heroes.",
        "background": "On the 18th of March Abdul Mabud Chowdhury warned Boris Johnson that the lack of PPE was putting NHS workers at risk.\r\n\r\nDespite not being issued with that essential PPE he continued to put his life at risk to save patients.\r\n\r\nSadly he and other NHS workers have caught Covid-19 and died from it.",
