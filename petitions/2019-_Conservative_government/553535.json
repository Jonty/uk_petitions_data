Teachers sometimes say that it is so students don't forget what they've learned. However, students wouldn't purposely spread their homework over time off making sure they won't forget anything. Everyone will try to get it out of the way ASAP and have some rest and family time! Those who need to catch up just get overloaded, have no time for rest and stress builds up.",
