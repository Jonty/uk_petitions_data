It is important that they are looked after during their demanding shifts.\r\n\r\nI believe the government should provide free meals by the way of vouchers or using caterers during this period. \r\n\r\nStaff are likely to be volunteering to complete longer shifts or additional days to cope with the demand. They need to be replenished and this would be the right way to do it.",
