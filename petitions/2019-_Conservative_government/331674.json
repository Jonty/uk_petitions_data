        "additional_details": "Between April 2018 and March 2019 over 375,000 stop and searches were carried out in England and Wales, with roughly around 16% of those leading to arrests. Meaning that over 300,000 people were stoped based on their appearance.\r\nDuring Lockdown in London alone 22,000 black males where detained under stop and search.\r\nMany people are being targeted without real grounds to do so and it is getting out of hand.\r\nIf there were to be a limit introduced this would reduce the issue of profiling.",
        "background": "Limit the number of Stop and Searches allowed to be carried out by Police in England and Wales to help prevent profiling of innocent people.\r\nIf a cap is introduced it would encourage police officers to be more considerate before taking actions towards people based on their appearance or race.",
