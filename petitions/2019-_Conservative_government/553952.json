        "additional_details": "The Government wants businesses to stay open, and to boost the economy. The evidence is that transmission is lower risk outdoors than indoors, so as long as the guidelines are followed and rules enforced it should be possible to allow funfairs to operate. If not for the economy then for mental health. People need something like the funfair to take their mind off of things and give them some sense of freedom and nostalgia.",
