Every year, millions of frogs are taken from their homes in the wild. Baby pigs are cut from their mothers\u2019 wombs in slaughterhouses. Rabbits, mice, rats, and other small animals are bred in warehouses and never allowed to experience a happy or natural life. Instead, their whole lives are spent in cramped cages until it\u2019s time to be killed for dissection.",
