        "additional_details": "The request to lift the 1% pay cap is not a plea to reward public sector workers, it is a plea for the government to pay them what they have always deserved.\r\n\r\nWe must never forget this time in our history because it is in this crisis that we remembered what is important to our society. \r\n\r\nI am truly grateful for a National Health Service that is free at the point of use but it is powerless without all the staff and support services who make it what it is today\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s our turn to fight for them.",
        "background": "Imagine our fight against Coronavirus without the courageous and dedicated NHS staff, emergency services and all the key workers, who have been working whilst we sleep.\r\n\r\nThey have chosen to risk their lives to save ours and to fight an enemy that even they cannot see.",
