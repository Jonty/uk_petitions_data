        "additional_details": "We need a review whereby at a minimum only Higher Rate tax paying families are the ones effected by this high income benefit charge. Basic tax payers should not be charged this. \r\nIt was not the original concept and idea of this charge to impact basic rate tax paying families.\r\nThe High income benefit charge had remained stagnate and not increased with inflation since 2013.",
        "background": "April 2021 will see the first time the High Income Benefit Charge effects the basic rate tax payer.\r\nWith the charge coming in at \u00a350,000 but the higher rate tax band increasing to \u00a350270\r\nAt a minimum the high income benefit charge should only be applicable to those who are taxed at a higher rate.",
