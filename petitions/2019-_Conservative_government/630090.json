This means many kids are going hungry at school. In relation to academy ran schools dinner breaks have been cut to 30 minutes. This isn't enough time for entire schools. Also some.schools run out of food, moreover some student have extra activities in their lunch breaks so 30 minutes isn't enough to queue and eat also.",
