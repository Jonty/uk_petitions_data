We have warehouse workers working shifts patterns and office people are crossing shifts and they don't have to wear a face mask. They are putting other people at risk if they are across shift 1  and shift 2 and they don't have to wear a face mask. Its not fair to other employees who must do a physical work with the face mask on .",

Office staff crossing shift pattern so they can see people from shift 1 and shift 2 and they do not have to wear a face mask which is wrong and unfair to other warehouse employees.",
