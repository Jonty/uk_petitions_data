This just isn't possible in areas of low population where there are much lower numbers. Why should these schools be forced to close just because of lack of funding. You allow companies to charge standing charges on electric and water for instance. All schools whatever the size have fixed overheads and these should be covered first. Then an amount per pupil added on even if it is less than is currently paid.",
        "background": "Currently you only provide an amount per pupil. What is needed to make funding fairer is that all schools get the same basic amount say \u00a3900,000 per year towards fixed costs and overheads like heating and water. Then an amount per pupil on top of this. At present small schools are at a disadvantage.",
