        "additional_details": "I propose that the Government extend the Stamp Duty holiday until June 21st, 2022, which will mark a year (hopefully) since ALL citizens were lawfully allowed to return to their place of work. \r\n\r\nThis will not recompense for lost earnings, nor will it make up for 12 months of frugal spending, but it would be indispensable to those looking to purchase a home (especially first-time buyers). I genuinely believe that without this relief many will be forced to defer their plans or surrender them entirely.",
        "background": "By the time final restrictions are lifted on June 21st, 2021, some will be approaching their 15th month of unanticipated financial strain. Whilst we can't undo that hardship or replenish spent savings, we should be able to mitigate Stamp Duty and the threat it poses to so many life-long dreams.",
