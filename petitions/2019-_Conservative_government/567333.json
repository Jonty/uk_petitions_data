        "action": "Partially refund all university students for their accommodation fees",
        "additional_details": "Throughout this pandemic, students have had to adapt to online learning, paying in full for courses that aren\u2019t delivering the same experience as precious years. On top of this, students are now being asked to pay for accommodation that they\u2019ve been confined to throughout stages of the pandemic and accommodation that is now inaccessible to most students (with some exceptions). The government have instructed students not to return to university, yet they\u2019re still being expected to pay for rent.",
        "background": "I believe university students across the country should be at least partially refunded for their accommodation fees as they\u2019re no longer allowed access. Most students have been told not to return to university until February half term at the earliest but are being expected to pay rent.",
