Amongst them are people entrusted as carers for children of friends who were unable to leave. These vulnerable groups are currently excluded from entering the UK.\r\n\r\nSafeguarding these children is paramount. But this process must not be allowed to cause harmful delays in seeking refuge within the UK when there are people ready and waiting to welcome them into their homes.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to urgently support groups such as these.",
