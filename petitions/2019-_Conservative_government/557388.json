        "additional_details": "Everyone needs to be able to exercise for their mental and physical health, particularly during the winter months. People use swimming as a low impact exercise to keep them mobile. The mental health benefits of exercise are widely known and the added benefit of spending time outdoors for both your mental and physical well being should not be under estimated. People have turned to swimming outdoors as a saviour during this pandemic and to take it away from them now would do more harm than good.",
        "background": "Allow outdoor swimming pools and lidos to continue operating during lockdowns. Provided all the safe Covid-19 operating procedures are in place . Class them as safe and essential outdoor exercise for people to keep fit and healthy during the pandemic.",
