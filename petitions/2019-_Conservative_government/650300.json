        "additional_details": "The Government must introduce a Government Bill to keep its promise to voters and protect wildlife. \r\n\r\nTrophy hunters target animals already under increasing pressure from habitat loss, climate change, poaching and illegal wildlife trade. Trophies from leopards, elephants and even polar bears have been imported to the UK. Some hunting clubs reward the use of weapons that can cause enormous suffering, such as bows and arrows. One poll showed that 80% of the British public support a ban.\r\n \r\nA Bill to stop imports of hunting trophies was recently blocked in the House of Lords. The Government must seek to ensure a ban becomes law.\r\n",
        "background": "The Government made a manifesto commitment to ban imports of hunting trophies from endangered animals but has so far failed to deliver and legislation was not announced in the recent King\u2019s Speech. \r\n \r\n",
