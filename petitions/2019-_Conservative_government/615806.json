        "additional_details": "Current year 10 pupils have missed out on a lot of the school curriculum in years 8 and 9. If they don\u2019t get adaptations for the 2023 GCSEs its extremely unfair as most year 10 pupils didn\u2019t get to do subjects thoroughly like IT, music, drama, food technology, english and many science practicals from all three sciences. I think we need to know if the current year 10s are going to do their GCSEs with adaptations or not ahead of time, so teachers and parents will know way beforehand.",
        "background": "Speaking on behalf of the public, we want current 2023 GCSE exams to be altered like the current year 11s. If the Government do this, the 2023 GCSEs will be a lot less stressful on students who have suffered during covid with the school curriculum.",
