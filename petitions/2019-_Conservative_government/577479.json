        "action": "Abolish VAT for the fitness industry",
        "additional_details": "Public physical and mental health is helped by the activities carried out in gym businesses across the UK. Placing the burden of tax on businesses that are beneficial to health whilst alleviating this cost to businesses and consumers within the hospitality sector is a perverse logic. The government should incentivise better public health and fitness particularly in light of the fact that Covid cases have been more deadly in those with a poorer level of physical well-being.",
        "background": "Gym and exercise driven businesses have been forced to close during the pandemic and have not been given the attractive 5% VAT rate that hospitality has, despite the obvious benefit to public health. There should be a temporary cut to 5% for 12mths along with a review for long term reductions",
