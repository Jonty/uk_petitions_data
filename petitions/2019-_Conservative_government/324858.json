        "additional_details": "The coronavirus pandemic has had a horrendous effect on our UK zoos which find themselves in financial difficulty as their income has dried up. \r\n\r\nThey are now ready to reopen. Safety measures have already been put in place to protect everyone, including; Restricting the number of visitors on site, online bookings with timed arrival slots, closure of many indoor areas, implementing a one-way route, enforcing social distancing and placing multiple hygiene stations throughout.",
        "background": "Please let our zoos reopen so they can care for their animals and continue helping endangered species. A change in the law has seen zoos added to a list ordered to stay closed 'indefinitely', even though they have made themselves Covid-secure and other outdoor spaces have been allowed to open.",
