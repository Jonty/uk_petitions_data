        "additional_details": "References to the UK Empire ignore the historical context in which the Empire was created and the exploitation of both the people and resources of the countries which were part of it. Its existence enriched the UK at the expense of these people and countries and its impact persists to the present.\r\n\r\nIt is now widely recognised that the Empire is not something to be celebrated. To continue to reference it when honouring people today is not just inappropriate, but insulting.",
