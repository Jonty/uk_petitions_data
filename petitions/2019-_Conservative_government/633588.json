With the current price rises, everyone is struggling, meaning many people who are under 35 on benefits are struggling to pay their rent. This can mean people being forced into unsafe, and unfair living arrangements, and having to choose between food, gas, electric or a roof. This age discrimination to those under 35.\r\n",
