We would like to this to be extended to people guilty of child sexual offences or child abuse, to prevent offenders exercising parental rights either from jail or after release.\r\n \r\nWe believe the safety of all our children in the United Kingdom should be safe guarded by law from the moment offenders are found guilty,\r\n",
