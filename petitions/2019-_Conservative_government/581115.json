        "action": "Return the Elgin Marbles to Greece",
        "additional_details": "The Elgin Marbles were purchased by Lord Elgin from the occupying Ottoman Empire and later sold by him to the British Museum.  On the face of it these were not illegal transactions however as the original sale was not sanctioned by the Greek state or the Greek people they amount to the sale of stolen goods. Today, 25th March 2021 is the 200th anniversary of Greek independence from the Ottoman Empire and as such it is an appropriate time to return the Marbles to their true owner.",
        "background": "The Government should enact legislation to ensure the return of the Elgin marbles to Greece.  Whilst the Marbles are a work of art in their own right they form a part of a larger wonder of the world and should be reunited with the Parthenon.",
