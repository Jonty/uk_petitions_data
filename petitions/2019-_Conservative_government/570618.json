        "action": "Allow adults who have been driving for 15 years or more to pass learners.",
        "additional_details": "This should be allowed because these drivers are highly experienced and must know driving back to front. They\u2019re also unlikely to be biased as they\u2019re likely to be mature at their age and therefore would not want to risk having unsafe drivers on the road. This will help clear the backlog of learners significantly so that there is less strain on the DVSA and people can finally drive themselves around without having to get public transport where Covid may be present.",
        "background": "The government should allow adults who have a driving license of 15 years or more to pass learners if they think they are ready to drive unaccompanied.",
