In a survey of social workers carried out by Community Care, social workers reported being threatened with weapons, verbally abused, stabbed, held hostage, harassed in the street and having hot drinks thrown on them. Some had to move house or leave their jobs due to persistent abuse. Social workers are on the frontline and are often needed to work in emergency situations.",
