        "additional_details": "The typical sibling isn't always from the same marriage/partner and half/step siblings are often common place in families due to seperated parents. If a parent with custody stops siblings seeing eachother, the siblings have no legal standing and are made to suffer through no fault of their own. Assuming the siblings meet conditions as parental visitation rights have to meet (what's best for the children etc.) I believe we should give siblings the right to see one another.",
        "background": "We would like Parliament to introduce rights for siblings to have contact with one another. As divorces with parents become more common, so does needless pain for siblings, incl half & step, being seperated through no fault of their own and parents blocking access for siblings to see eachother.",
