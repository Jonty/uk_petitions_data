        "additional_details": "If the Government is to keep Early Years settings open they need to provide the resources to make them safer. This could be achieved through rapid screening of children and staff along with making staff a priority for vaccines. With the schools closed they should divert the resources they have in place to the Early Years sector. Or the government should close settings in line with all other educational settings until this can be provided.",
        "background": "The Early Years Sector has been widely over looked by the government. Routine testing takes places in care homes, hospitals and soon schools. Staff have to work in close contact with children with no PPE. We need protection through Covid screening and priority access to vaccinations.",
