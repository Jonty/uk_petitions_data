        "additional_details": "The Government introduced the Health and Care Worker visa in August 2020 with a reduced visa application fee compared to that paid by other skilled workers including exemption from the immigration health surcharge, with a view to make it cheaper and easier for the best health and care professionals around the globe to work in our brilliant NHS. But the Home Office still charge exorbitant fee for ILR . The Government should reduce the ILR fee to retain health workers in our NHS.",
        "background": "The Home office is charging almost ten times the actual processing cost  of indefinite leave to remain application fee from overseas health care workers. The Government should stop making profit from foreign health workers and instead seek to retain those foreign doctors and nurses in our NHS.",
