The Eurovision song contest is a politically motivated show and therefore as an impartial broadcaster the BBC should not be spending the publics money on this.  Therefore the government should recommend to the BBC not to fund this any more.",

The BBC is funded by the public and as such their money should not be wasted time and time again on a novelty programme that draws in minimum viewers and has a politically motivated scoring system.",
