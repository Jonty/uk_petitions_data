Experiments on such dogs, and other animals, are today widely reported to be entirely failing the search for human treatments and cures.\r\n\r\nCurrent science from multiple fields proves that animal-based research and testing is not viable. The Government should therefore change the law to include laboratory animals under the protection of the Animal Welfare Act, to prevent their unnecessary suffering. \r\n",

Laboratory animals are currently not protected by the Act and are therefore victims of 'unnecessary suffering' (see section 4 of the Act: https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/45/section/4).  ",
