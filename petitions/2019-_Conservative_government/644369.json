        "additional_details": "By limiting MPs to two terms, I believe we can increase their accountability to their constituents. Knowing that they have a finite time in office, MPs may be more motivated to deliver on their promises and work diligently to represent the interests of their constituents. Term limits help prevent the emergence of career politicians who may become disconnected from the concerns of everyday citizens. Restoring trust in democracy.",
        "background": "I submit this petition for limiting the terms of Members of Parliament (MPs) to a maximum of two terms in office. I believe that this change is essential to ensure a more dynamic and accountable political landscape, and enhance the democratic process.",
