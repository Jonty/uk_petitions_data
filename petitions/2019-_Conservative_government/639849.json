        "additional_details": "Currently non-binary people are not recognised in law. This leads to misgendering, especially in institutional organisations. Having our gender legally recognised would help us to feel so much more respected and accepted within society, in accordance with fundamental British values. Non-binary people have campaigned for years to be recognised, a change is needed. We want to be seen within society and currently we feel hushed away. Change the law so we can have our place recognised in society.",
        "background": "The Government needs to recognise non-binary as a legal gender. Non-binary people in the LGBTQ+ community feels silenced and invisible. We need the Government to reform the Gender Recognition Act 2004 to legally recognise non-binary as a gender and help non-binary people to feel heard",
