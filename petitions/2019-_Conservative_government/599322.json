The consultant said if this had been picked up sooner bracing and scroth physio could have been used to stabilise the curve through growth.\r\n \r\nScreening is easy and non-invasive, and many American schools already do this, and many cases are picked up at this point.",

Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is a change in the shape of the spine during the child\u2019s growth normally linked to puberty. Early detection can effect the course of the treatment.",
