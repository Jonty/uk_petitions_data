        "action": "Introduce Covid-19 vaccine passports",
        "additional_details": "We believe that we all need to get vaccinated to protect ourselves and our communites.   Unless a large percentage of the population is vaccinated there is a risk that Covid-19 will spread further and mutations may occur. No vaccine is 100% effective but they offer excellent protection for the general public and are the best way to end the repeated cycle of lockdowns.",
        "background": "We want the Government to commit to rolling out e-vaccination status/immunity passports to the British public. Such passports would encourage uptake of the vaccine, increase protection for the general public, reduce the burden on the NHS and help life get back to normal.",
