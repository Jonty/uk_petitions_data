The platform must report the personal details of \"sellers\" and their sales records to HMRC. Platforms can be fined \u00a35,000 + \u00a3600 per day for failing to provide information to HMRC. Platforms will now have to verify the ID of ALL sellers to avoid the heavy fines, possibly making a loss on customers who only sell a few items or passing on this cost to sellers.\r\n",
