        "additional_details": "The Home Office has identified a number of countries from which asylum claims can be said to be \"manifestly-well founded.\" It proposes to deal with these by requiring asylum seekers to complete a lengthy, complex form, in English, within 20 days. This is an onerous burden to place on new arrivals, whose first language is unlikely to be English, and for whom it may be difficult to obtain professional help with the form within the 20 days. We believe this will not help reduce the backlog and could lead to additional appeals.",

The Government has introduced what it calls a \"streamlined asylum processing model\" for processing some \"manifestly well-founded cases\". We want these claims approved immediately.",
