        "additional_details": "Period poverty is an issue that still affects over 1 million people across the UK, and impacts many factors of their lives. This includes being able to attend work or school. While period products are now free within schools, they are still not free in most workplaces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Nobody should be forced to miss work because of their period, or accessibility issues.",
        "background": "Period products should be free and accessible to all of those who require them, in all workplaces. They should be provided, free of charge in workplace bathrooms, and the barrier of payment should not be an issue that people have to face.",
