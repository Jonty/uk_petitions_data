        "additional_details": "I do not want other mums to have to suffer the most horrendous cancer journey like I have. No mother should have to witness their child enduring the most horrific pain caused by cancer, or to witness the debilitating after-effects of outdated and harmful treatments. My beautiful daughter, Sophie, at just 10 years of age, was taken from us on 18th September 2021 by this horrid disease. We must provide more funding to find new drugs and a cure for childhood cancers.",
        "background": "The Government & Parliament must ensure more research funding in the UK is dedicated to childhood cancer research, which currently makes up only 2-3% of cancer research funding in the UK. We need investment into new treatments, to replace outdated & harmful drugs that have not changed in decades.",
