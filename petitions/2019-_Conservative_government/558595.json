If we have the responsibility to evaluate the competency of our government we need visibility on the data that is informing their decisions. Data authoritarianism leads to mistrust and undermines cooperation with government policy. The more eyes are on the data, the less chance there is that it will be misconstrued or mistrusted. The UK must become a data driven country thus we your sovereign request exposure to our data.",
