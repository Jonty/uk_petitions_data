        "additional_details": "During the pandemic many self-employed business owners received grants, whereas small Limited Companies, operating on a similar basis to self-employed, had to turn to the Bounce Back Loan to provide desperate monetary assistance.\r\n \r\nHowever, unlike a grant, the loan needs paying back and right in the middle of the worst cost of living crisis. The timing of all of this could not be worse, but it seems unfair to pay grants to one type of small business owner while only loans were made available to another.",
        "background": "We want the Government to help small businesses who are still trying to get back on their feet and now feeling the financial burden of the Bounce Back Loan repayments, whilst trying to turn their business around in the middle of a major cost of living and heightened inflation crisis.",
