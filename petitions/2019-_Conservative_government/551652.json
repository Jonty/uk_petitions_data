        "additional_details": "We need financial help to survive until able to freely perform. Until the government impose restrictions we don't get hired as it is too difficult for venues and institutions to sustain costs and operate within the law. Some will have to find alternative employment and UK will kill arts and entertainment. We cannot easily find an alternative after a lifetime as professinal artists. We won't be the fist choice of employment from other industries. We need a basic income, SEISS/furlough extension.",
        "background": "Artists, musicians, Djs, actors and many more, self employed and not, working in entertainment and other industries cannot operate fully if not at all because of social distancing. There are less open venues than before and those open cannot hire us because they don't have the same budget as before.",
