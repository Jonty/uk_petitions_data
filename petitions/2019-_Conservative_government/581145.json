        "additional_details": "We want the UK government to investigate how much paid leave would be appropriate, and to introduce a policy whereby any woman who miscarries would be able to take paid time off to recover, if she feels she needs it. \r\n\r\nIn New Zealand, anyone who miscarries is entitled to three days paid leave. This isn't a huge amount - but it's enough time to deal with the initial physical disruption that comes with pregnancy loss, and it's a whole lot better than nothing.",
        "background": "Currently, if you miscarry before 24 weeks (almost six months) you are not entitled to any paid leave - it will be at the discretion of your doctor to sign you off, or not. We are asking for statutory paid miscarriage leave, similar to what the New Zealand government have recently introduced.",
