        "additional_details": "In the UK if you are faced with a criminal attempting to physically or sexually assault you, you may be able to run away or call the police but for many victims these options were not viable and they were battered, robbed, raped or in extreme cases killed. There are going to be a number of future victims but we can help lower this number! There is no easy way to defend against an immediate crimal attack but non-lethal self-defence equipment can assist and prevent an attack, isn't that worth it?",
        "background": "Amend the Firearms Act 1968 and any subsequent laws so that a member of the public can carry self-defence equipment such as pepper spray or a taser so long as they have no prior criminal convictions.\r\nAlso allow/legalise the manafcturing and selling of such equipment in the UK.",
