        "additional_details": "While the Northumberland Line is a very welcome reopening of a closed passenger route linking Ashington, Bedlington, Blyth and other communities to Newcastle Upon Tyne; the 'Northumberland Loop' could add rail connectivity to North Northumberland & into Scotland at low cost & quick implementation. If long distance services run via this route other cities in UK (such as York & London) could be connected to this area helping drive economic growth in one of UK's most economically deprived regions.",
