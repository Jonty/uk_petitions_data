        "additional_details": "It is vital masks are made optional ideally ASAP, or June 21.  I wear one day in day out. It is not just an inconvenience, it is horrible. Most of my colleagues feel the same.  Let those who wish to wear them do so, but rescind the law. Vaccinations and 'herd immunity' are better protection than a screwed up re-used mask worn just out of compliance, because that is reality. I never thought I'd live in a country where unimpeded breathing is a crime. Masks are unnatural and unnecessary.",
        "background": "Scrap the mask law. Masks are farcical, uncomfortable and extremely difficult to work in 8 hours a day week in week out. Evidence states they work when worn 'effectively ' if not worn effectively they are just worn for compliance and control nothing to do with 'safety'. They cause so many problems.",
