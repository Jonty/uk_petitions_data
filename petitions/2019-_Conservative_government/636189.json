        "additional_details": "We believe the Government isn't taking a short, medium or long term view for social care.\r\n \r\nAbout 400,000 people left their jobs in 2022, 1/4 of the workforce. If this isn't addressed frail and vulnerable people will go without the care they need.\r\n \r\nThere are 165,000 vacancies, a 52% increase on the previous year and the highest on record.\r\n \r\nCare workers were paid an average hourly rate of \u00a39.66 in the independent sector and \u00a311.03 in the public sector.\r\n \r\nIncreased investment in workforce development is what is needed.\r\n",
        "background": "The Government had previously announced \u00a3500 million to improve recruitment, retention, progression, and staff wellbeing in social care. This has now been cut by 50% to \u00a3250 million. We believe this should be increased back to the \u00a3500 million originally announced.",
