        "additional_details": "The extraction of natural gas will unbalance the ecology of the area,  damage wildlife,  damage fauna such as sea grass meadows that are vital in carbon sequestration.  The loss of such habitats will cause an imbalance in the forecast \u2018offsetting\u2019 of ecological damage and also does not help the govt image and claims to be carbon neutral by 2050.  The extraction, building infrastructure, storage and transportation all add to the carbon costs as well as damaging the carbon capture capability.",
        "background": "UK Govt funded extraction of Natural Gas by Total and the St. Ives LNG company will affect the local coastline and be detrimental to the ecology of the surrounding area.  The impact is incalculable and irrevocable.  The lasting effects will damage the natural beauty and fragility for decades.",
