        "additional_details": "We cant expect young children to be following the rules of social distancing and hand washing because they are young, nursery ages can start from a few months old and if we are truly honest, one thing we all know is kids put objects in their mouth, they spread germs and Is it really a good idea to have the youngest still in school?\r\nJust because not every child will be effected by this virus doesn't mean the rest of the household or bubble is safe. Is keeping nursery's open r\r\nworth the risk?",
        "background": "Parliment need to fully embrace the closing of schools to lower the spread of covid MEANING nursery's should also be asked to close as although the children may not be showing symptoms or have as bad a reaction to covid itself they are able to spread within their class bubbles.\u00a0",
