Someone can provide the most loving care for their pet/be an amazing owner but an accident/injury that costs lots upfront can be inaccessible. Some owners of animals with conditions sadly abandon them due to fees. Creating a national Pet Health Service should reduce abandoned/surrendered animals massively. Private vets should have an option to participate but PHS clinics should also be created by the Government.",
