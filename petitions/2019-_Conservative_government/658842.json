        "additional_details": "We think this needs to be changed so these parents are able to concentrate on being carers without the added stress of not being entitled to 30 hours of free childcare for their younger children.\r\n \r\nNursery is a fantastic place for children to grow yet if they have siblings who are disabled and the parent is unable to work because they care for them they cannot benefit from free childcare. We think this should change.",
        "background": "Parents who are unable to work due to staying home to care for a disabled child(ren) are unable to claim 30 free hours childcare for any other children. We believe this should not be the case as the parents who care for their disabled children are doing a full-time job but just from home.",
