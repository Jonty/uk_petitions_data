        "additional_details": "Australia and New Zealand already provide paid leave, and Northern Ireland / Ireland have passed legislation to provide for its introduction.\r\n \r\nAs a family lawyer I have seen first-hand the long-lasting traumatic emotional impact upon victims of domestic abuse. I have seen clients struggle to get time off work for important meetings such as applications for non-molestation orders or urgent Children Act applications. Victims should not be worried about finances at such a devastating point in their lives.\r\n \r\nMore needs to be done to offer victims assistance and support. Such a provision is a move in the right direction.",
        "background": "The statistics over the years show that domestic abuse is regrettably prevalent and on the increase in our society.\r\n\r\nOffering paid statutory leave for victims of domestic abuse is a sign of a progressive British society.",
