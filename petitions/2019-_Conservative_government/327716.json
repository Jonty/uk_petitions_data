        "additional_details": "These two departments often have conflicting interests that would hinder their ability to co-operate (as seen with the Pergau Dam scandal). The DfID needs to be able to distribute its aid to the world\u2019s most impoverished regions without its decisions being influenced by the diverging motives of the FCO.\r\nThe FCO also spends only 25% of its international aid on poverty-focused projects (source - Real Aid Index) so are too biased to take control of the DfID\u2019s budget and distribute this aid fairly.",
        "background": "Separate the DfID and the FCO back into their previous departments instead of allowing them to stay as a single department so that their respective duties can be carried out effectively and unbiasedly.",
