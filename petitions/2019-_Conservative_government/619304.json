They are the generation who have not been subjected to nicotine filled public places and should be the generation choosing not to fill their lungs with potentially harming products. But now we find that E-Liquids appeal to them. Why?  One reason is retailers are displaying them directly on counters in cartoon/colourful packaging like sweets. Lock E-Products behind the counters like tobacco products.",

The use of these designs directly appeals to under 18s a market the product sellers have no right to sell to so should not be trying to appeal to.",
