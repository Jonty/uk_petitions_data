        "additional_details": "I would like the government to step in to stop archaic rules being implemented in public schools which strip pupils of their basic rights. Stop Locking the toilets during lessons and allow pupils access when they need it. Schools are putting pupils at risk by making them hold it in. It is school not prison. Retrain those teachers who try to implement these rules.",
        "background": "Uphold the basic rights to sanitation for all pupils in England and wales. Allow access to toilets during lessons. Imagine the mental stress if a pupil soils themselves in front of other students. If I can go to the toilet during work, why can\u2019t pupils go during lessons.",
