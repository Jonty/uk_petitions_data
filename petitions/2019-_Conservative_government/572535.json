        "additional_details": "I would like to see the UK Government instigate a deposit scheme on all single-use glass, plastic, steel and aluminium bottles and cans that are sold singly or part of a multi pack in the UK. The scheme should fund a local repository and collection service that ensures the Items are recycled rather than littered across the UK Countryside, Towns and Cities. The scheme should also support research into the manufacture of biodegradable single-use glass, plastic, steel and aluminium bottles and cans. The education of the British public to engage in local conservation actions to collect, remove  and recycle these products within their local areas. I think the majority of the UK would relish the opportunity to banish the said waste products before the environmental effects  become irreversible.",
        "background": "The UK government to launch a consultation on a deposit scheme that could see a refundable charge added to the cost of single-use glass, plastic, steel and aluminium bottles and cans sold in the UK in an effort to combat pollution, reduce waste and increase recycling.",
