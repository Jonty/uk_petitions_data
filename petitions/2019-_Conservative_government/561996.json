The Wedding industry is a largely viable sector & with no road map we cannot advise couples on how to move forward in the future. Instead we are dealing with cancellations up to a year in advance as there is no guidance available on how things will be able to return. Many venues can provide the space needed to socially distance, and whilst indoor entertainment can now return to 1000, Weddings are still limited to 15.",
