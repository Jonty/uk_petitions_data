        "additional_details": "I believe all women should receive care and support during and after miscarriage. There should be follow ups post miscarriage to check blood levels as there\u2019s potentially a lot of blood loss and low iron as a result. There should also be checks to ensure that a woman isn\u2019t experiencing infection, that the blood loss they\u2019re experiencing is normal/abnormal and that they don\u2019t have retained tissue. Women and partners should be offered emotional support to help them through this time.",
        "background": "Miscarriage is an extremely traumatic time. After care is pretty non existent. Women are merely told to take a pregnancy test 3 weeks following miscarriage- if it\u2019s negative they\u2019re told there\u2019s no need to contact hospital. Women have no follow up at all to check basic things like blood loss etc.",
