        "additional_details": "The eastern leg of HS2 could be transformative to the North and the Midlands. It would free up space on existing lines for more local services and could help reduce carbon emissions. After the COP26 conference the Government must invest in projects that help move the country to net zero. Increasing rail ridership is a major way to do this.",
        "background": "The Government must build the eastern leg of HS2 in full to deliver it's promise to level up the North. To achieve the full benefits of Phase 1 the full Y shaped network must be built. The planned route is a result of years of work. We believe it is the best option for the UK rail network.",
