Scrape the unwanted TV tax and make the BBC a subscription channel after all if like the in coming chairman is right,and the BBC licence fee is value for money then it will have no trouble attracting SUBSCRIBERS will it.But it would be good if MP's were to do something useful for the people of this country PLEASE.",
        "background": "To bring the BBC into the 21st century, people should be given a choice on what they spend their money on. Not everyone has loads of money where they can afford to have Netflix on top of the BBC licence fee, scrape the licence fee and people can buy Netflix and Amazon prime for the same price.",
