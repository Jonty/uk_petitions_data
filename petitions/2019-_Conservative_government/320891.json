        "additional_details": "This should be done so parents and staff  know that schools are a safe place which whilst Covid 19 is uncontrolled, they will certainly not be. Many parents believe the reopening of schools is not aimed at the best interests of the children but primarily to act as childcare for workers and to create the herd immunity. Therefore by tying school openings to effective testing these fears can be allayed.",
        "background": "Schools should not be opened for non keyworker children until parents and staff have confidence that Covid 19 can be controlled. Full functionality of the Test Track and Trace systems is important to controlling Covid 19. Therefore school openings must be linked to this regime.",
