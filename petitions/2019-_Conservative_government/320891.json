Many parents believe the reopening of schools is not aimed at the best interests of the children but primarily to act as childcare for workers and to create the herd immunity. Therefore by tying school openings to effective testing these fears can be allayed.",

Full functionality of the Test Track and Trace systems is important to controlling Covid 19. Therefore school openings must be linked to this regime.",
