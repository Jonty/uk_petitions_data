        "additional_details": "I believe that in both economic and environmental terms HS2 is no longer a viable project. As we suffer the ongoing fallout from Covid-19 there is increasingly less justification for a project that will only benefit a small number of people who can afford the ticket price. HS2 has at best only enjoyed lukewarm support amongst a small number of the general public and substantial challenges from the large numbers of people opposed to it. Now, in the post-Covid world, the country's priorities have greatly changed. The Government should acknowledge that we have more pressing concerns, and better ways of spending HS2's \u00a3108bn 2020 budget, than saving 30 minutes on the journey from Leeds to London.",
