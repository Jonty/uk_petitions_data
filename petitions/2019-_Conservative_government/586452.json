If everyone in this country was on a Secure National DNA Database we could have a huge fall in crime, and a massive increase in detection. \r\n\r\nI ask all citizens who care,and want people to be able to walk the streets without fear to support this. Its time we made an effort to protect the vulnerable in society. We can remove dangerous criminality off the streets quickly. This I think is a simple way to achieve making Britain a safer place to live. Your support is needed if you want a safer Britain for all.",
