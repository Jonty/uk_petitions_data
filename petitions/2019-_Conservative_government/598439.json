        "additional_details": "As I feel GP's are still WFH even the Covid19 situation getting better. People working super stores , police, fire fighters and nhs staff in hospitals are working now. It's time to start GP's to start their activities as usual as risk is minimal as they can ask patients to take rapid Covid19 tests before appointments as kits are giving free by most of the pharmacies and GP's can wear complete protective equipment if necessary.",
        "background": "We all can understand the impact of Covid19 for more than 18 months and covid 19 is in control and I believe  GP's and nurses are fully vaccinated and Covid19 cases are getting lower and lower day by  day. Now GP'S need to start their activities as usual and start giving face to face appointments.",
