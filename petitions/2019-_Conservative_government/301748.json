        "action": "Give all an income if schools, workplaces shut during COVID19/Coronavirus scare",
        "additional_details": "A good government has a duty to its citizens during an unprecedented time like this.  Many people do not have the means to provide for themselves without regular income.  They do not have the savings to survive even a month if their workplace closes or if they have to stop work to provide childcare.  People have been paying taxes to the government for years and now expect the government to provide the safety net it needs.",
        "background": "Give adults a basic income of \u00a31500 per month of shutdown and give them \u00a3500 for each of their dependent children.  This could be done via employer's payrolls and also direct to bank accounts of child benefit claimants.  For the self employed it could be done via self-assessment.",
