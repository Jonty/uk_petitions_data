        "additional_details": "Covid-19 takes 14 days to be fought by the body. 3 weeks of no contact would mean that if someone had it, it can only spread to their household who would also have fought it by the end of the 3 weeks. People are breaching the tier system, it costs the country more to be off work than a full lockdown. 1 full lockdown with a month to prepare. If people run out of food they can contact a number set up and will be brought to their door. Police walk power to section people if breaching lockdown rules",
        "background": "Lockdown the UK completely for 3 weeks. \r\nEverything should close. I believe closing everything for 3 weeks would help prevent any further cases of the coronavirus. \r\nThe only things still running should be emergency services, NHS and care sectors. No rent/tax for that month and no wages",
