        "action": "Make it mandatory to teach Domestic Violence in Sixth Form and 16-19 colleges",
        "additional_details": "According to the Home Office, there were 672,912 reports of violent domestic abuse-related offences from Apr 2020 to Mar 2021 experienced by 16yrs+ in England and Wales. Sixth forms and colleges are not required to teach this, despite the duty of care to protect their students of all gender identities and backgrounds from falling into the vicious cycle of perpetrating or receiving abuse. Education on domestic abuse can save lives, and prevention is the most effective solution to the problem.",
        "background": "This petition calls for the Government to make in-depth lessons about domestic violence and coercive control mandatory in Sixth Form and 16-19 colleges in England, which are currently not required to teach about healthy relationships. This is a preventative measure, not a cure.",
