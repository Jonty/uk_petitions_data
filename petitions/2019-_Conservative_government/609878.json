        "additional_details": "We are fortunate to be in a country where we feel safe. This decade started with a global pandemic that proved to be life-changing to most people. The world is yet to recover from the repercussions of this pandemic, yet Ukrainian citizens are now being attacked by a more violent villain.  Denmark has allowed 20k Ukrainian asylum seekers to enter their country and Hungary has opened its borders. We have the means to help and should do what we can with the least amount of bureaucracy.",
        "background": "We want the British Government to facilitate the entry of Ukrainian citizens into the UK. While engaging in the war may be a risky option, offering people a safe place and helping them to get to that place is the least we can do.",
