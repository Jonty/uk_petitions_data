However, there is still no ban in place which prohibits the captivation of these animals, therefore there is still opportunity for captivation. The captivity of marine mammals is an outdated and barbaric practice. With the UK being known for its high standards animal welfare laws the abolishment of this law would be a victory for our government.",
