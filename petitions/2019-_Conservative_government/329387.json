        "additional_details": "2020 has been a tough year for us all and has affected more than others. These grades are going to stay with the students, including me, for the rest of our lives. It would be unfair for us to be downgraded by a third of our potential because of an outbreak that none of us had control over.",
        "background": "It would be unfair to downgrade students that missed the opportunity to sit their exams in Summer 2020. It is also statistically proven that children do better in their real exams rather than mocks therefore we urge that you do not downgrade the students by 33%.",
