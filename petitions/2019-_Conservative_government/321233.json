An ambitious plan that will secure a safe climate and fairer society by totally transforming our economy (Green New Deal UK, 2019).\r\n\r\nThe Green New Deal must put the UK on a net zero greenhouse gas emissions trajectory to limit global heating to 1.5 degrees. It must also be built on the principles of social, economic and environmental justice. \r\n\r\nIt is time for a green recovery where the health and wellbeing of all people and the planet are put first.",

Tragically, air pollution kills 40,000 people in the UK every year (Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, 2016). This must stop.",
