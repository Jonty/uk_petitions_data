        "additional_details": "This is an antiquated law for the outdated reasons above.

Its not Brexit and its not a referendum, just common sense.",
        "background": "The European Parliament has voted to stop moving clocks forward an hour in spring and back again in the autumn. Politicians passed the measure by 410 votes to 192 - meaning seasonal time shifts, which were introduced during World War One to save energy, will end in 2020",
