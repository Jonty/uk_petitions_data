        "action": "Do not reopen of schools on 8th March",
        "additional_details": "I suggest that the government wait until the R rate has lowered to a value less than 0.6, and that they consider opening non-essential retail first rather than schools. It would be safer as children and teaching staff are not even being vaccinated yet, and many workers in this sector have been furloughed or fired. The mental health of students also should be considered. Many like me have been traumatised by family members dying/almost dying due to COVID and we do not feel comfortable returning.",
        "background": "We would like the government to stagger the start of term until the R rate has been lowered, teachers are vaccinated and it is proven to be safe to go outside, after being told to \u2018Stay at Home\u2019 for months. Many of us are traumatised by personal bereavement and do not feel safe returning to school.",
