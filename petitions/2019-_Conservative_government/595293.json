        "additional_details": "The system is grossly unfair. Children can be born weeks apart but be at a detriment of thousands of pounds worth of free child care hours. Eligibility should be set firm that on the date that the child turns three, they become eligible for 30 free hours. Not several weeks later based on terms, and particularly the summer terms which are significantly longer than other terms.",
        "background": "The current system for provision of 30 free childcare hours is grossly unfair. Currently it is provided from the term after your child's third birthday. For those born March it starts from April, for those born in April it is September. Parliament needs to harmonise this so all benefit equally!",
