Sometimes it's cheaper on private prescription. Some people resort to buying medication online which can result in death. I propose a flat rate of 50p per item with a cap of \u00a33 per prescription with exemptions for the elderly. There is no need for cost cutting. Well organised good quality medicine is always value for money medicine!",

I was a pharmacy technician & I am very aware that the prescription tax costs more in administration to run than it brings in!",
