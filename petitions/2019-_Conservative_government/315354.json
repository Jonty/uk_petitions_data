        "additional_details": "The Covid-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented emergency situation for the nation. This has been made worse by chronic underfunding of the NHS over many years and the government's mismanagement of the situation in its early stages. Now is not the time for tribal politics, we need to unite under a government of national unity and pull together to rescue this situation.",
        "background": "The current political setup is not up to the job. No Prime Minister, an inexperienced and incompetent cabinet and parliament not sitting to call them to account. We need a government of national unity immediately. This government should be cross party and include retired, experienced politicians.",
