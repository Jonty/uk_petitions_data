A Will must be signed in the physical presence of two independent witnesses, who then also sign the Will in the physical presence of the testator (Will-writer).\r\n\r\nIn the light of the current coronavirus pandemic, many people feel the need to urgently make or update their Wills.  Unfortunately, many of these people are self-isolating and cannot meet the requirements.  Urgent change is needed to meet this need.",
