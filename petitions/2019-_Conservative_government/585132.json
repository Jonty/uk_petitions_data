        "additional_details": "Without the UK Government & opposition MPs enforcing these prohibitions on search engines and results it gives an appearance of an unenforced law. This in turn perpetuates an environment for ease of access which subsequently results in more and more animal abuse while more content is created. Furthermore, this content will be especially dangerous in developing minds.",

Bestiality is illegal under UK law but currently sites and hundreds of images can be returned in searches. These should be censored to dissuade animal abuse.",
