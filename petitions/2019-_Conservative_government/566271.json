        "action": "Close schools due to the increase in COVID-19 and cancel A level and GCSE exams",
        "additional_details": "I want schools and exams to be canceled to ensure people's safety as covid cases are on a rise. I understand that schools are making an effort but cases are still rising and we are at risk so we need to transfer to online learning as this will be a safer option for all. Exams should be canceled this year and assessments should be used instead as a large amount of our academic year has been spent at home due to lockdown/self-isolation therefore exams will be an unfair representation of ability.",
        "background": "There has been a spike in COVID 19 cases due to the festive season and the new strain of COVID-19. Most of the UK is in tier 4 to stop the spread of the virus so we need to close schools to ensure people's safety. Also, exams should be canceled and assememts should be used instead.",
