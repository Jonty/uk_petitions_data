        "additional_details": "I suffer from sever allergic asthma and animals are one of the triggers. My attacks have been bad enough to put me in hospital very close to death. I don't see why any human, be it a phobia, illess or my case a disability, should be discriminated against for the sake of an animal to be in a pub. My partner plays league pool and I can't support him because of all pubs now being dog friendly. \r\nIt's hard enough trying to live a normalish life as it is without un needed obstacles.",
        "background": "I would like a ban on animals being allowed in pubs after a certain time so people with phobias, illnesses or disabilities aren't being  distrcriminated against. I'm not looking to get them stopped as they are part of the family but there are people like myself that are now afraid to go out to a pub",
