        "additional_details": "I want the government to do this because the teachers are always worried that their job may be cut. I'm 9 years old and I'm worried that my school might close if they don't have enough money. Why can't the government see this and help all the schools that don't have enough money. we are the future of this country and want the best education we can get. When teachers are worried about their jobs they can't give us their 100% like they ask from us.",

They are really struggling and need more money to help the school pay their bills. \r\n\r\nI want the government to review the budgets and give more funding to schools to cover the costs of bills and teachers salaries.",
