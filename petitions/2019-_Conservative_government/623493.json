        "additional_details": "Many pet owners in Turkey must follow strict rules to bring their pets into the UK. The rules for bringing animals via approved routes are time consuming, costly and cause stress for both us pet owners and our beloved pets. The government must allow us to fly directly into the UK after making us wait 4 months before we can travel. The change in this rule will mean that families will be able to travel directly without having to travel via other countries or pay extortionate agency fees",
        "background": "The government should allow direct flights to the UK with our pets. The current requirements for travelling with pets are very strict and despite having to wait for 4 months we cannot fly directly to the UK and can only use approved routes via other countries or agencies",
