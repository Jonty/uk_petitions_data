        "action": "Reduce the school summer holidays to 4 weeks",
        "additional_details": "Summer holidays used to be for children needing to help with the harvest; but now they are long, expensive drawn out weeks which are challenging for working parents, grandparents and carers. Whilst children and teachers require a rest, six weeks is a significant amount of time that children are relying on more screen time, less learning and parents try to keep them entertained on tight budgets. Spreading the holidays would allow for more even time off for families to take affordable holidays.",
        "background": "Reduce the school summer holidays to 4 weeks and extend the May and October half terms by 1 week each. \r\nThe current holiday schedules are out dated and do not fit with modern family life.",
