        "additional_details": "Children have missed months of education and preparation for later years, Especially those in the final year before secondary school. \r\nThe children are not emotionally not educationally ready to be moved up and the pressure cannot be put onto their secondary school educators to make up this loss of learning in September.\r\nSitting at home on a video call doesn\u2019t prepare the children for the level of discipline and the standards held by a school setting.",
        "background": "School children have missed out on months of education and a \u2018Teams\u2019 call doesn\u2019t replace the months of zero education. Children aren\u2019t prepared for secondary education emotionally nor educationally. Forcing them to move up will cause a mental health crisis which the country can\u2019t handle.",
