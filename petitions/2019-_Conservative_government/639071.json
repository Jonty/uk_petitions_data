        "additional_details": "I was shocked to discover that goldfish are still being given as prizes at fairs. This practice is extremely bad for the animals. Giving goldfish away as prizes is already banned in Scotland. Contrary to what some people may believe, goldfish are easily stressed and when they are given as prizes, they often suffer badly from shock; also, they are harmed by oxygen starvation or changes in water temperature and many die in their plastic bags before their new owner even gets them home. This is why I was so shocked and why I think it\u2019s so important that the practice of giving goldfish away as prizes is banned.",
