        "additional_details": "Many students in the uk could drop a few grades down . Especially year 10s as they are missing key lessons on topics that will be in their GSCE papers . The time we have missed because of Covid-19 will never come back and assuming lockdown could end by the time we are in year 11 , many students in year 10 haven\u2019t done any mocks and some haven\u2019t even covered half of the curriculum. Most year 10s do 9-10 GCSEs and catching up within less than a year Is extremely hard . When we come out of social distancing and isolation, children and young people and their families will need help to manage mental health, self-esteem, friendships and relationships.  A lot of students are suffering with their mental health and their GCSES will only add onto that .",
        "background": "I believe the current year 10s (going into year 11) are going through a lot of stress . I believe the quality of work we are being given online isn\u2019t sufficient enough and isn\u2019t of a good quality - a lot of students are very anxious and worried about getting the grade they could have gotten.",
