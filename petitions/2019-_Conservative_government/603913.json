        "additional_details": "We're concerned about how vehicle insurance policies may be affected, because if someone is killed by a fully automated car with no human interaction then this could complicate things if the case went to court. Also, with no human interaction then it may be difficult to confirm who is at fault. if there is an accident caused by a human-operated vehicle then when the case goes to court it will likely be clear that the driver is liable. Driverless cars could be hacked which could cause accidents.",
        "background": "Driverless vehicles could be extremely dangerous on our roads as they could be hacked which could cause more accidents which potentially puts drivers and pedestrians at a high risk. Whereas 100% human operated vehicles mean that the driver is in control of the vehicle and should make driving safer.",
