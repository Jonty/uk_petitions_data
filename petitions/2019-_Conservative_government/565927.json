The change from a 3 week delay to a 12 week delay is contrary to the advice given by the developers of the vaccine and allows a further 9 weeks where patients will be vulnerable to the disease. There is no logical reason for this delay except that either there is a shortage of doses or it is done purely to reduce costs, either of which is wrong.",
