        "additional_details": "Limited company directors on the annual payroll scheme have been excluded from the 'furlough' 80% salary claim scheme, if they made their once-a-year RTI submission after 19th Mar. Most will have submitted after, as standard deadline is 5th April!! This is a huge injustice.  This must surely be a genuine oversight. This is not a case of a few people slipping through the cracks of a 'furlough' scheme that can never be perfect - this is an entire group of people that includes small company owners.",
