        "additional_details": "The buyer should have the right to use his or her vehicle on public roads without paying fees to various councils, as this would be anti-democratic. It is blatantly stupid to charge the driver to drive their car, which they already paid for. We should not be dictated to what cars we drive. Drivers should choose what cars they drive without having to pay any charge whatsoever. Some people can't afford new cars. Also, some people may not like the new cars because of their poor quality design.",
