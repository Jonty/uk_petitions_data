        "additional_details": "Politics in the UK is increasingly complicated. Counting and reporting all election results at the more granular, polling district level will help policy-makers determine what issues are of importance to different parts of the electorate and improve the policy-making process, whilst maintaining voter anonymity. EROs should be required to count elections at polling district level, and the results made public on a national website.",
        "background": "Currently, election results are reported at different levels of granularity, depending upon election type and decisions made by local  EROs, and no lower than ward level. All elections \u2013 national, regional and local, including referendums \u2013 should be counted and reported at polling district level.",
