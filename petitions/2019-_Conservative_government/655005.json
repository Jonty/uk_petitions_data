        "additional_details": "When parents are together they can support their child through education together, including university. CMS should continue to support anyone over the age of 18 up to the age of 20 in any form of higher education, including university. The maximum student maintenance loan isn\u2019t always enough to cover the cost of accommodation and the cost of living. The higher earner gets away with not paying anything if they choose not to and the lower earner can end up even worse off trying to support their child.",
        "background": "Make child maintenance payable to any child up to age of 20 in higher education so they receive financial support from both parents. One parent should not be given a choice to walk away from all financial responsibility, leaving the other parent to support the child alone.",
