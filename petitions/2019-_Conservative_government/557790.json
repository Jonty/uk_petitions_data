If they were to cancel A Levels and GCSE\u2019s, myself and every other student in England would be given appropriate and accurate grades, instead of grades that don\u2019t reflect students abilities as a result of 6 months away from a classroom environment. \r\n\r\nIt is much needed to cancel exams, remove pressure and give students the results they deserve.",
