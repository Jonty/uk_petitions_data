        "additional_details": "The use of targeted political advertisements by social media giants such as Facebook and Twitter uses the information of users target them based on their characteristics.\r\n\r\nThis can contribute to the creation of digital echo chambers, with users seeing selectively curated content, paid for by interested parties. This can contribute to dangerous polarisation and radicalisation, such as that which resulted in the civil disorder at the American capital, and undermine the free market of ideas that democracy depends on.",
        "background": "Pass legislation which prevents social media platforms from targeting individual users on social media with political advertising, messaging, and narratives that are based on their personal characteristics and user behaviour, and which lead to polarisation or radicalisation.",
