        "additional_details": "Brexit has established significant barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and both the rest of Ireland and Great Britain, also leaving residents of Northern Ireland with fewer rights than the EU citizens they share the island with. \r\n\r\nGiven that recent polling indicates a majority would be in favour of 'Irish unity', the Secretary of State should immediately begin preparations to call a border poll - it could be called the biggest democratic exercise in the history of the island of Ireland.",
        "background": "The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland should call a border poll, as provided for by legislation, at the earliest opportunity to determine the will of the people of Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom or to unite with the remainder of the island of Ireland.",
