        "additional_details": "It took almost 2 years for my mum to get a diagnosis which has left us with a lot of what ifs - we can\u2019t assume the cancer was always there but what we can say is that her body was telling her something is wrong. We are desperate to save my mum's life and help anyone we can along the way. There is a high possibility my mum's cancer could\u2019ve been caught earlier meaning she could have had surgery and so on. If people with a family history had yearly checks, it may just save their life.",
        "background": "A major risk factor for cancer is a family history. My mum, Laura (36) lost her mum and gran to cancer at a young age. She had seen the GP numerous times with pain but was never taken seriously. The pain was actually due to a cancerous tumour pressing on a nerve and now, she\u2019s battling cancer.",
