        "additional_details": "Only one in six low-paid workers in the last 10 years managed to secure a full-time job with better pay. The low pay culture traps people in poorly paid jobs and prevents them into full-time work. \r\nIn 2017, \r\n22% had taken out a payday loan to cover essential purchases.\r\n43% said they had fallen behind on household bills.\r\n30% had walked to work as they couldn't afford the travel fare.",
        "background": "The Government should increase wages for those on low income jobs because it will allow them to become stable financially. Everyone has taxes and bills to pay but what about those who struggle to? There are many people who are on benefits due to the low wages they received.",
