        "additional_details": "This would open up the possibilities for type 1 diabetics. With today\u2019s technology and how well diabetes can be managed there is no need for them to be discriminated against. As stated our diabetic children are active, competing in sports, nationally all whilst maintaining their levels and not putting themselves in danger.\r\nI do not understand why they aren't allowed to contribute to the Armed Forces in some way. My 12yr old son's dream of joining the Army has been crushed by his diagnosis.",
        "background": "The Armed Forces are currently the only UK institution with a blanket ban on recruiting Type 1 diabetics. As a parent of a Type 1 I understand that front-line would pose a risk - however I also feel there are other positions in the Army where our children could make a difference and aspire to be!",
