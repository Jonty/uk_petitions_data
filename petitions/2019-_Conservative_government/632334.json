        "additional_details": "Hens in battery farms are subjected to awful living conditions which we believe amounts to severe animal cruelty. Many hens in battery farms will never see daylight and are sent to slaughter after only 18 months. Male chicks in battery farms are brutally discarded and not allowed to live the life that they deserve. We believe that all chickens should be allowed to flourish and live life in all its fullness. Free range chickens are able to do so whilst still laying eggs to support our community.",
        "background": "We would like the Government to ban Battery farms. We believe that all eggs available to buy should be free range and have been laid by happy, well looked after hens.",
