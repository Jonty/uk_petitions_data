        "additional_details": "Before 2017 the university fees of trainee nurses, midwives and allied health professionals in England were paid and bursaries awarded in recognition that they spend as much as half of their university time in clinical settings, working alongside qualified staff in order to gain knowledge, skills and experience. They contribute to the day-to-day functioning of the hospital wards, community teams and special units during their placements and the NHS cannot function without their service.",
        "background": "Three years of paid university fees for healthcare students in return for two years of qualified service in the NHS in England. This is already happening in NHS Wales and we need to urgently extend this to NHS England to address the recruitment and retention staffing crisis in the NHS.",
