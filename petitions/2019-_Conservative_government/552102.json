Independent businesses such as florists  photographers and caterers are at breaking point, and the new guidelines will cause many to collapse.\r\n\r\nRestrictions on free bars and dancing can be implemented, one way systems can be introduced and guests can remain seated when indoors, in order to prevent the spread of Covid-10.\r\n\r\nPlease, have a heart.",
        "background": "The new policy changes are unfair to couples who've been planning & saving for years. Most venues can hold over 15 guests with social distancing & hygiene measures in place. Stop penalising young people and trust venues to implement strategies with the same freedom granted to restaurants & bars.",
