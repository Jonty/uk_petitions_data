        "additional_details": "I understand the reason behind the rule of six and agree that simplicity is best but it really does not complicate matters to extend it to \"or two household\" nor does it increase risk. I have a family of five if I want to visit my parents in order to comply with the rule of six I have to leave one of my children at home. Taking the extra child from the same household will not add to the risk. In fact six people from different households pose a much greater risk.",
