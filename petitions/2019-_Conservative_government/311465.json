I am now in a sad situation where I have always been employed and have no means of starting another job due to COVID-19. This in my opinion is very unfair and totally out of my control. Everyone else seems to be able to get some sort of wage back from the government which is great but I as do many others fall into an area that hasn't been thought of.",

Put a process in place where they can make a claim direct to HMRC using their National Insurance Number.",
