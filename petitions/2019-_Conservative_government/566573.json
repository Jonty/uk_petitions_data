        "additional_details": "Grades have been heavily affected by circumstances outside of college/sixth form, causing underperformance all year for many students, meaning their CAGs may not be the grades they need and would have achieved in an exam situation. Therefore choosing to take the exams means they will be able to get a fairer grade. Some students however, believe that they cannot learn all the content before exams, given the situation and quality of online teaching.",
        "background": "Make exams in 2021 optional, and allow teacher assessed grades for those who want it, while those who feel disadvantaged by this can take the exams. Students would have a fairer chance at achieving the grades they want to achieve considering the consequences of Covid-19.",
