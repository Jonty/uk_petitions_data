        "additional_details": "The Amazon rainforest loses around 10,000 acres of land every day. Around 80% of this land is converted into cattle farms to breed, raise and slaughter livestock. The ignorance of the fashion industry and consumers has led to the mass slaughter of billions of animals per year. By banning the advertisement of leather, the Government can hopefully reduce demand for the material, leading to less need for cattle farms to produce leather. This would mean fewer animals would be slaughtered and fewer CO2 emissions would be released.",
        "background": "We want the Government to ban the advertisement of leather products to influence the public to purchase sustainable and ethical alternatives. We believe this would be a great step forward to creating a more environmentally conscious fashion industry.",
