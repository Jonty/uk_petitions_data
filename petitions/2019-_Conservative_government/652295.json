        "additional_details": "The suspension of payments can create a ripple effect, exacerbating the very hardships the Universal Credit system aims to alleviate. Families and individuals, some of whom are already vulnerable, can find themselves in situations where meeting basic needs becomes a daily struggle. This contradicts the fundamental goal of the welfare system to provide support and stability to those who need it most.",
        "background": "We urge the Government not to suspend payments when it is reviewing Universal Credit claims. The current practice can cause severe financial hardships for claimants who depend on these funds for essential living expenses.",
