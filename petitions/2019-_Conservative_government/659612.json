        "additional_details": "The Omani Driving license is acquired after stringent driving tests which we believe are comparable to UK and UAE. UK issued licences are already allowed to be exchanged into an Omani driving licence. Many Omanis and Omani-based expatriates face a hassle in having to do a GB driving test again, even though Britons can easily exchange their GB licence to an Omani one.",
        "background": "HM Government in the UK has reciprocal agreements with the EU, and countries including the UAE, Canada, Japan, Australia and South Africa for exchange of driving licenses. We think it would be a great initiative if Omani licenses are also allowed to convert to a GB License.",
