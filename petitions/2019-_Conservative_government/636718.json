If we don\u2019t know the true scale of childhood bereavement, the services that exist to help are unable to proactively offer the support that children and their families need to cope with their grief. Without support, unresolved grief in young people can lead to an increased risk of youth offending, family breakdown, underachievement in education and employment and long-term mental health conditions.",

Recording the number of children in the household when a death is registered, could help thousands of bereaved children and ensure services can better plan, reach out to families and offer much needed support.",
