        "additional_details": "This is a ridiculous system which penalises countless families who are deserving of the money.  It allows a situation wherein one family with an income of only \u00a360,000 total cannot claim without paying all of the benefit back and on the other hand, enables families with a household income of nearly \u00a340,000 greater to claim the benefit in full without being charged.  Every other child benefit scheme is calculated on the basis of household income which is much more fair overall.",
        "background": "A family where two people earn \u00a349,000 each and have a total household income of \u00a399,000 can have the full child benefit without issue or charge. A family where one person earns \u00a360,000 but the other person has no income, would have to pay all of the child benefit back in the charge.",
