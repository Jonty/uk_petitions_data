Having multiple systems will make it harder for business and introduce inefficiencies into an economy struggling to cope with Brexit and COVID. Virtually every country in the world (with the exceptions of Myanmar, Liberia and the USA) now uses metric (with very limited and specific exceptions) and would certainly expect any relevant exports from Britain to be measured in metric units. There are no discernible benefits to imperial measurements",
