This is far higher than the levels deemed \u2018safe\u2019 in the IPCC special report of 2018.   Many of us are oblivious to the damage that we wreak daily on our environment by our activities.\r\n\r\nWe all need to get involved in facing the challenge, so that the UK can be a role-model for the rest of the world.",

The government has carried out such campaigns in the past for issues that posed far less danger to our well-being, for example the anti-smoking campaign.",
