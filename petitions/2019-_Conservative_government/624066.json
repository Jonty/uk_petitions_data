Within two weeks of taking the reigns of power has managed to destroy the UK economy with heartless policies which ignore the problems the UK currently faces and instead enrich the top 1% of earners.\r\n\r\nIt is already to late to undo the economic damage caused by these policies, but further damage can be avoided by giving the people the opportunity of a general election.",
