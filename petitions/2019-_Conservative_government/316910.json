        "additional_details": "Motor insurance companies stand to make millions from the Coronavirus crisis thanks to drastically reduced payouts during months of lockdown.\r\n\r\nIn New Zealand it is estimated this will give insurance companies a $100million windfall. \r\n\r\nMillions of UK drivers have paid for policies that the Government's lockdown has rendered partially or completely redundant. A refund should be made.\r\n\r\nIn the US the top 10 insurance companies are refunding $7.5billion in premiums.",
        "background": "There has been a dramatic drop in driving since the Government's lockdown. Motor insurance companies will therefore pay out far less than usual in insurance claims.\r\n\r\nMPs should remind them that we are all in this together, so they must pass on this massive windfall to their hard pressed customers.",
