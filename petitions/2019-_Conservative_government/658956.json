        "additional_details": "Post the overturn of Roe vs Wade women in the UK have become increasingly worried about their access to abortion healthcare. Previously these women have been dismmissed by the UK government claiming there is not a large enough mandate for it to be a right. France has now added abortion access to their consitutional rights. UK women deserve the same respect. They need it as a right so they can stop feeling like criminals to access this reproductive healthcare.",
        "background": "Abortion is currently only legal under criminal law when you follow a certain set of rules. Abortion should be a right to UK women under the bill of rights. There should still be guidelines set in terms of how late you can get an abortion. Women should not feel like criminals to access healthcare.",
