        "additional_details": "Introduced in April 2010, and reduced a number of times since 2012, the FIT requires participating licensed suppliers to make payments on both Generation and Export from eligible installations for those signed up to the scheme before it closed in 2019. These rates were determined and published in the Feed In Tariffs Order 2012 (as amended).  The present 2019 rate being paid now bears no sensible relationship to the cost of power paid by consumers and should be reviewed to reflect this.",
        "background": "In view of the recent steep rises in the cost of Energy from all Suppliers,  the Government, and Ofgem, should raise the level of the Feed In Tariff (FIT) to make receipts for power uploaded to the Grid from home Solar Panels a fairer reflection of what the Suppliers are now charging users.",
