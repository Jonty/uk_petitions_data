        "additional_details": "With the cost of living crisis, Gluten Free food was already more expensive than regular food, and now costs have increased more.\r\n\r\nItaly has a scheme funded by the government where those with Coeliacs Disease receive vouchers specifically for gluten-free food (eg. bread, pasta, flours etc.). If there was a similar scheme for those who have Coeliacs Disease in the UK this should help save the NHS from prescribing this food. Vouchers could be based on age & how much gluten free food they require.",
        "background": "Those with Coeliac Disease need to avoid gluten, but some PCTs have stopped prescribing Gluten Free food as it\u2019s too costly for the NHS. I would like the Government to give those with Coeliacs Disease a monthly voucher for gluten-free food, to help them maintain a healthy diet.",
