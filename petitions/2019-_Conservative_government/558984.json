        "action": "Allow schools to continue to provide extra curricular sports during lockdown",
        "additional_details": "With schools remaining open in the second lockdown it is baffling that schools have been advised to cease all extracurricular activity untill December 2nd. Sports are vital to students physical and mental wellbeing, and are already operating within strict year group bubbles and other school coronavirus protocols. If it's unsafe for 1-2 hours of extra curricular sports to take place, with the students you sit next to and are exposed to in class, then schools should not be opening at all.",
        "background": "Reverse the decision to cease all extracurricular sports in schools during the November lockdown. The WHO's recommended daily physical activity guidelines for children aged 5-17 cannot be achieved in the 2 hours of timetabled PE lessons a week provided to students in the UK.",
