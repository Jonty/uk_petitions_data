You have gone against Pfizer advice and put us at risk. We were not aware that we had to wait and now our choices of having Oxford vaccine that offers better protection after one vaccine has been taken away. Again the Government has let us down with no scientific evidence to suggest this will be safe.",

We have been denied pay rises and staff have out their lives at risk to help others. We are never recognised in what we do and you are going against Pfizer\u2019s advice. Staff have died.",
