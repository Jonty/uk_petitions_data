Plus allow the dvla to issue fines if laws are not followed.\r\n\r\nBand 2 (class 2) minimum wage of \u00a345,000 and Band 1 (class 1) \u00a355,000.\r\n\r\nDriving is a dangerous and responsible job where lives are in their hands, they need to be treated and paid accordingly making the profession desirable and more responsible.",
