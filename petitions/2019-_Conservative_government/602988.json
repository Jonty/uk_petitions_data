A memorial would not diminish Britain but help it to establish its place as a diverse and inclusive country.\r\n\r\nAs George Santayana said \u201cThose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\u201d We must be aware of our mistakes, in order to learn from them. A lesson we teach to children, yet as a nation over 400 years old, we aren\u2019t prepared to face it. \r\nA memorial would provide the historically excluded with a sense of belonging. They would know that the struggles of their ancestors have not gone unnoticed.\r\n",
