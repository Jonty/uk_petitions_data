        "additional_details": "Sexual offence cases are complex when it comes to the law, stereotypes, biases and taboos. We believe Jurors are not always equipped.\r\n \r\nThe rape conviction rate in the UK is extremely low, reported last year to be just 1%, and we believe the current system does not work.\r\n \r\nMany victims of sexual offences do not come forward due to the fact that there is rarely a conviction and they are concerned about how they will be treated by the justice system.\r\n \r\nJuries may not be able to comprehend the complexity of these cases without training. There are also taboos associated with some sexual offences cases, and we believe the justice system works in the suspect's favour. This can mean that people who might have been guilty of an offence are acquitted due to a jury\u2019s misunderstanding or bias.",
        "background": "A review could include evaluating whether only certain jurors should serve on these cases, based on their knowledge and any biases, and whether they should have to undergo training before a trial.",
