        "additional_details": "The Government accepts that the theft of a pet is devastating but in incorporating the crime of pet theft into the Animal Welfare (Kept Animals) Bill it singles out the abduction of dogs & fails to treat cats and other pets as equals. We believe this decision does not reflect the emotional & welfare issues that affect both humans and all animals. The inclusion of all kept animals would be compatible with the Sentience Bill which is progressing through Parliament",
