The very fact it was even agreed to be a pay rise of 1% is incomprehensible. The nation does not have the stomach for such callous & calculated treatment of those who have sacrificed the most. Quite literally risking their lives, sacrificing their time, sleep, families and own mental health to help, serve and protect our nation. Without doubt, the government need to act..",
