        "additional_details": "Why? Isn\u2019t it obvious children get raped and abused by people and what they get to go to prison and probably live comfortably? Celebrities who have been found guilty, nothing happens. The world will not take this seriously until something drastic is done. I don\u2019t think the death sentence is drastic for pedophiles. I would like the government to make this a law and I wish the world to follow in example. If someone is found guilty of being a pedophile they get sentence to death immediately.",
        "background": "I want this to become worldwide! We need to make sure anyone including celebrities who is found guilty of paedophilia gets sentence to death.\r\nPeople who harm and rape children should not get the right to live and we do not take this seriously when celebrities get away with this, they should not!",
