        "action": "Please bring into consideration about building Ski Jumping slopes across the UK.",
        "additional_details": "I Strongly agree with bringing the Ski Jumping slopes in as people can experience Ski Jumping. This sport is not common in the UK. As we do not get much snow these Ski Jumping slopes can be made out of small plastic bristles. There is a lot of upcoming talent in the likes of football and I think that Ski Jumping is a good opportunity for young people to come through and represent us in events such as the Winter Olympics.\r\n",
        "background": "I would like Parliament or the Government to bring Ski Jumping into thought as I love Ski Jumping and would like to start Jumping, this may also benefit use by finding young talent in the sport and for people to find a new sport to try.",
