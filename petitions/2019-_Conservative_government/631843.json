        "additional_details": "Plastic is transported around the world as tiny pellets or 'nurdles'. Container ships regularly shed loads of these nurdles into the sea. The polluters are rarely identified.\r\n\r\nThe nurdles are irretrievable due to their tiny size, they look like food to many marine species, so are eaten and end up in the food chain (that's our food chain, folks). Their toxins cause profound damage to life. \r\n\r\nYou can more information here https://www.nurdlehunt.org.uk/the-problem.html",
        "background": "We want the UK Government to protect the marine environment by banning the import or export, by sea, of plastic pellets (known as 'nurdles') which are used in the manufacture of plastic products and which regularly end up in the sea in vast amounts.",
