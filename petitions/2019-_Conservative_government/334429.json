        "action": "Impose sanctions on China for undermining the Hong Kong Basic Law",
        "additional_details": "The HK Basic Law guaranteed Hong Kong freedom from the socialist practices of the Chinese Communist Party for 50 years (1997-2047) under a 'one country, two systems' principle. The Basic Law grants HK residents the right to stand for election, of free speech, of the press, and of publication (BL Articles 25-38). The new National Security Law has already resulted in pro-democracy books being removed, and arrests of pro-democracy activists like Jimmy Lai; a blatant disregard for the Basic Law.",
        "background": "On June 30th 2020, China imposed a National Security Law for Hong Kong, in the wake of demonstrations last year calling for greater democratic autonomy. The implementation of this law directly contravenes the statutes of the HK Basic Law and the UK Government must sanction China accordingly.",
