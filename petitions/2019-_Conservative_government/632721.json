        "additional_details": "Give those that smoke freedom to do so. Provide an area at all UK airports that is accessible once through departures. It would reduce anxiety in nervous flyers, reduce arguments between holidaymakers & I still a sense of control over an already controlled environment. Charge for it by all means as long as it\u2019s accessible to all classes of living. We get taxed on our cigarettes & told where & how to smoke them. It\u2019s a personal choice & smokers are penalised daily",
        "background": "Smoking is a personal choice. The government have far too much say in how we live our lives by controlling every element. Other countries provide an area in airports for those that smoke but the UK doesn\u2019t. Myself & millions of others would appreciate a terrace/outdoor smoking area through departure",
