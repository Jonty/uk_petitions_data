        "additional_details": "This will need to be honoured by the government as this has put a lot of people in unnecessary debt, and has also had detrimental effects on the mental health and well-being. Often times, it felt as though we were in \u201cglorified prison\u201d and the state of the food in some of the hotels were unacceptable.",
        "background": "As a British citizen, we should not have been forced to pay \u00a32285 to quarantine in a hotel. The government should payback this money to everyone who\u2019s had to do that (irrespective of whether they tested positive or not) in such short notice after deadline on 6th Dec 2021.",
