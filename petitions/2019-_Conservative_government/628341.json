        "action": "Enact new UK Legislation requiring supermarkets donate unsold to food banks",
        "additional_details": "This September, nearly 1/5 families have experienced food insecurity. While people go hungry, UK supermarkets throw away 200000 tonnes of (own-label food fit for human consumption) food every year. 10 million adults and 4 million children are unable to eat regular meals. Meanwhile, many food banks are having to buy food to make up for loss of donations, many more struggling to supply increased demand for their support. Food banks are a lifeline - lets direct food to them and not the landfill",
        "background": "The UK is facing a cost of living crisis. Record numbers of people turning to food banks, where food donations have been unable to keep up with spiralling demand. The government should pass a ban on supermarkets throwing away or destroying unsold food, instead donating it to charities and food banks",
