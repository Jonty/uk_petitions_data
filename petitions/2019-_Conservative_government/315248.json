        "action": "UKRI should extend all PhD students affected by COVID-19",
        "additional_details": "The 6 month funded extension should be awarded to all PhD students. Without it, those in the initial years of their study will face significant personal and financial challenges in order to complete their PhD. The initial years are vital for data gathering and learning essential skills. The impact of COVID-19 will disrupt the educational journey of PhD students at all stages, therefore it is vital that extensions be granted to all ensuring that PhD students achieve their project objectives.",
        "background": "UKRI has announced that final year PhD students will receive a 6 month funded extension due disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Whilst encouraging for PhD students finishing by 31st March 2021, this does not give peace of mind to PhD students currently in their first or second year.",
