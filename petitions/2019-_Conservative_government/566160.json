        "additional_details": "All year groups just start again in September 2021  eg Year 6 stay in year 6 instead of moving to Year 7 etc.  This would mean that pupils due to start in Reception 2021 would have to wait until 2022 etc.  Yes, all future pupils will be starting a year later but I think we actually start our pupils in school too early anyway.\r\n\r\nThe only issue is there will be a gap in pupils going to University but there must be some on a gap year ready to start.",
        "background": "All pupils have had inconsistent education since March 2020.  During the autumn term, some pupils were forced to isolate, some schools closed & now there is a delay to the spring term. If they all repeated the year from Sept 2021, they would be in a much better position for future learning.",
