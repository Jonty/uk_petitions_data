        "additional_details": "They can be dangerous to the environment, wildlife and put people at risk who are called to extinguish any subsequent fire that they cause. Often they are not taken away as rubbish by those who have used them and they leave behind ugly patches of burnt grass. It seems that the public have no common sense when using these and do not consider the safety of themselves, others or their surroundings by using them. There needs to be a deterrent in the use of these in public places to protect us all.",
        "background": "People are using these disposable BBQs in public places and areas such as national parks and beaches. They have been proven to be the cause of many devastating fires up and down the country and cause damage to the ground upon which they are used and also are often left as litter.",
