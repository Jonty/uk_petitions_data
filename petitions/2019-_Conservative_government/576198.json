        "additional_details": "In the UK, 1 in 10,000 children are newly diagnosed each year.  It can affect children physically - swelling of joints, stiffness, pain, fevers, rashes, psoriasis, inflammation around internal organs, as well as mentally - leaves them feeling like they are the odd one out, people judging them and like they are different. It is important that schools support children with JIA and their families, to ensure that the child is properly supported with their school work, their learning, being able to be part of the class activities, and their mental well being is considered when it comes to things like class trips or attendance awards.",
        "background": "Make sure that schools are more aware, and properly educated, about JIA, how it affects a child and their families, as well as the impact this can have on a child's mental health. JIA happens when the immune system attacks the lining of the joints causing the joints and other organs to swell.",
