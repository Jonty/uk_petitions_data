        "additional_details": "227,000 miles of wrapping paper is thrown away each year. In the UK alone, it is estimated that the amount of wrapping paper the country throws out at Christmas could stretch to the moon! Each year we are adding to this waste, and it\u2019s not going anywhere.\r\n\r\nIn todays climate it is more important now than ever to prevent waste wherever we can. With alternative options available for eco-friendly gift wrapping it is completely unnecessary that wasteful, non recyclable products are still being sold.",
        "background": "There are now many options for recyclable, eco-friendly wrapping paper & gifting decoratives (bows, ribbon etc.) yet retailers are still selling a majority of non-recyclable, wasteful products. Many people do not realise that the majority of these products are non recyclable.",
