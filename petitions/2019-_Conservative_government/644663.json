        "additional_details": "In 2020, the government's 'Everyone In' scheme practically ended rough sleeping overnight. Now numbers are rising again. Government figures show a 26% increase to 3,069 people sleeping rough. The largest increase was in London.\r\n\r\nPeople experiencing homelessness have to prove they are in 'priority need' to be eligible for emergency housing. But everyone should be. \r\n\r\nThe government committed to ending rough sleeping by 2024, and they must deliver now. No more deaths on our streets this winter.",
        "background": "The government should reinstate measures introduced under 'Everyone In' and provide everyone experiencing homelessness with emergency accommodation. \r\n\r\nThey should abolish the requirement to prove priority need for emergency housing and conduct an urgent review into their rough sleeping strategy.",
