This isn't good enough as it severely hinders the commute for job openings for residents based near either town.\r\n \r\nWe believe there would be a huge benefit in a new motorway cutting through the high moorlands passing by the towns of Todmorden and Hebden Bridge. Residents of Bradford, Halifax and Huddersfield would be able to commute more quickly to the towns of Burnley & Blackburn to access the industrial job market there, and vice versa.\r\n \r\nWe believe the current single lane A-Road (A646) and hour-long 44-mile alternative motorway route, which takes you down Manchester then back up, are not adequate.",
