        "additional_details": "Health care students are working in high-risk COVID areas during placement and aren\u2019t being paid a penny. Students living with families are being forced to either put their families at risk or find alternative accommodation which they have to pay for themselves. If they can\u2019t afford this, you have no option but to delay qualifying. Students are working 40 hours a week unpaid with full PPE, plus many have part-time jobs. We have no death in service or sick leave and our lives are at risk.",
        "background": "Ensure all health care students are paid for placements during Covid-19, as many students are working in high risk health care settings. By paying students, they would be entitled to death in service benefits and be able to pay for alternative accommodation to prevent putting loved ones at risk.",
