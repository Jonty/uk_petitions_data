In light of this the individual(s) should be made to attend training with the military or work beside them as their punishment, so they can truly reflect. This would also teach the individual(s) about Values and standards and they\u2019d also be able to understand our Ethos.",

These are exactly what I stand for as a member of our Armed Forces and I feel let down by the justice system that nothing is ever done, yet in other countries their flag is about honour.",
