Not to have done so, would mean that what was given with one hand, would be snatched by another.\r\n \r\nThose caring for many of these people, are not afforded the same recognition. Many will still see their Carer's Allowance swallowed up by reductions in other benefits.\r\n \r\nThis isn\u2019t just about money either, there is a neglectful principle at play; the demoralising dismissal of the carer role and denial of the needs of carers, separate from those they care for.\r\n",
