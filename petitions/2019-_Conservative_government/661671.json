It is imperative that action is taken to halt these discriminatory practices and ensure that all individuals, regardless of their ethnicity, have equal access to employment opportunities.",

If you'd like something else, you could start a new petition clearly explaining what it is.\r\n\r\nPositive discrimination is already unlawful in Great Britain. It is legal for employers to take positive action that aims to reduce disadvantage, meet different needs and increase participation. We could accept a petition calling on the Government to ban positive action to reduce disadvantage, meet different needs and increase participation, if that's what you want to happen.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about existing rules on positive action here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/positive-action-in-the-workplace-guidance-for-employers/positive-action-in-the-workplace\r\n\r\nWe only reject petitions that don\u2019t meet the petition standards."
