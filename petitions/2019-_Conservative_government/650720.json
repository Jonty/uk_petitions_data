        "additional_details": "All I've heard for the past several nights now is bang bang bang, this is completely unnecessary, it's frightening animals and pets and causing needless noise pollution. You've previously rejected banning all fireworks as you doubt the effectiveness but surely banning the loud fireworks would just lead to everyone using quiet ones and then everyone's happy.",
        "background": "Loud fireworks scare pets and animals for weeks every year around bonfire night for no good reason, it's time to put a stop to it as there are quiet versions of fireworks that can be used instead. Banning the sale of loud ones will still allow people to enjoy quiet fireworks.",
