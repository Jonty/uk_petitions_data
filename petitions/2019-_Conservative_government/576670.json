        "additional_details": "According to the 2011 census, over 1.5 million people have more than one home address. They can only register with one GP, which restricts their access to medical services.\r\n\r\nThis includes medical reviews that require clinical observations, referrals to specialist services (such as cancer screenings and mental health services), and receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.\r\n\r\nPeople can therefore have to choose between deciding to travel for medical appointments, re-register with GPs, or miss appointments entirely.",
        "background": "UK residents with more than one home address should be able to register with a GP at each address. This will allow people access to non-emergency medical services in their area, reducing unnecessary travel and causing fewer people to rely on private services when they are not near their GP.",
