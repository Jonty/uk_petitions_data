        "additional_details": "Currently, constituents face a disadvantage when evaluating their representatives if they abstain from voting, as there is limited information available. Reasons for an abstention could include; the impartiality of the chair, party abstentionist policy, personal choice to abstain, procedural reasons, constituency or ministerial duties, or other unforeseen circumstances. \r\n \r\nThis procedural change aims to eliminate this ambiguity by requiring a clear reason for abstention, ensuring transparency for constituents.\r\n",
