Subsidising public transport will ease the financial strain that many are experiencing.",
        "background": "NHS and social care workers are having to cover their own transport costs during the pandemic. Public transport is extremely costly and the need to finance travel has caused difficulty for many members of staff working in healthcare as well as many medical/dental/nursing students who self-fund.",
