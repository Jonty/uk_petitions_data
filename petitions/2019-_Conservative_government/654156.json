        "additional_details": "We believe that this is unfair to students who have chosen the UK as the destination country based on the previous rules. These changes could jeopardise international students' aspirations and planning for several years. Therefore, we request revising this change, so that it does not apply to those students who entered the country before January 2024.",
        "background": "New rules stated that the baseline minimum salary to be sponsored for a Skilled Worker visa will rise from \u00a326,200 to \u00a338,700. We express our concern about these rules, and call for students who entered the UK before January 2024 to be exempted from these changes.",
