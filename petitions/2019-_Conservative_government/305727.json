        "additional_details": "Companies do not have the funds to start mass production of a new vaccine until completion of a successful trial (maybe three months). Hence three months is lost before a mass production run can be started. \r\n\r\nGovernment, however, does have the funds to get mass production runs started at the same time as each trial of a Covid-19 vaccine is started. 90% of the trials may be unsuccessful and the production runs then binned, but for a successful trial the production is ready three months earlier.",
        "background": "Government should fund parallel running for mass production with the start of every Covid-19 vaccine trial. 90% of the trials may fail and the corresponding mass production runs would then go in the bin, but three months might be gained for the production run that corresponds with a successful trial",
