        "additional_details": "This is an issue that has been going on for a long time now, and we believe it isn't fair that people born in the US who now live in the UK have to pay tax to both UK and the US when they are no longer living in the US!\r\n \r\nThe process can be extremely stressful and costly for US-born, as they have to file every year to the US on their worldwide income. This also affects children born abroad, who automatically become a US citizen and will face tax  obligations from the age of 18.\r\n",
        "background": "Many people born in the United States (US) living in the UK still have to pay taxes to the US. We believe this is not fair, and the UK should seek an agreement with the US that anyone born in the US but resident in the UK only needs to pay UK taxes.",
