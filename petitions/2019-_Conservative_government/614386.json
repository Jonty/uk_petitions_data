This also affects children born abroad, who automatically become a US citizen and will face tax  obligations from the age of 18.\r\n",
        "background": "Many people born in the United States (US) living in the UK still have to pay taxes to the US. We believe this is not fair, and the UK should seek an agreement with the US that anyone born in the US but resident in the UK only needs to pay UK taxes.",
