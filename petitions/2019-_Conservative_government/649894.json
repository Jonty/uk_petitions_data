        "additional_details": "The proposed checks could see bettors having to prove they can afford their hobby if they sustain losses as low as \u00a31.37 per day. We accept the need to help those with problem gambling but more intrusive checks triggered at a higher threshold risks bettors moving to the black market where there are no consumer protections or safer gambling tools. We are concerned there will also be a negative impact on British horseracing\u2019s finances due to a reduction in betting turnover and resulting fall in Levy yield.",
        "background": "We want the Government to abandon the planned implementation of affordability checks for some people who want to place a bet. We believe such checks \u2013 which could include assessing whether people are \u2018at risk of harm' based on their postcode or job title \u2013 are inappropriate and discriminatory.",
