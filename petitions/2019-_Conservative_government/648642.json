        "additional_details": "It is everyone\u2019s right to live in safety. Imagine being a doctor in Gaza right now, running out of medical supplies and electricity. We don\u2019t even know how many have been killed in their homes because there isn\u2019t even capacity to pull people out of the rubble. Around half of the people in Gaza are children, and around 70% are refugees.\r\n \r\nThe Fourth Geneva Convention demands of Britain and Israel, as signatories, to protect the lives of those under occupation or in a war zone. We believe inaction by the UK Government in this regard would not be consistent with these obligations.",
