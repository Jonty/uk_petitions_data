GPs have refused to see people such as both my nanas. They have paid taxes all their lives and become ill. They cannot claim State Pension due to their age and this is the same with millions of other people.\r\n\r\nThe GPs should open up again, just like every other business and government building has.",

Both my nanas are becoming ill and require their doctor to write them up to claim disability from PIP and Universal Credit which they as well as others can't do at this time due to them being closed.",
