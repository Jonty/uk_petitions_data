        "additional_details": "I am asking the government to consider requiring the courts to place automatic bail conditions on those charged with offences against children that prevent them from contacting anyone under the age of 16 for the time they remain on bail.\r\nMy daughter was seriously assaulted, leaving her with life changing injuries. \r\n \r\nOnce charged by the police, the person responsible was granted unconditional bail due to previous good character. This allowed them to make unsupervised contact for a further 6 months which caused more distress. Children\u2019s Services need the support of a justice system that helps them to protect all children from offenders on bail for offences against a minor, regardless of their history.",
        "background": "The law currently allows for persons who commit offences against children to be granted unconditional bail, leaving them to pose further risk to minors around them.",
