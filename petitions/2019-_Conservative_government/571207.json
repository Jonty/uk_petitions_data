        "additional_details": "The war on drugs has been a huge failure, wasted trillions of pounds and is a huge infringement on freedom and democracy. Other countries and places have benifited from legalising drugs. Drug use should not be treated as a criminal issue instead of a public health issue. Psychedelics and other drugs could be a breakthrough therapy for many mental and phsyical health issues. Many pschedelics and illegal drugs are not addictive, not toxic, cannot kill humans and are safer than alcohol and tobacco.",
        "background": "Legalise all drugs. This would greatly reduce crime, violent crime and would create thousands of jobs, benefit the economy and so many people\u2019s lives. It would also greatly reduce harm and death from drugs themselves as they would not be cut with or completely contain other substances.",
