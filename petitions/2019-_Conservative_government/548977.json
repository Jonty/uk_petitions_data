        "additional_details": "With distancing, ventilation and screening in place, congregational singing poses far less risk than e.g. playing of close contact sports, being out in public where voices are raised consistently, and so many other comparable situations (for instance public swimming pools open, but baptism isn't permitted). \r\nThe government needs to revisit the guidelines so that the church is not inadvertently being discriminated against. Full worship can continue, whilst keeping worshippers safe!",
        "background": "Singing is an integral part of worship and prohibiting this, silences the church. Hymns can be shortened for moderation, but as of now, hymns only last 2-3 minutes with large breaks in between in any case. To further reduce risk, mandatory temperature screening could also be introduced.",
