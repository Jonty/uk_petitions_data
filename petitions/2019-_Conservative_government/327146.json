        "additional_details": "The country's Capital must reflect the entire country. It is more than 12 years since the white British population of London fell below 50%. As a result London has become a nation within a nation. Sadiq Khan is running London as his own personal mini nation and all too often infuriates the wider British public with his speeches and policies.\r\nA widening of the franchise would ensure that the Capital city belongs to the whole country, as it should.",
        "background": "Increase the voting franchise for London mayoral elections to encompass all England (and possibly even the whole U.K.)\r\nEnsure this policy is not hijacked by other mayoral elections other than the home nations capitals.\r\nSee reasoning below.",
