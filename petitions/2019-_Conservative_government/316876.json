At this current moment in time, Captain Tom Moore's 100th Birthday Walk for the NHS has raised around \u00a318,179,000 - Just Giving charge 25p per donation, plus a 2.9% processing charge. At this moment there is 895386 donations - \u00a3217,346.5. And then 2.9 is \u00a3527,191. That\u2019s \u00a3744,537.5 - there needs to be accountability in these strange times.",
        "background": "I want government to limit the fees charged by Just Giving and similar sites to what it\u2019ll actually cost them to process any NHS charity donation pages. Ensuring they aren\u2019t making a profit from donations at this valuable time and people\u2019s generosity. Fees to be inclusive of labour costs.",
