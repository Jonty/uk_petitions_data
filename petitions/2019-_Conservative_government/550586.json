This is in stark contrast to promises made back in 2016 that the legal status of EU nationals will not be affected. It is not necessary to deport serious criminals as this process is irrespective of Brexit. The whole program takes thousands of man-hours of work of the civil servants while not being necessary to achieve any purported or identifiable goal.",

This has been promised by the Leave campaign back in 2016 and now the Prime Minister has the opportunity to fulfil that promise.",
