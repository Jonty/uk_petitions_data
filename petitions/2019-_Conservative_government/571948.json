Most are struggling to engage their children in the current curriculum.  Many feel that the basics are being missed and children are being rushed through their learning.  It is proven that children learn when they\u2019re having fun and feeling engaged.  If children constantly feel like they\u2019re failing, they lose concentration and mental health suffers.  This is really unacceptable.",
