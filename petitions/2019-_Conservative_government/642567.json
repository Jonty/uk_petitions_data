        "additional_details": "Bovine TB is unlikely to be eradicated using the current culling practice since TB is present in wild animal populations. Reinfection of herds is an ever present danger. Unless a program is put in place to eradicate TB in wild animals the DAERA TB Eradication Program will continue to cause unnecessary distress and disruption. It is proposed that the government acts now to implement a robustly documented vaccination program to eradicate Bovine TB from livestock. Stop this senseless slaughter.",
        "background": "The senseless distruction of livestock due to the current DAERA TB Eradication Program complying with Council Directive 64/432/EEC leads to the unnecessary loss of livestock and financial hardships to Farmers. Implementation of a rigorous vaccination program will eradicate TB from livestock.",
