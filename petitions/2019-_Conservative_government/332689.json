It will be essential to have the entire banking community on board with this.\r\n\r\nHumanity as a whole, is living in unprecedented times due to the pandemic. It will be many years before the world sees a return to a normal way of life. There is an estimated $15 Trillion invested in tax havens around the world by wealthy individuals & corporations, many of whom appear to be pursuing a course of tax avoidance. Governments are borrowing heavily & they need tax receipts to pay their loans & provide a better society for us all. Billions could be harvested annually if these schemes are banned.",
