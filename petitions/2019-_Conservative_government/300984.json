These pensions must be free from company interference, once paid in the only person who should be able to access to the pension is the employee who paid into it. It should not be treat like easy money for shareholders. Pensions must be protected from profit grabs. The government must introduce a secure pension policy for employees.",

As if this were not bad enough, they find that their company pension has been seized as part of the company assets and they are told \u201chard luck\u201d.",

You can find out more on the Pension Advisory Service's website here: https://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk/about-pensions/when-things-change/leaving-your-pension-scheme/insolvency\r\n\r\nYou could start a petition calling on the Government to require all employers to establish pension funds independent of the company's assets to ensure that all pension entitlement are paid in full."
