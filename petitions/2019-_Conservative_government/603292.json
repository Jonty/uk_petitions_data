We understand that you are concerned about existing rules applying to poker, but we're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nPoker involves both elements of chance and elements of skill. As such it is covered by gambling legislation.\r\n\r\nIf you wanted the Government to amend gambling legislation so that this did not cover poker, we should be able to accept a petition requesting this, but we could not publish petitions that contain false or unproven statements. This would include unsubstantiated claims that all poker players want poker to be reclassified so it is exempt from gambling legislation, and misrepresentations of legislation. The Gambling Act is not intended solely to cover games where anyone has an equal chance of winning, and explicitly covers games that involve an element of change and an element of skill, such as poker."
