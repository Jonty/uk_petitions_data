        "additional_details": "\u00a3210 is a huge amount of money. The pandemic is affecting everyone financially, amongst other things. \r\nSome people have to travel for their work, studies, or even for medical reasons. This new measure is really discriminating individuals who do not have the choice but to travel back to the UK.",
        "background": "Lowering its cost to a reasonable price. PCR tests are available for free via the NHS. While there must be a fee to discourage some to travel, others do not have any choices but to come back to the UK for various reasons and adding a \u00a3210 home test kit to their budget may have dramatic consequences.",
