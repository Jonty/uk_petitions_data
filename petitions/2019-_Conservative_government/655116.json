        "additional_details": "There exists various mechanisms for changing of a name in the UK for a variety of reasons. While it is important to establish a history for a person in cases such as claiming benefits or establishing identity. the fact remains that there is little justification for insisting a person continually have to divulge a name they have abandoned  for a considerable time. \r\n\r\nIt is proposed a birth name should only be required to be disclosed in very limited circumstances such as where convictions exist.",
        "background": "To limit the requirements where an individual must disclose a birth name to situations where it is essential to an industry i.e. the security services or where a person has a serious conviction. It is suggested the person be allowed to abstain from providing birth names 6 years after a name change",
