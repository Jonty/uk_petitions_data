        "additional_details": "I am a young queer person who has faced harassment for their queer identity in schools, including forced outing and anti-queer comments from other students. Even I was unaware of LGBTQ+ History Month until this year. \r\n\r\nI am aware the government is beginning to make moves towards this by introducing queer and LGBTQ+ sex education but that is not enough, especially following the moves away from trans rights by our equalities minister.",
        "background": "The government should include queer and LGBTQ+ history and general education in schools, and not just sex education. The government should ensure inclusive queer and LGBTQ+ foundations are consulted. The government's bad record on queer and LGBTQ+ rights should not be disregarded in such lessons.",
