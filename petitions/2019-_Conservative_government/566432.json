        "additional_details": "Both my parents,who are in their 80\u2019s, and my sister in law, who works in a care home,are amongst the group of people brave enough to be the first to have the Pfizer COVID vaccination on 21/12/20. They did it on the agreement that their second one would be 3 weeks later. Concerns are Pfizer only tested the vaccine with a 3 week gap between doses and therefore the consequence of a 12 week gap is unknown and what happens if there is a supply issue of the Pfizer vaccination after the 12 weeks gap.",
