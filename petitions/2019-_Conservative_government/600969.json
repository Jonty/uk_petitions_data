        "additional_details": "MPs are well-paid, and are already in the top 5% of earners. It is wrong that MPs are able to receive significant additional incomes from second jobs, including for political consultancy or advisory roles for corporate interests. There needs to be legislation to prevent MPs from having second jobs, except where there is a clear public interest such as to maintain a professional registration (e.g. nursing).",
        "background": "Being a Member of Parliament is a huge privilege, but it is also a well-paid, full-time job. Parliament should legislate to ban MPs from having second jobs, with limited exceptions where there is a clear public interest such as to maintain a professional registration (e.g. nursing).",
