        "additional_details": "They may also not be eligible for increases like the proposed 3% getting discussed now for NHS staff. They have been doing vaccine clinics. The Government should also ensure that all GP practice staff receive any yearly cost of living pay rises that NHS employees receive. Practice nurses and doctors have been a driving force in the fight against covid and releasing pressure off A and E - they should be paid and rewarded the same as their NHS counterparts.",
        "background": "A number of GP practices have staff who are not employed directly by the NHS, and so are not on the Agenda for Change pay scale. This can leave staff stuck on wages lower than their NHS-employed counterparts, with some having to move around jobs to chase money. ",
