        "additional_details": "Reducing VAT temporarily will help the less well-off, as opposed to the current taxpayer-funded plan proposed by the Government's cost of living coordinator, David Buttress. His plan is to encourage businesses to divert marketing spend so that they can cut prices, reducing the cost for the consumer. However, this could have a negative impact on those employed in the UK creative, advertising and marketing industries.",
        "background": "Now the UK has left the EU it can change VAT rates. We believe the Government should reduce the standard rate of VAT, to reduce the financial burden on families and businesses, particularly in light of the increased cost of living.",
