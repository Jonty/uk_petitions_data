The only way we can stop this is by taking action.\r\n \r\nCommunity fridges and food banks could sustainably redistribute food waste to those who need OR want it. As well as tackling food poverty, reducing food waste would reduce carbon emissions. About 6-8% of global human-induced emissions could be reduced if we stop food waste.\r\n \r\nThis is not just a social concern, it\u2019s an environmental one.",
