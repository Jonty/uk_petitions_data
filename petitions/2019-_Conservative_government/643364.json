        "additional_details": "We undertook shared motherhood IVF in order to fulfil our desire to be equal mothers. After a difficult process to create a family we were blessed with our daughter who we are both mother to.\r\n \r\nOn registering the birth we were equally disappointed to learn that the law does not recognise two mothers. Law states - no other woman is to be treated as the mother of the child. Allowing only the 'natural mother' to be recognised. The other is listed as 'parent' rather than 'mother' creating inequality\r\n",
        "background": "Section 33(1) of Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 prevents two mothers being allowed to be listed on the birth certificate of a child. We would like for this to be amended to allow two mothers for same sex families rather than 'mother' and 'parent'.",
