        "additional_details": "Angling is an craft that's been woven into this country's heritage for decades if not centuries and people who can't be bothered to learn the art of casting but who would rather use technology as a means to fish in order to get a cheap picture in a bid to gain false accolade are ruining this heritage.\r\n \r\nPlease ban the bait boat so we can reduce pressure on carp lakes we care about as anglers and keep technology from spoiling a time-old craft.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to ban the use of bait boats as these are increasing pressure on carp lakes. These boats also give the carp nowhere to retreat to, therefore placing them under additional stress.",
