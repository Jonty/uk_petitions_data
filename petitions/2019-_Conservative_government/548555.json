        "additional_details": "Those taking A Levels in Summer 2021 have missed months of education and face missing more if there is a second wave of COVID. This risks our future prospects and therefore something needs to be done to protect us. Cutting out topics will not work as different schools learn topics in different orders so it is unfair to cut out certain topics. The only fair way of proceeding is by ensuring that our grades will be triple locked, right from the outset.",
        "background": "The \u2018triple lock\u2019 system of exam results should be extended to those doing A Levels in 2021, whose education has been enormously disrupted by COVID-19. In doing so, students should get the best result out of their predicted grade, their mock result and their exam result.",
