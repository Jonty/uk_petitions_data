        "additional_details": "There needs to be more that the CMS/resident parent can do with regards investigating via forensic accountants in order to expose the true income and value of assets of the non-resident, self employed parent. Also, sales of any assets which add income should be taken into account. Currently there are those who take diminished to zero accountability for the day to day costs of the children incurred by the resident parent which is extremely unfair.",
