If patients are invited once yearly to a health check, healthcare practitioners can check overall health, and also advise on how to avoid health risks, such as obesity.\r\n \r\nPrevention is better than cure, but we as a nation are not grasping this. A simple health check could save many lives and we believe would be cost effective to the NHS.",
