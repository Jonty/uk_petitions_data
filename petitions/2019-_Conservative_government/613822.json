        "additional_details": "Many citizens of Ukraine who have not evacuated from their homes are taking up arms but are ill-equipped for this. They are issued with guns but not given protective clothing, such as helmets or flak jackets as these are not available in sufficient quantities. Such clothing could give protection against shrapnel and could save thousands of lives. They could also be invaluable to citizens who have to make treacherous forays from their homes to obtain food and water for their families.",
        "background": "We call for the MOD to quickly donate army surplus protective clothing to Ukraine. The Government should also work with partners in Europe and NATO to provide adequate supplies, not leaving it to charities to purchase this clothing piecemeal. If necessary, commissioning factories to provide more.",
