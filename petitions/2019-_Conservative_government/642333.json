        "additional_details": "Anti-social behaviour can ruin people's lives and make home life unbearable, as there is little residents can do about this, especially if the properties are attached. Some victims of anti-social behaviour find it difficult to function or concentrate on their lives in a healthy way as they are consumed by the disruption at home. This can lead to them avoiding their home, experiencing anxiety and depression, and can even lead to homelessness. When someone has been identified as a victim of anti-social behaviour, local authorities should be required to ensure that they do not house individuals who have previously been anti-social neighbours next to them. Prolonged exposure to anti-social behaviour should not be allowed.",
        "background": "We want the Government to require local authorities to ensure that they do not house individuals who have previously been anti-social neighbours from being housed next to tenants who have previously reported anti-social neighbours, and the local authority found those reports to be accurate.",
