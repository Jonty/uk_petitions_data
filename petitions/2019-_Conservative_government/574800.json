        "additional_details": "The accommodation sector (B&B, Hotels, Short-Term Rentals, Cottages etc) employs over 3.2 million people and is worth more than \u00a3130 billion to the UK.   So far, UK Gov have given little support and little to no recognition to the sector.    \"Eat-Out to Help-Out\" helped restaurants only, and propagated the virus.  BUT a room, a cottage, with contactless check-in/out is private and not crowded. Majority of accommodation providers have implemented enhanced sanitization and CAN help.  Gov must act.",
        "background": "Open quarantine hotels criteria to B&Bs, recognise safety measures implemented by B&Bs, use B&Bs to help with outpatients, homeless, abuse victims, promote B&B as \u201csafe workspace\u201d instead of office, exempt B&Bs from Google digital tax due Apr1st, insist that bank/landlords help more.",
