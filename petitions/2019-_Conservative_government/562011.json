        "action": "Reverse the decision to prevent yoga studios opening throughout tier 3.",
        "additional_details": "Yoga studios operate on average for 3, 1hr classes per day, far less daily footfall than gyms, sharing the same social distancing floor markings as gym. Instead of shared equipment, clients provide their own. With contact points being wiped down in between each class, and staggered entrance, we consider studios to be covid safe environments. In contrast to fitness classes, yoga promotes controlled soft breathing and far less physical movement, but with huge mental and physical health benefits.",
        "background": "Please consider a separate review for yoga studios to be removed from the class exemption category. Yoga is a spiritual practice of mindful movement and meditation, with essential benefits for mental health. Yoga studios with specific PPE in place to safeguard clients should be deemed essential.",
