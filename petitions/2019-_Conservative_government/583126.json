        "additional_details": "Gender-based violence is repeatedly shown as a systemic issue, recently highlighted by tragic events. In response to public concern, the government stated they would provide funding for extra streetlights, police and CCTV to make women \u201cfeel safe\u201d. Whilst all measures to tackle these issues are important, we believe it\u2019s urgent to address the root causes of gender-based violence and abuse via education; to start teaching young people much earlier about these serious social issues and crimes.",
        "background": "The curriculum states pupils should be taught about issues surrounding gender-based violence and abuse, such as sexual harassment, by the end of secondary school. However, to prevent harm, we need to educate sooner on disproportionate and targeted violence because of someone\u2019s gender.",
