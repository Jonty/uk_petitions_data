A well thought out cycle lane has great benefit but many are not, and create more risk as road space is lost and bring cyclists into conflict with other road users.\r\n\r\nA review needs to look at how best to use space we have.\r\n\r\nOne of the key ingredients to road safety is predictability, requiring nation-wide guidance on road use and infrastructure.\r\n\r\nBicycle, scooter and motorcycle use reduces congestion which benefits the transit of goods and the economy.",
