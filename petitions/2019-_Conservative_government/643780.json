It is imperative the Government increase the funding so art classes can continue.",
        "background": "Many primary school art departments have had funding reduced, impacting art education. The Government must provide additional funding so all primary school students receive the arts education they deserve, as it can be greatly beneficial for their development and allows them to express themselves.",
