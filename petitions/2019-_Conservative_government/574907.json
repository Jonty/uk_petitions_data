These include the need:\r\n\r\n- for a suitable environment (place to live)\r\n- for a suitable diet\r\n- to exhibit normal behaviour patterns\r\n- to be housed with, or apart from, other animals (if applicable)\r\n- to be protected from pain, injury, suffering and disease\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, we could accept a petition calling for the Government to ban keeping alpacas as livestock, if that's something you want to happen."
