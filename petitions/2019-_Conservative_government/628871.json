The schools having no uniform would result in classes being more colourful which then influences creativity, happiness & makes students more eager to attend schools. Uniforms are expensive & families struggle to buy & replace them which then effects the family\u2019s bills, & food bill. There are also no uniforms in colleges, university etc. so why the need for children?",
