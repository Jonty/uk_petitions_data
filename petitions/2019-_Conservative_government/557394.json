        "additional_details": "We realised after the 1st lockdown that closing gyms was a massive mistake & played a huge part in the decline of everyone's mental health, increasing anxiety. Gyms are low risk, the science backs that along with UK Active releasing figures. For so many, gyms are more than a place of exercise. It's our home, a family and to take that away is immoral Please hear our voices, see sense & overturn this decision.",
        "background": "I ask you to review the new restrictions that have been made due to the recent lockdown. The data proves that gyms & leisure are not the cause of the rise in cases & I for one urge you to have another look at that. Gyms are so vital to people's physical & mental health, to close would be a disaster.",
