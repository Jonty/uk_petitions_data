It was only due to family and nearby publicans being on site that allowed for our escape and prevented us from potentially drowning. A brightly coloured and easily accessible car window breaker and seat belt cutter could be used in any sort of emergency whereby the conventional means of escaping from a vehicle is not possible. These could be placed above the driver's side window for ease of access.",

This could help in case of an emergencies where conventional means of escape are hindered.",
