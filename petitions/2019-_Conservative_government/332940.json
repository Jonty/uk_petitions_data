        "additional_details": "We believe including calorie counts on restaurant menus would be at the extreme mental and physical detriment of those suffering from eating disorders, which research suggests is somewhere between 1.25 and 3.4 million people in the UK alone. Calorie counts can promote food being seen as a \"reward\" that is \"earned\", which can encourage excessive exercise and potential binging/purging behaviours. Eating out should be a pleasurable and enjoyable experience, not one dominated by anxiety around eating.",
        "background": "PM Boris Johnson recently promoted the idea of including calorie counts on restaurant menus to \"tackle obesity\". We, the undersigned, are asking that this does NOT happen. Calories are not a constructive way to determine full nutritional value, and we ask the government to consider other factors.",
