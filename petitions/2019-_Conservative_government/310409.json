If all unsecured personal debt was wiped clear (\u00a3250-300bn) the population would have alot more cash flow to spend in our shops and on our high streets to help boost and revive our economy. I feel in the wake of this an adjustment to the way credit is offered to make it more difficult to obtain would be of great benefit also to prevent re occurrence.",
