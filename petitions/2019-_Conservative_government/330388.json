        "additional_details": "Beauty and tattoo studios have qualifications in cross contamination and infection control. The fact that this has been overlooked makes no sense. Many of these businesses also use PPE anyway as part of their daily processes. But even so, we would stay closed If we could afford to. Right now many businesses that are still closed are liable for rent, insurances, and utilities and have no more lifelines to use. Please provide a 2nd grant to those businesses who are still forced into closure.",
        "background": "Salons and businesses are still prevented from opening by the government and liable for rent, utilities and insurances. The government has allowed most other businesses to get back up and running - it\u2019s still a blanket no for some - with no help left and no additional loans or grants available.",
