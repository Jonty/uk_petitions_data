When a litigant in person is new to the procedure of court & will be up against a seasoned professional who know how to manipulate their clients words & wishes, use their previous experience to benefit their client. It is a gross injustice for the child especially when hearsay, speculation, conjecture, assumption & prejudice are allowed in court without true factual based evidence. children deserve more.",
