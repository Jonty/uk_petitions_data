        "additional_details": "The government should recognise that there is a significant difference between UK companies importing large volumes of goods for selling on to private individuals here in the UK, and those same individuals themselves buying small quantities of goods for their own personal use. \r\n\r\nIf the charges continue, EU companies will be less inclined to sell direct to UK citizens, and those UK citizens will cease buying from them because of the extra costs. This will also happen in reverse, and is not in the economic interests of either the UK or the EU.",
