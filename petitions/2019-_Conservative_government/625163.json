For this reason we ask the Government to increase this year\u2019s bursary amounts to match those of next year. \r\n\r\nWe believe it does not seem fair that students beginning their courses this year will not benefit from the rise in bursary amounts, especially given these tough economic times and the predicted increase in inflation for 2023. For these reasons we ask that bursaries for the academic year 2022/23 be increased immediately, so that they match the 2023/24 bursaries.",
