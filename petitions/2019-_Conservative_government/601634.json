        "additional_details": "Through research involving scores of Councils using the above examples I have discovered that only one Council gives a rebate of council tax for their failure to collect bins. No Councils provide council tax rebates for the closure of their amenity tips during the Covid pandemic. No Councils provide council tax rebates to council tax paying residents who live on unadopted roads. All Councils have Equality included within their policies but are failing to uphold this policy in the examples given.",

Examples where equality is not being met relate to bin collections, the closure of Councils' amenity tips during the Covid pandemic, unadopted roads.",
