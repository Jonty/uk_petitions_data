        "additional_details": "The legislation says that SDPOs might contain prohibitions or requirements that prohibit a protestor from being in certain places, being with certain people, taking part in certain activities, or using the internet in particular ways.\r\n\r\nWe believe these powers are incompatible with the rule of law and values of democracy, and that the court should not be able to put in place an SDPO, when a protestor has not been found guilty of a related offence.\r\n",
        "background": "The Public Order Bill contains provisions to enable courts to issue Serious Disruption Prevention Orders (SDPOs), imposing any requirement of prohibition the court thinks are necessary, on application by a chief police officer, even if a protestor has not been convicted of any criminal offence.",
