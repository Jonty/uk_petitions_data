For most people this is a large amount of money, especially when you may have more than likely assumed you were British. I feel this system is unfair. Please allow those born in Britain to be British, without having to pay excessive costs.",

Currently you are not automatically a British citizen unless your mother was British or your father was British and married to your mother. You must instead register to become a British citizen.",
