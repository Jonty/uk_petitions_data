        "additional_details": "The cost to apply is \u00a31,012 if you're under 18 and \u00a31,206 if you're over 18, plus an extra \u00a319.20 to have your biometric information taken. For most people this is a large amount of money, especially when you may have more than likely assumed you were British. I feel this system is unfair. Please allow those born in Britain to be British, without having to pay excessive costs.",
        "background": "We would like the Government to lower costs for citizenship for people born in the UK before 2006. Currently you are not automatically a British citizen unless your mother was British or your father was British and married to your mother. You must instead register to become a British citizen.",
