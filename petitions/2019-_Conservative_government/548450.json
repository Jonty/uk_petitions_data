        "additional_details": "When the coronavirus pandemic broke the provision of PPE to healthcare staff was erratic and industrial masks were used. This was accepted in a rapidly evolving situation, but it is now time to find a more secure way of protect staff with masks that are comfortable, fully cleanable, and provide for good communication between the wearer and their patient. In order to do so we need a PPE regulatory framework that is fit for purpose for the healthcare setting.",
        "background": "The regulations regarding PPE of reusable face masks are designed for industrial applications. Masks that comply with these regulations are not fit for purpose in the healthcare setting and provide the patient with no protection either. A suitable regulatory framework needs to be developed.",
