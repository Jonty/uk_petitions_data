        "additional_details": "Currently cyclists have more power over the paying vehicle drivers on the road. However they flaunt the law and ride through red lights putting themselves and motorists at risk, Cyclists ride in the centre of the road when there is safe space to the side of the road. For decades it\u2019s worked but now the woke cyclist exists. Cyclists tax can be used to secure cycle lanes  like in France and Europe. Pavements do not have to be so wide as they are protected by the secure protected cycle lanes.",
        "background": "Cyclists should have a registration plate and have insurance to cover them and third parties. They should also pay road tax as they are users and the roads are currently being adapted for cyclists in a covert way to suppress motor vehicles. Most motorists have had enough of continual restrictions.",
