        "additional_details": "On 01/12/2020 it was ruled that rough sleeping can be deemed reasonable grounds to deport non UK nationals regardless of whether or not they are legally seeking refuge in the UK. A large majority of those who are going to be affected by this, are refugees fleeing from modern day slavery, persecution and trafficking. \r\n\r\nIn the words of Warsan Shire, \u201cno one chooses refugee camps or strip searches where your\r\nbody is left aching, no one leaves home unless home is the mouth of a shark\u201d.",
        "background": "We ask the government to review and reject this decision as it is an immoral infringement on the rights of those who are already vulnerable.",
