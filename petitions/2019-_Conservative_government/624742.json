The Royal British Legion was informed (not consulted) only after the decision was made. The level of disrespect & thoughtlessness of this act is quite amazing. The reason HBC gave was for ease of access & to help the local economy.Neither are good enough reasons to disrespect the memory & remembrance of our war dead.",
