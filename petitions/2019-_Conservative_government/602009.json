        "additional_details": "With lockdowns for last year's year 10s and 12s, counting their mocks and other coursework done throughout the year for their grade is unacceptable. Teacher assessed grades aren't reliable. We don't want the last 'proper' year of exams to have been 3 years ago. 2021/2022 year 13s will have had no practice at formal exams so would struggle at the immense pressure in university. Education overpowers other 'wants' that could be spared.",
        "background": "The Government should take any measures necessary to ensure that GCSE and A-level exams can take place as normal in 2022, including imposing a lockdown over Christmas or other major holidays where hospitalisations might increase if necessary.",
