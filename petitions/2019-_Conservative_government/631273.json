Immigration facilities were overflowing years ago, leading to the procurement of hotels at huge expense to the taxpayer. Now the Home Office is trying to procure mass accommodation facilities like ex-RAF bases in Linton, North Yorkshire and ex-student accommodation like The Lawns near Hull.\r\nThis is all done without any care for the surrounding communities and impact such facilities would have. It has to stop.",
        "background": "The Home Office must be stopped from procuring any further accommodation for migrants, asylum seekers and refugees. Including procurement through contractors and subsidiaries.\r\nThe government must stop new entries and deal with the huge backlog already here.",
