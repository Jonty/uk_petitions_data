        "action": "Increase legal protections for people undergoing cosmetic surgery",
        "additional_details": "Patients should be fully protected against poor surgical outcomes and inadequate aftercare. Currently it can be difficult for patients to seek compensation or revision when surgery goes wrong. We want new legislation that gives patients stronger rights to seek compensation or revision when surgery had gone wrong. There should also be no time limits on making claims for cosmetic surgery gone wrong, and all consultations and consent should be recorded to ensure there is an accurate record of this.",
        "background": "We would like the Government to introduce new legislation to protect people undergoing cosmetic surgery. This should establish new rights to make it easier for patients to seek compensation when surgery goes wrong, and introduce new rules regarding consent required before a procedure can go ahead.",
