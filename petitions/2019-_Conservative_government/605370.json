        "action": "Come April 2022, STOP energy companies increasing all energy bills by 50%.",
        "additional_details": "People can not afford these unprecedented, unreasonable and unaffordable energy price increases. As a result, people could be made homeless, penniless and undoubtedly, suicide rates will sadly rise, as people fail to cope with the Covid -19 pandemic, unaffordable energy prices, unemployment and depression.  Subsequently we want the government and the energy companies, to stop these unprecedented and unaffordable 50% increased energy prices, otherwise a lot of people will suffer.",
        "background": "Due to unprecedented increases in the wholesale price of energy, the regulator's energy price cap is expected to rise by over 50% in April from its current level of \u00a31,277 a year, severely denting people's finances as bills get more expensive.\u00a0The government must stop these 50% energy price increase",
