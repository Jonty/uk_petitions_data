        "additional_details": "Hopefully we can be rewarded for the hard work and sacrifices made by all of us during the global pandemic with a new public holiday to be enjoyed in the middle of summer. I am certain that any new holiday would help boost the economy, in particular local businesses hardest hit during the pandemic. Having this additional holiday would be a nice summer addition to our current holidays and bridge the gap between the glut of spring holidays and the Summer bank holiday.",
        "background": "Create a new permanent public holiday on the nearest Monday to Midsummers Day, from 2022 onwards. This would allow people to enjoy much needed leisure time on one of the longest and (hopefully) nicest days of the year, With an average of 48 hours of daylight over the weekend (Sat, Sun and Monday)",
