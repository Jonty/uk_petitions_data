        "additional_details": "I would like our Government to ban milk manufacturers from using plastic bottles, and provide support for the transition from plastic milk bottles to biodegradable or glass bottles. We do not need to use plastic for milk, previously we used glass containers successfully. Therefore it must be possible for us to stop using so many of these containers that are bad for our planet.",
        "background": "I am very worried about the amount of single-use plastic that is used in this country, especially when I see the amount of plastic milk bottles used in cafes, restaurants and in our homes. I believe the Government should require manufacturers to supply milk in a more environmentally friendly way.",
