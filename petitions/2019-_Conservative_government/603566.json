        "additional_details": "This will adequately make students exam periods a lot better and significantly improve their state of mental health as expectations will not be placed as high upon them. Especially by lowering the grade boundaries for a pass from a 4 to a 3. Considering the fact that young people have been faced with a variety of challenges caused by the pandemic and a whole years worth of education has been missed due to this, It seems like a logical and fair way to ensure an ease of pressure on young people.",
        "background": "Whilst the government have acted in order to preserve the education of young people and believe that what they have put in place currently will ease the pressure as well as make the exams easier, It certainly does not feel or seem like it! Especially as a Year 11 pupil myself.",
