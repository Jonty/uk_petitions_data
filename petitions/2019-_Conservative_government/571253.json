        "additional_details": "Smart motorways have been the cause of a number of fatal incidents that could have been prevented if the hard shoulder still existed. A delay following an incident or breakdown results in late application of signage causing danger as other vehicles approach. \r\n\r\nThe lack of hard shoulder also impairs the ability of emergency services responding. \r\n\r\nSmart motorways are convenient and cheap form of motorway expansion that should never have been considered. It is money saving at the cost of lives.",
        "background": "Following coroner calls for reviews to smart motorways, we, the people, call upon the government to immediately halt development of any new smart motorways and prevent expansion of existing smart motorways. We also that that all existing smart motorways be reviewed independently and removed.",
