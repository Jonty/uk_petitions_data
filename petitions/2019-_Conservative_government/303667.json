        "additional_details": "There are many low paid workers, some that are paid weekly, that are only 1 or 2 pay checks away from serious financial difficulty. Statutory sick pay will not be enough to stave off the problems that arise with defaulting on rent payments or more important costs like car finance that if these were defaulted on could mean people not being able to make it to work, especially those that live in more rural communities. This could damage credit scores causing a long term unemployment problem.",
        "background": "For the UK government to provide economic assistance to businesses and staff employed in the hospitality industry, who are suffering unforeseen financial challenges that could have a profound effect on hundreds of thousands of people employed in the sector.",
