Due to my condition, I may have to change my pad during the day but normally there are no sanitary bins in men's toilets.\r\n \r\nThis means I have to use the disabled toilet, which sometimes can lead to me having to answer questions which can be distressing because I have autism spectrum disorder as well.\r\n \r\nRequiring sanitary bins in all toilets would ensure that everyone has access to facilities to dispose of sanitary waste.",

Currently sanitary bins are often only provided in women's toilets, and even that is not specifically required in law.",
