        "additional_details": "Greedy businesses are making cuts to staff asking people to work for them by way of self service checkouts sometimes quite forcefully. As a consumer by doing the checkout operators job saving the company money, recompense should be given in the way of discounted product or service. This is also adding to the forever challenge of older or vulnerable people being victimised and discriminated against if paying by card, forced to \u201cwork\u201d for the company.",
        "background": "Businesses are making it more important to use self service checkouts. Doing away with manpower and taking away the interaction between two people without offering the consumer anything for it. Make companies recognise the consumer \u201cworking\u201d for them with discounts.",
