        "additional_details": "Following government's decision to send students back to university, then the subsequent tightening of restrictions moving the university experience mostly online, many students now unnecessarily pay rent on accommodation they do not need, and in many cases aren't using.\r\n\r\nIt's unfair for students to continue paying rent for accomodation they're not using, all because of decisions government has made regarding sending students back to university and subsequent restrictions. They deserve a refund.",
        "background": "I propose that the government refunds students a proportion of their rent via a one off grant, sent to the details students provided in their student finance applications. Many students and their families are struggling to fund rent, and are unnecessarily doing so because of government decisions.",
