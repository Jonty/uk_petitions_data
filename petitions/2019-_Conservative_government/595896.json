        "additional_details": "In 2019 there were 5,691 suicides in England and Wales (ONS). Yet, in 2020 (Jan - Sept) there were 3442 suicides an evident increase which one can assume is not at all helped by the impact of lockdowns on mental health. It is evident that there is a genuine mental health crisis ongoing which can only be solved through reform and change. Therefore i emplore government to see the impact of this on the lives of the british public and investigate the evidently lacking mental health system.",
        "background": "Alongside the covid 19 crisis, there is an evident mental health crisis in the UK where people in dire need of crisis help are not recieving the help they need. It is imperative that the government investigate mental health services and the system as a whole in order to better help those in crisis.",
