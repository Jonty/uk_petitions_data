        "additional_details": "By moving cannabis into a legal, regulated framework the UK could shrink the illicit market, improve product safety and restrict underage use.  \r\n\r\n\r\nStudies have shown that legalisation could bring in tax revenues of \u00a31 billion per year, which could be invested into public services. An estimated \u00a32.5 billion a year would be taken out of the illicit market and brought into the regular economy.",
