        "additional_details": "Steps have been taken to help businesses and employees affected by Covid-19, yet the needs of students have not been addressed. Student finance is insufficient, particularly for Masters students who do not receive maintenance loans. They rely on gig economy jobs to meet daily living costs. The sudden unexpected loss of these earning will cause hardship and they now face immediate poverty. In these exceptional circumstances, students with bills to pay should be able to access Universal Credit.",
        "background": "We would like the Government to extend universal credit to all students. Students are left with university fees, household bills and loan repayments, most have lost their part-time jobs due to Covid-19.\r\nGenerally, students who worked part-time do not fall into self-employed or employed categories.",
