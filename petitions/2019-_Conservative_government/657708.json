        "additional_details": "Epinephrine autoinjectors can be lifesavers. They are incredibly easy to administer; I think it's utterly ridiculous that airlines operating in the UK don't carry them as standard. Some airlines carry voiles of adrenaline, but these have to be administered by a medical professional, and there can never be a medic guaranteed on every flight. Schools can hold emergency epinephrine autoinjectors and train staff, and we believe it is ludicrous and frankly dangerous for Airlines to not be equipped  with epinephrine autoinjectors. This is such a simple action, there is no excuse.",
        "background": "On 19th February, whilst flying from Malaga back to Luton, I went into anaphylactic shock for the first time. I had no epinephrine autoinjector, and there were none in the first aid kit. Luckily another passenger gave my husband her EpiPen and I received the lifesaving treatment.",
