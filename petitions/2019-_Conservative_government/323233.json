Many have brought disposable BBQs with them which have led to fires & valuable resources being diverted to tackle the aftermath.\r\nThese are often left to smoulder unwatched meaning children stand on them causing burns & wildlife can get trapped in the mesh.\r\nThey are another source of unwanted litter picked up by volunteers, please ban them completely from sale in shops and elsewhere.",
