        "additional_details": "The NHS forms part of the UK's social fabric and deserves an official day of recognition. This day should be used for educational purposes to make the public more aware of how best to use and support their local NHS services, which could ease pressure generally and in health crises. The sentiment behind the 'clap for our carers' initiative on 26 March 2020 set a brilliant precedent which should be carried forward. The NHS isn't just for crisis, it's for life.",
        "background": "We want Parliament to make the 26th of March the annual NHS Appreciation Day on which we can celebrate the dedication of our NHS workforce, not just in response to the coronavirus pandemic, but throughout the year. The people of the NHS have helped us all at some point, so let's thank them for it.",
