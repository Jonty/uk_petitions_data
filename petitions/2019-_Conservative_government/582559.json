All staff in schools do their best to support young people following trauma or a challenging time in their life, but to have a qualified counsellor there to support the child in school as well, would support the wellbeing of children beyond words.",
        "background": "A qualified school counsellor in each school/cluster would significantly support young people. \u201cLess than half (47%) of schools employed a counsellor who was a member of a professional body; only 44% of school counsellors had a qualification. 15% had no qualifications in counselling.\u201d",
