        "action": "Ban production and sale of wet wipes containing polyester",
        "additional_details": "Each year about 7.6 billion pounds of wipes go to landfill. Many more of these are flushed down the toilet. Most wipes contain polyester and will take at least 100 years to degrade. When they are flushed down the toilet they do not break down like toilet paper and therefore can cause blockages in sewers. The wipes that do make it through the waste system often end up making their way into our rivers and oceans. Sea creatures accidentally consume them, putting plastic into our food chain.",
        "background": "Ban production and sale of wet wipes containing polyester as they pose a massive threat to marine life all over the world. Similar to plastic bags, they take at least 100 years to break down in landfill and when flushed down the toilet make their way into the food chain by being consumed by fish",
