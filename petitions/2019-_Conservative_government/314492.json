Most commonly, please are burning garden waste and they don't wait until it has dried out; they are burning green waste which is more toxic.  \r\n\r\nThe bonfires are a hazard to the environment and health of people, especially those with breathing problems.  \r\n\r\nCurrently there is no law on time restrictions of bonfires, location of bonfires or size of bonfires.  People just light them whenever they want paying no particular thought to neighbours.",
