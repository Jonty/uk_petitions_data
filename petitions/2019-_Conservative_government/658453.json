Hydrogen sulphide and ammonia - harmful systemic effects via direct inhalation and trace elements e.g xylenes and dioxin - linked to malignancy and birth defects. \r\nWe frequently detect gaseous odour (unmistakably, hydrogen sulphide) in our homes via closed doors and windows. It impacts quality of life, is detrimental to physical and mental health and devalues our homes. We are expected to endure this until 12/26.",
        "background": "We residents proximal to the site regularly experience malodour from decaying rubbish, but recently this also includes increasing incidents of exposure to leaking toxic landfill gas; The worst episode yet 04/03/24 was acknowledged by the operators as a \u2018fault\u2019 and was detected up to 4.8 km away.",
