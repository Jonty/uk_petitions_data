        "additional_details": "There is a common thought that each parent has equal rights, this is so far from the truth. Fathers have to fight through court to see their child every other weekend. Then nothing happens to non compliance to these court orders. Parents use and emotionally abuse their kids through their hatred of the other parent. No repercussions for false allegations, no repercussions for damage to their kids mental health. No support from Social Services, no one to turn too.",
        "background": "Make Parental Alienation a Criminal Offence. Children are innocent and some parents use children in their hatred for the other parent. All kids need a Mother and Father, not one trying to get one over on the other parent.",
