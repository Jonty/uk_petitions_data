The Police say driving for exercise if unnecessary. People are confused about what is allowed. Is using our car's to travel to parks locally unnecessary travel? People from the same household going to the shops. The legislation does not state this is forbidden and feel the police are using overzealous actions. Police are loosing public trust",
        "background": "Police forces are interpreting the new coronavirus rules differently, the legislation should be more precise about their powers. People are being summonsed to court for following government guidance. Different messages by various member of police and MP's have left the public confused.",
