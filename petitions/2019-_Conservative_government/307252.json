        "additional_details": "Am I the only one who thinks its mad for schools to be open for NHS staff and other frontline staffs children! Nearly 1.5 million are employed by the NHS. Surely it would be better to use smaller settings i.e childminders small nurseries to prevent such big crowds together. Putting a load of kids back in schools is not going to prevent the spread is it now! \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I fully understand the reasoning to open to protect vulnerable children although in this day and age it is saddening and shocking that it is still relied upon for some children to eat at school purely because of poverty \ud83d\ude2a I also realise some are stuck for childcare but surely our children's health comes 1st. No one should feel that the schools are they're only option! This would also keep small businesses of this kind afloat",
