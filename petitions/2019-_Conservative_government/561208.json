        "additional_details": "The government have imposed more than a decade of austerity on public sector workers after the reckless excesses of the banking sector caused financial turmoil in 2008. Throughout the covid pandemic, as millions were paid 80% of their wages to stay at home, public sector workers continued to work, despite risks to their health. It is grossly unfair that they are penalised yet again, especially as private contractors have profited so much during this period. The government must rethink.",
        "background": "Public sector workers have suffered a decade of austerity to pay for the banking crisis of 2008. Despite working tirelessly throughout the pandemic, risking their health and that of their families, they face further erosion of their earnings. They need to be rewarded for their selfless devotion.",
