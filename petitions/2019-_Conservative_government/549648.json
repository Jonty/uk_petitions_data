        "additional_details": "A \u2018Workout to Help Out\u2019 initiative will not only help the UK fitness industry get back on its feet after 4 months of closure, encouraging the general public to return to or even start a new gym membership, but it would also have a huge impact on surviving and overcoming the health pandemic we are facing (and a potential second wave this Winter). \r\nObesity is one of the biggest health crises in the UK and recent studies have shown obesity drastically increases the risk of death of COVID-19.",
        "background": "Similar to the successful \u2018Eat Out to a Help Out\u2019 initiative run by the Government, we\u2019d like to see a \u2018Workout to Help Out\u2019 campaign, where the government subsidises gym memberships for the general public.",
