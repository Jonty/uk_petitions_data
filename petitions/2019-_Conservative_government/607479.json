        "additional_details": "Us road users are fed up of being discriminated against whilst we spend upwards of \u00a3700 to pass a motorcycle test and car tests cyclists now have more rights than us yet have no idea how to use public roads safely and legally, there needs to be an equal change that will punish those who deem it okay to make illegal manoeuvres like jumping red lights and not using cycle lanes where provided it can\u2019t be one rule for us and another for them",
        "background": "As the chances to the Highway Code have allowed cyclists to have more rights than other users we see it as only fair to introduce a licensing and points system for those who do not follow the Highway Code this should include module 1 and module 2 like the motorcycle test",
