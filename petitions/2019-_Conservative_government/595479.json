        "action": "Increase the number of Afghan refugees the UK will welcome",
        "additional_details": "We owe the people of Afghanistan a huge debt since Western interests have contributed to instability in the country. For over 20 years commercial interest within Afghanistan has led to a number of companies directly profiting from war. In addition, the allied takeover of Afghanistan, which included the UK, led to destabilisation where extremism has flourished. Thus, at the very least, we owe it to the people of Afghanistan to help them have a chance of a better life - 20,000 is not enough.",
        "background": "Following the US withdrawal of troops in Afghanistan which was followed by the Taliban takeover, the UK Government announced it intends to take in 20,000 Afghan refugees. This amount when compared to the total number of people displaced is derisory. Thus, we request an intake revision and increase.",
