        "additional_details": "Silver Voices research (from DWP sources) reveals that in September 2020 only 6% of state pensioners received the top rate of the new state pension at \u00a3185 per week, 87% received a basic State Pension of \u00a3142 or less. The UK provides the worst state pension in the developed world, which is insufficient for life\u2019s essentials, particularly with surging energy and food prices. After a lifetime of tax and national insurance contributions, older people deserve a minimum income of \u00a3200 per week without recourse to the benefits system.",

Any higher pensions should not be affected.",
