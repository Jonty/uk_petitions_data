The majority of workers in this country are working from home right now and are not getting ANY payments for equipment, utilities or sundries such as paper and ink.  This is an excessive amount of money whilst at the same time, a campaign is on to ask people, including the thousands without a current income and those who have lost their jobs, to donate to the NHS.  It appears that ALL civil servants are not EQUAL, as no one else is getting 10k",
