This will not stop people buying new cars but it will give Electric vehicles centre stage, perhaps even not taxing advertising for electric vehicles. This would help our country be completely ready for 2030 and be able reduce our emissions more quickly. Putting more electric vehicles on the road sooner will feed the second hand market.",
