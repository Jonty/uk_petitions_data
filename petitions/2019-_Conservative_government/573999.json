        "additional_details": "Young people are all too often either branded as not having enough knowledge about voting, parliament etc. to understand politics, or genuinely do not know enough knowledge and so feel like they cannot get involved with what is a very important subject.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of CCEA's GCSE specification, there are currently only A-level politics courses. However, with students having the choice with what subjects they take, they very often opt out of learning about this crucial topic.",
        "background": "The Government should make Politics compulsory at secondary school including for GCSE. The curriculum should introduce students to democracy and international politics so that they can be more engaged. Topics can include Political Parties, Parliament, the Constitution, international bodies etc.",
