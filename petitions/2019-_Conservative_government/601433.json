        "additional_details": "Spiking incidents have increased all across UK. These have instilled fear in female university students (who have been targeted disproportionately) which have led them to boycott clubs. Victims have no memory of the event (making it harder to report) with serious medical complications followed after. Women should be protected by introducing trained individuals that help prevent this abuse.",
        "background": "From 2015 there has been a 74% increase in the spiking cases with 179 being reported just in the last year. Therefore, the government should require all licensed premises such as pubs, bars and clubs to have trained on sight officer helping to prevent the spiking of drinks.",
