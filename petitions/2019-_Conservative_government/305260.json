As with the current Covid-19 it may potentially lead to redundancies which in turn can leave our people without money for rent, bills and food to eat. I believe the Government should support the people as this could in turn lead to more unnecessary homelessness. With businesses already closing, we need to ensure we have the most basic of human rights which is a shelter.",
