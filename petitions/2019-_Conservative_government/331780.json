        "additional_details": "I think it is vital for some sort of job scheme to be introduced so that students aren\u2019t struggling over the summer period or relying on parents. \r\nThe funding students receive is often spent on accommodation meaning that by the time summer starts they have no income and then have to wait until September to receive another maintenance payment making it very hard to survive the summer months.",
        "background": "As a first year student myself, I\u2019m astounded by the lack of help from the government for students over the summer period. Employers aren\u2019t fond of hiring students as they will leave again in September.",
