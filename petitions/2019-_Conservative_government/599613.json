        "action": "Modernise the national school curriculum and make it more diverse.",
        "additional_details": "It is unjust for children from minority backgrounds to be unaware of any other sort of history other than white or European history. Kids are seldom taught about the contributions that White people have made to the United Kingdom; learning about slavery and MLK is insufficient in comparison to the European history that students are taught in school. This is one of the very few reasons we need to modernise the national school curriculum in order to include others that may feel isolated.",
        "background": "We urge the government to incorporate a diverse range of cultural roots in the national school curriculum, making it comparable to European history taught in schools. Students have the right to study about Asian, Black, and other minority histories.",
