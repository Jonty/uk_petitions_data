        "additional_details": "Any new child to a family is a life changing event, but the first is a major life adjustment. It requires learning a host of new skills whilst under stress and sleep deprivation. Four weeks would allow more time to improve paternal relationships with the new child and reduce stress on the mother. This could reduce baby blues and other mental problems and potentially reduce parental splits. Caring for a whole new human being is a huge responsibility that justifies more than 2 weeks of training.",
