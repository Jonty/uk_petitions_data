        "additional_details": "The UK mortality rate due to Covid is 135 deaths per 100,000 population and is the sixth highest in the world.   \r\nThis compares with the USA at 122 deaths per 100,000 population, France at 106 deaths per 100,000 population and Germany at just 57 deaths per 100,000 population.  \r\nPeriodic global pandemics have occurred throughout history and will occur in the future.  We in the UK need to avoid repeating the terrifying loss of life and economic destruction we are presently suffering.",
        "background": "Hold a review to understand how wide disparities of mortality rates exist between the UK and other comparable countries and to learn lessons as to how future pandemics may be better prepared for and managed.",
