        "action": "Make Electric Scooters Legal On UK Roads And In Bicycle Lanes.",
        "additional_details": "Right now the only way electric scooters can be used legally is through private property. And since the pandemic the rise of the use of these scooters has increased dramatically and I feel with the right restrictions and requirements we can use them safely. The rise in these scooters is due to the fact that people cannot use public transport. I think legalising the use of them will help people get to work, especially people will be using less public transport even after lockdown has lifted.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to legalise the use of Electric Scooters on UK roads, and in bicycle lanes. Restrictions and requirements for the scooters could include speed caps, helmet and age requirements. Preference would be not to have to register the scooters.",
