        "additional_details": "Grounds:\r\n1. The financial burden of COVID-19 should be shared. It is unreasonable for companies to place all of this onto their tenants.\r\n2. Support packages are available for businesses of all sizes - little extra support is available for students.\r\n3. Many students work in hospitality to supplement student finance, and these venues are likely to be the last to reopen. Parents may also be less able to offer support.\r\n4. It is predicted that the next academic year will start later than planned.",
