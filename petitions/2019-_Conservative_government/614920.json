The Government is therefore not directly responsible for the action this petition calls for.\r\n\r\nIf you have concerns about how your local authority is enforcing access protection markings, you could raise this issue with a local councillor who represents you. You can find out who your local councillors are, and how to contact them, by entering your post code here:\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors\r\n\r\nYou could have a petition calling for parking across driveways to be made a criminal offence, if that is something you'd like to see happen."
