        "additional_details": "The majority of many other countries have enforced this rule. As the UK is a hub for international travel, the risks for not implementing this rule here will most definitely worsen the lives of all our elderly community and everyone else. \r\n\r\nOf course, any family member who wants to be with their family or in all other circumstances can still come to the UK if necessary, but their travel here should not be taken so lightly.\r\n\r\nPlease remember your own family and consider signing this petition.",
        "background": "If Boris Johnson pursues his current plans to create immunity for the coronavirus, the least the government can do is enforce a 14-day quarantine for all incoming travellers at every airport in the UK.",
