        "additional_details": "I believe this is damaging to the sport of football in England. It represents a slap in the face to the communities the clubs represent, and, if allowed to go ahead, will be one step towards their complete departure from domestic competitions. Not only that, it will have an immediate undermining effect on existing competitions in England. The proposed super league damages the culture, tradition, economics and society of football at home and steps which can be taken to prevent it must be debated.",

The Culture Secretary said that the Government would back the football authorities to stop this move, and if the football authorities couldn\u2019t act, the Government would. The Culture Secretary said the Government would \"put everything on the table to prevent this from happening.\"\r\n\r\nYou can read the Culture Secretary's full statement on the European Super League here: https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/statement-by-oliver-dowden-on-the-european-super-league\r\n\r\nYou can read a report about the English clubs' withdrawal from the European Super League here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/56823501.\r\n\r\nFurther, on 19 April the Government announced a 'Fan-led review of football governance', which will explore ways of improving the governance, ownership and financial sustainability of clubs in English football, building on the strengths of the football pyramid.
