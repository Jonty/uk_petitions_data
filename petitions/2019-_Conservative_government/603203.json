        "action": "Support the independent hospitality sector during the periods of Dec. and Jan.",
        "additional_details": "During the next 6 months hospitality businesses are required to repay any outstanding rents, part of the business rates as well as sums towards the bounce back loans that they received. At the current reduced rate of footfall, which is expected to reduce even further during January, a lot of businesses will have to close for ever. This will increase unemployment and destroy any independent small businesses on the high streets of the country. A support grant at this moment is therefor imperative.",
        "background": "Support the small independent hospitality businesses of the country as they are currently struggling to survive with footfall dropping massively due to the public being afraid to shop physically, because of the new covid variant and the increase of online purchases from national corporations.",
