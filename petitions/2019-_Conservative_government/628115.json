        "additional_details": "Aside from the environmental issues relating to sale of disposable vapes, there has been an increase in the percentage of young individuals using e-cigarettes. With the ban on menthol cigarettes in the UK in 2020 and the target of smokefree England by 2030, it does not seem viable to continue the sale of such destructive products.",
        "background": "Ban the import and sale of disposable vapes. The vapes mostly contain lithium batteries, which there is currently a global shortage. Due to being incorrectly discarded, plus the inability to be recycled, the vapes are polluting waters and causing negative impacts to biodiversity.",
