        "additional_details": "The predicted grades are designed as a tool for students to identify their strengths and areas they need to work on.\r\n\r\nI will like to suggest that PM Boris Johnson allows Year 11 and Year 13 students carry on with their schooling and take their exams as scheduled. If, unfortunately, any of the students develops symptoms of coronavirus, the students can be excluded from school and the students can resit their exams during the summer break. I strongly believe this is a better and fairer solution.",
        "background": "Whilst we have a serious health problem with the coronavirus and I understand the govt and PM have a duty of care to the citizens, cancelling the GCSE and A Level exams will have a detrimental effect on the students and their ability to either get into desired schools for A Levels and Universities.",
