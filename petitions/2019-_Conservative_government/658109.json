        "additional_details": " Tuk's Law request vets be required to:\r\n - Scan microchips prior to euthanising a healthy/treatable animal in a non-emergency situation\r\n- Confirm RBU/keeper on original database of unknown animals presented for euthanasia.\r\n- Seek alternative options in non life threatening/non emergency situations\r\n- Require corroborating evidence if an unsubstantiated reason for euthanasia is made\r\n\r\nFailure to scan microchip and contact RBU or registered keeper should result in an independent investigation involving all interested parties.\r\n",
        "background": "Despite changes to the RCVS Code of Conduct dogs/cats can still legally be euthanised without being scanned. In non-emergencies, we want vets to be legally required to scan microchips prior to euthanasia for RBU and confirm the person presenting the animal is registered on the microchip.",
