        "additional_details": "In July 2018, Theresa May stated to ban GCT (Gay Conversion Therapy) during her time as PM. In July 2020, Boris Johnson stated to ban GCT during his time as PM. It's nearly 3 years since and no decisive action has been made by Government. No agreed timeline of when the ban will be introduced into law. \r\n\r\nThey have done surveys and have undertaken research that concludes that this should be made illegal. And already MPs from cross parties are urging imminent action is necessary at this time.",
        "background": "The Government must confirm a timeline as to when the ban on LGBT+ conversion therapy will be passed as legislation and be made illegal under the law. If Government continues to drag further, it will affect LGBT+ people who as of now are receiving harmful and unethical treatments and practices.",
