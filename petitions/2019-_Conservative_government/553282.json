        "additional_details": "Student loans have to be paid back , so as well as being penalised by universal credit and having income reduced for receiving them - we still have to pay the loans back . We do not have a choice to decline the maintenance loan as it is still taken as income anyway. We are being forced into debt. It is difficult , especially for parents , to find employment around changing university timetables. Students are being either forced into poverty or giving up their studies .",
        "background": "Stop taking maintenance loans as income for universal credit purposes or at least change the rules so that the entitlement is reduced by 63p per \u00a31 instead of \u00a31 for \u00a31 just like earned income is . Students , especially parents , are being reduced to poverty or having to leave higher education.",
