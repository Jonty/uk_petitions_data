        "additional_details": "There are currently two associations attempting to govern funerals, membership is voluntary and they have no real sanctions available. It can be described as marking your own homework. This is simply not enough. The CMA has looked at the funerals sector, highlighting serious concerns. I believe in some cases our loved ones are being neglected, losing someone is something that will affect all of us at some point in life and I cannot be at peace knowing it continues. Many funeral directors see no issue with regulation. We need this addressed in parliament. We need help from our government.",
        "background": "Many families trust funeral directors with the care of their loved owns without knowing they are largely unregulated. My aim is for the government to start the process of creating a regulatory body to ensure our deceased are treated with dignity and respect.",
