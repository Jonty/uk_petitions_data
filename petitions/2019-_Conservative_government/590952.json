If public servants are using private email accounts to do public business, this could be hidden, overlooked, or made unavailable during freedom of information requests or investigations. By making it illegal to do public business on private accounts, you minimise corruption and lack of transparency while helping future officials. Matt Hancock is the latest MP to be investigated for conducting official business using personal email.",

We want law enacted to make it mandatory to use official accounts for communication, outlawing personal accounts for communication in connection with public service.",
