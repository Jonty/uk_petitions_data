        "additional_details": "This changing of product sizes, often a reduction in size without a corresponding drop in price (so called \u2018Shrinkflation\u2019) can be misleading. This phenomenon can affect budgeting and financial planning for households, particularly those with limited income. A 'New Size' label on items that change size by a significant amount could help ensure transparency, protects consumer rights, and promote trust in the marketplace. We believe it is a necessary step towards fair consumer practices.",
        "background": "Mandate manufacturers and suppliers to clearly label product size changes to enhance consumer awareness and help prevent deceptive practices. We suggest that changes of more than 10% within the last 6 months should require a \"New Size\" label covering at least 10% of packaging for at least 3 months.",
