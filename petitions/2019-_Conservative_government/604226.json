The rise in addictive behaviour, children seeing explicit materials online, peer on peer abuse, sexting, mental health issues linked to social media, cyber bullying and peer pressure is directly linked to children using smart phones. Therefore is it time phones were given an age restriction. To own you own mobile phone a person should be required to show ID to prove they were over the age of 18.",
