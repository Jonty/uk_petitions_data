        "additional_details": "UK birth registration is outdated and discriminatory, e.g. the Births and Deaths Registration Act dates back to 1953 and only recognises one family structure: \"the nuclear family\".\r\nKey issues:\r\n\u2013 Only heterosexual, cisgender parents can register accurately as \"mother\" or \"father\"\r\n\u2013 Children born to transgender parents or through surrogacy have inaccurate birth certificates\r\n\u2013 The definition of \"parent\" in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 is extremely narrow and gender-specific",
        "background": "Birth certificates should record legal parenthood. Parents need the choice to register according to legal gender or gender neutrally. Children must also know their genetic make-up and who gave birth to them. This requires root and branch reform of birth registration law (inc. the BRDA, HFEA and GRA)",
