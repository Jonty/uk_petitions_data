        "additional_details": "This could be made clear or included on the certificate, or recorded separately.\r\n\r\nUK birth registration is outdated and discriminatory.\r\n\r\nAll legal parents, including through surrogacy, must be recognised from conception and allowed to register on their child's birth certificate.\r\n\r\nKey issues:\r\n\u2013 Only heterosexual, cisgender parents can register accurately as \"mother\" or \"father\"\r\n\u2013 Children born to transgender parents or through surrogacy have inaccurate birth certificates. Trans parents cannot register as their legal gender but must register as their sex assigned at birth, even if they have a Gender Recognition Certificate and therefore, an updated birth certificate\r\n\u2013 The definition of \"parent\" in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act is extremely narrow and gender-specific\r\n",
        "background": "Birth certificates should record legal parenthood. Parents need the choice to register according to their legal gender or gender neutrally. The gender neutral 'parent' label should be available to anyone to choose.\r\n \r\nChildren must be able to know their genetic make-up and who gave birth to them. ",
