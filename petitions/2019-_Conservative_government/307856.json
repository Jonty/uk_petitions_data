The retail price for one of these in say ASDA is \u00a310.85 for the same product.  \r\nIm 26 with 3 kids all under 4, im struggling enough as it is to keep my family safe. For most of us, even those who don't have children are at breaking point now.\r\n\r\nAll these little 'bans' that supermarket retailers have, their own rules  don't always apply and most people seem to bypass them.\r\n\r\nWe are one of the most luckiest countries out there for this industry and people are just taking advantage and leaving others with nothing!\r\n\r\n",

NHS staff facing empty shelves after a 14hr shift. Its absolutely vile watching people fight over a packet of wipes, chicken, toilet roll etc.",
