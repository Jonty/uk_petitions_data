This has been a challenge for many, but hellish for those whose homes are not up to standard.\r\n\r\nA recent study by University College London (UCL) and the University of London (UL) found that homes delivered through change of use PDR were often poorer than those delivered through a full planning permission in terms of delivery of space standards, adequacy of natural light, and access to amenity space, to name a few.\r\n\r\nThe Government should take action to ensure that homes delivered under change of use PDR are of a comparable standard to those delivered through full planning permission.",
