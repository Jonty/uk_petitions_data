        "background": "Allow parents who lose a pregnancy before 24 weeks least three days to grieve by introducing paid miscarriage. \r\n\r\nOne in four pregnancies end in miscarriage. Under current legislation, workers are entitled to two weeks of paid bereavement leave following a stillbirth after 24 weeks of pregnancy.",
