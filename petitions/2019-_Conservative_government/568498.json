        "additional_details": "England wouldn't be the first country to make this change. Austria, Brazil and Argentina have already done this, with Scotland having lowered it for non Westminister elections. Wales will also be doing the same as Scotland in 2021. No one has seen any detrimental effects. Lowering the voting age would also make the result of any election more accurate, as it takes into consideration the opinions of a larger amount of the UK population. Young people have a voice, and it needs to be heard.",
        "background": "At 16, you can: get married, work full time, play the lottery, join a trade union, pilot a glider, leave home and join the armed forces. So why not vote? 16/17 year olds are mature and responsible enough to make informed political decisions, and their opinions should be taken seriously and valued.",
