        "additional_details": "Yes, universities can offer refunds on a piecemeal case-by-case basis, but this situation is not a piecemeal case-by-case situation. All students will, invariably, at one time or another, be under either local lockdown or mandated self-isolation - situations under the control of government. Hence, it is only right that the Government step in, with full legislative authority, to require universities to offer refunds of accomodation costs.",
        "background": "It is no secret that the coronavirus crisis is affecting students up and down this country. Given fines for failure to self-isolate, and the disruption to education, we are asking the Government to mandate an automatic refund of accommodation costs incurred during self-isolation & lockdowns.",
