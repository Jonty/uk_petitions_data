        "additional_details": "Students have faced varying levels of disruption, affecting the length at which they have learnt the curriculum. Factors other than time away from school, such as family bereavement, a lack of internet access, parental job stresses, and mental health pressures, have further compounded the attainment gap. Teachers - the people who have spent years marking student's homework and past assessments - are undoubtedly best placed to know what they would be capable of.",
        "background": "Gavin Williamson has written to Ofqual, proposing 'externally set papers.' These are the opposite of what was originally promised - exams. We instead need more understanding and recognition that teachers can best access and grade students.",
