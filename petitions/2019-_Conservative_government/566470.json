        "additional_details": "If we can tax sugar to protect public health or introduce a lockdown to save lives, why can't we tax those companies who are not held responsible for their environmental damage and CO2 emissions. Climate change will cause more deaths then corona and action must be taken to save those lives. We have both a legal and moral obligation to tackle this and the responsibility lies with both governments and TNCs. If we don't hold them responsible you are committing us to extinction.",
        "background": "Tax large companies on their co2 emissions both nationally and globally, have consequences for those companies who we know pollute and damage the environment. Put this money back into funding new renewable, nuclear, and hydrogen fuel technologies and fund the scientific breakthroughs we need.",
