        "additional_details": "As part of nationalisation, the Government should introduce an entry test, like the one in South Korea, where they sit the College Scholastic Ability Test. This tells citizens what university they would get into. This would be better for everyone as a more skilled workforce would be richer and could make crime rates lower. Also, more people could come off benefits and other social schemes as they would have a better jobs. In this the pros outweigh the cons.",
        "background": "The way for a rich successful country is to have good education. If University was free and nationalised it would increase education and also make the population smarter and richer. Here the pros outweigh the cons as after the COVID-19 pandemic this would help to revive the economy.",
