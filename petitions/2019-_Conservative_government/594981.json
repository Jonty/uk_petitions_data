They\u2019re available right now so would help accelerate pollution reduction during the considerable time before internal combustion engines cease to be in widespread use (the 2030/35 ban only applies to sales of new vehicles). Parliament should also consider related issues such as 3rd party insurance and minimum safety equipment required for riders.",
