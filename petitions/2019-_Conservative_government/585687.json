        "additional_details": "Academics researching this discrimination have argued: \"society should consider policies to guard against this form of discrimination\" (Stulp et al., 2012). Research in this field has been undertaken for over five decades, with evidence of height prejudice being published in 1968, (Wilson. P., 1968), and new studies appearing in 2021 (see above). When will it be time to acknowledge that discrimination can occur to people outside of the current protected characteristics? Amend the Equality Act 2010.",
        "background": "Height discrimination is a scientifically proven, yet largely unknown bias that impacts men and women. Studies have stated, \"employers prefer not to hire or promote short employees\" (Omer., 2020), as \"stereotypes may play a role, inducing halo effects favoring taller people\" (Buunk et al., 2021).",
