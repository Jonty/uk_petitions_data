        "additional_details": "It is believed that such a system will not only solve man power and retention issues within our Armed Forces. But also it will go a long way to solving the problems of Anti Social Behaviour. Giving young people a new mentality / second chance to believe in themselves and strive to a higher standard. It could help keep young people from turning to crime, and could also help to fight lifestyle-related medical issues that strain the NHS.",
        "background": "We ask the government to permanently restore a system of National Military Service such as that found prior to 1963. And to this day in South Korea or Israel for example. For each eligible person to serve a min of two years between the ages of 18 and 30, up to 40 if the candidate volunteers.",
