They should be allowed the freedom to do what they want with their bodies just like they do piercings. You can get piercings from 12 years old and the older you get the more piercings you\u2019re allowed to get on your body so why wouldn\u2019t they be allowed a tattoo at the age of 16. Lowering the age could stop 16/17 year olds going to unreputable tattoo parlours and coming back with infections etc.",

In other countries and states you can get a tattoo at 16 with parental consent and even without parental consent in some countries. 16 year olds should be allowed to get a tattoo at 16 with parental consent, just like they can get piercings.",
