        "additional_details": "Whilst I sit every week for treatment amongst my fellow cancer patients it shocks me how young the breast cancer patients are. I am on support groups on social media and again it shocks me how young the breast cancer patients are.  This has made me question why mammograms are only offered to women over 50 years old???? We know that triple negative breast cancer is being found in younger women and is an aggressive cancer. If it is detected early it can be treated!",
        "background": "The current age of women being offered breast screening to detect breast cancer is 50. However women in their 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s and even sadly as young as in their 20\u2019s are being diagnosed with breast cancer which they have found themselves.",
