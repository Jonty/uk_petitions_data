        "action": "Provide temporary financial support to the UK Care Sector throughout COVID19",
        "additional_details": "The UK Care Sector has been neglected and unsupported preCOVID19. The Coronavirus has led to increased costs through Operators having to privately procure PPE due to lack of state supply. Staffing costs are higher than ever, mortality rates are up to eight times higher than admission rates. Without Government support many operators could cease trading due to lack of liquidity. The Government has successfully cleared NHS debts. The Care Sector needs temporary financial support to ensure viability",
        "background": "I want the government to review the current level of support provided to UK Care Home Operators, ensuring that emergency funding is available for operators to ensure their financial viability during COVID19. This can be in the form of ensuring Local Authorities provide a short term income guarantee.",
