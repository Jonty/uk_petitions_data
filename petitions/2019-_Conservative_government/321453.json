        "additional_details": "MPs already earn way above the salary of an average person and this pay rise is unnecessary. They should not accept a pay rise and the money saved could be put to better use, such as the NHS or food banks.\r\n\r\nNo one is debating that MPs have a difficult job to do. However, since Coronvirus many people's eyes have been opened up to the reality of the work of the NHS and the incredible job they do saving lives. If they have to accept a pay freeze, it should be the same for MPs.",
        "background": "Keep the MPs salaries at \u00a379,500. \r\n\r\nFullfact.org states since 2010, MPs have seen a 2% rise in their wages. Public sector workers have struggled to support their families in the face of pay freezes. In real terms, Nurses earn 5% less, teachers 6% less and Police Officers 14% less than in 2010.",
