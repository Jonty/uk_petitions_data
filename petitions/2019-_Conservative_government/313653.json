        "additional_details": "Kennelling dogs pending court causes welfare & emotional problems for dogs/owners, it also drains police resources. Many dogs are returned by courts so release with conditions in the interim needs to be urgently undertaken. Hearings are being delayed; vets are not neutering which prevents dogs going home. DEFRA must relax exemption rules on neutering and all seized dogs in police custody released. Dogs can be kept on leads/muzzles in public and insured for third party to ensure public safety.",
