        "additional_details": "My organisation deals with freelancers every single day. I'm seeing firsthand the disruption and stress COVID-19 and IR35 legislation is causing. Many hiring organisations have reevaluated their engagement of freelancers due to IR35 but the onset of Coronavirus is having a major effect on business continuity for these independent professionals. People\u2019s livelihoods are at stake and pausing the one issue that is within the Government\u2019s immediate control (IR35) is desperately needed.",
        "background": "Freelancers are a vital part of the UK economy and the changing face of work. This petition requests the UK Government to deliver business relief for the increasing number of independent professionals that will be affected by COVID-19, and the postponement of IR35 legislation for 12 months.",
