        "additional_details": "Marriage is a bedrock of society and is vitally important, particularly for those with faith who cannot live together unless married. Work within an office is allowed, professional contact sport is allowed, shopping for non essential items is permitted. Marriage is more important than all of the above, can be conducted with 5/6 people whilst socially distancing (considering the married couple will live together in the same household), yet is still banned. It simply cannot stay like this.",
        "background": "Marriage should be allowed in the UK during lockdown. Whilst big gatherings are banned, marriages only need 5 people: the two getting married, the registrar/vicar, and two witnesses. Current guidelines allow 6 people to gather, therefore there should be no problem with weddings",
