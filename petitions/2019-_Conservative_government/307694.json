        "action": "Provide WHO standard PPE immediately to ALL frontline NHS staff AND care workers",
        "additional_details": "This is a simple, achievable set of products to manufacture rapidly and immediately protects the lives of frontline staff. It will prevent the spread of the disease in an already over-stretched NHS.\r\n\r\nAll frontline staff are at risk due to the current government provision of inadequate PPE.  Lives will be lost and the spread cannot be contained with such a glaring oversight by government.\r\n\r\nThis basic infection control measure in hospitals, primary care and care homes will save lives.",
        "background": "Immediately distribute WHO standard PPE to all frontline NHS staff and care home workers. Accept that this simple measure would greatly improve patient contacts and stop infecting frontline staff unnecessarily, potentially spreading COVID-19 further to at risk groups.\r\nForce manufacturers: make more",
