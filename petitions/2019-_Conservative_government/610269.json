It's not only women who suffer from sexual harassment, anyone can be affected and it's important to make this a specific criminal offence to deter this behaviour and to ensure it's known this behaviour is wrong and that those who sexually harass others can be more easily reprimanded and prosecuted. The law must reflect the strength and frequency with which sexual harassment affects victims.",
