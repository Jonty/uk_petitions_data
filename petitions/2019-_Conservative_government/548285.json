For one small business, their loss of revenue amounted to \u00a324k, but because this business received a grant of \u00a310k, the insurer says they have only lost \u00a314k & that is all they will pay. This business continues to lose money (uninsured) & by year end are likely to fall short by a further \u00a325k at least. The grant was not meant to help insurers, but clearly is.",
