The property we were selling our buyer pulled out last minute right before exchange and cost us solicitors fees, house number 1 and when I finally sold again a year later,  I had to take 17k less. House number 2 was undervalued by 20k and House number 3 the end of chain would not exchange before completion, everyone was packed in the removal vans and they decided not to move with no explanation Leaving us in difficulty",
