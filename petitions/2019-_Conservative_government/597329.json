        "additional_details": "The red list is draconian and is disproportionately affecting UK citizens who have ties in Africa or of African origin. This includes a lot of key workers who continue to serve our nation well. Some lost relatives and have been unable to travel due to the exorbitant fee. Asking a grieving person to isolate alone in a hotel and charge \u00a32285 is unfair. Please scrap this fee or reduce it. A clap is not enough for key workers of African origin, please lift or reduce this draconian charge.",
        "background": "Most of the African countries have been on the travel red list for several months now. Covid did not originate there and none of the main variants have been found there. According to WHO, to date (18.09.21), Africa has had approx 6 million confirmed cases of Covid versus approx 68 million in Europe.",
