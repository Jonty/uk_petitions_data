        "additional_details": "As Local & Community Theatres are mostly staffed by volunteers, they do not qualify, or receive, the essential financial support needed to remain alive, whilst in forced closure. Moreover, current social distancing guidelines prevents these venues from opening, as reduced audiences would cause continual losses and are unable to viably reopen. Therefore, additional funding would ensure that monthly staff and building overheads can be paid until they can resume near normal operations.",
        "background": "At least 30% of Local & Community Theatres are on the verge of total collapse and will permanently close by March 2021. Additional funding is urgently needed, to ensure their survival. Most of the \u00a31.57bn \"renewal fund\" has been given to the larger theatres within the London and Metropolitan areas.",
