        "additional_details": "If the HSF comes to an end in March, or if the Government provides significantly reduced funding, it could result in a cliff-edge in support for vulnerable people that many councils cannot fill.\r\n \r\nA significantly reduced local welfare offer could risk more people falling into financial crisis, destitution and homelessness. We want the Government to urgently extend the HSF for at least another year to help councils to support residents.\r\n",

The Government has not yet confirmed whether it will provide the HSF beyond 31 March 2024, when the current fund is set to end. Now is not the time to withdraw support for struggling households.",
