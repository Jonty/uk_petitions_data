        "additional_details": "The funding crisis is a direct result of government failing to sufficiently fund public sectors, in particular education settings. SEN Support and EHCP funding is provided by local authorities. At this stage the current funding is inadequate and cannot cater for the rapidly increasing numbers of children with additional needs accessing mainstream education. In Nottinghamshire if a child does not receive funding they cannot access specialist support. Lack of funding is impacting the vulnerable.",
        "background": "Schools in England are currently at crisis points with deficits to budgets and impending redundancies. The lack of sufficient funding is directly impacting our most vulnerable children and young people. Schools need access to more funding to support effectively.",
