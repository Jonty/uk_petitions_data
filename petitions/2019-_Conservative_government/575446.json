        "additional_details": "Many pple have been waiting to take driving tests and lessons for a months it is very upsetting for people who have had their test cancelled many times and their is a huge backlog of tests so opening them as soon as possible can relieve this. Also many driving instructers have been unable to work so have lost all their income. Driving tests and lessons can be safe if masks are worn and windows open ,students are sat far apart from their instructer so wouldnt be a risk to begin tests and lessons.",
        "background": "Parliament should allow driving tests and lessons to go ahead as soon as lockdown is released they should be included a priority and one of the first sectors to open straight away.",
