        "additional_details": "The governments strategy should be centered around nutritional education and wellbeing. \r\nAlso, many businesses are struggling due to Covid-19 and the RPC said the new measures will cost businesses \u00a3600,000 to implement calorie labelling. \r\nThis petition asks that the proposals be reviewed to ensure the measures: \r\n-Are evidenced based. \r\n-Do not promote crash diets. \r\n-Have involved eating disorder experts and ensured that people with experiences of eating disorders are not placed at further risk.",
        "background": "Around 1.3 million people in the U.K suffer with an eating disorder. These measures are likely to impact them in a negative way and put more people at risk of developing an ED. The government should tackle obesity, but putting an emphasis on calorie counting is not the approach to take.",
