        "additional_details": "Travellers are often mislead by travel insurers into taking out additional cover for delays and cancellations only to be met with a standard pay-off that is well under the additional costs they had to spend as a result of cancelled flights. Travel insurers insist that it is not included in their policies and consumers need to take this up directly with the airlines. This should be handled by travel insurance companies directly with the airlines. Can you imagine if car insurance worked this way?",
