We think that some riders for gig economy companies are breaking road safety laws, such as by using illegally modified e-bikes, running red lights and mounting pavements. However, gig economy companies may not be liable for their conduct, particularly where the rider is an independent contractor. \r\n \r\nWe want to change this so that these gig economy companies can be held liable for their riders' conduct so our streets can be safer.\r\n",
