One symptom of this problem is the number of people who have petitioned to abolish the organisation. \r\n\r\nThere is a half way house and that is for the organisation to mea culpa but they are incapable of doing so.\r\n\r\nThis petition draws on the concept of the court jester, where an undiscussable subject could be brought to the prince through humour.",
