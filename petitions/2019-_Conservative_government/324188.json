        "action": "Change the British educational curriculum to cover the UK Civil Rights movement",
        "additional_details": "In light of the events in May/June 2020, it is clear that the country is severely uneducated in the history of our own country. We are taught about the US Civil Rights movements, the Jim Crow Laws, and we get taught about Rosa Parks and MLK. But in my near 12 years in school, I have never once heard of any British Civil Rights activists. Education has the potential to be one of the biggest weapons against racism because it creates awareness, inspires accountability and catalyses change.",
        "background": "The government needs to include learning about the Civil Rights activists and movements within the UK in the national history/ PSHE curriculum. This includes movements such as the Bristol Bus Boycott, The Mangrove Nine and so many more. It should also aim to better cover British Colonialism.",
