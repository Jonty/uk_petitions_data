        "additional_details": "There has not been a situation with such far-reaching impact, globally, since World War II. The entire nation has been affected and has been called upon to help - some by just staying inside, many by risking their lives to ensure that the rest of the population can continue with theirs. Such a situation should be marked and remembered permanently. A new national holiday, allowing people to show their recognition of such a momentous event, would be an ideal way to come together and pay tribute.",
        "background": "To always remember those key workers who helped defeat COVID-19 a new Bank Holiday should be declared. The population that stayed indoors to fight the disease can join together outside to celebrate and remember the sacrifice made by all who were affected by it.",
