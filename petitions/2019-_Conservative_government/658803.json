Candidates stand on their party's values, policy and manifesto. It is widely understood by the electorate that a vote for a particular party's candidate is a vote for the party.\r\n \r\nMPs are elected to represent the interests of their constituents. We think that by switching parties an MP abandons the policy platform they were elected on. We think it is only right that they seek a renewed mandate from their constituents.\r\n",
