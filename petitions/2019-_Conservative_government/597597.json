Lots of companies are promoting use of Hybrids but this still get the 45p rate from business mileage. An increase in rate for EV would support the take up of EV\u2019s in business further. This measure fits with the BIK discount and promotion of the green economy where business can support the transition to EV and away from fossil fuels in cars and vehicles. the energy cost is so high",

This was set at 4p in 2017/18 and now with increasing cost of electricity and on the road charging cost does not fully cover the cost of the electricity needed to charge the EV. The current rate does not promote EV use",
