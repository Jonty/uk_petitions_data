        "additional_details": "The UK government should make a public statement to address their opposition to the bill, which would infringe on LGBTQ+ people, and advocates human rights. Anti-LGBTQ laws were implemented within the colonial rule of Ghana. It is the UK governments moral responsibility to engage in international discussions between Ghanaian  representatives and the UK to protect the rights of Ghanaian LGBTQ+ people.",
        "background": "The infringement of human rights globally is everyone's issue, therefore Ghana's plan to criminalise LGBTQ+ identities and anyone who is deemed to 'advocate' for them is a global issue. The UK government needs to send a clear intentional stance against the Ghanaian government passing this bill.",
