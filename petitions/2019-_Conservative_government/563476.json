        "additional_details": "This could lower the cases. The less ''super spreaders'' you have the quicker the cases will drop and the quicker life goes back to normal rather than giving it to the elderly who regardless are still being told to stay away from their families. This may sound harsh but its also fair since the goverment have already shown the young have more chance of getting it regardless if its less lethal to them or not.",
        "background": "The goverment should give the vaccine to the young and high risked illnesses first. If we as 18-25 are the so called super spreaders surly in that case we should get the vaccination first. With us going out more due to work etc surely this makes more logical sense to do.",
