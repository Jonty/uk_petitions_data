        "additional_details": "The assessment process does not work. In the last quarter there were approximately 65k mandatory reconsiderations for PIP, mine being one of them, the initial decision was over turned in my favour. Disabled people aren't being assessed properly, leaving many with either a huge reduction or losing benefits completely.  \r\nBeing disabled or mentally ill is a challenge, and to be told by a stranger that you're not, is soul destroying.",
        "background": "The Government need to reform how assessments are done, and more importantly who does them. Assessors don't alway write what you've said, and make assumptions. They seem to stick to a script to make it harder to give them a representation of daily life. Some even only giving you yes or no questions.",
