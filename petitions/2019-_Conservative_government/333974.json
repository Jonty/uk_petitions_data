        "additional_details": "During lockdown and following his own battle with Corona virus, Boris Johnson announced his \u2018war on obesity\u2019 and in the same sentence facilitated the Eat Out to Help Out campaign mixed with a reduction in VAT for the hospitality industry. If the government are serious about the health of the nation we ask them to show this in the form of direct financial support. This will help secure the future of over 7500 facilities but also have a direct positive effect on the NHS for years to come.",
        "background": "Gym and fitness facilities remained closed in England and all other nations of the UK longer than most industries yet received no additional financial support. We call on the government to provide support in the form of VAT reductions, additional grants and a Work Out to Help Out scheme",
