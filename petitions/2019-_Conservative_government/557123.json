        "additional_details": "This is a positive outcome to keep the gyms open for the British people. Gym places have already made these areas \u201csafe zones\u201d to be able to do their workouts from the previous lockdown, enforcing the people to look after themselves and others who are in the area at the time. It is essential that the government look over this again and class gyms as an essential place to keep open.",
        "background": "It is essential that the British people are able to go somewhere during this lockdown. The government should take into account the mental and physical account of being isolated during the lockdown and class the gyms as an essential use and be able to go without any issue or be reprimanded",
