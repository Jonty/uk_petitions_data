        "additional_details": "My brother recently passed away, having died suddenly and made no will. Unfortunately there is a family dispute over the date and timing of the funeral, which has meant his funeral has not been held until several weeks after his passing. We want the Government to require funerals to be held with a certain time of death, so that families do not have to wait indefinitely to see their loved one laid to rest.",
        "background": "Currently there is no legislation or time limits for funerals which can make it very difficult for a loved one to be laid to rest with the dignity and respect they deserve.",
