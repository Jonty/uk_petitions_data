        "additional_details": "Because the United Kingdom has been extremely sluggish in testing patients for the coronavirus, the official tally likely represents a fraction of the real caseload. But even if we take this number at face value, it suggests that we should prepare to have up to 10 times as many cases a week from today, and up to 100 times as many cases two weeks from today. Imposing social distancing will level off the number of new cases and increase the number of healed patients, compared to newly infected.",
