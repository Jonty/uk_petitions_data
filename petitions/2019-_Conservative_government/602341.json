However, despite us contacting a number of local football clubs (both grass roots and Premier League) none were able to communicate their anti-racist strategy to us. We believe this is unacceptable considering that during the 2019-20 season, there was a reported 42% increase in reports of discrimination. How are we to know what is being done to tackle this and to support our national players, if clubs do not tell us what they are doing to protect them.",
