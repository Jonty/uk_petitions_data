        "action": "Stop quarantine for those not vaccinated upon their return to the UK.",
        "additional_details": "This is due to the travel industry missing out on millions of pounds from millions of the UK population, and also employers suffering as their workers are made to needlessly quarantine for 10 days upon returning home from travel, even with negative test results. Since the quarantine guidance change in October2021 for the unvaccinated, it has been proven that variants have been brought to the UK regardless of vaccination status (Omicron). If testing works then end the contradiction of rules.",
        "background": "Relieve the strain on the travel industry and work, millions of the UK population cannot be vaccinated or have natural immunity so should not have to quarantine for 10 days after travel. It has been scientifically proven that transmission is no different if vaccinated or not and this deters travel.",
