        "additional_details": "Having wheelchair image in spaces , on signs and on the badges gives people the impression that only people with physical visible disabilities should be parking there although awareness is growing over hidden disability it's still issue with discrimination and being held back by the wheelchair image so just replacing with blue badge holders will help stop people looking for visible disabilities as not all disability is visible",
        "background": "I have a blue badge because of a hidden disability but there has been many times I have had people shouting at me from there cars and as they walk past because I'm in a disabled space and walking I would like the wheelchair image removed and replaced with blue badge holders only",
