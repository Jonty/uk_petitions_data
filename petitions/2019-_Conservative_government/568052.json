The upcoming 2022 GCSE exams are causing an abundant amount of stress and anxiety to year 10 students! We cannot possibly learn everything in the criteria/curriculum in this amount of time at home! Something impossible is being put upon us, as there is a high level of uncertainty with this new 3rd national lockdown!",

Give us permission to take notes into all GCSE's and give us a list of all topics that will be mentioned in the papers. Current year 10s have missed out 6 months of education last year and this year, we are missing more from a 3rd lockdown.",
