Many other countries do not rely on a single national healthcare provider and we believe the UK should take a similar approach.\r\n\r\nEmpowering the patient with a Health card will create real patient choice of provider and should help create competition, which could lead to greater efficiency and productivity, plus a more timely service for the patient, whilst remaining free at point of use.\r\n",
