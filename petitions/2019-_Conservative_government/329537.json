        "additional_details": "In allowing fans to gather outside Anfield (and all across the city), Liverpool FC completely failed to respect both the seriousness and the many victims of the COVID-19 pandemic. I believe they should be stripped of their title as a warning to all clubs to better monitor the behaviour of their fans, especially given the current global climate.",
        "background": "As feared by many since the football season was suspended due to COVID-19, Liverpool FC allowed thousands of fans to congregate outside Anfield after they won the Premier League title. Please consider stripping them of the title as a deterrent to fans of other clubs who may now do the same.",
