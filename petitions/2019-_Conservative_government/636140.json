If the public have to spend extra to purchase an electric vehicle, as opposed to a diesel or petrol variant, without the incentives that currently exist, people will be less likely to buy an electric vehicle. Why would anyone pay an extra \u00a310,000 on an electric vehicle instead of buying a cheaper petrol or diesel car?  ",
