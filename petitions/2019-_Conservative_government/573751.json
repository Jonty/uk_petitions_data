        "additional_details": "HMRC believe \u00a3100m of revenue is lost each year as a result of missing-trader fraud, where construction businesses charge VAT to their customers and then disappear before paying it over to HMRC.\r\nHonest traders are being penalised for doing the right thing at a time when money is tight. The VAT Reverse Charge is onerous. HMRC recognises that cash flow will be impacted and have delayed it once but the pandemic and lockdowns are lasting longer than we thought they would.  Postpone it again please.",
        "background": "Debate the release date and postpone it until after the pandemic.  My contractor customers can take anything from 30-90 days to pay me. Reverse Charge VAT will have a seriously negative impact on cash flow which small businesses can ill afford in the current economic climate and pandemic.",
