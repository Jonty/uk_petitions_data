        "additional_details": "Lives will be put at risk due to dangerous defects. Approx. 10% of \r\n my customers do not service their vehicles and rely on the MOT every year to make sure their vehicle is safe. The MOT is a very basic check of vehicle roadworthiness and certainly no guarantee that a vehicle will be safe for 3 months let alone 2 years!\r\n\r\nJobs will be put at risk in the sector, garages that have recently invested (approx. 30k) to carry out MOTs will be put into a difficult financial position.",
        "background": "Keep the tried and tested MOT system which is good value for money. Do not change the requirement to 2 years with the intention to save households money as it will not have the desired affect.\r\n\r\nMy background is main dealer/independent motor trade having carried out MOT tests for a number of years.",
