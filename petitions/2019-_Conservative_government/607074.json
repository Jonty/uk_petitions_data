        "additional_details": "The pandemic has highlighted the gaps in mental health & wellbeing awareness & shown people in all walks of life that mental health and well-being issues can affect anyone. The children that are studying GCSEs now are the health professionals of the future. If we are to truly prioritise this subject it needs teaching in the same capacity that Physical Health is taught. This would be an investment to protect our children\u2019s mental health and the NHS for future generations.",
