We're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. \r\n\r\nSince you started your petition, the national lockdown in England has ended. Under the new local restriction tiers, organised outdoor sport, physical activity and exercise classes can continue (with restrictions on higher-risk contact activity in tier 3). Organised indoor sport is permitted with some restrictions in tiers 1 and 2, though there are exceptions in all tiers for indoor sport for educational purposes and supervised indoor sport and physical activity for under-18s.\r\n\r\nSee: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-restriction-tiers-what-you-need-to-know\r\n\r\nYou could start a petition calling for changes to the local restriction tiers system, if there are specific changes you would like to see happen."
