        "additional_details": "With the well publicised underlying rises in wholesale energy markets it seems entirely unfair to further penalise the general public by sustaining a fixed high percentage tax rate on road fuels when a historically acceptable tax take could be achieved whilst still helping cap the retail pump prices, assisting general economic activity",
        "background": "With a tax on road fuels fixed at a high percentage of the retail pump price, road users are currently being forced to generate a huge windfall tax caused by the underlying rising cost of crude oil",
