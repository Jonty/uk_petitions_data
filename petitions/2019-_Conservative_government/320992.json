        "additional_details": "I have seen several friends struggle to make ends meet over the last decade as their pay fell in real terms and expectations at work rose. Many have left the caring professions as a result. There are many ways of recognising the amazing, heroic service we have received from our heroes in the NHS, but perhaps the most urgent and important is for our government to refuse to consider financially penalising them.",
        "background": "The cost of Covid-19 should not be borne by the public servants who have risked everything to care for people during it. For the lifetime of this government, please rule out any pay freezes for the people who have sacrificed so much. Look to industry, not individuals, to recover the costs.",
