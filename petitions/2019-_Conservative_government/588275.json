        "additional_details": "Current hate crime legislation does not include ageism, although there has been talk of considering 'Hostility towards the elderly' as a hate crime.\r\n \r\nI am 59 and was recently verbally attacked online by a complete stranger on a local news page, completely unprovoked, where someone called me names like 'fossil' and 'antique' and even criticised my hairstyle as being 'ridiculous for a woman' of my age.\r\n \r\nI believe this type of abuse should be treated the same as racism or homophobia.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to extend rules regarding hate crimes to all forms of ageism. This should cover people using derogatory terms towards anyone they consider 'old', whether in person or on social media.",
