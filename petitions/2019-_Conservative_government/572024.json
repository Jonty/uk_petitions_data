Details of which children can attend school during the current closures are available here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-maintaining-educational-provision/guidance-for-schools-colleges-and-local-authorities-on-maintaining-educational-provision\r\n\r\nWhile schools are closed the Government has made it clear that schools have a duty to provide remote education for state-funded, school-age children who are currently unable to attend school: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/952443/210114_School_national_restrictions_guidance_FINAL_14012021.pdf\r\n\r\nThe Government's guidance on teaching during school closures states that the Government recognises that some pupils with Special Education Needs and Disabilities (SEND) may not be able to access remote education without adult support and so expect schools to work with families to deliver an ambitious curriculum appropriate for their level\r\nof need. \r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling on the Government to give all SEND children a right to attend school while schools remain closed to most students, if that's what you want to happen.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following related petition, which you might like to sign: \r\n\r\nIncrease funding for Special Education Needs schools: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/556274"
