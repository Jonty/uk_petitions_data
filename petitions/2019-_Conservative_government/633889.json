It could also help divorced couples, where people are having to start life all over again, on their own, at a late age. The rising cost of living and house prices makes paying off a mortgage extremely challenging for many people.\r\n \r\nThe value of the mortgage that people could pay off using salary sacrifice could be capped, so that it only benefited those who are in need.\r\n",
