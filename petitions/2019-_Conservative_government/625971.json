        "additional_details": "While there is no powers we hold to force a general election i believe legislation should be put in place to do so. The legislation should be simple, 6 months after a new party leader is elected, for the ruling party, a national binding referendum takes place. This decides whether the public believe the party still represents us, if the vote return no, government should be dissolved pending a general election. This allows for a 6 month transition period but ultimately its the public who decide.",
        "background": "In light of the short term of Liz Truss and the ensuing race to become Tory Party leader, it has left the public with little confidence in our ruling party. There needs to be public support for the government. Call a general election now.",
