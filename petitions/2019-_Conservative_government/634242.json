        "additional_details": "Certain benefits, for example Carer\u2019s Allowance are limited to earnings of \u00a3132 from work. This with the payment of carers allowance in the cost of living crisis to save up for a family visa which stands at \u00a31,538 and a health surcharge of \u00a31,872 totalling in \u00a33,410 is almost impossible for some people on these benefits to save the money to pay for a family visa for a relative to join them in the UK. We just want to be with the people we love, especially after the pandemic.",
        "background": "The value of unpaid care was estimated at \u00a3530 million per day and \u00a3193 billion per year during the pandemic. With these savings the Government should reduce the immigration costs for people applying for family visas to join relatives receiving Disability Living Allowance (DLA) or Carer's Allowance.",
