The belief that under 25s are less likely to have children, have a home of their own is simply not true. Many young people have homes and children of their own and not paying them enough could put them in poverty in addition to deterring young people from working and make them more likely to commit crime just to make ends meet. In addition to raising the risk of ill mental health in them.",
