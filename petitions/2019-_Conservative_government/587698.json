        "additional_details": "Tattoo artists are in a position of power, often in a room alone with a vulnerable person. Tattoo processes are often intimate experiences, and people should be able to be confident that they are safe. Too many people have been abused within this industry, clients AND other tattoo artists. We must do better to protect them. Requiring DBS checks is one step closer to being a safer, inclusive industry.",
        "background": "Local authorities should be required to do DBS checks for tattoo artists before granting them a licence, to check for serious violent/sexual/race/hate crimes. The decision of whether to grant a licence would be on a case-by-case basis (minor or non-violent crimes should not exclude tattoo artists).",
