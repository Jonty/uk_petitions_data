        "additional_details": "Before lockdown was implemented travel had already decreased and the population were taking sensible measures to reduce the spread of the virus without legislation. \r\n\r\nMental health problems are rising as people are kept in confinement away from their family and friends, and so will unemployment. Life saving operations have been postponed indefinitely and people without coronavirus are not getting the care they need. Lockdown will lead to more deaths in the future and should end.",
        "background": "Lockdown is causing enormous financial and psychological damage to the country and should be ended immediately. \r\n\r\nLockdown goes against fundamental human rights by keeping people away from their families, cancelling elections and forbidding protests (Articles 5,3 and 11 of the ECHR)",
