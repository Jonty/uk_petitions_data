Government websites for such a purpose have been built at vast expense to taxpayers, they should be used.\r\nGovernment seems to choose journalists it considers more likely to report sycophantically rather than objectively.  This is not behaviour becoming of a modern democracy.  Such methods are generally reserved for tinpot dictatorships.",

This is not an appropriate response to a crisis. Measures should be coordinated and announced by appropriate minister via COBRA process.",
