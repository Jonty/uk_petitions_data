        "additional_details": "Liz Truss has resigned as PM and the Conservative Party has said those with Tory membership will get to vote on the next leader. Why should only a select few ignorant individuals get to pick from a select group of talentless individuals? You don\u2019t even have the support of your backbenchers. If this truly is a democracy, the choice should be put to the British public. Otherwise this may as well be a dictatorship.",
        "background": "I want the Conservatives to allow for an immediate general election. The people did not vote for the shambles that is this government. We are facing a cost of living crisis and the Conservatives have shown us since 2019 that they are not capable of leading our country through anything.",
