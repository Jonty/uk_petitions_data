        "additional_details": "These actions are of great significance in mitigating the loss of innocent Palestinian lives and averting the continuation of suffering, turmoil, and regional tensions. Diplomatic intervention is essential in alleviating the suffering of innocent Palestinians during this period of heightened Israeli attacks. The absence of action from the UK government risks unnecessary loss of life in Palestine and heightens concerns among UK citizens advocating for the safety of Palestine",
        "background": "We urge the UK govt to take diplomatic steps to protect Palestinian civilians amid escalating Israeli attacks;\r\n1. Call for an immediate ceasefire.\r\n2. Demand transparency on Israeli actions in Palestinian territories.\r\n3. Secure a commitment to minimize harm, especially in densely populated areas",
