        "action": "Ban whipping to toe the party line and allow MPs free votes on all matters.",
        "additional_details": "In banning this particular aspect of whipping, Parliament will remove an established practice which undermines public confidence in representative democracy and has been used by Government to motivate MPs to act against their better judgement.  It is not a practice recognised in Erskine May, under Duties of Whips.  A ban will reduce opportunity for Whips to offer inducements to MPs to vote as required by party and be consistent with the Members Code, where duty to party is not mentioned.",
        "background": "Parliament must act to reinforce fundamental principles of representative democracy which are explicit in Members' Duties.  Those are duties to always act in the best interests of nation, with special consideration of the interests of all constituents.  Ban a practice which favours party first.",
