        "additional_details": "The Government is paying \u00a37,000 per day to some management consultants. There is no justification for paying this amount for external consultancy, and public sector spending on external consultants should be limited. These rates are obscene and an absurd waste of public money which is ultimately paid by the taxpayer. We need to stop wasting money like this.",
        "background": "With news that the Government is paying \u00a37,000 per day for test and trace consultants (meaning one test and trace consultant costs more than several dozen Band 1 nurses, who risk their lives every day) the Government should cap the cost of consultants used by the public sector at \u00a3500 per day.",
