Boris Johnson assured President Zelenskyy of the UK\u2019s \u2018unwavering support\u2019 of Ukraine. We hold the UK government to this, demanding support is offered with a rapid response that ensures the safe housing of Ukrainian refugees within the UK. Government inaction at such a time would be unconscionable.",

With routes out of the country restricted, we demand the UK government work with the UN and Ukraine's neighbours to provide safe passage to the UK for those seeking sanctuary from conflict.",
