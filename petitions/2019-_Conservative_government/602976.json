        "additional_details": "I feel its appropriate to drop the criteria to 3 years service as a thank you of the exceptional circumstances our service men and women have endured throughout the pandemic. This will be a honourable token to those who have been called upon to deliver critical aid to the public. I feel it would be extremely disappointing for the service men and women who risk their own health and welbeing for others, to miss out on the opportunity of receiving a jubilee medal due to their service time.",
        "background": "The criteria currently is 5 years service as of February 2022. However due to the extreme serving conditions throughout the pandemic over the past 2 years. I believe it should be dropped to 3 years as our service men and women deserve to be recognised.",
