        "additional_details": "Not enough is being done to help the homeless in Covid times, not enough financial support or aid. Charities that do help are so stretched and don\u2019t have enough contacts, when councils are hanging on to empty properties. More support needs to be available. You can\u2019t get a job without an address, but you can\u2019t get an address without ID. Too much red tape and circles meaning the homeless are still on the streets and need easier support and access to help!",
        "background": "There are no valid reasons why 'homelessness' exists. There are half a million council properties sitting empty, unused at a time when homelessness is on the rise, and will increase during Covid times. We\u2019ve seen so many on the streets, that could be in housing, especially with colder weather coming",
