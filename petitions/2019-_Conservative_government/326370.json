        "additional_details": "These loud gas bird scarers are widely used by the farming community. These gas guns are on the most part, very loud, very frequent, and are often used without any regard to the local community in the area.\r\n\r\nThey cause untold distress to many dogs, horses, and other animals, causing severe noise anxiety, thereby preventing the dog and its owner to enjoy their surroundings.\r\n\r\nThey often start in the early hours, frequently before 5am, and often continuing into the evening.\r\n",
        "background": "Propane scare cannons are very loud bird scarers. They should be banned or at the very least restrictions placed on their use in areas surrounding villages and public rights of way.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
