        "additional_details": "This policy does not consider the name changing laws of other countries; for example regarding marriage, many countries do not change the maiden name on their passport including Greece and Quebec - this leaves the applicant in a difficult position if they have already legally changed their name. This policy discriminates against the rights of dual nationals to change their name freely because of the naming policies of another country which they cannot control.",
        "background": "The current rules for people with two passports to change their British passport name requires them to first change the name on their non-British passport. We request that the government does not require the other passport to be changed before the British passport.",
