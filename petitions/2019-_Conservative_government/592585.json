        "additional_details": "Such an important decision needs to be supported by scientific evidence. For example, what is the increased risk for COVID-19 contamination by people travelling from France compared to other amber list countries? What is the increased risk of Beta variant related deaths due to people traveling from France ? The government needs to share with the public the figures and statistical models supporting this key decision and how this outcome has been balanced against the impacts.",
        "background": "The decision to maintain quarantine for double jabbed people travelling from France after the 19th of July will have an impact on the UK economy, businesses, people mental health. Families won\u2019t be able to reunite, or won\u2019t be able to go on holiday. The public needs scientific evidence.",
