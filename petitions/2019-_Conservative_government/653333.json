        "additional_details": "Depending on the part of the country you live in, full-time childcare can cost an average of \u00a3394.58 a week (\u00a31,709.85 a month). This means the Tax-Free Childcare scheme won't always cover the full cost of childcare. By raising the annual entitlement, the Government can make sure this can more effectively make childcare costs tax free.",
