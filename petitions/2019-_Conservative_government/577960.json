They can, therefore, effectively grant themselves de facto immunity from legal challenges.\r\n\r\n2) That a 'two-tier' system of justice now exists whereby UK citizens who may qualify for citizenship of another country are subject to a potential additional punishment- removal of citizenship- that other UK citizens are not.\r\n\r\nWe ask that the government legislate to resolve these issues.",
