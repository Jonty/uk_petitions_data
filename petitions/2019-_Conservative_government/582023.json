Commercial fishing is a leading environmental issue and if commercial fishing continues at the rate it is today there will be empty oceans by 2048. 46% of plastic waste in the ocean is fishing nets and other fishing gear.\r\n By banning commercial fishing until at least 2025 we can see a significant reduction in plastic waste in the ocean and stop overfishing in an attempt to reduce the damage already done",
        "background": "Ban the use of commercial fishing boats for a minimum of 4 years to stop over fishing destroying the oceans and our planet any further",
