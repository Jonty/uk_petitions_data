        "additional_details": "It is reported that 97% of wildflower meadows have been lost in the United Kingdom in the past 100 years. Verges can provide an invaluable resource for a number of insect species including bees which are also declining due to habitat loss, intensive farming and climate change. Insects in turn feed birds which in turn feed birds of prey and other mammals.\r\n \r\nLess grass cutting means less burning of fossil fuels reducing the United Kingdom\u2019s carbon emissions and helping to slow climate change.",
        "background": "To instigate restrictions on cutting more than thirty percent of roadside verges. Only allow verges to be cut back to allow pedestrian access to pavements, and clear roadside edges where visibility is obscured.",
