The Government should increase funding for this.\r\n\r\nRoad surfaces in many areas are a disgrace and not becoming of a supposedly developed leading world economy.\r\n\r\nPotholes are an obvious danger to all road users but our roads need much more than the sticking plaster of pothole repair, much of which takes an age to be undertaken.\r\n\r\nNor is it simply about safety; there is a total lack of civic pride. Improving roads could help improve wellbeing by reducing stress. Invest more of the billions of pounds of revenue taken from road users into road infrastructure.\r\n",
