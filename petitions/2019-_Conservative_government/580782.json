Teachers for example earn an average of \u00a330,000. hard working families, young people and professionals are stuck in house shares or inadequate housing. The waiting list for social housing can be up to 10 years which is not good enough. There are many empty high rise apartment blocks for people who have \u00a3650,000 to rent a studio. This has to change.",

Many average income to low income households are missing out on a place to live. The government should regulate and motivate property developers to prioritise social needs over profit.",
