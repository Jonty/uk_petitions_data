        "action": "Remove quarantine on return from Spanish Islands & exempt from Spain FCO advice",
        "additional_details": "These Islands rely heavily on UK tourism and their economies will suffer badly. \r\nThey have done exceptionally well in managing the COVID-19 outbreak and do not deserve to be punished for Mainland Spain's rise in cases.\r\nPeople returning from the Islands will then miss out on 2 weeks paid work when they have to quarantine. Due to some airlines not cancelling flights many people have no choice but to go or lose out on money.",
        "background": "The Balearic and Canary Islands are probably few of the safest places to visit just now regarding COVID-19.\r\nThe rise in cases applies to Mainland Spain. This petition is to remove the quarantine on return from both Balearic and Canary Islands and exempt them from the current FCO advice on Spain.",
