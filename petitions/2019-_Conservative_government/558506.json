        "additional_details": "Closing dance schools is damaging to children\u2019s education and futures. My 2 daughters attend dance school 4-5 days per week. They are training to be professional dancers and teachers. Whilst school, colleges and universities stay open, all including arts training courses, dance schools are closed as they are classed as leisure facilities. My girls are training for vital exams that are needed to progress and gain what they need to pursue their careers. The closures are damaging their futures.",
        "background": "Currently dance schools are considered as leisure and recreational activity and as such are closed during lockdown. They should be considered as educational settings so that they stay open the same as schools, colleges and universities.",
