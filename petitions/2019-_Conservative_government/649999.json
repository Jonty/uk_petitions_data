Police officers on a motorbike may be able to respond more quickly and be better able to navigate traffic than officers in a police car. This could help the police to apprehend criminals more effectively, especially when they are using motorbikes to flee.\r\n \r\nThis could also save money, as motorbikes should be cheaper to buy and maintain, and there is only one officer on a motorbike, when often multiple officers are in a police car.\r\n",
