        "additional_details": "We're calling for the Government to fund the provision of a weekly Veg & Fruit box to all individuals and families on low income, removing the reliance on and the stigma of using a food bank. The shielding scheme is proof that food can be provided on a national scale with weekly food parcels being delivered up and down the country. We can and should be doing this as a first port of call in the fight against obesity.",
        "background": "Obesity is complex encompassing mental health, wealth and accessibility. A healthy nation requires regular and sustainable nutrition. By providing this the Government could reduce hunger, decrease poverty, increase health & wellbeing, reduce inequality and help alleviate the climate crisis.",
