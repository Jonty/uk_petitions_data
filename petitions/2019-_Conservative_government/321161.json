        "additional_details": "As a chair of school governors I do not believe there is value in rushing pupils back to school for such a short time and feel it would be best to continue for this short time with home education. I also do not want to put any of my valued teacher and support staff at risk.",
        "background": "Do not open schools until the new academic year. This will prevent a second peak in the virus. And will stop children having to go back to school on a staggered schedule for a month. They will not catch up with education in this short time frame. It will cause them unnecessary stress.",
