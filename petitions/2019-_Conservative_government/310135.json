There are over 200+ personnel working on a site currently that I\u2019m working on, and there is no safe guarding what so ever. These big companies are now trying to get us to change our method statements, to include the covid-19 measures, so the blame fulls on us and not them, who are not making sure their sites are safe. If we don\u2019t they are trying to fine us as small companies, risking our health and businesses",
