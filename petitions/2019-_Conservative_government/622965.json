Jobs could be created and funds raised as the perpetrators would be liable for any costs plus a potential fine and penalty points. Also it will take a further strain from the civil courts to deal with other matters. ",

As the matter is civil it can take an eternity to pursue and at great cost to the landowner. Police should be given the power to remove offending vehicles at cost to the owner.",
