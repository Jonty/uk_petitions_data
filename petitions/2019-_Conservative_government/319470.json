        "additional_details": "Sharks are an incredibly endangered species and many are being overfished to meet the demand for shark fins. When sharks are fished and finned, the process can be a brutal one and it seems an unnecessary waste of life for such a small dish in a restaurant (only 5% of the shark is used for the dish). The petition has been brought up previously but has been rejected for various reasons which have now changed.",
