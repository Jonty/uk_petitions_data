In the past few years, the government have decided to throw Northern England to the wall after Brexit, and we have faced stricter restrictions under Covid-19, where other areas have been allowed their freedoms despite similar levels of infection.\r\n\r\nIt's time for us to decide our own affairs, akin to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - no more ruling from afar!",
