And now Project Vigilant.\r\nThe Government should Cancel Project Vigilant, and protect people by actually listening to and implementing the recommendations of established anti-violence campaigners and organisations.",

Many such groups have asked for different measures to be taken, and have disapproved of the move to place undercover officers in and around bars and clubs throughout the country, which could put people at higher risk.",
