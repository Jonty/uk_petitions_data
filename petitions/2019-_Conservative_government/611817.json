        "additional_details": "Black teenagers are often victims of \"adultification\" (seen as adults) and as a result can be treated more harshly than their white counterparts, including being subjected to strip searches. This is racist and despicable. Strip searches of under 18s, without an adult chosen by the child present, should be outlawed. In a society where diversity, equality and the prevention of violence against women and girls is valued, action to protect children is critical.",
        "background": "Under 18s should only ever be subjected to a strip search if there is tangible evidence that deems it essential, and in such a case the child\u2019s choice of adult should be present.",
