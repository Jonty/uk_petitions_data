        "additional_details": "In 2011, the Alternative Vote was offered to the public in a referendum, but was rejected by 67.9% due to a advertising campaign which made a number of contested claims against AV. With such a low turnout of 42%, it is perfectly reasonable to assume that the British public may have changed their minds about AV in the 9 years since then.",
        "background": "Start using the Alternative Vote electoral system in - at the very least - UK general elections in order to better represent the British public and avoid the problems that our FPTP system possesses, like the Spoiler Effect, where the two largest parties benefit unfairly from third-party voters.",
