        "additional_details": "The rating can cover things like manufacturing, how far it\u2019s flown, what the toy is made of, how long it will last, packaging.\r\n \r\nThis would mean people could choose not to buy toys that are more damaging for the environment. People want to help the environment but often don\u2019t have the information to make the right choices.\r\n \r\n\u00a33.3 billion was spent on 330 million toys in 2020 in the UK. An environmental rating system should mean more of this money is spent on eco-friendly toys.",
        "background": "When I buy a toy I want to make an informed choice and buy the most eco-friendly toys. Sometimes toys have excessive plastic packaging and only last 5 minutes before they break and go into landfill as they can\u2019t be recycled. An environmental rating could help people make more eco-friendly purchases.",
