        "additional_details": "The Transport Secretary recently outlined the traffic light system for international travel from 17 May, which is silent on British expats living overseas. Many expats live in countries with higher vaccination and lower virus rates than the UK, such as the UAE. Regardless of vaccination status, we face prohibitively lengthy and expensive hotel quarantine if we return home. Many of us have not seen family since before the pandemic and are being prevented from doing so by quarantine restrictions.",
        "background": "There are an estimated 5-6 million British Nationals living abroad as expatriates. Many countries with large British expat populations appear on the red travel list from 17 May. We propose the Government allow all vaccinated British expats to return home quarantine-free to visit their families.",
