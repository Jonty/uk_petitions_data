It is a legal requirement in Australia and the USA for all electrec vehcles to make a noise. The EU are also making AVAS a legal requirement.\r\nSo I think that the UK should also follow suit.\r\n I am blind. I have been hit by someone driving an e scooter on the pavement. I would not have been injured if I had known that the electrec vehcle was aproaching. If the vehicle had an Acoustic Vehicle Warning System attached.",
