        "additional_details": "The pressures of the pandemic should not be used to introduce a major permanent change to GP services. Without the physical proximity to a doctor, some conditions may not be diagnosed through remote consultations alone. Older patients, in particular, may be uncomfortable with, or ill-equipped for, video or telephone consultations and be unable to describe their symptoms correctly. In a survey of Silver Voices members, over 70% reported difficulty this year in seeing a doctor.",
        "background": "There are reports of some GP practices refusing requests for face-to-face appointments from patients, despite guidance stating patient preference should be respected unless they are considered a covid-19 infection risk. Government should legislate if necessary to put this fundamental right in law.",
