        "additional_details": "It constitutes a breach of basic human rights - education is to be accessed by everyone irrespective of age, gender, sexual orientation, race, colour, ethnicity, disability, or religion.\r\nDowngrading by location and/or socioeconomic background results in every affected student being discriminated against by each of these protected characteristics.\r\n\r\nIt is unfair, unjust & unlawful. Through no fault of their own, students are being let down time & time again by this conservative government.",
        "background": "Halt the process of downgrading, the teachers that have assessed their own pupils predicted grades are in a far better place to judge, than the education secretary.\r\nNot only will downgrading be detrimental to students' mental health, but you will also be undermining the teachers.",
