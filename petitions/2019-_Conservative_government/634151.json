But can claim back twice that amount in expenses. Tax payers money should be better spent on public services and not service the political class",
        "background": "As mango public sector jobs can't claim on as many expenses as Mps, this should now stop. Tax payers should no longer fund MPs food, heating, travel or rent on second homes. Mps should now earn a living instead of stealing one",
