        "additional_details": "It's not fair for people to be left out of the support the country is receiving because of arbitrary decisions. These people will have had an income in 2019 - e.g. a PAYE job - which income can be deduced from, and support given as appropriate. I started my company in February and two big projects were cancelled due to Coronavirus. Interviews for jobs were then indefinitely postponed or cancelled. If there's a way to understand income then it should be used - especially if taxes are to rise.",
        "background": "There are many recently self-employed individuals or limited company directors who have seen their income drop to nothing (or very little) and have been lumped in to a 5% of people who are entitled to no support during the Coronavirus pandemic. Many will have had jobs and an income throughout 2019.",
