        "additional_details": "It is a massive inconvenience and disruption to the whole community. It is a real struggle to get to simple local amenities and locations. There is word being spread about the government considering a Phase 2 of the LTN enforcement which we cannot let happen as it will make it virtually impossible to get to destinations in Kings Heath forcing people to stay at home. This also increases the chances of more trouble for ambulances to get past and other potential risk factors.",
        "background": "We want the government to reconsider their actions about their usage and enforcement of LTN plans  and to remove the blockages and bollards which have been placed all over Kings Heath, Birmingham",
