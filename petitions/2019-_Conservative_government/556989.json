The test and trace system has cost many billions of pounds of taxpayers money even though it's apparently unfit for purpose.

Parliament already holds the Government to account for the value-for-money of its projects, programmes and service delivery through the work of the Public Account Committee: https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/127/public-accounts-committee. Government spending is also scrutinised by the independent National Audit Office: https://www.nao.org.uk/.\r\n\r\nFurther, requests for information about spending on specific projects can be made through the Freedom of Information scheme: https://www.gov.uk/make-a-freedom-of-information-request.\r\n\r\nYou may instead wish to sign this petition which calls for a related action: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/328408\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about coronavirus and how you can protect yourself and others here:\r\n\r\nwww.gov.uk/coronavirus\r\nhttps://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/\r\n\r\nThe Government has also created an online service to help you find out what you can do if you\u2019re struggling because of coronavirus: https://www.gov.uk/find-coronavirus-support\r\n\r\nYou can read NHS tips to help if you are worried about coronavirus here: https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/coronavirus-covid-19-anxiety-tips\r\n\r\nYou can read impartial analysis of the Government response to coronavirus and policy developments here: https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/coronavirus/\r\n\r\nYou may also be interested to know that because of the large number of petitions that have been started in relation to coronavirus, the Petitions Committee has been questioning the Government about its response to the coronavirus outbreak.\r\n\r\nFind out more: https://committees.parliament.uk/work/192/the-governments-response-to-coronavirus/"
