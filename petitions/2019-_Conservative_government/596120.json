This can make women feel like a failure but this isn\u2019t the case things can be done by doctors you just need to make sure it\u2019s what you\u2019re suffering from, another thing with PCOS is excess facial hair this tears down women\u2019s mental health because they\u2019re made to feel less womanly and because people don\u2019t understand it is a condition it can mainly incur bullying.",
