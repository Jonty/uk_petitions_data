        "additional_details": "With a potential 3 months of no cash flow into these small businesses die to the lockdown there is a high chance some will face bankruptcies.  Even though a director pays via partly PAYE and Dividend he still pays his fair share in taxes to the state based on a personal tax return. The Ltd also pays it\u2019s fair share in corporation taxes so to not support directors will have a knock on effect for small business employees also.   There has to be rules based on small, medium and large enterprises.",
        "background": "Many small companies directors in the UK are being left with no support.  This impacts heavily ltds who are currently operating based on a single employee/director. The govt should look at Director salaries and provide the same support where the declaration of PAYE and Dividends is less that \u00a350k.",
