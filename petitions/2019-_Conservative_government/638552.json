Nothing is being done currently, so action must be taken. If the government happens to be unaware of problems within the majority of secondary schools across the UK, then we will plead for further action to be taken by the government. \r\n\r\nThank you for your time,\r\n\r\nWe would appreciate action to be taken. This means a lot for us and for the education of many students.",

This isn't silly nonsense, these people are downright rude. We can't explain how disgusting these people are and action should be taken. We will think on possible solutions.",
