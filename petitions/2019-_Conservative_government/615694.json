        "additional_details": "In a ruling on Wednesday, Lord Justice Bean and Mr Justice Garnham\r\nconcluded that policies contained in documents released in March\r\nand early April 2020 were unlawful because they failed to take into\r\naccount the risk to elderly and vulnerable residents from non-\r\nsymptomatic transmission of the virus.",
        "background": "The SAGE scientific advisory group said \"asymptomatic transmission\r\ncannot be ruled out\" in early February.\r\nBut government documents show there was no requirement for\r\nhospital patients to be tested for COVID, before being transferred\r\nto care homes, until mid-April.",
