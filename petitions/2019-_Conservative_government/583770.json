This comes specifically off the back of the threat of the \u2018European Super League\u2019 where offshore owners decided their pockets are more important than the desires of their fans, players and the all round footballing community. We know for a fact PM Boris Johnson backs us.",

From the heights of the EPL down to the NL North and South.",
