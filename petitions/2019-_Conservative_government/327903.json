        "action": "Stop the rebranding of the RAF Voyager (PM/Royal Family plane)",
        "additional_details": "The Government should not carry out this rebrand. The money could be better spent elsewhere, including but not limited to: supporting vulnerable people through the COVID-19 pandemic and afterwards, the NHS (including social and mental illness care), education and the environment. In a time where the economy is fragile, this kind of spending is insensitive for those looking at redundancy and low income families, as well as genuinely shortsighted and ridiculous.",
        "background": "Plans have been unveiled to re-brand the RAF Voyager, the plane that is used by the Prime Minster, other ministers and senior members of the Royal Family for official engagements. This is estimated to be \u00a3900,000 and funded by taxpayers - but is completely unnecessary.",
