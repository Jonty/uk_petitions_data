        "additional_details": "I work in the construction industry and since mortgage rates have gone up, I feel the industry has suffered. Some people are losing jobs and businesses because many people have stopped building or selling houses. Many cannot afford to buy a house with the current mortgage rates. Some people who work full time are struggling as much as those who get benefits, and I think the Government should provide more support to full-time workers.",

Some people's mortgage payments have doubled since 2023, and we feel our standard of living has gone from comfortable to impossible.",
