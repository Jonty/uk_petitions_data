        "additional_details": "During the first wave of Covid-19, many departments in hospitals were closed, re-deploying the staff from these departments to alleviate the stress and staff shortages on the wards. During the second wave of Covid-19, many non-emergency departments are now open, so there are no spare staff. This means many wards are short of staff, which is exacerbated by staff having to self-isolate because of the virus. The frontline NHS workers must be immunised for hospitals to maintain safe levels through the winter.",
        "background": "Residents in a care home for older adults and their carers have higher priority for Covid-19 vaccination than frontline health workers. This should be swapped. For the NHS to survive the winter, NHS frontline staff must be vaccinated first. If not, there may be no-one left to staff the hospitals.",
