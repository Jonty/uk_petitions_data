        "additional_details": "Vaccinations are generally pretty effective and safe. However, we should ensure that we are aware of any risks associated with vaccine. Between the documented side-effects of existing vaccines, and the MHRA seeking an AI tool to handle the \"high volume of expected\" adverse reactions, there is a need to assess the safety of adjuvants in vaccines.",
        "background": "Approve funding specifically for vaccine safety. A good area specifically would be the research on adjuvants travelling in the body, their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (potentially resulting in adverse consequences) and long-term effects of exposure of numerous vaccines and boosters.",
