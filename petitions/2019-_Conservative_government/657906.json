        "additional_details": "People might purchase the lower model of a car because of the surcharge. The luxury model might take them over the \u00a340,000 threshold, even though it has exactly the same engine size. Increase it to \u00a350,000 so it is paid by those buying more expensive cars. This could help people to purchase newer vehicles with more safety features like reversing cameras and better longer lasting seats like leather or leather alternatives. This might encourage them to keep the vehicle longer.",
        "background": "I think the government needs to raise the threshold for paying more vehicle excise duty (VED) from a \u00a340,000 to \u00a350,000 car cost price. This could allow lower paid people to buy luxury vehicles and not penalise them with what we believe is an extortionate tax that has nothing to do with emissions.",
