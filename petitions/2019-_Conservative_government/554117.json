        "additional_details": "In 2020 where LGBT partnerships and marriages are accepted under the law as per the Marriage Act 2013, the law should also provide for LGBT extra-marital affairs. Currently, married couples are unable to sue for divorce on the grounds of adultery if their partner has engaged in sexual conduct with a member of the same sex. This does not provide LGBT equality in the eyes of the law.",
        "background": "I want Section 1(6) of MCA 1973 to be updated to reflect LGBT marriages and lifestyles, so that conduct between the respondent and a person of the same sex may constitute adultery. Currently in divorce law, only conduct between the respondent and a person of the opposite sex qualifies.",
