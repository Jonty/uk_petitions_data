        "action": "Expand care home coronavirus testing to allow residents to see their loved ones.",
        "additional_details": "Many residents in care homes have not had any meaningful contact with a loved one since lockdown began in March, having a huge impact on their emotional health. Brief, socially distanced visits keep risks low but make communication & support difficult and so cause distress. Care homes access weekly tests for staff to reduce risk to residents. By extending testing to a nominated relative, residents could also be allowed close contact with loved ones to support them through extended lockdown.",
        "background": "We are asking that routine weekly coronavirus testing of care home staff be expanded to cover at least one nominated relative/friend per resident, so that vulnerable care home residents can access vital family support and maintain important relationships, during the extended care home lockdown.",
