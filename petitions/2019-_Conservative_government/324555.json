        "additional_details": "We feel current modules in subjects such as PSHE, RE and History do not reach the depth we need. The government can change this. Education on the British empire and how it has affected immigration, race and economics is key to understanding our modern society. From a young age children are not formally introduced to the subject of racial inequality, which is something we believed should be addressed in primary school PSHE and later in secondary education. Our past affects our future.",
        "background": "How well do you know British history? Do you feel that you understand the racial inequalities within modern society? We want revisions of the curriculums in all key stages to tackle the issues of racial inequality that colonialism has shaped, and equip young people with skills to improve society.",
