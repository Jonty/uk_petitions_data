        "additional_details": "At present, someone can write a \"mirror will\" with someone else and if one party dies, the other person can make a new will cutting out the deceased person's family, or making any other changes they want. This goes against the deceased person's wishes and they are unable to defend it. It means that their wishes can be totally ignored and the inheritance rights of their family can be totally removed.",
