        "additional_details": "Vulnerable adults can struggle interpreting information or decisions that are made during law cases. We believe many families experience discrimination and bias in private law cases. It\u2019s extremely difficult for vulnerable adults to self-represent as litigants and to learn the appropriate regulations/principles, including the legal way of writing, to successfully argue their case. Losing a legal case can have a negative impact on the mental health of vulnerable adults and their families.",
        "background": "Make legal aid available for disabled and vulnerable adults with learning difficulties and for those aged under 18 years in private law cases. Having legal representation gives them a voice to correctly apply the law in support of their case fighting for family justice and their children.",
