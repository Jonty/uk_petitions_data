        "additional_details": "The importance of a strong digital infrastructure has never been more evident during the Covid-19 lockdown, and businesses are reconsidering their operating models to allow for greater home working. Whilst there will always be a place for city centre offices and the need to invest in local transport connections, the need to reduce the time from Birmingham to London by 30 minutes is less evident. The roll out of fibre will be quicker and impact the UK economy rapidly and in many positive ways.",
