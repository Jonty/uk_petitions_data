        "additional_details": "It clearly isn't logical to penalise weddings at 15 people and allow such large amounts of people at live events and football games. If social distancing guidelines are met why can't weddings have 50% venue capacity l, like live indoor events. It makes no sense and it is unfair.",
        "background": "If 4000 people can gather outside at a football game and 1000 people/50% capacity (whichever is seller) can go too an indoor live event then the number of guests at weddings (including receptions) should increased from 15 people to 50% capacity.",
