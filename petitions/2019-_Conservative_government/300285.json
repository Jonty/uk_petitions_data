        "additional_details": "Online casinos make it too easy for people to gamble to excess and even with limits put in place they can easily be circumvented.  By advertising on television and offering free money, guaranteed wins etc they are drawing people in who may then become addicted.  Online gambling addiction destroys families and lives and these companies should not be allowed to promote their product on mainstream media.",
        "background": "I would like the government to pass legislation to make the promotion of online casinos illegal in the media.  I know people whose lives have been destroyed by online gambling addiction and I feel that it is imperative that advertising is banned in order to minimise this problem.",
