        "additional_details": "The 'Rule of 6' makes it a crime for a family of five to meet their grandparents, and even makes \u2018mingling\u2019 into a crime. It is currently devastating whole sections of the economy. Other statutory instruments have effectively banned protest and free association. Yet the government responds to criticism by threatening more restrictions.\r\n\r\nCovid restrictions have no democratic legitimacy, and have not even been rationally explained. This government by decree must end.",
        "background": "Weekly, there are new Covid laws that affect the lives of millions of people, imposed without approval of parliament. We call for parliament  to be resuscitated as the place where laws are made and approved - for proper scrutiny and consideration of the effects of these measures on social life.",
