        "additional_details": "Parliament should make the manufacturing, sale and use of these lanterns illegal in the UK. They cost the economy millions in damages from destroyed buildings, farmland and woodland. They also cause immense cost to NHS trusts, Fire departments and police departments across the country. They are also a danger to human and animal life. There is no way to control where the lanterns land. The economic benefit these lanterns create is less then what they cost the economy and communities",
        "background": "A total ban on the use, sale or manufacturing of sky lanterns. These are paper lanterns with a wire internal frame that use the heat from a candle to fly in to the atmosphere.",
