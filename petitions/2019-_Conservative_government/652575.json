Many people work from home and they can cause disruption to video meetings, cause stress, lower productivity etc. We believe that restricting their use certain times or days isn't not sufficient. They can cause stress and distress to older retired people, reducing their quality of life. \r\n \r\nThey are also very polluting, with studies showing a single petrol powered lawn mover can cause as much pollution as a new car driven for 11 hours. We believe that there's simply no excuse for their use in urban areas where electric alternatives can be used.",
