        "additional_details": "Myself and my mother got the second dose in early January due to our extremely vulnerable circumstances. Our immunity has significantly dropped, but the booster dose has been proved to increase protection levels. Approximately 500,000 vulnerable people got the second dose in January. Evidence from Pfizer, Israel and USA urges booster doses. Many countries have already started to offer third doses.",
        "background": "Third doses must be now available for priority groups in the UK. Everyone who received the second dose at least 6 months ago should be eligible for the booster. Some experts in the UK are suggesting natural infection rather than more vaccines, but this is unfair and dangerous.",
