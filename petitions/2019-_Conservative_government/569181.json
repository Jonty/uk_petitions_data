        "action": "Extend ADI Theory test certificates expiring 2021 for a year",
        "additional_details": "For almost a year testing has been postponed nationwide while thousands of PDI\u2019s have paid out large sums in training costs & fees to not have any extension granted for time missed where there has been no training or testing conducted down to tough restrictions & nationwide lockdowns making it impossible to resume furthering into this desired career. The Government have power to instruct  DVSA to give a year extension on the ADI theory certificates in England, Scotland, Wales & Northern Ireland.",
        "background": "I want to make this petition because it\u2019s became evident that the UK government & DVSA have not given thought to the thousands of driving instructors (PDI\u2019s) whom have a period of 2 years to complete 3 parts of training from the date they passed the ADI theory test.",
