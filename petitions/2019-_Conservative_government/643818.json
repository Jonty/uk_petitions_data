        "additional_details": "This is an ongoing issue for the whole country. This will continue year in year out if this issue is not addressed. The government have stated that schools should relax uniform policy during temperatures that fall under amber & red weather alerts. There is evidence to suggest schools are not taking this into consideration and are penalising male students for wearing shorts. This is discrimination and a change needs to happen. The uniform policy needs to change to address this country wide issue",
        "background": "Incorporate the guidelines set out by the government into school uniform policies. This will allow boys to wear shorts without discrimination and punishment in hot temperatures in the summer months",
