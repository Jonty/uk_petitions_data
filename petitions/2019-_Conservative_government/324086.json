By refusing to publish this report, the government risk the lives of people in order to avoid addressing issues affecting our communities . The government failing to act is indicative that they do not take the idea of black lives mattering seriously and by failing to release the information they are further contributing to this problem.",
        "background": "The Government's review into how the BAME community has been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 has been delayed for the second time. This is supposedly due to \"current global events\" and ongoing 'Black Lives Matter' protests. They should remove this delay and publish the report immediately.",
