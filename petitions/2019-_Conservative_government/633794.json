Modern medical advances have revolutionised treatment and outlooks, even so the daily fight to manage the condition is gruelling and relentless. CF patients can find it very difficult to maintain jobs due to the often incapacitating nature of the disease, causing many to live with extremely strained finances.\r\n \r\nCF patients in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland already receive free prescriptions. English sufferers deserve nothing less than parity.",

The exemption list was created in 1968, and CF was not included due to patients rarely living into adulthood, so cruel was the condition.",
