        "additional_details": "I believe that the method of creating the A level grades given to students this year was unfair. The uncertainty of this year alone, has had a significant impact upon students. For them to discover, the way the grades were created is not an accurate representation to many students skills . The university that many students wanted to attend were made as not an option due to the grades received, so many students are stuck with their second choices or no university at all. Downgrading grades is an underestimation of a students educational ability and is not fair as a basis to be judged upon.",
        "background": "I would like for parliament to take teacher\u2019s predicted grades for students or at least upgrade each students grade by grades 1/2.",
