        "additional_details": "The mental and physical trauma of menstrual pains can be immense especially those that suffer severely from endometritis, nausea & back pain. It can also effect productivity levels at work and it is said that women lose up to 9 days of productivity in the year. This is a matter of basic human rights, menstruation is not an \"illness\" & women should not just call in sick every month to be excused from work. One day is being proposed because the first day of the cycle is often the most painful day.",
        "background": "To pass legislation to allow women in the UK to take paid leave a month or to work from home if possible when experiencing severe menstrual pains. \r\nWomen are forced to take casual or medical leave or come into work and suffer excruciating pain, dizziness, back pain and nausea-this is injustice.",
