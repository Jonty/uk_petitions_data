        "additional_details": "To base the vote on reality, all funding from the UK government to Scotland should cease, all laws, financial support and all other influence should be stopped.\r\n\r\nBy year 3, the Scottish government will be being judged based on its own policies and financial numbers. Year 4 and 5 will be used to prove they can make it work and the vote at the end of year five will be based on success or failure.\r\n\r\nScotland can still use the pound but for all other purposes it should be acting as if independent.",
        "background": "By removing all UK legal and financial influence on Scotland for 5 years and allowing an Independence vote at the end of the 5th year (which cannot be repeated for a significant period), Scotland will be able to vote based on the actual performance of the Scottish parliament.",
