        "additional_details": "A dedicated Minister would liaise with industry representatives. We believe such a Minister would have been beneficial to Government & Industry during the pandemic.\r\n\r\nAs the UK seeks to encourage investment & tourism back to the UK in coming years, the vision that UK hospitality industry portrays of the UK is excellence, innovation, inspiration. \r\n\r\nWe need a Minister who can listen to concerns on taxation & legislation and bring forward suggestions to the chancellor and policy makers on our behalf.",
        "background": "The UK hospitality industry. Responsible for around 3m jobs, generating \u00a3130bn in activity, resulting in \u00a338bn in taxation. Yet, unlike the Arts or Sports, we do not have a dedicated Minister.\r\n\r\nWe are asking that a Minister for Hospitality be created for the current, and successive governments.",
