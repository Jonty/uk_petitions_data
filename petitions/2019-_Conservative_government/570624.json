        "additional_details": "As we know and has been illustrated through popularity of other petitions, us university students believe it is unreasonable to pay \u00a39250 for this year. However, we also acknowledge it is highly unlikely universities could afford to operate charging only \u00a33000 as other petitions propose, as they still have to pay for maintenance, resources, contractors and salaries. This petition offers a more reasonable solution, assuming it is carried out with transparency. There is little negative to universities, but brings fairness for us students who believe teaching has been inadequate.",
        "background": "Universities should operate on a no-profit basis this year, to which the Government should bring into law. \r\n\r\nAny profit made should refunded to students, in the form of a reduction in tuition fees, divided equally amongst students as a rebate.\r\n\r\nStaff bonuses should not be used to reduce profits.",
