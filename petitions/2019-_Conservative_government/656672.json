Unfortunately farmers are not currently required to provide information regarding the presence of livestock in an area open to the public. Walking a dog can therefore become a lottery, because one day there is no livestock, but the next day there is, and without live notices owners have no way of knowing. I believe my idea will reduce dog attacks.",

To assist in this farmers should also be legally required to post notices on all entrances to areas to which the public have access, informing them of the fact that livestock is present, which must be removed when the livestock has gone.",
