Unfortunately farmers are not currently required to provide information regarding the presence of livestock in an area open to the public. Walking a dog can therefore become a lottery, because one day there is no livestock, but the next day there is, and without live notices owners have no way of knowing. I believe my idea will reduce dog attacks.",
