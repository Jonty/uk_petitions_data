        "additional_details": "Students in the UK have already missed hundreds of hours of learning since 23rd March. This has had a huge effect. Some pupils don\u2019t have the essential resources: a working computer, textbooks, stationary, etc. Many don\u2019t have a proper learning environment, therefore results will most certainly not reflect the true efforts of pupils. Hence why I am writing to the Government to cancel GCSEs and A Levels and provide predicted grades to show the true reflections of students across the country.",
        "background": "The Government should cancel GCSEs and A Levels in 2021 due to the disruption of Covid-19. By the time students go back to normal learning, 6 months will have passed since schools were closed to most pupils. This has already had a huge impact on the studying of so many.",
