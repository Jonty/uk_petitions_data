If correct then this would be a 300% increase vs the price cap of \u00a31,042 in January 2019.\r\n \r\nAlthough the Government is providing \u00a3400 off of household energy bills from October, and has provided more in direct payments to \u2018low income households\u2019, this does not go far enough.\r\n \r\nMore support is urgently needed, especially for working families and taxpayers who have received the lesser amounts of current support level.",
