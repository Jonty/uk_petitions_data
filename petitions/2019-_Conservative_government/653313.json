        "additional_details": "We believe any charges that are passed on to consumers would be yet another unfair cost, particularly for the poorest homes in the UK. Many boiler manufacturers themselves have said the Governments targets are unachievable. The cost of boilers has already risen due to inflation and are likely to rise again in 2024. We believe this charge will NOT be an incentive to buy a heat pump, and that it will only increase the cost of people providing heat for their homes.",
