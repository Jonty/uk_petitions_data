Often MP's go against the pricibles on which they were elected.  Only by allowing the people to hold MP's to account can we be sure that our MP's work for US.\r\n\r\nThe power to appoint MP's is in the hands of the electorate.  The power to recall MP's, for whatever reason the community sees fit; should be soley in the hands of the electorate.",
