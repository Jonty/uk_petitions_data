It\u2019s a well known fact that holiday prices are hiked up during the school holiday season, forcing many families from low income households to pay almost double for a package holiday abroad.\r\n\r\nWith the prospect of foreign travel once again on the horizon we would like to ask that for this year and this year only, we give these families a break by being able to take their children out of a school term for 1 week, without fear of financial penalty and criminalisation; therefore easing the financial burden on our most vulnerable citizens.",
