        "additional_details": "These changes were started by a time-based grant from central government in response to covid-19  They have negatively and seriously impacted the lives of many residents and workers all over London.  Local councils hurried to implement them without, it would appear, any co-ordination with Tfl, which is causing cross borough issues.  People have been pushed out of the roads and the alternative (walk/cycle) is not suitable for all.  It's discriminatory.  Some people have no alternative.",
        "background": "Recent London LTNs have been put in place with a live consultation period of 6 months.  Many areas have experienced them for a few weeks and want them gone NOW, not in 6 months.  People are reporting high levels of stress and frustration. There is no reason to prolong it.  Reverse them now!",
