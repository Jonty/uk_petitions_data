This would help students to feel less stressed and worried about money so they can better focus on their studies. I have spoken to a lot of students and they agree it is wrong to be effectively paying student loans twice.",

As a student nurse I am trying to better myself and follow my dreams, and it is not fair that student loans are treated as income for Universal Credit, when these most also be repaid.",
