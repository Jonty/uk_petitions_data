        "action": "Ban per-minute pricing for e-scooters to avoid encouraging excessive speed",
        "additional_details": "Unlike in other countries, electric scooters cannot be lawfully used on public roads in the UK. Consequently they are currently limited to trials within hire schemes. Speed limiters at 15\u00bdmph (25km/h) or 12\u00bdmph (20km/h) do not prevent financially-incentivised dangerous use. Pricing structures that encourage excessive speed should be outlawed. The time to do this is now, before e-scooters become lawful and widespread in the UK.",
        "background": "Per-minute pricing for hired e-scooters financially incentivises riders to complete their journeys as fast as possible and thereby encourages excessive speed. There are many other ways to charge, such as per-mile charges or daily charges for unlimited journeys of 30 minutes each as with hire bikes.",
