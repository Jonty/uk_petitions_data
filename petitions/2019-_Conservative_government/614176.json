        "additional_details": "Channel 4 is one of the only UK broadcasters to genuinely represent a wide cross-section of society (e.g. Skins, It\u2019s A Sin, Paralympics, Bandung File, Queer As Folk, the Black to Front project etc.) as well as feature films through Film 4, and one of the most engaged news programmes available.\r\n\r\nSelling it brings no public benefit as the channel is not a drain on public resources, but the loss to diversity and innovation in programming would be irreplaceable.",
        "background": "The Government is proposing to privatise Channel 4.\r\nThis should be opposed: Channel 4 costs the tax-payer nothing as it is funded by advertising and sales, whilst offering an extensive range of innovative programmes that would be unlikely to find a home on a private channel.",
