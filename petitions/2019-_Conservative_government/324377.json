This puts an incredible strain on the uks firefighting resources which could lead to an increased response time to domestic or commercial building fires. \r\nThis past week has seen crews tackling wildfires in Darwen, Longridge and Rochdale. Fire Crews have worked tirelessly to ensure that moorland fires do not reach the scale of the Winter Hill fire of 2018.",
