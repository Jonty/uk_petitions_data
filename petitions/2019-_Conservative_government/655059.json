The UK Spouse visa should not exceed \u00a325,000 threshold for people  working on national minimum wage.",

Ironically even some home office job don't meet \u00a338,700.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Migration Observatory at Oxford University 2017 approximately 40% of workers do not earn enough to sponsor a spouse's visa under existing rules.",
