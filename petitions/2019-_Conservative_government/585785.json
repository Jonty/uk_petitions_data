        "action": "Provide guidance for NHS England to allow support to patients in hospital",
        "additional_details": "I believe the government need to provide guidance to NHS England which can then be relayed to the trusts throughout the country. The government has done a good job of getting us through this pandemic and supporting businesses, and whilst the NHS have been protected they are still yet to 'catch up' with the easing along with the rest of the country. I have spoken to the trusts and they are reluctant to make any decisions so I would like the government to provide guidance and advice in this.",
        "background": "As the country is easing out of lockdown and the efforts of the population have allowed this, patients in hospitals should be allowed visitors and support. Adult patients should be allowed atleast 1 person and a child should be allowed 2. (Support for the adult in the emotional struggles faced).",
