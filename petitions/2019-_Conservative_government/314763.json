        "additional_details": "UK Govt's decision to charge for repatriation flight is not fair when a \u00a375m budget has been allocated for this and the Government is providing financial support to several flight companies. People stuck in various parts might be already in financial distresses as they might have already lost their return flight fare. On top of this being charged a hefty (up to 3 times regular) one way fare to get a seat in your repatriation flight is completely unreasonable.",
        "background": "UK Govt is charging sometimes unaffordable costs for chartered flights to bring back the residents stuck in various parts of world. UK Govt should remove any charges and bring everyone free of cost.",
