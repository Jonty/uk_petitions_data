        "additional_details": "Inclusion of front line 40+ workers on the group 6 priority list will:\r\n\r\n* Reduce the risks of mortality and 'long covid' for front line workers aged 40+ and their families by including them in group six of the vaccination rollout. \r\n\r\n* Ensure continuity of key public services such as policing, education, retail, transport and social and home care.\r\n\r\n* Inclusion of front line workers aged 40+ should not significantly delay the vaccination rollout as it is a small demographic group.",
        "background": "All front line workers aged 40+ including police, teachers, support staff, retail and transport staff should be prioritised for the COVID-19 vaccination. They should have an 'age premium' due to the increased risk of infection they face working with the public in face to face settings.",
