        "additional_details": "We want the government to redistribute police funding to youth, education, social and health services that have been proven to reduce crime by meeting people\u2019s basic needs. We want communities to be given the power to respond to the 80% of non-criminal incidents that the police respond to; as we believe that a community response rooted in resolution and meeting individual needs would have better outcomes. Finally, we want autonomous community-based police scrutiny panels established.",
        "background": "Government guidelines state that consent to policing cannot be withdrawn individually. Therefore, we want to collectively withdraw consent to the current model of policing and request that the 80% (the amount of non-crimes the police respond to) of police funding be redistributed into communities.",
