        "action": "Give Ofsted greater powers to inspect and regulate all schools in the UK",
        "additional_details": "The UK currently has separate executive agencies such as Education Scotland, which means that Ofsted does not have jurisdiction across schools outside of England. It also lacks responsibility for inspecting the majority of private and independent schools, which are overseen by separate organisations. By abolishing these agencies and streamlining their responsibilities into Ofsted, we can create a more efficient education inspection body that applies the same standards across every UK school.",
        "background": "Ofsted currently inspect education and training services to both young and adult learners, yet their powers do not extend to all schools across the UK. We\u2019re calling on the government to streamline Ofsted to inspect and regulate all schools in the UK, whether they are private or state-run.",
