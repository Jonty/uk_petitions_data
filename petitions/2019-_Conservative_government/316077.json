They are a hazard to wildlife and marine life.  Often they are marketed as \u2018biodegradable\u2019 which they are not. They take years to rot away causing destruction in the process. They are littering our farmland and countryside with devastating consequences. Images show animals, birds and marine life caught up in these lanterns.",
