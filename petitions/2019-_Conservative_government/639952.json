        "additional_details": "People's privacy is being invaded by the flying over and around their homes of small, cheap and widely available drones fitted with video cameras. The current regulations prohibit larger drones from doing this but allow sub-250g drones to do so. The size and weight of a drone has little bearing on its ability to carry high-definition video equipment and the regulations should also prohibit sub-250g drones from being able to film people in and on their own private property without consent.",
        "background": "Change the regulations pertaining to drone and model aircraft operation in order to prevent drones under 250g in weight from being allowed to fly over, around, viewing or filming private property without prior permission from the property's owner and residents.",
