        "additional_details": "For reasons including safety and green policies speed limits have been reduced in many places to 20 mph and the intensity of speed cameras in some areas appears to have increased.\r\n \r\nOne consequence is more penalty points awarded for people driving below 30 mph, often leading to driving bans and speed awareness courses, now at all-time highs.  I believe reducing the penalty for speeding in a 20mph zone would help ease public stress on this issue and free resources for more useful work.",
        "background": "I want the fixed penalty for offences relating to the new 20 mph speed limits to be reduced to a level I believe commensurate with the offence and more in line with public opinion.",
