They may experienced trauma back home or on their journey to the UK, and should receive support and care. Instead, a lack of security has allowed them to disappear and there appears to have been little effort to find or protect these children. It is the state\u2019s duty to protect children under The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). It is the government\u2019s duty.",

The government should take immediate action to find these children and protect all children living in Home Office hostels.",
