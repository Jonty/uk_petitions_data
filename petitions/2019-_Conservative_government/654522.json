        "additional_details": "I would like the goverment to put this in place because as a mountain biker myself, I have no wheee local to ride. This has resulted in my and my friends to ride features like the stairs down in the mariner. As a result of being in a public place, we have had loads of encouragement for what we are doing from locals that mountain bike them selves. We have also had complaints and been shouted at for it as we are in a public space. I believe that the MTB park (or pump track) would keep people happy.",
        "background": "I would love to see a MTB (mountain bike) park in brightlingsea, maybe a small paved one with lots of jumps and berms, it would mean that it is low maintenance as the concrete won\u2019t get damaged by tire tracks. Brightlingsea is a small town but a MTB park would really bring people in to the town.",
