        "additional_details": "Singing together with other people has been an invaluable lifeline for those of us who have to work hard at managing our mental health. It is entirely possible to sing safely indoors when COVID-secure measures such as social distancing, good hand hygiene, and ventilation are put in place. This last-minute guidance that non-professional singers can only sing indoors in groups of six is hugely disappointing and damaging to mental health, and will do more harm than good.",
        "background": "I would like the government to retract the guidance issued on 18 May that says amateur choirs can only rehearse indoors in groups of six. Step 3 of the roadmap should allow choirs of any size to rehearse indoors providing social distancing is maintained and COVID-secure measures are in place.",
