Compared to Homes For Ukraine, they miss out on:\r\n- Min 6 months rent free accommodation; if they can't provide rooms in their own home or afford to rent privately, relatives at risk can't come here or may be homeless on arrival\r\n- \u00a310000 funding per refugee for councils\r\n- \u00a3200 'welcome' for refugee\r\n- \u00a3350 a month payment for host to cover costs\r\n- 25% single person council tax rebate preserved",
