        "additional_details": "Too many people are injured and killed each year as a result of a drink / drug driver, a 6 month or 12 month ban and a small fine is not enough, they should be removed of their privilege to be able to drive and make roads more safe, people are getting injured and killed that are simply just walking along a pavement, taking these people off the road before they cause damage will save lives.",
        "background": "Introduce a permanent driving ban for anyone who is found to be over the drinking limit whilst driving or under the influence of illegal drugs, removing their license and any chance to be able to drive again",
