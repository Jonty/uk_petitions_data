        "additional_details": "I want this to happen because many people are mature at 16 they have interests and some have part-time or full-time jobs also public transport isn't the best option due to lateness. even though people age 16 aren't adults that doesnt mean they can't be trusted. Adults are speeding up and down the road not looking but that should mean the government or parliament can't give 16-year-olds a chance. not everybody is bad some people need this. Some whose lives could change. i would really appreciate if this is held up for debate.",
