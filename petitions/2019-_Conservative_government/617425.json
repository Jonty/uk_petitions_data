We might have to switch off or use our equipment less which is vital for our survival. We could be unable to purchase specific food for our dietary requirements. We might be unable to be warm. This could lead to more hospitalisations and death. Most Disabled people already suffer from mental health problems and this will only increase. This could lead to more suicides and death.",
