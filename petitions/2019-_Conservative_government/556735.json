        "additional_details": "Whilst completing uni and being in placement full time there will be no additional support for PGCE students. Due to the fact that these students will be working in schools full time and completing uni work it makes it near impossible for them to have a job to be able to fund them selfs. I myself have had to work whilst completing my degrees and now face going into significant amount of debt just to become a teacher. The government have shown that they have no respect for teachers and their job.",
        "background": "The government recently decided to scrap funding for arts and humanity PGCE students. Meaning whilst at uni and in placement full time there will be no additional support for PGCE students. The government should fund these students e.g. minimum wage for the time that they are working in schools.",
