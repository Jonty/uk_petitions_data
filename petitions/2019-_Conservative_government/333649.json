        "additional_details": "The industry is a huge contributor to the UK economy and further disruption will see many jobs lost and many businesses closing down. Money was spent to plan for the 1st August open but this was stopped meaning some business owners spent their last bit of income to re-open then had to cancel all the bookings . An initiative like vouchers for beauty would help get customers back into the salons and give the industry the boost it needs to recover, like eat out to help out.",
        "background": "The beauty industry has been hit the hardest during lockdown and with close contact services restricted they are suffering even more. The beauty industry needs support to rebuild and recover and could benefit from a scheme similar to eat out to help out to help kickstart their businesses.",
