Our people have had enough, how much longer do they need to see their children dying, their mothers crying, their brothers, sons, fathers getting killed? Here we have the privilege to get educated, we have laws that protect us from forced marriages, but in Afghanistan, girls as young as 12 are forced to marry Talibs. We've had enough, the cries of Afghans are not being heard at all.",
        "background": "The UK government should evacuate as many Afghans as they can, and it would be better if an army was sent to fight off the Taliban, along with armies from other powerful countries, such as the US.",
