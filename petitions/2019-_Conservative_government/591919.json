Your petition calls for \"1m social distance\" to be made mandatory, but it's not clear how you want this rule to work (for example, whether it would only apply to people from different households, and how it would work in situations where people provide close contact services).\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
