The penalties for causing death by dangerous driving are one to 14 years in prison, and a driving ban for a minimum of two years. I have never heard of a case where anyone has been sentenced to the maximum 14 year term in prison. What does it take to get 14 years? If someone causes death by dangerous driving whilst intoxicated and they don\u2019t stop they should be sentenced to 14 years not up to 14 years.",
