        "additional_details": "It is clearly undemocratic to have a section of parliament responsible for scrutiny, that is not answerable to the UK electorate.\r\n\r\nIt is not democratic to receive a seat in the Lords based solely on your birth family or because of favour with those in power.\r\n\r\nIn a modern Britain, how can it be fair and equal that we automatically elevate those of certain religions over that of others.\r\n\r\nIf the UK wants to have a truly democratic process, we need an elected Second Chamber.",
        "background": "We want a UK wide referendum on abolishing the House of Lords and replacing it with a wholly elected Second Chamber.\r\nMembers of this Second Chamber would be on the same electoral constituencies as the House of Commons and serve for a 10 year term.",
