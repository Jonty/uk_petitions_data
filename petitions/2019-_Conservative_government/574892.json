        "action": "Legalise recreational use and personal cultivation of Cannabis in the U.K.\u201d",
        "additional_details": "I believe that the government should do this because it would allow them to take cannabis out of the black market and ensure that the cannabis sold in the U.K. is controlled, tested and safe. This increased control over the market would also offer a huge boost to the economy, which would greatly ease the financial strain of Covid 19. Furthermore, a recent UN vote recognised the medicinal values of cannabis, so based on the science, cannabis being illegal is both immoral and completely outdated.",
        "background": "I urge the U.K. government to legalise recreation use of cannabis and small scale cultivation for personal use. Using Canada and 11 states in the USA as an example, legalisation has proven very beneficial economically, lowered crime rates, and has created a controlled and safe market for users.",
