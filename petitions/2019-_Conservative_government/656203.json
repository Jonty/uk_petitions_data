        "additional_details": "The reason for this petition is due to the chaos of parking caused by the Gravesham & Dartford Muslim Association centre on Albion Terrace. \r\nDuring the times of 12.00-14.00 every Friday, guests attending prey cause chaos to residents by double parking, and parking in available space in these streets resulting in residents having no where to park or parking on double yellow lines. There is a car park located 2 minutes away at The Promenade, but they will not use this because of cost.",
