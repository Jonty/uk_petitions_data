The conflict in Ukraine, brought on by Russia\u2019s invasion, is exacerbating pre-existing hunger crises for many countries. \r\n\r\nThe UN projects that a further 8-20m people will now be left hungry from the knock-on effects of soaring prices and broken supply chains. Today, 811 million people are living with chronic hunger. \r\n\r\nIf we don't act fast the threat of famine will increase for millions of people.",
