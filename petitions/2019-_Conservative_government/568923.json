        "additional_details": "In the first month of lockdown 25 front-line doctors died of which 24 were BAME. Why has this slaughter stopped? The Asian Doctors' Assoc advised them to take Vit D and distributed fast-acting Vit D. The drop in deaths is nothing short of miraculous.\r\nA recent study showed dramatic benefits giving fast acting Vit D to Covid-19 patients entering a hospital in Spain. 50 patients were given Calcifediol \u2013 only one went to ICU and none died \u2013 of the 26 control group 13 required ICU care and two died.",
        "background": "Vitamin D deficiency is known to be a major health problem linked to infectious diseases, such as Covid-19, as well as other serious and chronic diseases. Yet in Winter 40% of the UK population is deficient in Vitamin D rising to near 80% in some BAME groups.",
