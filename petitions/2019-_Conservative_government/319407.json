        "action": "Keep schools closed until September to allow more time to prepare more carefully",
        "additional_details": "I feel strongly as a member of staff at a primary school and also a parent of a year 6 pupil that this is causing immense anxiety in both parents and children feeling they are being rushed like guinea pigs into this uncertain situation. The risk to a second wave outways the urgency to get children back into schools with only weeks left of term. Allowing a return in September prevents this and gives everybody more time to gain confidence and knowledge of the safest way to begin normality.",
        "background": "Schools may reopen in June and I feel strongly as a parent of a year 6 that this is far too soon to be taking this risk. This should be delayed till September to allow more time to asses the risk it poses to both the children and the staff/parents. More time would allow better preparations.",
