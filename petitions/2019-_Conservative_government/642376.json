There are many reports of incidents from vulnerable road users including walkers, cyclists, horse riders/drivers and motorbike riders e.g. 68 horses were killed on roads in 2022 (British Horse Society data). Campaigns such 'Pass Wide And Slow' and 'Dead Slow' raise awareness but most often amongst affected groups rather than the majority of drivers.\r\n\r\nA reminder may encourage drivers to check changes.",
