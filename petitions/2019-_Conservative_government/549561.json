        "action": "Require the BBC to explain why it thinks Britons should be slaves",
        "additional_details": "Govrnment is responsible for permitting the 'licence fee'. It is legally a tax which means it cannot be challenged in court, and is not a payment to or for the BBC, therefore no consumer rights attach. In real life everyone knows it is a payment to and for the BBC so government is complicit in this corrupt and dishonest method of supporting the BBC and bears some responsibility for its output, including its denial of the claim that  ritons should never be slaves",
        "background": "The BBC has chosen to suppress the line in a popular song that asserts 'Britons never never never shall be slaves'. It is therefore of the opinion that Britons should be slaves and in view of the way it is financed, should be required to justify this policy to the taxpaying public.",
