I think there is a scarcity of public toilets relative to the population. This move could help enhance public health and inclusivity, offer economic benefits to businesses, and contribute to a more hospitable and accessible public environment, positively contributing to the cost of living and the UK's reputation as a tourist-friendly country.",
