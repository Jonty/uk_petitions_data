        "additional_details": "This isnt anything in our power, the government should be thinking about the peoples physical well being aswell as mental. Some students did not get much support from the teachers so it was the case that they had to understand most lessons their selves, and so these people need a right amount of break to not only have a short holiday but mostly revise over school work.",
        "background": "Schools/colleges should be open at September as it's not safe enough to go to school in july and students that have been working hard need a break as the period of time that was spent at home was mentally draining for many of them and going back to school wouldnt help.",
