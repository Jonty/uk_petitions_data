        "additional_details": "There aren't enough staff, and isn't enough funding to actually help people. People find the courage to speak up, only to find there's limited help available to them. Therapy has moved online, whilst pubs remain open. People are having therapy sessions in their personal space with nowhere to escape to afterwards and no support after the session if things get intense. Mothers try to speak about their suicidal thoughts with their children in the same building. It's just not good enough.",
        "background": "The mental health sector is underfunded and understaffed. The government should provide the sector with additional funding and improve training, resources and services. They also need to help the sector to provide face to face therapy for the most vulnerable patients during this pandemic.",
