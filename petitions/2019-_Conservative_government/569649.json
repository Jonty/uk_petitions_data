        "action": "Open COVID vaccination venues 24 hours a day",
        "additional_details": "Israel has already by mid-January vaccinated a fifth of its population by offering vaccines day and night, despite starting its vaccination programme 3 weeks after the UK. Due to the increased infectiousness of the UK's COVID mutation B117, we need to immunise the entire adult population as quickly as possible in order to return to normality. We urgently need to be able to go back to work and have our children go back to school: our economy and the prospects of our young people depend on it.",
        "background": "We urge the government to offer vaccines 24 hours a day to radically speed up the vaccination programme. We are concerned we are losing valuable time in the race against COVID and we would like vaccination venues to be open round the clock so all UK adults can get their first vaccinations by spring.",
