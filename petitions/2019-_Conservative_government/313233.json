        "additional_details": "Many people make their money from a mix of employed/ self employed work. The decision not to help those who make under 50% of their money from self employment seems to suggest that those workers don't count on that money. Try telling someone in full employment that a potential 49% of their income is irrelevant. \r\nIf the government is willing to pay up to \u00a32,500 per month to those earning up to \u00a350,000 a year from self employment, why won't they help the self employed asking for much less?",
        "background": "The government is currently offering no support grant to workers who's self employed earnings make up under 50% of their total annual income. The government should extend their offer of a support grant to cover ALL self employed workers, not just those who make over 50% of their money that way",
