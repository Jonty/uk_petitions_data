        "additional_details": "During the cost of living crisis many people are trying to budget and balance their spending. The surcharge, albeit small, is unfair to the end user. They should not be penalised for budgeting wisely and trying to refrain from a large single payment annually. In addition to this as the VED is all online and no paper disks are required a 6 month VED should be half the price of 12, not having an extra charge.",
        "background": "In these difficult financial times the Government is adding to the burden of expense by charging more money for VED, commonly known as road tax, to customers paying by direct debit and for those who pay monthly or every 6 months, rather than yearly. The Government should remove these surcharges.",
