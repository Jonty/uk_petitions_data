Mental health is declining, we are paying for an education we have not received and for houses we are not allowed to go back to. Reimburse students for their \u2018online learning\u2019, take ACTUAL measures to support university students. Get rid or provide an alternative for dissertations, offer priority access to mental health services. Stop ignoring our struggle and take accountability. Take notice of your ignorance.",

Through two national lockdowns we are expected to deal with the same workload whilst under even more stress than usual and we are not being properly supported or considered by the government.",
