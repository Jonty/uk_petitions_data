So that we can make it fair for all student we would like NVQ/VRQ students to get their teacher predicted grade so that they do not have to come in, in summer while other student are having fun and not stressing like NVQ/VRQ students who expected to take the exam.",
        "background": "We would like this because unlike all students last year when they all had their exams cancelled and got their predicted grades NVQ and VRQ students had to come into college after lockdown to do a bit of revision and then take the exams regardless of their preparation and what grade they may get.",
