        "additional_details": "We all need to make changes to limit the effects of climate change in our future and in our children's future. There is a growing movement across the country to 'do the right thing' but this can be a daunting task for an individual - are bananas shipped from Africa less environmentally damaging than satsumas grown in Spain? \r\n\r\nAlso, if the awareness of the environmental impact of different foods is increased, then people who are less informed are also more likely to make lower impact choices.",
        "background": "This proposal is to mandate environmental health traffic lights of carbon footprint, water use & packaging recyclability on food products similar to the sugar/salt health traffic lights. This will enable people to make informed choices on the environmental impact of the goods they are buying.",
