        "additional_details": "We, the British citizens of the United Kingdom have a right to protect Londons statues and landmarks. We may not always be proud of some of our history, but London is NOT just any capital - it is the Capital of our country and Mr Khan has no right to attempt to re write our history to suit diversity. All this will achieve is agitating a nation that already feels disenfranchised from london. If diversity truly exists then people should live with our history, not erase it.",
        "background": "Sadiq khan has started a commission to debate the possibility of removing or replacing London landmarks and statues. As citizens of the UK we oppose this action and want this commission disbanded on this topic.",
