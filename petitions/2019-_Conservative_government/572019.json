        "additional_details": "We need to keep children safe from infection. Schools Re opened far too soon after the March 2020 lockdown & along with other measures like eat out to help out people all over were pushed together & so the virus rates soared. Schools are a breeding ground for viruses. Everyone who works in education knows that. The government need to keep schools closed for as long as it takes & once they do re open class numbers should be halved to allow for social distancing & online lessons continue",
        "background": "Schools should remain closed, until it\u2019s safe to open, & then open gradually & with social distancing in place. The rates of infection are far too high still to send the children back into the classroom. There needs to be clear evidence that the numbers are decreasing and schools can be made safe",
