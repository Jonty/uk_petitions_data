There is also no need for accommodation which students have paid between \u00a34,000-\u00a38,000 for in advance and adding to their student debt. Lastly, the extended strikes of this year have severely disrupted student-staff interaction and personalised help, with staff not replying to emails or available for meetings. Grading is also being delayed. Overall, university quality is poor this year and certainly not worth up to \u00a39,250.",
        "background": "All students should be reimbursed of this years tuition fees as universities are now online only due to COVID-19, with only powerpoints online for learning materials which is not worthy of up to \u00a39,250. Furthermore, all assessments are being reconsidered to \u2018make do\u2019 and build up credits.",
