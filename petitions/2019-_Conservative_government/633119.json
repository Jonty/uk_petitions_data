Ironically, this because their services is deemed too important. I have seen first hand the damage this does to our officers. They are overworked due to lack of numbers and can be penalised for not doing their job to the best of their ability as a result. Pay does not reflect the increase of work, psychological damage and the rise in cost of living.",

Police in England and Wales continue to suffer but have no right to take such drastic action as other emergency services do. This needs to be rectified.",
