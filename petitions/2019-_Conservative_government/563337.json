        "additional_details": "The Government has recognised the potential with e-scooter rental trials, but privately owned e-scooters aren\u2019t allowed on the same roads. The UK laws should catch up with many of our European neighbours.\r\nIf made legal, the benefits include: they offer an alternative to public transport \u2013 for short journeys in particular, are simple to set up and ride and better for the environment. Any new regulations should deliver safer roads and ensure that users behave responsibly and with due care.",
        "background": "The UK law states that you can ride a bike, drive a car or even saddle up a horse on the road, but not ride a privately owned e-scooter.\r\nE-scooters are better for the environment, helping ease congestion and address pollution, so I am calling on the Government to legalise their use on public roads.",
