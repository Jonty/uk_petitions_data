        "additional_details": "The rationing that is being done in supermarkets isn\u2019t enough. People are getting family members to join them shopping so that they can double the amount they buy. People are also not limited to how many times they shop each day or week, meaning they can still stockpile. People didn\u2019t have money to stockpile in the war, they do now. They have savings and credit cards so we need to do it now more than ever to make it fair for those who are vulnerable and not over buying",
        "background": "The government need to put proper ticket rationing in place to ensure people get what they need. Tickets per person per household will ensure that people are not able to stockpile more than what they need, because at the moment, people are going without",
