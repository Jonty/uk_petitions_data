        "additional_details": "The UK has a disgraceful record on public toilets. Whilst urinating in public is an offence, councils do nothing to prevent this.  \r\n\r\nThe Government should make provision of public toilets a legal requirement and stop councils pushing this responsibility onto the private sector.\r\n\r\nThis legal requirement should stipulate that there should be a minimum number of toilets based on footfall to the area, i.e. the more people there are the more public toilet cubicles are provided, which can be either free, via money slot or staffed. There is technology today for self cleaning toilets.",
        "background": "Public toilets are not a legal requirement in the UK, which is why local councils have sold off buildings housing toilets over the last 30 years and not replaced them.",
