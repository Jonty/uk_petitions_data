        "action": "Lift social distancing in schools and nurseries for the sake of mental health",
        "additional_details": "Schools and nurseries are environments where children develop social skills that are essential to life in society. Social distancing measures do not allow for these aspects to be fomented. As staff needs to concentrate on excessive disinfection, and access to material such as toys and books is limited, the focus is taken away from teaching. Engagement between parents and teachers is also reduced, as well as pupils' motivation to go back to school. All of these could impact mental health negatively.",
        "background": "We would like the government to lift all social distancing measures in schools, so children can go back to their normal activities. Any future measures on schools related to Covid19 should be presented to parliament for voting considering the mental health, social and educational needs of children.",
