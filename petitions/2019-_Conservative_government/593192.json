Apart from individual human tragedies, the economic costs will be devastating. For example, obesity alone has an estimated price tag of \u00a35.1 billion per annum ALREADY and much more money is needed to fund even the current demand for mental health services, with credible sources anticipating demand will skyrocket. Immediate and determined action is needed to safeguard the future.",

New cross-Departmental policies are required to halt and reverse the serious deterioration in health and wellbeing, entrenched before the pandemic and now exacerbated by it.",
