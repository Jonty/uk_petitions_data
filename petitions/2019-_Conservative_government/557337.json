        "additional_details": "The system was messed up before cancelling and rebooking test and most of us who have a test in this brand new lockdown have been waiting almost all year for it. \r\nYour rules say to work from home, but how can all the self employed and contracted driving instructors do that if you hit pause on their livelihood again. \r\nThere is little contact for lessons so it can be made safe, safer than meeting 30 students at school I would have thought. You may say it\u2019s not essential but I promise you to, the majority of People waiting for their test , it is the most important thing for them right now.",
        "background": "I believe the test should still be allowed to go ahead during lockdown if the existing safety measures stay in place.\r\nIf school and universities can stay open why can\u2019t student driving schools remain operational and practical and theory tests Keep on happening.",
