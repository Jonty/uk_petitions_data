        "additional_details": "The beauty industry in the UK alone is worth close to \u00a330bn. And yes, we know the pub industry is worth \u00a323bn and the restaurants contribute \u00a338bn but let\u2019s face it, you can\u2019t eat or enjoy your pint with full PPE nor can you behave rationally and adhere to social distancing rules whilst you\u2019ve had a few drinks down you! I am not judging those who enjoy bars and pubs whatsoever, I am just comparing safety and logic. In a salon, you can behave and follow rules for the sake of everyone\u2019s safety.",
        "background": "I am asking Boris Johnson that once lockdown #2 is over, for the sake of businesses, the economy, and more importantly, mental health, for both clients and the business owners, allow salons to be the first or at least part of the first group of businesses to open.",
