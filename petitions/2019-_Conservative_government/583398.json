Small clubs that are integral to the culture and structure of football are at risk of going out of business. And what is the response of the richest clubs? To try and take even MORE money for themselves by creating a competition from which they can't even be relegated. The six richest clubs would not exist without the football leagues below them.",
        "background": "Introduce legislation to prevent the richest football clubs in England destroying our sporting history and culture. Bring forward proposals to help regulate the game. Protect fans from greedy owners that want nothing more than to make more money. Make football more equitable for ALL English clubs.",

The Culture Secretary said that the Government would back the football authorities to stop this move, and if the football authorities couldn\u2019t act, the Government would. The Culture Secretary said the Government would \"put everything on the table to prevent this from happening.\"\r\n\r\nYou can read the Culture Secretary's full statement on the European Super League here: https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/statement-by-oliver-dowden-on-the-european-super-league\r\n\r\nYou can read a report about the English clubs' withdrawal from the European Super League here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/56823501.\r\n\r\nFurther, on 19 April the Government announced a 'Fan-led review of football governance', which will explore ways of improving the governance, ownership and financial sustainability of clubs in English football, building on the strengths of the football pyramid.
