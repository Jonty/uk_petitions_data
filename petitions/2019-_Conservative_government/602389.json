        "additional_details": "Tax-free childcare, though appreciated, is capped far too low for working families. In Surrey for example our nursery costs \u00a312,650 per annum for 3 days meaning we use up our allowance before the year is up. Fortunately we have family that help with childcare for 2 days, if not our annual childcare bill for one child would be \u00a321,000 average for the area. 20% tax free allowance would need to be \u00a34,200 but it is currently capped at \u00a32,000. In order to support women attain equal pay and progression at work there must be NO cap.",
        "background": "Remove the cap on tax-free childcare to allow parents, particularly mums, to return to work without a large financial burden. Too many women who want to return to work are either unable to do so due to childcare costs, or return at a cost to themselves in order to progress their careers.",
