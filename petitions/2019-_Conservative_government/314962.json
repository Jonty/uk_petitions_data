        "additional_details": "The Corona Virus is the biggest nationwide challenge the United Kingdom has faced since WW II; our NHS and Key Workers are at the forefront of fighting the global pandemic. Life as normal has ceased, only the dedication and self-sacrifice of NHS and Key Workers will bring normality and safety back to citizens of the UK. Unlike the military, they did not sign up knowingly putting their lives on the line which makes their courage all the more remarkable: they deserve full National recognition.",
        "background": "We want the Government to give a National Defence Medal to all the NHS staff & Key Workers who have helped to save the Nation in our hour of need during the Corona Virus Pandemic. The dependants of those who are killed carrying out front-line services should also receive special recognition.",
