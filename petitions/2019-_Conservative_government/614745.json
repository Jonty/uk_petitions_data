        "additional_details": "Every day in Britain, a schools security will be undermined. Whether it be a dangerous weapon or drugs being smuggled in to the premises, or an intruder entering a place of learning. Several pupils and staff are also very unaware as to what to do in a major security breach/incident. This is unacceptable, the lack of security and protocol is putting our children at risk. Our children deserve a safe secure environment to learn in, as do the personnel who work in the educational establishment.",
        "background": "I would like the British Government to put in appropriate measures to make British schools more secure and safe for pupils and staff, and have a detailed protocol for all schools in the UK on what to do in the case of a major incident/security breach.",
