HS2 and foreign aid is a priority to this government but making the vulnerable pay for this tax out of their reduced universal credit is absolutely unacceptable.",
        "background": "The government should revoke the bedroom tax and help the vulnerable on limited budgets. According to Crisis homelessness is on the increase and there are concerns this tax is helping towards those figures due to people not been able to pay for the rent shortfall out of their limited benefits due.",
