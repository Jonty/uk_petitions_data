        "additional_details": "Pets currently are referred to in law as \u2018property\u2019 but for the majority of pet owners, they see their pet as a member of the family. Some pets are therapy dogs and assist with physical impairments. Pets are more than property and the law should resemble this. With threats to life being made, families heartbroken and breaking and entry into homes this is simply not enough. Where a pet theft takes place, the punishment should be more severe and it should be classed as abduction.",
        "background": "The government need to reassess the laws in place around pet theft, especially with the heavily increased amount of crimes of this nature committed recently. The punishment is not enough to deter criminals from acting on this.",
