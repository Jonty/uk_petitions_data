        "action": "Stop weigh-ins for school children",
        "additional_details": "A weight loss focus encourages restrictive eating, binge eating, excessive exercise & calorie counting. Millions of UK citizens suffer from eating disorders (EDs). Weigh-ins would likely increase severity & number of pupils with EDs. Weighing children would encourage bullying & be unreliable (weight naturally increases with height). Instead, teach healthy relationships with exercise, food, drink & educate about links between mental & physical health, promote healthy canteen & lifestyle options.",
        "background": "Weigh-ins are damaging, unhelpful, traumatising, encourage fat shaming & create damaging relationships with food eg. eating disorders.  Weight is not a reliable health indicator. Better alternatives include increasing healthy lifestyle education (physical & mental health, nutrition etc).",
