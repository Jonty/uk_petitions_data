        "action": "Require food manufacturers to reduce packaging if they reduce content size",
        "additional_details": "1. Environmental protection: Reduces unnecessary packaging\r\n2. Consumer protection/improved transparency: requiring manufacturers to reduce pack size if content amount/size is reduced makes the change more obvious. This would help consumers to make better informed buying decisions.\r\n3. Consumer health: current rules risk consumers being disappointed by reduced portion size. If they consumed a second product, this could result in increased overall consumption with potential adverse health impact",
        "background": "Food manufacturers are quick to save money by reducing the size of food contents. The price and packaging are often left unchanged. I would like to see food producers required by law to reduce the size of packaging if they reduce the amount/size of the contents.",
