        "action": "Stop funding the BBC with the TV License fee or other public money.",
        "additional_details": "Please remove the BBC from the list of beneficiaries of the TV license fee. It is not fair to make citizens pay for content they have no intention of watching, this is almost communist/socialist in nature. Regardless of the structure, it amounts to state television. Redirect the funds into the other areas which are funded by the TV license.",
        "background": "Television has evolved over the last 20 years, with many forms of media now available. Many citizens do not want to watch BBC programs, yet they are forced to fund the BBC via the TV License. We understand that the TV license funds other things, but we do not want it to fund the BBC any longer.",
