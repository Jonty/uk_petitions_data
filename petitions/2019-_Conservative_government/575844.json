        "additional_details": "Electricity prices are 24% higher due to the environmental charge, whereas gas prices are only 2% higher.  \r\nThis disadvantages rural communities without gas, residents of flats and people forced to use electrical home heating.\r\nThe high charge on electricity slows the transition to Net Carbon Zero, by increasing the fuel cost for clean alternatives such as heat pumps and battery electric vehicles.\r\nElectricity generation is becoming cleaner each year, and the charges should reflect that progress.",
        "background": "Currently environmental charges applied to domestic electricity are 12 times higher than those applied to gas, despite the fuels having almost identical levels of environmental impact. \r\nThe government should spread the charges relative to the pollution caused by each fuel.",
