This is shocking and not justice for the impact the offence has caused. We don\u2019t want anyone else to go through what this family has suffered.\r\n\r\nIt should be a minimum life sentence for taking a life, especially driving under influence of drink and drugs. Two young lives were lost due to this! The law has to change with heavier sentences for these crimes, and serving a full sentence per offence.",

The minimum sentences must be increased, and offenders should have to serve sentences consecutively instead of just one sentence for all charges when multiple people are killed or injured.",
