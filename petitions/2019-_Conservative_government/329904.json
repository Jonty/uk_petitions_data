        "additional_details": "Since many of the public are already using their privately owned e-scooters, it makes sense to allow them to continue, but with a clear set of rules to follow. Rental scooters alone are not as safe, as they pose a high risk of passing on coronavirus to multiple people and also making the streets cluttered. Personally owed scooters means you are more protected from transmission of COVID-19 and personality owned e-scooters will be looked after and not left on pavements/rivers etc.",
