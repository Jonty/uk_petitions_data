        "additional_details": "We want this reduced to six week's pay, and limited to Ministers who have served a certain period in post (for example, 75% of the full term of a Parliament).\r\n \r\nRecent flux in Parliament has resulted in many Ministers serving extremely short periods in office, with often limited periods for new ministers to get a grip of their briefs and deliver outcomes. We believe Ministers should not be entitled to severance pay from day one, and that the amount of severance payments should also be reduced.\r\n",
