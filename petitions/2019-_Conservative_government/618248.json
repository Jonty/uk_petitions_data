When the wind doesn't blow and the sun has gone down renewable energy is useless. The energy we use should be reliable and cheap. Our energy should come from North Sea gas and oil and be refined here in the UK.\r\nWe also need to increase our capacity for refining gas and oil.\r\nThe transition to green energy should be natural as it gets cheaper in the future.",
        "background": "Net zero is being paid for by inflating our gas and electricity bills. Wind turbines are NOT FREE. We are all paying for them. We the tax paying people were never asked if we wanted to go green.",
