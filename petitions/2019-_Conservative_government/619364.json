        "additional_details": "In light of the US Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, there hasn't been a more important time for the UK to lead the world in protecting womens' healthcare, agency and choice.  The notion that any person, especially women, should not be in complete control of what happens to their own bodies is offensive.  Women shouldn't need to be handed these rights separately, and shouldn't be made to suffer when those rights are stopped by a majority who never need to undergo that care.",
        "background": "Ensure that all women have the constitutional/legal right to assert autonomy over their own bodies and own their own care.  The language used by MPs troubles lots of women as it can be extended far further than just abortions.  Just because she is a woman doesn't mean that she doesn't have agency.",
