        "additional_details": "Currently, the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) \u00a30.18 per litre of soft drinks containing 5-8g of sugar per 100ml, and \u00a30.24 per litre with above 8g. We believe this has not had enough of an impact on the industry, or on reducing sugar consumption. This proposed increase in the levy should have a deeper impact on the soft drinks industry and help reduce the accessibility of these harmful products - and would send a strong message about need to reduce sugar consumption.",
        "background": "We propose this threshold be increased to \u00a30.25 for 5-8g and \u00a30.30 for above 8g. This increase should have a deeper impact on the soft drinks industry and help reduce the accessibility of these harmful products - and would send a strong message about need to reduce sugar consumption.",
