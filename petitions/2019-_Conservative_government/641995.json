We understand that you are concerned about discrimination against Gypsy and Traveller communities, but we're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nGypsies and Travellers are a racial group as defined in Section 9 of the Equality Act 2010. They are therefore protected, from direct discrimination (Section 13), indirect discrimination (Section 15) and harassment (Section 26). \r\n\r\nThere are also already offences in the Public Order Act 1986 relating to threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour. Where an offender has demonstrated hostility based on race, or been motivated by hostility based on race, offences can be treated as hate crime. Decisions about investigating and prosecuting alleged crimes, including alleged hate crimes, are a matter for the police and Crown Prosecution Service, not the Government or Parliament."
