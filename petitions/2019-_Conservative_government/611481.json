We have recently seen admirable instances of European politicians leading by example under extraordinary circumstances. The Government has announced a scheme for the public to volunteer to house refugees. British Parliamentarians who receive taxpayer's money for housing expenses must lead by example and offer to house Ukrainian refugees in their vacant accommodation.",
        "background": "Many Parliamentarians performed duties remotely during the CV19 pandemic. A substantial number are in receipt of expenses for London accommodation but reside there for a small proportion of the week. Members could resume remote working and accommodate refugees in their vacant properties.",
