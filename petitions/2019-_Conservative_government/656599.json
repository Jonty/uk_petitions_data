        "additional_details": "We want the Government to make Close Passes by drivers a specific traffic offence, with significant penalties for drivers. This could make the police take this more seriously.\r\n \r\nThe Government aim to increase the number of people cycling would be well served by increasing safety for cyclists, and drivers taking more responsibility for how they view cyclists. More members of the population might cycle if it felt safer to do so.\r\n \r\nOften the only space is the road and it can be a nerve-racking experience cycling alongside cars, which puts some people off from cycling and does not instil confidence in parents that their children will be safe. Improving driver behaviour is essential. We think making \"Close Passes\" by drivers a specific traffic offence could help achieve this.\r\n \r\n",
