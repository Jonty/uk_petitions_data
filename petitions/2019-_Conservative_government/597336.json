        "additional_details": "The government prides itself on its world class education system and also currently on its focus on mental wellbeing. Universities are providing neither, teaching online does not allow for quality learning and has a huge detrimental impact on mental wellbeing. How when all other teaching professionals are back teaching face to face are universities permitted to continue online? Students are still paying \u00a39000 for an unacceptable education.",
        "background": "Enforce universities to teach a minimum of 50% face to face. Students are returning to university with all or the majority of teaching still online. This is having a massive negative impact on student wellbeing as they feel neglected and forgotten by the government.",
