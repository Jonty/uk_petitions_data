        "additional_details": "Mandatory school uniforms limit self-expression, they can create a financial burden for families, and may not be suitable for certain climates or activities. there is lack of evidence on impact on academic achievement or behaviour, and they have the potential to discriminate against cultural or religious practices. Instead, schools should prioritize creating a culture of respect, inclusivity, and self-expression that celebrates diversity and encourages students to be their authentic selves.",
        "background": "School uniform should not be a requirement as it does not improve the child's learning or well-being in any way, if anything it decreases the child's willingness and enjoyment of being at school it also decreases creativity in a child's work.",
