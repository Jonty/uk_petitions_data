I am tired of being afraid to leave my own home for fear of not being able to park close to my home. It's time things are changed for the better, its supposed to make our lives easier not harder.",

This is to prevent people from blocking desperately needed safe access for all disabled people to their own homes. They also need to be made enforceable.",
