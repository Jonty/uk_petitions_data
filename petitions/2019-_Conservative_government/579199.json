        "additional_details": "It has become increasingly obvious that Boris Johnson is abusing the powers he has been given. \r\nParliament must have a voice because it represents every one of us.  \r\nOne party leader making all the decisions and whipping his party to blindly agree with him is eroding what little democracy we have. \r\nThe UK shouldn't be under the dictatorship of one person.   \r\nEnd this abuse of power now.",
        "background": "The abuse of power under Henry VIII protocol has led to a loss of parliamentary scrutiny,  representation and sovereignty. \r\n\r\nAnyone who abuses power doesn't deserve power. \r\n\r\nStand together to rid Boris Johnson of this privilege.",
