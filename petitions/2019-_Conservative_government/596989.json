        "additional_details": "There is huge anecdotal evidence to show that historically it was very distressing as an adolescent to have to get changed with no privacy, even in a single sex changing room. This impacts on a child's willingness to participate in PE which can lead to school avoidance. It can also cause massive self-esteem issues and this can be long-lasting. In 2021, a time of importance of safe-guarding and of positive mental health, our children should be safe from this extra stress during a difficult time.",
        "background": "All secondary school pupils should be able to get changed in privacy and they should all be able to access a private cubicle or area to do this in. All changing rooms should have cubicles or partitions so that no child has to unwillingly change in front of eachother.",
