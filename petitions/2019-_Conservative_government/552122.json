        "additional_details": "The expectation of a second national lockdown is already igniting fear and anxiety in a large majority of the population. Other countries such as Sweden and New Zealand have effectively handled this pandemic and are now returning to normality. \r\n\r\nThe government cannot provide a substantial or scientific reason why healthy individuals shouldn't continue to live life as normal whilst still shielding the vulnerable. Cutting off the economy now will just cause further devastation.",
        "background": "The pandemic has had a hugely detrimental effect on the mental health of the majority of the population; a second lockdown will exacerbate this. Allow people without pre-existing health conditions to continue to experience normality in a socially distanced way and shield the vulnerable.",
