        "action": "Enforce legislation around vaping specifically within the youth community.",
        "additional_details": "We believe that vaping in the youth is a dire issue. We have conducted local surveys and found that many local stores are selling to underage teens and children, we also found that older teens and adults were purchasing vapes and either giving them or reselling them to younger teens and children. Furthermore, although vaping is a new issue research from medical agencies has linked it to 1000s of lung illnesses and 3 deaths. The vaping epidemic is taking over and we want your help to resolve it.",
        "background": "We would like our Government to tighten the legislation around vaping and the sale of vapes to underage youths. We would also like to see licensing officers visiting the off-licences and, not only checking the sale of alcohol and Tabaco products, but also checking the sale of vapes.",
