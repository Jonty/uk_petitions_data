        "additional_details": "Allowing teachers this will bring them into line with other state-employed personnel; it will help remove more polluting vehicles from the road; it will help to contribute towards the government\u2019s stated target of stopping the production of fossil fuel powered cars by 2035; it will allow teachers to drive to school without emitting harmful gases in the vicinity of the school and other buildings.",
        "background": "State-employed teachers are currently exempt from accessing salary sacrifice schemes for electric cars, unlike many other state-employed people. Teachers should be allowed to take advantage of this to contribute to a greener future and savings on purchasing a zero emissions vehicle.",
