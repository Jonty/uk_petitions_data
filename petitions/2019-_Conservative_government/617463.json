        "additional_details": "The Prime Minister's actions to remove the need to resign after wilfully misleading parliament undermine the democratic process of this country. No government official should have the ability to change legislation when their position is in jeopardy due to their actions, and should be held accountable for this. We ask that the legislation changed by the current Prime Minister is reinstated and an independent body is formed that holds the Government to account and cannot be impeded by their will.",
        "background": "Reinstate need to resign after breaches of ministerial code and implement an independent body to enforce this to ensure elected officials are held to account for their actions. The independent body should have the final say in these matters and not be impeded by the Prime Minister.",
