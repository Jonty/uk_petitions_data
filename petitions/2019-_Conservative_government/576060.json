Not to mention that the cases of child abuse at home have risen by nearly 80% during the lockdown. It has also been shown in recent research that children do not contract the virus easily and so don't pass it on easily either. Protect the kids and their future, let them go back to school.",
        "background": "As a medical student, and also by helping homeschool a 5 year old, it has become evident the toll lockdown is taking on children. It affects their personal development, academic development and relationships. The quality of teaching/learning is no where near a real school.",
