        "additional_details": "Hedgerow supports many creatures that other types of habitat do not, providing harvest and shelter for the broadest range of species. The depth of three-yearly cuts must allow for sustainably healthy growth and development of foliage. Cutting depth thus to be subject, also, to limitation.\r\n\r\nMaking the retention of hedgerows a condition of BPS and ELM payments, particularly the Sustainable Farming Initiative (SFI), should ensure re-wilding of natural landscape as food, shelter and nest sites are restored, but this will take some time as ancient tracts of hedgerow have been weakened. Other landowners should be encouraged to follow suit, and means considered to reward their doing so. Such moves would ensure that public money is used to fund environmentally sustainable practices.",
