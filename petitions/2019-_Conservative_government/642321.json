A review should investigate how often landlords are charged for the above offences, and how often reviews of premises licences take place. It should also consider new powers that should be given to landlords under the law to prevent customers from drink driving, such as confiscating their car keys. This could help prevent drink driving, and the tragic consequences this can have.\r\n",
