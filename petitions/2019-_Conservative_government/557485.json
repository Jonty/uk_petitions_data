With them closed, infections are likely to fall quickly, like they did during the first lockdown.\r\n\r\nWithout making schools COVID-secure, infections will rise again as soon as lockdown ends. Transmission in those aged under 25 caused the second wave, and will cause a third wave if nothing is done to stop it happening again.",
