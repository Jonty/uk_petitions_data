        "additional_details": "The Amazon rainforest has recently been pushed past the tipping point, and has gone from being a carbon sink to a source of emissions. \r\n\r\nThis has been done deliberately by companies clearing land through fires and logging in order to grow mostly beef and soy.\r\n\r\nThe total disregard for life on earth that these companies show cannot be supported in the modern UK.\r\n\r\nA trade embargo on these products would prevent companies from profiting in the UK from the destruction of the Amazon.",
        "background": "The Government should not allow products that were grown on land cleared from the Amazon rainforest to be sold in the UK. The Government should send a clear message to Brazil and set an example for other countries of the measures it is willing to take to tackle the most dire crisis of mankind.",
