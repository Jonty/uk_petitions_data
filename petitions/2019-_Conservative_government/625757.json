        "additional_details": "I believe Economics is essential learning and should be more than an afterthought, once current EBacc subjects are chosen.\r\n \r\nWith respect, Economics is at least as valuable a learning experience as History or Geography. I would argue that Economics develops a greater understanding of the world outside of school, and opens many more future pathways for our young people.\r\n \r\nEconomics is often overlooked by the time students get to choosing sixth form subjects due to lack of GCSE exposure.\r\n",
        "background": "The English Baccalaureate - GCSE students take English, Math, the Sciences, Geography/History and a language. I would like Government to include GCSE Economics as an option alongside History and Geography. I feel it is equally significant and often not taught until A Level.",
