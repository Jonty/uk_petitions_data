Wetter winters and the increasing number of storms are taking their toll across the country. \r\nAid is always after the event of a flooding and any permanent improvement appears to be based on how extensive / expensive the damage was. Smaller communities are often left to try and minimise the risk of flooding by themselves with very little help from the relevant authorities.",
        "background": "Stop the building on flood plains until we have a far better understanding of the impact it has. \r\nProvide the Environment Agency with the necessary powers, funds & resources to provide flood defences or create a separate agency that is focused solely on flood management.",
