It is also unclear if you are referring to tests you need to take abroad, before you come back to the UK, in which case it would not be the responsibility of the UK Government to set prices of PCR tests for companies based abroad.\r\n\r\nYou could have a petition calling on the Government to cap the price of PCR tests supplied in the UK at a certain amount, if that is something you would like to see happen.\r\n\r\nYou may also like to sign the below petitions currently open on this topic:\r\n\r\nProvide free PCR tests for international travel and return to the UK\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/590483\r\n\r\nAllow international travel with a lateral flow test result\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/582714\r\n\r\nLower the price of the \u00a3210 COVID Home Test Kits for travellers entering the UK\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/575509\r\n"
