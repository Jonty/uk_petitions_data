        "additional_details": "Far too much waste is produced. Streets are strewn with litter. Much of this is plastic waste that is harming the environment. Greater awareness and accountability is required from manufacturers and consumers to reduce, reuse and recycle more. Changing the words we use about a product is a powerful message and drives awareness so that people think more about what they buy and where it goes when they have finished with it. Debates in Parliament highlight issues and can speed up change.",
        "background": "The term disposable implies the items can be thrown away without consequences, and this gives the wrong message. \r\n\r\nDisposable must be replaced with terms that clearly show the consequences when the object is thrown away, for example we could use the term \"non-recyclable lighters\".",
