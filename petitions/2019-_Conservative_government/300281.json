        "additional_details": "The charity Gingerbread states that around a fifth of families with children in the UK are single parent. When separated parents disagree over Child Maintenance, payment must be claimed through the Child Maintenance Service. But this service is not fit for purpose and is letting children (living in single parent families) down across the UK. The inefficiency of this service is one of the key contributors to half of single parent families (49%) living in poverty, despite the fact that 69% of single parents work.",
