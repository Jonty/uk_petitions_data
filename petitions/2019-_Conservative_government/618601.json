        "additional_details": "So many dogs die unnecessary when the weather heats up. Walking any dog in hot conditions can be fatal to them, it only takes 15 mins in 20\u00b0 conditions for a dog to become sick from heat stroke. When the weather gets above 20\u00b0 I think dogs should be indoors or in shaded areas where they can rest and stay cool. \r\nDogs are uncomfortable in the heat and it is not necessary for them to walk in hot conditions. Its cruel and potentially kill them. \r\nI want people seen walking dogs in hot conditions to be fined on the spot. Owners may think twice then and it would save dogs lives.",
        "background": "I think its about time people take seriously the health of their dogs. I want people who are seen out walking a dog when the weather is too hot to be fined on the spot. Only then do I think people will understand the seriousness of walking a dog in the heat.",
