This is prompted by current events, which will see the shortest-serving Prime Minister in the nation's history, receiving \u00a3115,000 a year for the rest of her life for only six weeks' work.",
        "background": "Since the allowance is intended to pay former PMs back for expenses spent while fulfilling public duties in the role, Parliament should consider introducing a qualifying threshold based on a mimimum period of office.",
