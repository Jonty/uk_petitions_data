        "additional_details": "Just like the furlough scheme, students need help for accommodation charges that they should not have signed up for this year. This is mentally affecting their lives and even derailing their studies. This has left students with unfair debt just because the government hasn\u2019t considered the impact on them.",
        "background": "Totally unfair how this wasn\u2019t considered beforehand by the government, students are doing online classes and do not need to be 100s miles away from home paying thousands for doing classes that can be done at home.  Had this been known before, students would have thought twice before moving out.",
