        "additional_details": "Any form of examination in the summer would put a ridiculous amount of stress on students who have missed over 6 months of education, and went through 3 national lockdowns. There is plenty of time to sort out a way of giving predicted grades which are fair and reasonable. So many pupils have had gone through several problems of at-home learning, and \u2018mini-exams\u2019 would not be fair in anyway. Sitting \u2018mini-exams\u2019 is no different from sitting normal exams in the summer and would not solve anything.",
        "background": "Instead of implementing mini exams that would be taken in the summer like normal exams, students should receive either their teacher predicted grades or fairly given Center Assessed Grades.",
