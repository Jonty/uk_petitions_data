        "action": "Stop Blackpool City Council from closing Blackpool Strip clubs",
        "additional_details": "Since COVID-19 forced businesses to shut their doors for over 12 months now, it would be detrimental to not only the immediate staff - (dancers, bar staff, management, security staff etc) but also suppliers and business networks which of course compromises our wider economy. \r\nI am one of many who believe there is more to this than the \"clean up\" they claim it to be with comments of SEVs being \"seedy in the extreme\" and seems more like 'slut-shaming' at it's finest.",
        "background": "Following Bristol's recent attempts to ban strip clubs, Blackpool councillors are set to discuss a ban of their own as they believe it will \"cut violence towards women\" and \"clean up\" the image they have to become a more so-called \"family holiday resort\".",
