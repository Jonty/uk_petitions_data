Perhaps people from that era could look back fondly on it, or maybe it could uncover a family mystery?\r\n",

Many people doing genealogical research will never see the contents of it, and because the 1931 census was destroyed and there wasn't a 1941 census due to the war we would otherwise have to wait 20 or so years for the next release.",
