Perhaps people from that era could look back fondly on it, or maybe it could uncover a family mystery?\r\n",
        "background": "We want the 1951 Census to be released early, at least by 2031. Many people doing genealogical research will never see the contents of it, and because the 1931 census was destroyed and there wasn't a 1941 census due to the war we would otherwise have to wait 20 or so years for the next release.",
