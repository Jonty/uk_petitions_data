        "additional_details": "Many people born before 1951 aren't around anymore, and if people are concerned with their personal data from that time being released, actions such as redacting information for living or presumed living people, similar to arrangements for the 1939 register, could be put into place.\r\n \r\nIn 2031, someone born in 1940 would be 91. Perhaps people from that era could look back fondly on it, or maybe it could uncover a family mystery?\r\n",
        "background": "We want the 1951 Census to be released early, at least by 2031. Many people doing genealogical research will never see the contents of it, and because the 1931 census was destroyed and there wasn't a 1941 census due to the war we would otherwise have to wait 20 or so years for the next release.",
