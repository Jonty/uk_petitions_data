Only by statistically gauging the true depth of these issues can effective measures be put in place to identify those who are vulnerable and to mitigate the destructive effects of PTSD within the UK police service.",

This should be led by a Governmental requirement for these issues to be recorded and reported by doctors and coroners.",
