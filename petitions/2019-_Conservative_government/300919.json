        "action": "Ban the sale of artificial grass",
        "additional_details": "It is widely accepted that planting trees and other plants is beneficial in the fight against climate change due to their ability to process CO2. Grass and other plant life also support our wildlife. Artificial grass offers no benefit to wildlife.\r\n\r\nArtificial grass is made from plastic and will not biodegrade. Its manufacture also has a carbon footprint.\r\n\r\nFor those who do not want the maintenance of plants, decking or patios are an alternative which do not contribute towards the plastic problem.",
        "background": "The sale of artificial grass should be banned in the UK for environmental reasons. It is environmentally irresponsible to allow garden space occupied by grass and other plant life (which processes CO2 and supports wildlife) to be replaced by plastic which does not biodegrade.",
