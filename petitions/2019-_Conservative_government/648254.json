        "additional_details": "Relentless breeding and showing of rabbits is cruel, exploitive and detrimental to their welfare. Rabbits, including extreme breeds with severe health conditions, are being bred for competition, kept in inhumane conditions, ringed, transported long distances to shows and displayed in tiny cages. Videos show terrified rabbits being severely mishandled by judges. Rescues frequently take in traumatised ex-show rabbits. Others are sold off or killed for pet food.",
        "background": "Make all competitive shows and exhibitions of rabbits illegal, in public and online, including on social media. Prohibit the hosting of competitive rabbit shows and exhibitions, and the hiring of public and private venues for such events, including county and agricultural shows.",
