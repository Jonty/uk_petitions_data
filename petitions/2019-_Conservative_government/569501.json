        "additional_details": "It's been reported that the Government say that there is currently \"not a clamour for jabs after 8pm\". The entire country is in a terrible situation thanks to Coronavirus and especially the newer mutation which is far more transmissible, which has resulted in horrendous overstretching of the NHS and the subsequent inevitable lockdown. To get us out of the situation as quickly as possible we must distribute the vaccines as quickly as possible, including on a 24hr basis wherever resources allow.",
        "background": "Whenever it is possible and safe to do so, and staffing/resource levels permit (including paid healthcare workers, volunteers, army etc.), the Coronavirus vaccines should be offered on a 24 hour basis to allow rollout to be as rapid as possible. The virus doesn't stop at night, why should we?",
