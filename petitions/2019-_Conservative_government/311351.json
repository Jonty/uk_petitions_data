        "additional_details": "It is important to reduce pollution and there's no question about it. These days people can buy online so why do we need more people on the streets on Sundays.\r\n\r\nLess shops means: less cars, trains, energy consumption, rubbish, noise, etc. This will allow the air to clean and nature to flourish better. \r\n\r\nThis would also reduce accidents and the need for more police on the and emergency services on the streets. \r\n\r\nThis would help to reduce stress on society.",
        "background": "Our main concern is the effects on the environment but also we want society to restore their spiritual values and to have peace of mind. \r\n\r\nWe should take the lesson of the coronavirus epidemic as an example of the benefits of having less people on the streets as this reduces pollution.",
