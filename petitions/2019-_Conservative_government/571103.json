        "additional_details": "Doctors like me have been waiting to do their practical test for a year now and due to multiple lockdowns there are no dates available or tests are cancelled. Allowing keyworkers to do their test will enable them to reach work and home safely especially when there are no trains working at late hours of the night and weekend. There have been multiple disruptions to rail services and change in timings due to the restrictions and lockdown as there is short staffing.",
        "background": "Keyworkers especially doctors are currently working long hours and odd unsocial hours and are unable to work from home. Please allow keyworkers to do their driving test practical and driving lessons to enable them to commute safely especially at late hours when trains or buses arent available.",
