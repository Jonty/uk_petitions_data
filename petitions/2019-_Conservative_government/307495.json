When compared to the 80% of wages offered to those in employment, universal pay is not enough. We have overheads, rent and bills to pay. We do not see how it is fair that we pay our taxes and support our national economy, only to be left out in the cold in this time of need. We will have no money left to pay taxes after this unless more financial help is offered now",
        "background": "We want to be treated as valued members of society, just as those in employment have been treated",
