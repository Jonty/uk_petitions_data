        "additional_details": "I have been trying to move houses for months now. Time and time again when the landlord hears the money to pay for the rent will come from Universal Credit they don't want to have anything to do with it.\r\n \r\nMany times landlords say that it is a condition of their Mortgage (which possibly discriminates against UC tenants). It shouldn't matter where the money is coming from as long as one is able to pay. Many tenants are threatened with eviction and yet it is so difficult to find suitable accommodation when one is on UC.",
