        "additional_details": "Too many patients have been denied details of serious known risks resulting in needless life altering damage. Currently we believe there is not sufficient deterrent to ensure culpability, and that medical/cosmetic organisations abuse their power by cherry picking the information given to patients. We believe that to deny a patient details of a known risk, to risk a worse outcome for a patient having a non-urgent procedure/treatment, without their consent is abhorrent. Without informed consent patients are unable to make an informed decision about their treatment.",

Legislation must ensure all known risks are declared to the patient. Failure to comply resulting in needless injury must be prosecutable.",
