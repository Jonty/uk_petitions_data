If we act to make permanent reductions which would otherwise be temporary, there is a chance to achieve this much sooner, avoiding or mitigating future climate breakdown, and, indeed, saving lives.",

This has led to short term reductions in emissions and improvements in air quality.\r\n\r\nWhen it becomes possible to lift the 'lockdown', the Government should consider as its greatest priority how to make these benefits permanent.",
