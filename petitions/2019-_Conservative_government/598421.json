        "additional_details": "There has been a lot of media attention particularly but not exclusively around violence against women. Carrying a weapon is illegal whether or not it is used. It could be argued that carrying a \"date rape\" drug is a weapon being carried with intent. The victims are left with a life sentence of trauma. Young people, particularly students, who are away from home and new to going to entertainment venues are vulnerable. A hard line on this is needed as a stance against this awful violent crime.",
