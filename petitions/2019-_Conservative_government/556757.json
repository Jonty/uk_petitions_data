        "additional_details": "Many of the 52% who voted for Brexit are of the older generations that have no plans to move abroad. Many young people have plans to move to EU countries in the future; this has been made much more difficult due to Brexit. Many young people did not want Brexit and whilst it is understood that this cannot be changed, it would be much better for young people if a deal was formed which allowed continued freedom of movement after the 31st of December. It is not fair to punish young people.",
        "background": "Seek to agree a deal with the EU to allow freedom of movement after the transition period. The immigration bill was not decided democratically and could impact many lives negatively. Nationalism can damage international relations and it should not dictate one's ability to move within the EU and UK.",
