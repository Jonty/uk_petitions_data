They were safe in mainland Europe but desire the benefits the UK provides.\r\nMany threaten to drown themselves if forced to accept French intervention at sea. Allowing safe completion of their journey to UK land, MUST not be reason for illegal entrants continued residence here, which makes an otherwise mockery of the efforts of legal applicants.",
