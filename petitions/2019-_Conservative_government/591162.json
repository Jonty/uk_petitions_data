        "additional_details": "PMQs is meant to be a meaningful service to Parliament and the public. It is a way to find out how/why the PM and his Government make decisions on our behalf. The way the PM regularly treats PMQs is an insult to those he is supposed to serve and further undermines trust in the political system. Politics/politicians already have a bad enough name. Since the UK Government and Parliament apparently can't force the PM to take PMQs seriously, it has become largely redundant and best get scrapped.",
        "background": "Over the years PMQs has degenerated into a farcical event where the PM hardly answers questions seriously anymore. Instead we are weekly being treated to a cheap pantomime performance where petty point scoring, bad jokes and deflection has become the norm. Please end our suffering - scrap PMQs.",
