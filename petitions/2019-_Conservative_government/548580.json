        "action": "Add British Sign Language to the secondary school curriculum and offer BSL GCSE",
        "additional_details": "Being able to communicate effectively using British Sign Language is a great addition to CVs and will enhance employment opportunities. More importantly, people who are mute or hard of hearing needlessly struggle with day to day life because there is no working knowledge of Sign Language amongst the general population. Bringing BSL into the curriculum is a first step towards levelling the playing field when it comes to opportunities for those with disabilities.",
        "background": "I propose that government draft a bill adding British Sign Language to the compulsory (KS3) curriculum to be taught at Level 2 alongside commonplace subjects such as History and Geography. A GCSE level British Sign Language qualification should be widely introduced, equivalent to BSL Level 5.",
