However, it seems the Government plans to dismiss these findings. The Government must respect these results, for progressive but also democratic reasons, and look to improve the rights of trans Britains.",

The results showed the public are in favour of improved rights for trans people, which should be acted on. This also sets a dangerous precedent for the Government dismissing results it does not agree with.",
