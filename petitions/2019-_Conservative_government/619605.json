        "additional_details": "The British people are tired of being exploited. It is a complete waste of an applicants time to have to contact a company and get to an interview stage before the other shoe drops. They should be able to decide whether or not to apply for a job based on its salary. Some job adverts do not state a salary at all. Its time employers wake up to why people don't want to work for them. Wages are already too low in the UK, the cost of living is high, and this practice just makes it more difficult.",
