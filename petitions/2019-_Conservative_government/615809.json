        "additional_details": "If pet foods stated the ingredients in full and stated the allergens on them such as chicken, beef and dairy, then it would save pets from having allergic reactions to a food their owner thought was safe.  \"animal derivatives\" isnt clearly stating what that includes. Animals suffer because of allergens not being stated. All pet food should state full ingredients to prevent this and help owners understand what they are feeding their pets without the worry of over spending on hypoallergenic foods.",
        "background": "I want allergens to be written on pet food, many dogs are allergic to certain foods and hypoallergenic isn't affordable for everyone. If foods stated exactly what was in them like human food does, it would save unnecessary suffering from allergic reactions to animals.",
