        "additional_details": "Secondary schools currently are not permitted by law to include Drama in their KS3 curriculum, meaning that across England there are young people who are missing out on the wealth of benefits that engaging in a Drama curriculum can bring. \r\nRegular participation in Drama not only develops key life skills including confidence, empathy, problem-solving, leadership and many more, but is proven to have a positive impact on the mental health of young people.",
        "background": "Currently, Drama is not on the National Curriculum for Secondary Schools. This petition aims to encourage the Government to discuss this matter in Parliament, with the intention of adding Drama on to the current National Curriculum for Secondary Schools.",
