        "action": "Abolish the compulsory requirement to include calorie labelling on all menus",
        "additional_details": "With up to a 3.4million (DIAGNOSED) people currently suffering from an eating disorder in the UK, the inclusion of calories on all menus would be insanely detrimental. With 20% of those with anorexia nervosa dying within the first year of diagnosis, the active encouragement of calorie counting is frightfully dangerous. Obesity is a complex disorder that the government should tackle comprehensively, not by shifting responsibility through putting the onus on individuals.",
        "background": "The government plans to introduce calorie labelling on all menus in major cafes, restaurants and takeaways from April 2022. This MUST NOT happen. The consequences will be disastrous. Claiming to tackle obesity, research proves that calories do not necessarily equate to health.",
