        "additional_details": "The 'Future Fit' hospital reconfiguration project has proved controversial and has been inundated with challenge. There have been reports of a leaked document revealing that the initial estimated cost of \u00a3312m for the reconfiguration has risen to \u00a3498m.\r\n \r\nAn end is nowhere to be seen; meanwhile there is growing tension and unease between neighbouring communities and A&E services in Shropshire are at breaking point. This solution is ideal, making sense geographically and will put an end to uncertainty.",
