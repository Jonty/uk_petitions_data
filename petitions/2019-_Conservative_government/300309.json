        "additional_details": "The 'Future Fit' hospital reconfiguration project has proved controversial and has been inundated with challenge. There have been reports of a leaked document revealing that the initial estimated cost of \u00a3312m for the reconfiguration has risen to \u00a3498m.\r\n \r\nAn end is nowhere to be seen; meanwhile there is growing tension and unease between neighbouring communities and A&E services in Shropshire are at breaking point. This solution is ideal, making sense geographically and will put an end to uncertainty.",
        "background": "This petition calls on the Government to provide funding and the go-ahead for the building of a new hospital off the M54 motorway between Shrewsbury and Telford capable of providing accident and emergency services for the entirety of Shropshire and mid Wales.",
