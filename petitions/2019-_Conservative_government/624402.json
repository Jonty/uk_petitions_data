        "additional_details": "To meet demand, around 90% of the honey we eat in the UK is imported. There is legitimate concern among UK beekeepers and honey producers about honey imports from countries where honey may be adulterated on an industrial scale. This can significantly impact the perceived value of honey in the consumer\u2019s eye and result in unfair economic competition against UK producers. Labelling with full country of origin would enable consumers to choose honey from sources where adulteration is less likely.",
        "background": "Currently the country of origin on labels can be replaced, if the honey originates from multiple countries, with \u2018blend of EU/non-EU/EU and non-EU honeys\u2019. We believe this is insufficient to allow consumers to make an informed choice. All countries where the honey originated should be listed.",
