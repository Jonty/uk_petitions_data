We believe there is still too much priority given to motorised traffic in urban spaces over people. This can make travelling as a non-motorised user more inconvenient and give rise to a perception of inferiority from those on the footway. Many push-button crossings are simply not utilised as intended because they take too long to activate, or are activated and not used when intended. This can also create a safety risk at crossings.\r\n",
