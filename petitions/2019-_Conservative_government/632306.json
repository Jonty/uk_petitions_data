Furthermore, no vegetation can be planted as the ground is filled with hardcore. \r\n2) The decking created a space to celebrate events, bringing guests to the area who will need accommodation and boosting local businesses. \r\n3) The company invested a lot of money in the build of this deck and should it be removed it would seriously impact the business recovery after the pandemic.\r\n4)The deck does not encroach on any public footpath.",
