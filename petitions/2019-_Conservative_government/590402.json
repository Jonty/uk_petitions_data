        "additional_details": "We have removed masks from classrooms and we are in the process of removing bubbles and close contact isolation.  This leaves schools with no mitigation measures in place except for test to enable using the Innova Lateral Flow Tests which are not fit for this purpose (stated in the manufacturer\u2019s literature).  We would like children over the age of 12 to be offered a Covid vaccine and allocated funding to improve the ventilation in every classroom that needs it.",
        "background": "We all want our children to be able to resume their education without any more disruption and as safely as possible.  The two most effective mitigation measures are improved ventilation in classrooms and vaccination.  It is time that these were offered to our schoolchildren.",
