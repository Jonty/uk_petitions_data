        "additional_details": "Why? Because people who suffer from anaphylaxis do not have a choice. If they don't carry their Epipens with them, everywhere, they can die if they come into contact with the food or other things that cause the life-threatening problem. Epipens usually have to be replaced annually, and it is usual that a user needs at least four Epipens to ensure that two are with them at all times and two are at their workplace. Some users also need to have an additional two Epipens at home as well.",
        "background": "Many people are able to access vital life-saving drugs for free on the NHS, such as drugs for diabetes. Anaphylaxis sufferers have to carry an Epipen throughout their life. This is undoubtedly a life-saving medication and we believe it should be free to anaphylaxis suffers.",
