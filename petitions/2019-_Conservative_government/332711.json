        "additional_details": "We believe the proposals from Highways England for Junction 10 of the A3/M25 are flawed because an Alternative has not been considered, and that the DCOs scheme unnecessarily threatens the environment including the future of RHS Garden Wisley. The proposals would put the RHS under huge financial burden; the increased journey time to the Garden could lose the RHS \u00a36.6m during the construction period & lead to a loss of \u00a319.2m over 10-years. The Garden risks the loss of 44 ancient trees on the boundary of RHS Wisley.",

Urges the Secretary of State to adopt the Alternative Scheme advocated by the RHS to protect the local environment and RHS Garden Wisley.",
