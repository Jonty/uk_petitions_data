        "action": "Ban Face Coverings in Shops in the UK (Except for Medical Grounds)",
        "additional_details": "It is well known that face coverings allow people to hide their identities, allowing them to harm others without the victims identifying them. Even if someone doesn't wear a face covering, if a person they intend to communicate with wears one it makes communication difficult (in some cases, impossible). The face is used in lip reading and British Sign Language. Tests have shown the importance of seeing the mouth for correct communication. Face masks also muffle sounds. Ban face covers in shops.",
        "background": "To safeguard the vulnerable, ban the use of face coverings in shops in the UK. Face covers allow criminals to hide their identities, create a placebo effect, people think they don't need to cover their mouth if they cough, and make lip reading and BSL (which utilises facial expressions) impossible",
