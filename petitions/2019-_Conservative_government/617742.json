        "additional_details": "Bullying in schools is an ongoing serious issue which leads to long term behavioural difficulties, mental health difficulties and suicide. These problems also follow children into adulthood if not effectively resolved at the earliest convenience. Many schools do not have systems in place that adequately protect and prevent children from bullying even if they have an anti bullying policy in place. Many schools fail on their requirements to safeguard bullied children as a result.",
        "background": "Introduce a statuary anti bullying policy to effectively tackle bullying that all schools must abide by, that must address key issues parents report as failings from schools when they've reported bullying. This should be in line with mandatory training to teaching staff on how to tackle bullying.",
