There has been a number of examples of them raising their own prices for events like Beyonce to unaffordable prices. Ticketmaster have cornered the events market and created a monopoly to the point they have become the touts so much work went into curbing. Laws need to be passed to make it fair for the consumer once again.",

They charge what they want and raise prices on a whim to extortionate rates. This is not fair on the fans or artists. We need laws to keep it fair.",
