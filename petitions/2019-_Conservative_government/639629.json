        "additional_details": "Shorts should be allowed on building sites for a variety of reasons. Firstly, working on a building site can be a physically demanding job, and during hot weather conditions, wearing long trousers can cause discomfort and even pose a health risk. This is because long trousers can restrict airflow and cause excessive sweating, which can lead to dehydration and heat stroke. Allowing workers to wear shorts can help to prevent these issues and ensure that they are able to work safely and comfortably",
        "background": "wearing shorts can improve worker productivity. Research has shown that workers who are comfortable in their clothing are more likely to be productive and perform better on the job. Allowing workers to wear shorts can help to improve their morale and job satisfaction,",
