This is all usually done by exam boards and PAID examiners (only some exam boards have paid furlough to their examiners)\r\n\r\nSchool staff are used to being under funded and unappreciated but to be paying exam boards so that we can do their job for them is simply unacceptable. \r\n\r\nReturn exam board fees to the schools to pay for the reprographics bill, increased staff workload and more.",
