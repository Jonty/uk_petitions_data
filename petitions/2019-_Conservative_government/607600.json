        "additional_details": "The new changes to the Highway code have put drivers on the road at an even lower position on the priority hierarchy. Given that the roads are predominantly for motorists, why is it that cars and other motor vehicles that use the roads find themselves in a position of inferiority when it comes to driving on the roads of the UK. New rules such as having to give way to pedestrians crossing junctions, not only lack common-sense but have real consequences that put the safety of pedestrians at harm.",
