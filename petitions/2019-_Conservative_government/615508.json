        "additional_details": "The new calorie legislation has potentially harmful effects. Though the dangers of obesity are well understood, the requirement for calories to be on menus is not the solution to the problem. For those who have struggled or are struggling with eating disorders, the law makes what should be a enjoyable event stressful and a reminder of these struggles. Furthermore, the assertion that a food is more healthy due to it having less calories is flawed; there is more to food than calorific content.",
        "background": "Calories should not be displayed on menus. Menus with calories on them should be a choice, with restaurants obliged to be able to provide them - but non-calorie menus should remain the default.",
