        "additional_details": "This cost is crippling to many families who are above the cut off for help and grants. We live in a rural area and other than parents taking children to school themselves there is no other way to get to and from school.\r\n \r\nWhen it is compulsory for 16-18 year olds to stay in full-time education (if they are not on an apprenticeship, traineeship, or volunteering) it is wrong that parents have to pay for school transport. This should be free.",
        "background": "School transport is free for students aged 16 and under where they live a certain distance from school, but for 17 and 18 year olds many local authorities require parents to pay for this, which can cost hundreds of pounds a year.",
