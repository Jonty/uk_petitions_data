We live in a rural area and other than parents taking children to school themselves there is no other way to get to and from school.\r\n \r\nWhen it is compulsory for 16-18 year olds to stay in full-time education (if they are not on an apprenticeship, traineeship, or volunteering) it is wrong that parents have to pay for school transport. This should be free.",
