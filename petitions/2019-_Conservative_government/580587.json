        "additional_details": "The shocking decline in the number of rape and other sexual offence prosecutions is a National Emergency. Convictions too often result in lenient punishments. Confidence in the police and process from many victims is particularly low. For the number of rapes and sexual offences reported, larger numbers are not reported in part due to lack of confidence in the police and justice system. Unless CPS referral has been made, a victim's right to review request is considered by another police officer of the same force, albeit one who is independent of the case. This is a concern for victims. ",
