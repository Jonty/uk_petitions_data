        "additional_details": "I am personally affected because I own a car that I only drive on the weekends, as I work from home and own another vehicle for commuting. It is ridiculous that I have to pay \u00a3630 per year to drive a car once a weekend. This is more than my car insurance. Why is this tax not based on mileage? I am tired of being told how much tax is with no explanation.\r\n \r\nLinking road tax to mileage would also mean there were financial incentives for using a car less, which could help reduce emissions.",
        "background": "I want the Government to change the Road tax to a mileage system. This tax should reflect the emissions that the car gives out. If I use a car once a week, I'm using less emissions than somebody using it every day, so why am I paying the same amount of road tax?",
