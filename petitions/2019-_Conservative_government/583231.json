This includes, in the most serious circumstances, powers for dogs to be removed or destroyed: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/control-dogs\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for changes to these powers, or new requirements being placed on local councils or other authorities, but it would need to be clear exactly what changes you wanted.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
