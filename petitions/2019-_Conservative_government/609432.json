        "additional_details": "Because if funding is stopped at this time, there is a real danger that services will be reduced or axed. This will impact on many people who are dependant on buses to get to work, do shopping or get to healthcare appointments - including many older people who have stopped driving. It will impact rural areas, and less well off people - and it could increase car use and therefore carbon emissions. More time is needed to encourage people back to public transport.",
        "background": "Do not stop  emergency funding for bus services at the end of March, extend it further to give more time for people to regain their confidence to use public transport. Concurrently run a campaign to encourage people to use buses",
