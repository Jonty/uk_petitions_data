        "additional_details": "We have watched loved ones suffer and die, early and painfully, we believe due to Big Tobacco's use of addiction over the years to take away choice and profit immensely at the expense of people's health and lives, and of the UK and wider world's societal well-being. Some of us are dealing with the same horrendous outcomes in our own health and lives, or, having quit, are fearful of the impacts we have stored up for our later lives due to the number of pack years we accumulated before quitting. We believe it is high time for the UK Parliament to show the resolve and moral courage to excise this societal cancer once and for all from the UK, setting a strong example for the rest of the world.",
