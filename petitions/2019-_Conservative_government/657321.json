        "additional_details": "I wish for the Government to outlaw the use of AI-generated technology, as I am concerned that artists, musicians or voice actors face the possibility of being completely replaced by an AI. \r\n\r\nThe Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) has agreed a deal was made allowing the use of AI-generated voices to be used in the video game medium, before, during or after final development. We are concerned this will mean that voice actors could fail to get a role due to AI.",
        "background": "AI software can generate images very similar to how a human would draw an image themselves, and generate voice recordings that sound like natural human speech. I wish for the use of such technology to be banned.",
