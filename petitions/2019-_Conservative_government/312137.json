        "additional_details": "The NHS is currently facing an unprecedented demand with the COVID 19 pandemic. It is evident from examples of other countries that COVID 19 has had a major impact on the health of the care workers and putting their lives at risk.  \r\nThe NHS workers are supporting the country and the governments effort to fight COVID 19 and hence I would request the government to support the families of these workers in the case of them having to make the ultimate sacrifice.",
        "background": "Many in the NHS workforce are doctors/nurses on a work visa. The rule states, if the main applicant dies the dependents not granted ILR and would have to return to their own country. I would want the government to grant ILR/Citizenship to the family members if NHS worker dies of COVID 19.",
