        "additional_details": "The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted to record numbers of essential frontline workers either calling in sick or self-isolating in accordance to public health procedures. Migrant workers who are willing to put in more work hours than normally allowed in order to maintain staffing numbers should not be restricted to do so by the terms of their visa. This is, ultimately, for the benefit of the public.",
        "background": "Many migrant workers are subject to limitations in their visa on the number of hours they can work, and will be in breach of their visa if they exceed these. During these times the Government should extend leniency to migrant workers and suspend these limitations.",
