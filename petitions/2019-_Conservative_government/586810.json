Children at 11/12 are far more aware and can discuss their results with their peers, which can perpetuate the problem further. I believe this scheme does more harm than good.\r\n \r\nGiven the impact the pandemic has had on children\u2019s health, action needs to be taken to protect the mental health of children.",
        "background": "Children in Reception and Year 6 currently have their height and weight recorded by school nurses to check whether their BMI is over or under weight. They then receive a letter home for additional help with this. I believe this scheme is detrimental to children\u2019s mental health.",
