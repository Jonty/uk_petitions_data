Patients experience chronic pain, nerve damage, partial bowel removal, bladder dysfunction and a long list of other associated complications. By suspending mesh rectopexy and undertaking a retrospective investigation there would be better understanding of its long term risks.",
        "background": "We ask that a halt be put on mesh rectopexy in order for its complication rates be more understood. There has been a  distinct lack of data over the last 20 years due to no clinical code. There needs to be retrospective investigation and the procedure be suspended until true figures can be audited",
