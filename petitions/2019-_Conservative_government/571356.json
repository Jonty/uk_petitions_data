        "additional_details": "Since the UK is no longer included in the margin scheme, a pre-owned item selling for \u00a315k would now attract VAT in the EU.\r\n\r\nSince all remaining 27 member states of the EU still offer the margin scheme, a customer buying the aforementioned item from any trader based in the EU will pay around \u00a316k for the watch, but a UK-based business selling to an EU-based customer would have to charge C\u00a318k, therefore ruling out trade of 2nd hand goods with the EU and potentially forcing businesses into bankruptcy.",
        "background": "We want Government to agree with the EU to re-instate the Marginal VAT scheme for second hand goods between the EU and the UK. \r\n\r\nBusinesses trading in second hand goods are being hit with a change in taxation rules that puts UK-based operations at a massive disadvantage to competitors in the EU.",
