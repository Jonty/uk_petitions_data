They are exposed to threats of violence, face violence, verbal assault and assault on a daily basis. Yet security officers are so under paid that our retail workers, cleaning assistants and many other sectors are paid much more! Why? The wages do no justice. Others on the front line our police force, fire fighters and paramedics are on far better salaries than security",
