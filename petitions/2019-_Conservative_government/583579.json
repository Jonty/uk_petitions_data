        "additional_details": "Periods are something that can't be odds. There isn't a way around them, with most women starting their period at age 12 and not going through menopause until they are around 50. Meaning they have to pay for period supplies for a lot of their life, with sometimes not being in a great financial situation or dont want to ask their parents for the money to buy them the things that they need.",
        "background": "Help everyone by making period products free or having a national maximum price on them as some people aren't in a good financial situation to buy them for example, the homeless. This would make women feel more comfortable in the world that they live in.",
