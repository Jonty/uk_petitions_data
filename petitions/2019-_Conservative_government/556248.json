        "additional_details": "I want the Government to do this as there are loads of children that need help with food and nutrition and who are not in receipt of free school meals. This will help them with a healthy boost to their lifestyle and diet. A little help all year round for all children so none are suffering in silence would be better than a little support over school holidays for only a proportion of the children needing help. These vouchers won't end child poverty but they will be a step in the right direction.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to extend its Healthy Start Vouchers for fruit, vegetables and vitamins to all primary school children. I grew up on Free School Meals and this would help provide families with healthy snacks and meals in term time and out of term time too.",
