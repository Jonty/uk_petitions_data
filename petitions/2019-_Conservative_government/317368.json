        "action": "That the Government extends the EU withdrawal transition by a further two years",
        "additional_details": "This is not a petition to alter the ultimate purpose of the Withdrawal Act. It is simply a recognition of the unnecessary damage to the rebuilding of the UK economy that will be caused by the current transition period ending in the next few months. The potential reduction in GDP that HM Treasury already acknowledges as a result of even a satisfactory leaving deal did not even countenance the dire prospects with which the UK and the world are now faced.",
        "background": "As a matter of urgency:\r\n1. Consult with all necessary states and parties on the proposed extension.\r\n2. Ensure appropriate amendments to EU Withdrawal Act 2020 are passed by Parliament.\r\n3. Ensure no action is taken in the interim to frustrate the purpose of this petition.",
