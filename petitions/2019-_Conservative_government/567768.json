        "additional_details": "Students at specialist universities can't access fundamental facilities such as wood workshops, 3D printers or kilns. The amount and level of work being produced isn't up to standard as the facilities cannot be accessed and students don't have enough space (e.g. producing in studio flats). Students doing sandwich years are paying \u00a31850 for even more reduced teaching and cannot find internships. Contact hours are reduced, there's limited access to libraries and pre-recording prevents questions.",
