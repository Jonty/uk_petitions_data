        "additional_details": "In the UK today there is a huge national shortage of LGV (Large goods vehicle) drivers. This is one of the effects of Brexit as many European drivers are now no longer able to work in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the Covid virus has seen many Coach and bus operators cease trading with the consequent loss of many bus and coach drivers jobs. \r\n\r\nIf successful this petition will allow the thousands of drivers who lost their job during this crisis to seek alternative work within the UK haulage industry. \r\n\r\nThe benefits being that the current LGV driver shortage would be significantly reduced and that drivers who are currently seeking welfare payments will no longer have to do so.",
        "background": "That the Government should grant category C entitlement for all current holders of class D licences.\r\n\r\nBoth classes of vehicles are similar in weight and size, laden and unladen, and the current certificate of professional competence is valid for both.",
