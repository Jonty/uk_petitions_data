        "additional_details": "Daylight saving time is unnatural. It is known to have more unintentional negatives than intentional positives, particularly for health reasons because an artificial alteration of time, even by a single hour, is shown to be harmful and detrimental, especially to those with mental health issues. It serves no practical or logical purpose.",
        "background": "Natural solar time (IE: GMT) matters - for eons, man has been in sync with the Earth's rotation, and disrupting this carefully concocted balance also disrupts the natural lunar calendar of the year as well as the Gregorian calendar, giving summer an extremely unfair advantage.",
