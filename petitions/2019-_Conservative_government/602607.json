The Gov. must recognise the life & death consequences of continuing to fund animal-based research for humans; that we have entered the era of personalised medicine & immediately ban all animal tests, to free up funding for relevant human-based studies.",

The Gov. must recognise this evidence, ban these cruel animal experiments & redirect all Gov. funding to human-based methods, such as gene-based medicine. ",
