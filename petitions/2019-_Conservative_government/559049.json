        "additional_details": "Each year London uses tax payers money to fund the New Year Eve celebrations where fireworks are set off at the end.. Fireworks cause environmental damage and noise pollution.  Ten minutes enjoyment from looking in the sky to the hours and sometimes years of misery people  and animals have to endure where they've been maimed by a firework is not worth it.",
        "background": "I want fireworks made obsolete.. They have no place in society in 2020.. They cause immense suffering to millions of pets and farm animals throughout the United Kingdom from the noise and hundreds of animals and people are maimed or killed every year from fireworks deliberately being thrown.",
