        "additional_details": "I own a training academy and have seen over the years that salons are popping up all over the UK, too many with staff not having the correct qualifications and severely hurting their clients. The standards and health & safety can be non-existent and it is become a laughing stock. There have been reports of nail bars using illegal products, brow bars burning clients, under 16s receiving treatment without consent, and clients not signing waivers. We need to put a 1-5 rating in place to keep clients safe.",
        "background": "I want the Government to introduce an inspection regime for aesthetic services such as salons so they are vetted. These inspections should inform a health and safety rating that must be displayed before the business can open & trade, similar to the ratings displayed in restaurants. ",
