I'm a qualified Police Firearms Instructor, but I can't apply to join the police because I've lived in the US for the last 20 years. I have worked in the US & UAE training Police Officers, and completed background checks within 1 month of living in those countries, but I can't work in my own country. The Government should review these barriers to entry, and work with law enforcement bodies to remove these.",
        "background": "I'm calling for the Government to commission a review into barriers to entry to the police as a result of residing outside the UK, and in particular requirements for recruits to have been resident in the UK for three years, which unfairly prevents many qualified persons from joining the police.",
