        "additional_details": "Long distance relationships are just as valid, if not more serious than physical relationships. Why would we make the effort, despite constantly missing each other, to keep on being together and spend thousands on travel back and forth to see each other? \r\nThe Government should allow travelling for the reason of being with a long distance partner, even if there is a lockdown or restrictions, because some people may wait years to see the ones they love if there aren\u2019t changes.",
        "background": "I have been in a long distance relationship with my partner from Holland for two and a half years. I haven\u2019t seen him since last Christmas because of travel restrictions, and because my type of relationship isn\u2019t taken seriously I may not see him for years depending on Covid travel restrictions.",
