BAME men, women, teens and children are being physically assaulted and, in some cases, killed.\r\n \r\nFurthermore, there has been widespread racial abuse directed towards sports people in England, which is out of order.\r\n \r\nUs BAME men, women, teens and kids should not have to live in fear.\r\n \r\nSo, instead of simply condemning racism, the Government needs to take action as condemning does not mean a thing.",
