At least they can fix a price or set a reasonable price range for some of these basic foods. This means some companies will make less profit but they will help their customers. With the current situation vulnerable people are walking further to find available or cheaper food because of their budgets or availability of foods. With this solution they can go to nearer shops and spend less time outside. Thank you all",
