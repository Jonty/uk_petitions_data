These outcomes are not the dog\u2019s fault and the impact it has for others that come into contact with them. People need to stop using their dogs as weapons or be punished like they have used a weapon or committed the physical crime as if it were themselves doing the damage or causing a death. Stop blaming the wrong end of the lead.",

I would like owners to be charged with the crime of  their dogs actions if found to be not out of self defence or unprovoked.",
