        "additional_details": "It is 2020. Same sex Marriage/Civil Partnerships are legal. The law should be brought up to date to include the grounds for Adultery.\r\nIt is disgraceful that a woman who is in a Civil Partnership can have an 'affair' with another woman and this is not considered Adultery as she is the same sex! If she did the same with a man it would be considered Adultery. Where is the justice in that?",
        "background": "I want the law changing to be the same as a Marriage between a Man and a Woman.\r\nRight now, in 2020 a couple in a same sex Marriage/ Civil Partnership cannot file on grounds of Adultery if the other person is the same sex as the 'Adulterer'.",
