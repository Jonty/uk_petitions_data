There is now a new variant of the COVID virus which has a 50% - 70% faster spread. Keeping schools open will only hasten the spread of the virus. The COVID fatality rate of children are not as high as opposed to adults and because the majority of children/young people aged 10-21 are asymptomatic to the virus they are more likely to pass it onto their families and spread the disease further.",
