        "additional_details": "While the risk of transmission of Covid-19 through a takeaway meal is lower than sitting down in a restaurant, it's still a real risk, especially to workers who often cook in very confined spaces. \r\n\r\nFurthermore it sends the wrong message for people to take the lockdown seriously if fast food outlets, which are clearly nonessential, are allowed to remain open.\r\n\r\nIf it's not safe for children to go to school then it's not safe to work in or order from fast food at this time.",
        "background": "Mandate that fast food outlets close completely including for takeaways during the new lockdown period.",
