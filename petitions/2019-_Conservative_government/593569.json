They are of major cultural significance and should be freely available for all to watch. Inspiring healthy active lifestyles is very important in the UK and part of strategic preventive health. Viewing the delayed 2020 Olympics has been severely affected by the licensing arrangements made for these games.",

This could include lobbying the IOC, ensuring major UK broadcasters are supported financially and negotiating with host countries.",
