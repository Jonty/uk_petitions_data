        "additional_details": "The government needs to enforce a return to normal for GPs. They are not over run with work and it is vital for people\u2019s health to restart normal service.  It is impossible to give a correct diagnosis when you fail to physically examine a patient and illnesses are being misdiagnosed and people are dying needlessly.  There is no genuine reason why surgeries can not open normally, we the people are paying for a service which we are no longer getting as it is not fit for purpose anymore.",
        "background": "Force GP\u2019s to return to work.  Dentists have been working normally for months now, even Vets are carrying out face to face appts.  Many serious illnesses are being missed due to lack of proper examinations.  Phone consultations do not work for many illnesses we must get back to normal to save lives",
