        "additional_details": "Currently drivers must have passed a test for a C1 licence (largely for rigid HGVs) before taking the test to get a C1E licence (for articulated vehicles). Drivers should only be required to take one test for a C1E licence, and grants should provided to anyone who wants to apply for this licence, to help reduce the shortage of drivers in the country.\r\n \r\nIt can cost up to \u00a33,000 to do all the training to become a fully qualified HGV driver. This burden should be reduced.",
        "background": "The Government should scrap the test for the C1 licence so people can apply directly for a C1E licence. The Government should also provide grants to people taking the C1E test to fill the gap for HGV driver shortage in the UK.",
