        "additional_details": "There are approximately 10,400 people in the UK living with cystic fibrosis. These individuals could benefit immensely from these modular drugs but may not be able to access them because of financial constraints imposed by our healthcare system.\r\n\r\nWe believe that denying access to a treatment that could significantly improve and extend lives based on cost alone is unjust!",
        "background": "Life-changing and potentially life-lengthening drugs are at risk of being pulled from the NHS by December due to their high cost\r\n\r\nWe urge the NHS and relevant decision makers to reconsider this stance. Ensure these effective modular drugs remain accessible for all those living with cystic fibrosis",
