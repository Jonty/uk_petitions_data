        "additional_details": "I believe that the government should prevent  raising tution fees for university students as it would have a detrimental effect, as already many of the educated workforce leaves Northern Ireland to the UK mainland and stays. With prices being the same even more would leave Northern Ireland and effecting the workforce and the economy.\r\nThe government/minister should prevent this from happening.",
        "background": "With there being no Northern Ireland executive the NI secretary of state Chris Heaton-Harris is expected to set the budget. With the executive loosing \u00a3700 million a year the minister is considering raising student tuition fees for students in Northern Ireland from \u00a34,710 to between \u00a37,200 and \u00a39,25",
