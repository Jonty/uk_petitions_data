        "action": "Stop blocking the COVID vaccine patent/IP waiver",
        "additional_details": "The reduced vaccination rates in low-income nations are directly impacting an underprivileged population, and fueling new variants due to the widespread infection rates amongst the people. This IP waiver would enable countries to develop their own vaccine, and allow other organisations to support vaccine development and administration in low income nations. The UK should fall on the right side of history, in line with other nations such as the USA, which has an even larger pharmaceutical sector.",
        "background": "I would like the government to stop supporting the pharmaceutical industry in maintaining market exclusivity for what is a global humanitarian issue. There should be a global IP waiver in place to help other countries develop their own vaccine.",
