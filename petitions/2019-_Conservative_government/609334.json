        "additional_details": "Rishi Sunak's announcement in the Budget brings e-books into line with physical books, which are already exempt from VAT.\r\n\r\nAt this time, audiobooks will continue to be charged VAT.\r\n\r\nGiven that many people with print impairment can only access literature via audiobooks, charging VAT for Audiobooks is unfair and discriminatory.\r\nThe ability to access books, regardless of format, is one that can only improve literacy in individuals, thereby developing knowledge and potential.",
        "background": "Calling on the Government to extend the removal of VAT on e-books  to include audiobooks, in both physical and digital formats.\r\n \r\nWe are therefore asking that the additional 20 percent cost barrier for access to Audiobooks be removed, bringing them into line with other physical books and e-books.",
