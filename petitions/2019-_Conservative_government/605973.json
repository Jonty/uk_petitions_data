Modern technology makes it unnecessary for these pupils to physically be in the classroom. Children who have been under medical professionals who believe it is in their best interests to not go into the physical classroom should be allowed to remote learn at home. There should be no fines or prosecution for parent / carers of approved remote learners. Live one to one tutors can ensure child protection.",
