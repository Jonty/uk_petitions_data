As well as this Asylum seekers receive \u00a339.63 per week which is \u00a35.64 a day. This amount is not enough for them to afford food, sanitation and clothing everyday, especially in the face of rising costs of living.\r\n \r\nThe human rights of these asylum seekers must be respected, and changing the support they receive should help achieve this.\r\n",

This should include regular inspections of housing to ensure living conditions are acceptable.",
