        "additional_details": "Current year 12s got their GCSEs altered; they can't be doing A-levels when they didn't get to experience official GCSEs. I strongly feel that year 10s shouldn't be doing GCSEs when they missed out many topics in years 8 and 9 due to covid. From science practicals, drama, IT, food technology, PE, music, computer science, english and even languages.",
        "background": "Parliament should consider how current year 12 and 10s have been effected from covid within schools. As we all know, covid has been a disruption to learning and I firmly feel that year 12 and 10s need adaptions on their 2023 exams as they have not had all the lessons that they need for the exams.",
