        "additional_details": "The lives of so many couples have been on hold. Wedding preparation is stressful at the best of times, but has been taken to another level with this added uncertainty. We can now hug. We can go out for dinner. We are slowly re-opening sports events. Surely by using proof of vaccine and rapid testing, we can start to remove social distancing & have dancing whilst offering other guests/venues/service providers a level of assurance. Please give couples & families the chance to celebrate properly",

Make those who are planning the wedding responsible for requesting guests to be tested/show proof of vaccine and for ensuring results are returned before wedding.",
