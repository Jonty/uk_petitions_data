        "additional_details": "I appreciate the need for rapid government response e.g.,   quarantine rules and Stamp Duty Land Tax. I also appreciate that exceptions from quarantine rules cannot be expanded retrospectively, or changes to extend the SDLT relief retrospectively would inevitably lead to similar borderline cases. I however do believe that when government encourages travel, property purchase, etc., any sudden decision could disadvantage people with no prior knowledge who have followed official signals.",
