        "additional_details": "By providing CCTV, when there is ever a situation in question- we can review the footage and understand scenarios in which are very one sided when special needs children do not always have the ability to report something inappropriate, or explain their side of story-should an incident occur. Unfortunately some people are not always honest, kind, or have the training to be transporting SEN children. This puts our vulnerable children at risk.",
        "background": "Our vulnerable children are often transported to school via transport arranged through the council. No cameras are onboard to not only ensure the safety of those onboard, but to go back and review in situations where our children can\u2019t not speak, report, or defend themselves",
