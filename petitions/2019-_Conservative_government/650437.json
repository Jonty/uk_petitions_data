        "additional_details": "By requiring CCTV, whenever there is a situation in question - the footage can be reviewed so the situation can be better understood. Children with special educational needs may not report something inappropriate, or be able to explain their side of story, should an incident occur. Unfortunately some people are not always honest or kind, which can put children with special educational needs at risk.",
        "background": "Children with special educational needs are often transported to school via transport arranged through the council. We want cameras onboard to help ensure the safety of those onboard, and allow for the review of incidents involving students who may not be able to speak, report, or defend themselves.",
