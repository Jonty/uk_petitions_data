        "additional_details": "This needs to be taken seriously as poor grades will impede on our future. Evidence suggests that it is harder to recall information in a place dissimilar to where you learned it. This situation is incomparable to any other generation. It is still a priority to learn content for further education - that is if we are accepted with the grades we achieve due to these circumstances. Students will have to put in double the amount of effort for their grades to possibly not reflect their true potential",
        "background": "It is difficult to assume that all students have learned this content in the same environment and with the same resources. Given this, exam results would be unfair and unreliable. Undue stress and pressure put on students due to under confidence in their knowledge will be reflected in their grades.",
