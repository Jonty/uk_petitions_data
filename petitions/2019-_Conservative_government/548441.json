Those who came from schools in low socioeconomic areas received grades which were significantly lower than the grades submitted by their schools. The current algorithm puts students in smaller classrooms, typically private schools, at an advantage.\r\n\r\nThe appeals process current puts students from the same institute in direct competition with each other. The system should not take opportunities from one student for another.",
