        "additional_details": "Coronavirus(COVID-19) is highly infectious and has a long incubation period, which means that one carrier can infect dozens of people before a diagnosis is made.\r\nThis virus can spread through droplets, aerosols, and contact, which means that public places like tubes, classrooms, offices and pubs are all great places for virus transmission. Based on China's experience and lessons, the government should ban people from going out as early as possible to prevent the virus from spreading more widely.",
        "background": "The government should order stopping school and office work,  and prohibit gatherings such as parties and performances to avoid the spread of the virus. Some study and office works can be done remotely from home instead, other works that must be on site can continue.",
