        "additional_details": "We believe many 'feudal' leaseholds and rented homes are managed by ruthless or incompetent freeholders/landlords/letting/managing agents. There is no legal requirement for them to regularly check standard of health and safety re. damp, plumbing and heating. Often people suffer from neglect in these areas when such neglect affects their properties: i.e.. leaks, damp/mould infestation. Poorly maintained empty properties can cause damage to those adjacent and letting agents can be ruthlessly indifferent. There should be legislation to enforce that freeholders, landlords and letting agents have to regularly inspect properties, so that issues can be identified and remedied.",
