This is easily preventable by fencing.    Some responsible farmers have taken the lead but many do not.  Indeed some farmers purposely put cattle on land as an antisocial fear tactic to force the disuse of existing rights of way.  This is both dangerous and totally unacceptable. The government tells us to walk more to get fit. This Law facilitates that.",
