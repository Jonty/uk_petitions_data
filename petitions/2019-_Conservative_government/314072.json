Patients are having to spend their last few hours alone and scared which is both tragic and avoidable. Not just for them, but for the family and loved ones as well. This is generic to everyone at this time and this small act would go a long way to unburdening all those affected by Covid-19 including NHS staff. This is regardless of age or gender but specifically towards children infected with Covid-19.",
        "background": "We want government to lift the restriction so that one family member or loved one can be present with a person suffering terminally from Covid-19 in their final hours. This way, those nearest and dearest can get some closure and comfort for the patient who otherwise would be scared and alone.",
