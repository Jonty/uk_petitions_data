Please sign this petition to prioritise pregnant women in line with all other clinically vulnerable groups.",
        "background": "Pregnant women are the only \"clinically vulnerable\" group who have not been prioritised for vaccination. Instead, they are being told to wait for their age. The majority of pregnant women are in younger age categories and many remain ineligible for the vaccine. This is unjust and discriminatory.",
