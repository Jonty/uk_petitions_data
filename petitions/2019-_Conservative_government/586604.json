        "additional_details": "Pregnant women are \"clinically vulnerable\" to COVID-19 (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-pregnant-employees/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-pregnant-employees). With the rise of the India variant, coupled with lockdown easing, this creates an extremely stressful situation for women who are ineligible for the vaccine due to their age. Please sign this petition to prioritise pregnant women in line with all other clinically vulnerable groups.",
        "background": "Pregnant women are the only \"clinically vulnerable\" group who have not been prioritised for the COVID-19 vaccine. Instead, they are being told to wait for their age. The majority of pregnant women are in younger age categories and remain ineligible for the vaccine. This is unjust and discriminatory.",
