        "additional_details": "A government press release stated all students could return to in person teaching on the 17th of may (Roadmap Step 3), but many universities are carrying on with restrictions into the new year for reasons unknown to anyone apart from saving money. \r\n\r\nLack of real in person teaching has made learning far harder and poorer quality, with many people paying \u00a39250 to be sent YouTube videos a few times a week.\r\nIt has also negatively affected the mental health of many students lacking social contact.",
        "background": "We want government and universities to acknowledge that students do not support the movement of teaching to a blended format with online lectures and activities.\r\nUniversities must work with and listen to students who are demanding not to use this format unless specifically told by the government.",
