        "additional_details": "Taking the best interest of students into account high schools and colleges across the UK have said that amidst this crisis no exams will be sat by students and grades will be provided. We believe we are owed the same curtesy.\r\nUniversity students lack support, guidance, loss of face to face lectures, facilities and supervision and are told to continue as normal. Not taking into account the affect that this issue may have on mental health as well as the results outcome for exams and assignments.",
        "background": "After paying over \u00a39k per annum university students should not be asked to sit exams and submit assignments with next to no support during the COVID-19 crisis. Not every student has the facilities to work from home and not every student has a good environment at home to focus on studying.",
