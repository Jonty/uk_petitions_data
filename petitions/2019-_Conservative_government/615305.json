        "additional_details": "Make it law for every citizen from age of 14 carry a national biometric national identity card. The ID cards should be used as proof of right to vote, proof of age and biometric identification. \r\n \r\nIdentity cards give a citizen the right to belong and a sense of belonging. If a person doesn't have their ID card with them, they should have their residency status checked and verified. This will make it harder for people without legitimate status to be in the UK.",
        "background": "Many countries across the world require citizens to carry an identity card. In the past one of the Government's reasons against mandatory ID was because of the cost. The government has funds to spend on other areas like weapons and securing our borders. Now is the time to act on funding ID cards.",
