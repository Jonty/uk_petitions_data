        "additional_details": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak has confirmed that the government's cut to foreign aid spending will continue until at least 2024. This breaks a pledge in the Conservative manifesto from 2019 and has led to warnings from aid agencies and opposition from MPs on both sides.\r\n\r\nForeign aid had been increasing over the years, in line with a commitment to meet a target of spending 0.7% of GNI.\r\nThe promise to meet this UN-backed target was enshrined into law in 2015.",
        "background": "The UK is lagging behind other G7 countries in sharing surplus Covid vaccines with poorer countries. This is shaming for the UK Government. The figures show that the UK is behind every member of the G7 \u2013 of which Britain is currently the chair \u2013 except for Japan. A debate in Parliament is necessary.",
