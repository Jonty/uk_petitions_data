        "additional_details": "Unfortunately, despite working tirelessly during the pandemic, we have been overlooked in the governments initiative. On behalf of third year students in my cohort, we will be attending our first posts as registered nurses\u2019 in April alongside nurses who will have received the bonus for a job that we have been doing un-paid. Many feel that we have been treated as free labour throughout the pandemic. We are not fighting for petty change, we want real change in the treatment of student nurses.",
        "background": "As part of our studies as student nurses, we are involved in 2,300 unpaid hours of clinical placements. Recently, the government announced a \u00a3500 bonus for healthcare workers amazing efforts throughout the pandemic. Student nurses are not included in this reward due to their super-numeracy status.",
