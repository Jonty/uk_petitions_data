        "additional_details": "We would like Parliament to consider the easing of golfing restrictions enough to allow players to play. The clubhouse should be closed, but the Professional should be allowed to open the course shop, so to police the footfall. \r\nThe idea would be for 2 balls to be allowed to book a Tee time with 15 minute intervals so that the players don\u2019t meet in the car park or around the course. \r\nThis would assist with the mental and physical health of many.",
        "background": "Allow a system during Covid19 lockdown, where 2 people can play at a time, on pre-booked Tee times, and the only function of the club would be to allow players to play. No ancillary services would be required at this point.",
