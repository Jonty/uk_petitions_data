        "additional_details": "BNO\u2019s who have fled Hong Kong  came to the UK for a better life for their children. Not all can afford annual fees upwards of \u00a315000. Higher Education fees in Hong Kong is just HK$ 4000+ per annum and govt loan is available. So how is it a better life for us in the UK if we can\u2019t give the best start in life for our children by providing a good education. These same children will end being UK citizens. Government funding in the form of student finance is helpful too.",
        "background": "We would like dependents of BNO visa holders who are pursuing Higher Education at universities to be granted Home Fee status. Government Funding in the form of student finance is also acceptable",
