        "additional_details": "The zoos will not be able to survive without visitors. There are no Covid safety issues to walking around the outdoor space at a zoo and more than a park or garden centre. The survival of zoos and conservation of endangered species relies heavily on zoos staying open. Keeping the zoos open for visitors to take their daily exercise will help visitors mental health and well being whilst also supporting the economy and the zoo itself.",
        "background": "Keep the outside part of zoos open during lockdown so that people can exercise outdoors (walking around the zoo) whilst supporting the zoo as a business and conservation programme. Zoos (Chester Zoo as an example) have acres of outdoor land to walk around and have proven social distancing measures.",
