It's not rocket science. If the UK government made this switch in its subsidies programme tomorrow, the carbon based giant producers would be holding top level meetings the following day to urgently change their policies to renewables. And it would be just as good for business. Thank you.",

The Government already provides funding for renewable generation, and it's not clear how you want this to change.\r\n\r\nWe can accept petitions calling for the Government to end financial suport for fossil fuels, although the Government says that it does give any subsidies to fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
