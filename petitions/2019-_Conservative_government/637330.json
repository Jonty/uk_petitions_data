        "additional_details": "It is apparent that students who attend private school often gain advantages that those who attend public school do not. I wish for everyone to have the same opportunities for educational excellence, so everyone can have equal chance to have a bright future and go to college and university if they want to. But in a public school this can be harder to achieve than for someone with a private education. Being able to pay for private education should not allow some students to gain additional advantages.",
        "background": "We want the Government to provide additional funding for public schools to improve the quality of education, facilities and food, so that students attending public schools do not lose out to those attending private schools.",
