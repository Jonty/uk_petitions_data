        "action": "Make Public Sexual Harassment a Criminal Offence in the UK",
        "additional_details": "The Government should be implementing laws to protect women and give them the confidence to report those who harass them in public; a law against public harassment will do this as it will empower victims of public harassment to report incidents, making the streets and public places a safer place for everyone. Public sexual harassment is extremely threatening and over 90% of women in the UK have experienced it so it is vital that we implement laws combating public sexual harassment!",
        "background": "At present women and girls feel unsafe walking the streets, during both the daytime and night time, due to unwanted harassment. The Government should be implementing laws to protect people when in public, as currently there are no specific laws or regulations against public sexual harassment.",
