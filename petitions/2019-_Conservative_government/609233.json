        "additional_details": "Protect the vulnerable as a \u2018strap line\u2019 needs to be continued. Family members who work are at greater risk of contracting Covid, and if asymptomatic, will have no way of knowing if they are passing onto a family member who it could kill. The duty of care is to protect these people, they will still remain in hiding when everyone else has freedom, the least we can do is protect them from the virus in their own homes.",
        "background": "The Government should continue Covid tests for families with vulnerable members. Many have kept loved ones alive for over two years with very careful management and isolation. Taking away tests for these families will surely cost lives, jobs, without any way of knowing how to protect them.",
