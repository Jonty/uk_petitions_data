        "additional_details": "Disposable BBQ's are responsible for many fires in the UK, in our local and national parks and areas of natural beauty. They are not actually very good at cooking and often used by people in an unsafe manner. They leave burns dotted about our green spaces that do not recover well as the soil is sterilised by the heat. They are often discarded thoughtlessly, while still alight, and create a significant hazard to wildlife and livestock. They also end up polluting rivers, lakes, fields and woods.",
