The Culture Secretary said the Government would \"put everything on the table to prevent this from happening.\"\r\n\r\nYou can read the Culture Secretary's full statement on the European Super League here: https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/statement-by-oliver-dowden-on-the-european-super-league\r\n\r\nSince you started your petition it has also been announced that all six Premier League teams that were initially involved in the European Super League have withdrawn.
