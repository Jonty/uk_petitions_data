        "additional_details": "Year 12s have missed 40% of the academic year and many students have struggled in lockdown, whether thats due to mental or physical health, not having a suitable environment, or the massive amount of content we have to learn. A-Levels are much harder than GCSEs and they are very important qualifications that we need for University or other pathways. Our results will be significantly impacted by this epidemic, and we need something to be done about it. WE need a say in what happens to us.",
        "background": "A-Levels 2021 should have more changes. We need our exams to be altered to fit our needs after lockdown, whether thats making them easier, shorter, or cutting out certain topics. Delaying the exams by a few weeks does not make up for multiple months of school missed, we need change to the exams.",
