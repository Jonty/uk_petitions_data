        "additional_details": "Fireworks are dangerous to horses and livestock. When used in close proxomity they cause extreme distress and unnecessary suffering. Yet the only thing we are able to do is to document and record the stress and suffering it causes, to use as evidence to prevent it happening again in future. At this point the damage has already been done, with many animals losing thier lives or having serious injuries due to the stress. \r\nThe law needs to be changed to protect innocent animals from suffering.",
        "background": "Ban all residential fireworks within close proximity to horses and livestock.\r\nImplement laws to safeguard animal welfare for any organised events using fireworks. \r\nImplement firework control zones and licensing systems for sales of fireworks.\r\nFireworks cause unnecessary suffering to horses.",
