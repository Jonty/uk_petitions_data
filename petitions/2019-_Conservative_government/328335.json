        "additional_details": "The Government must do all it can to ensure working conditions are safe for factory staff, and that they are earning a liveable wage for companies to be able to sell their clothes in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe exploitation of factory workers operating in developing countries is extreme. The majority live below the poverty line, despite working extended hours every single day. They operate in extremely unsafe, crowded and filthy conditions, and are often subject to physical and verbal abuse. There is no regulation of working hours, or the age of factory workers and child exploitation is rampant.",
        "background": "The Modern Slavery Act should be strengthened to introduce mandatory due diligence for companies in the UK. High street brands must be made accountable for the exploitation of vulnerable workers with an appropriate penalty for those who fail to report and comply with the Modern Slavery Act.",
