        "additional_details": "The government and NHS should fund medical degrees.\r\n\r\nOur doctors are putting themselves at risk to help our country in this COVID-19 crisis. \r\n\r\nThey should not be paying 9% of their wage for 30 years because of the huge student loan they need to pay for their training. As a society, if we really value what they do, we should be collectively paying for their training.",
        "background": "COVID-19 has shown how desperately we need our doctors.\r\nCurrently Medical Students pay \u00a39250 a year for their course fees whilst they train to become Doctors. These students study for 5 years and only one year is NHS funded.\r\n\r\nI propose that tuition fees be removed for students on Medical Degrees.",
