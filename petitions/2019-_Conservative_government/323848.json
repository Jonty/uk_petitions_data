        "additional_details": "At the age of 16 when I studied A Level History, it was the first time I\u2019d heard anything about black culture in British history. Prior to that I\u2019d never heard anything apart from consistently being reminded of slavery and the civil rights movements as if that\u2019s all we\u2019ve ever existed from when there is so much more and we need to change that. It\u2019s 2020 - we need to start properly educating this country. Education is power. Education is key.",
        "background": "In light of recent events, we have to strive for more change. Black British history is non existent in the curriculum and it\u2019s not enough to be taught purely about white history when black people have existed in the U.K. for centuries.",
