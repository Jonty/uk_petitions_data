        "additional_details": "Present estimates of the severity of hearing loss and local hearing health needs in England rely on outdated evidence from four decades ago and predicted age demographics, rather than actual medical records. In contrast, other health conditions, including sight loss, are monitored using current medical records. It is vital to systematically gather and analyse data on hearing health at the population level, to ensure that hearing health receives an equitable level of attention and resources.",
        "background": "Due to the link between hearing loss and conditions such as diabetes, depression, and dementia, it is essential to measure and track the extent of hearing loss in the general population. Including hearing health indicators in the Public Health Outcomes Framework for consistent monitoring is crucial.",
