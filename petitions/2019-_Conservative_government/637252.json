        "additional_details": "There are lots of exams that students sit in a range of subjects that all require a lot of learning and memorisation. This workload needs to be considered. We believe spending time learning equations is not a good use of valuable revision time and there needs to be change. These sheets can help young students achieve better grands, and help put their minds more at ease because there is less to worry about, which could help with their mental wellbeing.",
        "background": "Considering the amount of pressure and hard work it takes to sit GCSEs, we believe students shouldn't have to spend valuable revision time learning equations. Even for exams in 2024 students affected by COVID are not getting the sheet. We need the sheets for all years from now on.",
