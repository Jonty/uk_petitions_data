        "additional_details": "Losing a loved one can both be painful and legally complex. Many employers will offer up to 5 days paid leave, however the grief and legal complexities can take far longer to get underway let alone fully deal with, far longer than any 5 days could provide. By bringing into law the proposed legislation it will allow employees the financial security, time and peace of mind they require to deal with bereavement and bring bereavement policies in the workplace in the UK into the 21st century.",
        "background": "Introduce legislation to require employers to offer 6 weeks fully paid bereavement leave for all UK employees on the death of a family member, spouse or partner or 4 weeks for a friend with the leave to be able to be taken in 1 block or in stages up to 2 months from the date of the person's death.",
