While we are free to move everywhere in UK many can't afford to visit their family in their home country because of the cost of the required PCR tests, which for a family of 4 can be around \u00a31000. We're locked up in UK for more than a year. Christmas and Easter were cancelled. We want to visit our family without these additional costs.",
