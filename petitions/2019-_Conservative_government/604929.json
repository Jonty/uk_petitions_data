Veterans with limbs missing have been offered \u00a3300.00. That is all and they had to fight for that. \r\n\r\nIt is a national embarrassment that we are unable to give back to those who have given so much to their country. Meer Pawns for the elected to ignore after they have proven their worth",

In May 2021 it was announced that Reading Borough Council's bid for the gaol had been turned down by the MoJ because the offer of \u00a32.6M was too low.",
