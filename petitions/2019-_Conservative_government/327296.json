Yet, after two years of dithering, during which anti-trans paranoia has increased in the UK, the government have decided not to go ahead with the reform. They intend instead to clamp down on people's freedoms by restricting trans people's access to single-sex spaces. Most British people support trans rights and an overwhelming majority of respondents called for reform so the government should respond accordingly.",
        "background": "The government held a consultation two years ago regarding reform of the Gender Recognition Act, which allows trans people to update their legal gender. Respondents were asked whether the process should be streamlined by allowing trans people to declare their own gender.",
