She found out that day that she had lost her baby. She then had to make plans for delivery of her angel; alone. She then had to tell her husband the news. Meanwhile the uk population can attend gyms, pools and nail bars as much as they like. Liverpool lifted a piece of metal in the presence & support of their family. But pregnant women are being put under undue stress.",
        "background": "Pregnant women should not be expected to attend antenatal appts alone, particularly scans. Imagine a newly pregnant woman worrying about her first scan, wondering if they\u2019ll find a heartbeat and knowing she has to do it alone. Or having attended her appt to be told there is no heartbeat, alone.",
