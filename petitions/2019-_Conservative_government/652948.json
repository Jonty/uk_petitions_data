        "action": "To not increase the financial requirements for UK family visas",
        "additional_details": "This change will impact UK citizens. The new financial requirements put a price on love. The initial requirement was brought in to ensure that a foreign spouse could be financially supported. This ridiculous and disproportionate increase is above the salary of many working professionals. It makes it almost impossible for a person earning a good salary to marry and be together with a foreign spouse. The policy is also ageist and will disproportionately affect those who are young or retired. A policy on limiting migration should not limit the rights of UK citizens.",
        "background": "To review the change planned for April 2024 to increase the financial requirement to sponsor non UK spouses from \u00a318600 a year. The change should be cancelled and the requirement left unchanged or removed.",
