        "additional_details": "We feel this is necessary because currently the DVSA are unable to supply enough vocational driving tests . There is an increasing shortage of commercial vehicle drivers. These drivers are vital to keep supply chains open and the country running normally. Vocational training companies are being forced to either close or restrict their businesses. There are a large number of potential drivers who could be gaining secure long term employment and assisting the economy.\r\n\r\nIf vocational trainers are able to conduct vocational tests this would also free up DVSA examiners to conduct L tests to ease the huge back log of learner drivers needing to obtain their ordinary driving licence.",
        "background": "We want the government to either change or amend legislation to allow approved vocational driver training centres to have their own driving examiners and conduct vocational driving tests.",
