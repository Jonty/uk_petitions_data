        "additional_details": "As a 42 year old Perimenopausal woman, I joined support groups and read up on menopause and noticed a worrying theme. Many women aged between 40-45 are being dismissed by their GPs even though they agree they have peri symptom\u2019s because a blood test didn\u2019t back that up. \r\n\r\nWhy is this test still being used when it\u2019s noted to be unreliable as the result is based on that one day. Hormone levels wildly fluctuate during peri. The test does not offer a valid indication of what is going on.",
        "background": "I am calling on the Government to remove the need for the FSH blood test in 40-45 year olds experiencing Perimenopausal symptoms before being allowed HRT. \r\n\r\nToo many women are being left to suffer debilitating symptoms based on an unreliable blood test, which is also a waste of NHS funding.",
