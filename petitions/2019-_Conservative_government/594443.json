        "additional_details": "The UK should adopt a similar relationship with the EU as the EFTA countries enjoy today.\r\nNorway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein are some of the wealthiest, happiest and most democratic countries in Europe. They are outside the Common Agricultural and Fisheries Policy, free to make their own trade deals and have their own court.\r\nIt needs to be made clear to MPs and Peers that even though the UK voted Leave, a lot of public opinion wants EFTA membership.",
