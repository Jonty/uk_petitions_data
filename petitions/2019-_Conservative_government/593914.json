        "additional_details": "I believe it unfair to use car users as a cash cow. In addition the fact that the proceeds from parking go to the council makes them an unfair judge and enforcers. The central government has reduced local council budgets and the councils are using parking and other minor infractions as a way of replacing that budget. Surely government was never ment to work that way. There is always ment to be a fair and impartial application and approach to enforcement",
        "background": "Legally create a maximum toll charge and maximum parking cost. Additionally the government should create more accountability regarding the enforcement of parking and parking fines in addition to removing the proceeds from going to the council",
