        "additional_details": "The people in Skewen have been left devasted after the mine blow out flooded homes and caused incredible damage to cars, gardens and homes. The mine shaft had collapsed around where the blow out happened and if the mine had been regularly checked then this disaster could have been avoided. However, the Coal Authority are not accepting liability. They have offered a mere \u00a32,000 of materials but many of the people affected will be left out of pocket as the cost of fixing everything will be colossal.",
        "background": "The Government should provide compensation for flooding caused by former mines. The Coal Authority claim they are not liable for flooding, meaning people affected by flooding due to mines under the responsibility of the Coal Authority can be left out of pocket and with unimaginable losses.",
