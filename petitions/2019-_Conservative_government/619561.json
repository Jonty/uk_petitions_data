        "additional_details": "With a cost of living crisis, more families will plummet into poverty with children suffering. Families earning just over \u00a37,400 in receipt of Universal Credit are not eligible for free school meals. This is a pitiful amount of money to live on. At least if these children had a hot free school meal each day, that would be a start to improving outcomes for these children. Research shows that children cannot learn if they are hungry. This would take a small pressure off those struggling to eat.",
