        "additional_details": "It hinders mobility for British citizens and deprives their children opportunity to study in their own country. It also does not take into account national insurance contributions made by parent while residing in UK. Many UK citizens need to work abroad because of globalisation of economy. Such UK citizens do not necessarily have economic capabilities to afford foreign student fees. However their children would love to study and work in the UK and should not be economically penalised.",
        "background": "Current rule of residing in the UK for 3 yrs to qualify for local fees for British citizens living abroad is unfair. They should be given concessions in foreign fee structure.",
