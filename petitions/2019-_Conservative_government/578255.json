        "action": "COMMIT TO DISCUSS RECIPROCAL VISA-FREE LEISURE TRAVEL WITH EU COUNTRIES",
        "additional_details": "This would be welcomed by all British long stay or frequent visitors to the EU: tourists; families and friends of British expats and second home owners; gap year students; retirees with boats or motor homes and many others.\r\n\r\nHowever, little will result if the Government refuses to discuss any such arrangements. We want a commitment from Government to respond positively to approaches from individual EU countries and achieve the same terms for British leisure travellers as we offer their citizens.",
        "background": "Most EU countries are eager to rebuild tourism revenue from British leisure visitors once the Covid-19 pandemic is over. Several seem willing (as allowed under EU rules) to discuss bilateral reciprocation of the 6 months visa-free arrangement for leisure travel that we now offer to all EU citizens.",
