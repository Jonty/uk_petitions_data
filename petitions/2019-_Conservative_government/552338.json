        "additional_details": "Due to COVID-19, part-time employment is not readily available for healthcare students to support themselves. This makes the coming academic year more difficult, potentially unfeasible, for many healthcare students.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThese healthcare students will take part in placements where there will be at risk of contracting COVID-19. The large majority (understandably excluding those at-risk) will do so without hesitation. They want to learn, to gain experience, and to help NHS service users. The efforts of certain students shouldn\u2019t be devalued because of their country of origin. Thank you for taking the time to read this petition.",
        "background": "The Department of Health and Social Care is strongly urged to reconsider the eligibility criteria for the NHSBSA LSF Training Grant. Everyone who is eligible for tuition loans from Student Finance England should be permitted to avail of the Training Grant.",
