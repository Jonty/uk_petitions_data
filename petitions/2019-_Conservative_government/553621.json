        "additional_details": "The entertainment industry produces billions of pounds to the economy and the government are refusing to acknowledge that. \r\nArtists are having to sell their equipment to pay a bill. Some artists haven\u2019t performed since before lockdown. University students are paying 9k a year to study the ARTS and have been told pretty much that they are wasting their time. Live venues can\u2019t support acts because they can\u2019t AFFORD to. Listen to your people. We WANT live music.",
        "background": "Provide more funding and help to musicians and those who rely on live entertainment as a career. Recognise us as a job rather than telling us we need to retrain and find something more substantial. Many venues can\u2019t hold live entertainment at the moment because of cost. We want live music.",
