While I'm off sick I'm only getting SSP.\r\n\r\nI want employees to be able to access a Government fund so they can pay enhanced sick pay to employees who are on long-term sick leave, when they think this is appropriate. Employers should be able to decide how a worker's sick pay should be enhanced, and apply for money to pay for this from the Government fund.\r\n\r\nThe Government supported companies to pay staff who were furloughed during the covid-19 pandemic, so why not put something similar in place for workers who are on long-term sick leave, especially where this is for a serious condition like a stroke or cancer.\r\n",

This would be especially helpful for workers suffering from serious conditions like a stroke or cancer.\r\n\r\n",
