        "additional_details": "The UK Foreign Office initially pledged \u00a31.5 million to Pakistan's emergency relief efforts, that amounted to less than 5p for each person affected by the unprecedented floods. \r\n\r\nToday, UK stepped up support for Pakistan by announcing further \u00a315 million. \r\n\r\nThe UK Government announced \u00a3150 m support in the 2010 floods. The 2022 floods are much worse while less than 10% is being done compared to 2010. Pakistan is submerged, and we must act fast by announcing \u00a3200 million in aid to the relief efforts.",
        "background": "In Pakistan we are seeing the most serious and catastrophic impact of the climate change with 1/3rd Pakistan flooded, 1236 confirmed dead, 40 million people affected and 1 million homes destroyed. \r\n\r\nThe UK Govt must announce \u00a3200 million aid in response to the unprecedented crisis.",
