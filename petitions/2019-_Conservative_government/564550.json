        "additional_details": "The pandemic has highlighted the importance of our health.  Exercise is a imperative part of strengthening our immune system and ensuring mental health is maintained.  \r\n\r\nThe new year is a time that people decide to start a more healthy lifestyle.  As a country, we must use the last nine months as a platform to encourage people to take responsibility for their health.\r\n\r\nClosure of exercise facilities will undoubtedly increase depression, illness, obesity and suicides within the UK even further.",
        "background": "In the event of a third national lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we ask that the government allow all physical exercise facilities to remain open so that the UK population can maintain both their physical and mental health during these testing times whilst reducing the strain on the NHS.",
