        "additional_details": "I am asking the Government to change the name in legislation from Female Genital Mutilation to Female Genital Cutting, which is how the practice is commonly known around the world. We believe the term mutilation does not help survivors. because of a fear of being seen as mutilated. Too many women and young girls live in silence because of a fear of judgement. We are not mutilated. Mutilation is a bad label.",
        "background": "I am a British citizen who survived Female genital cutting back in Somalia. The name Female Genital Mutilation is not a name that all victims and survivors relate to, and in fact being labelling mutilated can contribute to a victim's mental health and insecurities. We aren\u2019t mutilated.",
