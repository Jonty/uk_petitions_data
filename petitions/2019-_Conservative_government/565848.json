        "additional_details": "Our education system is so fixated on levels and results that actual knowledge that can set children for life is being overlooked. Children are introduced to Xbox\u2019s and PlayStations from an early age. Let\u2019s teach them about physical activity and fitness from an early age. Primary Schools teach sports to enter competitions to gain a sports mark. How\u2019s that right? Surely we should be teaching our children to be active and healthy which in turn will help with our schools mental health issues.",
        "background": "Teach the children from a young age the importance of being active and eating healthily even when on a budget. Teach them fully, from nursery onwards, the importance of a balanced diet and teach them physical activity and fitness skills rather than team sports.",
