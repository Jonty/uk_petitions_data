        "additional_details": "With restrictions being lifted and cases of Covid 19 rising rapidly, people in this situation need to be able to make an informed decision about how they move forwards with their lives. One of the ways to do this is to provide a free antibody test so that they are aware of how their body has responded to the vaccine and can make adjustments accordingly. Having lived with shielding and other restrictions for so long now, the mental health of people who are CEV needs to be taken seriously.",
        "background": "Studies have shown that some groups of CEV people may not have had an immune response to the Covid 19 vaccination e.g. the PROSECO study on lymphoma patients. As a person who has had lymphoma treatment during the pandemic I feel that I, and many others, need to know whether we are protected or not.",
