If the exact same children in a class bubble can see each daily, why can't the same children attend a birthday party in a covid secure venue?\r\n \r\nPlaygroups are allowed to run, where children are not in bubbles. Why can the children's party, an industry worth over half a billion pounds every years, not continue.",
