        "additional_details": "Currently you can call the school and explain you may not be able to afford it. And they may be able to help you. This is embarrassing, and something I would never personally do myself. I feel the government should be providing grants to parents in need to help cover the cost of new school uniforms/ p.e kits/ shoes/ bags etc.",
        "background": "When I was younger we got a grant to help with uniform costs. A uniform including shoes/bags/p.e kits can cost well in excess of \u00a3250. If you have more than one child like me it gets rather expensive & a lot of families including myself worry about where this will come from.",
