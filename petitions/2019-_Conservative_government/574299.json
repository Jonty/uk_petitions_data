Since many more charges will have been brought and thousands of fixed penalty notices issued across all forces with the majority being unlawfully or unfairly issued, I want the Government to conduct a review or all fines issued.",
        "background": "I want the Government to review all fines that have been issued under Covid regulations. Fixed penalty notices should be reviewed in the same way that the CPS has reviewed prosecutions. We believe it is likely that some fines have been issued unlawfully.",
