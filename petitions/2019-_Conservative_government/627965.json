        "additional_details": "Many people are in pain for unacceptable lengths of time. As a consequence depression sets in and long term medication is required. As a result this causes additional strain on GPs,Physiotherapists and employers.By providing a financial incentive many more people may feel they can opt for private surgery.Surely partly refunding treatment private patients would have received on a fully functioning NHS is a fair request, given they are helping to reduce the list and they have paid into the system.",
        "background": "Due to NHS waiting lists many are opting for private surgery at home or abroad. Prior to Brexit some or all of these costs were rebated depending on circumstances. Currently no financial assistance is available.The price of the prosthetic should be refunded to patients removed from the waiting list.",
