It is estimated a single baby uses between 4000 and 6000 nappies by the time they are potty trained. The majority of these nappies are not biodegradable and are placed into household waste so go into landfill which is a major environmental concern. We urgently need action to address climate change and this could massively reduce landfill and encourage more sustainability.",
        "background": "Disposable nappies are currently zero rated for VAT. If instead a tax were added and the money raised used to fund a reusable starter pack of nappies for babies in the UK this could encourage parents to use reusable nappies thereby reducing landfill, ocean plastics and climate change.",

In their report, MPs called on the Government to restrict the amount of plastic that can be exported from the UK. They also called on the Government to step up the enforcement of existing rules to prevent criminal gangs illegally exporting and dumping UK-produced waste.\u00a0\nRead the Committee's report reducing plastic waste (https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/31509/documents/176742/default/)\nRead a press release about the report (https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/52/environment-food-and-rural-affairs-committee/news/174191/mps-call-for-ban-on-all-plastic-waste-exports/)\nThe report follows a series of evidence sessions earlier this year, where the Committee questions representatives from charities, environmental campaigners and commercial trade experts. At these sessions the Committee explored:\nwhether the Government\u2019s current ambitions to reduce plastic waste were enough\nhow alternatives to plastic consumption can be identified and supported\nhow England's current plastic exports impact other countries.\nFind out more about the Committee's inquiry into plastic waste (https://committees.parliament.uk/work/1391/plastic-waste/) and read oral evidence from the Committee's inquiry (https://committees.parliament.uk/work/1391/plastic-waste/publications/).\nWhat is the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee?\u00a0\nThe Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee is a cross-party group of backbench MPs that scrutinises the administration, spending and policy of the Government\u2019s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.\u00a0\nFind out more about the Committee (https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/365/business-energy-and-industrial-strategy-committee/)\nFollow the Committee on Twitter (https://twitter.com/CommonsEFRA) for updates on its work.\n\u00a0\nThe Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee is a select committee.
