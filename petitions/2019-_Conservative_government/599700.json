        "additional_details": "The UK disposes of 3 billion disposable nappies each year, which represents an estimated 2-3% of all household waste. It is estimated a single baby uses between 4000 and 6000 nappies by the time they are potty trained. The majority of these nappies are not biodegradable and are placed into household waste so go into landfill which is a major environmental concern. We urgently need action to address climate change and this could massively reduce landfill and encourage more sustainability.",
        "background": "Disposable nappies are currently zero rated for VAT. If instead a tax were added and the money raised used to fund a reusable starter pack of nappies for babies in the UK this could encourage parents to use reusable nappies thereby reducing landfill, ocean plastics and climate change.",
