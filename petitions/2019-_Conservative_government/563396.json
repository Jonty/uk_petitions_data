        "action": "Replace current GCSE and A-Level exams with assignments",
        "additional_details": "In order to fairly judge academic performance, I urge that exams taking place in 2021 are replaced with assignments (coursework). These assignments will consist of questions that will encourage students to research and use their knowledge of a subject to form answers. By replacing exams with assignments, a result in cognitive and analytical enhancement would take place as students who have missed out on more than 6 months of learning are able to research their subject and gain further knowledge.",
        "background": "There has been a perceptible rise in fear amongst students across the UK as a result of the unpredictability of COVID-19 and its impact on students' performance in exams. It is essential to fairly measure students' performance considerately in current circumstances.",
