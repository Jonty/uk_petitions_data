        "action": "Extend maternity exemption certificates for treatment unavailable during covid19",
        "additional_details": "I myself am on maternity leave and had required treatment which has been postponed. My exemption will run out in October and, if dentists have not resumed work, I\u2019ll then have to either forfeit treatment or pay for treatment that, in normal circumstances, I would have received for free. I believe there will be many more women  who will also miss out unfairly if this is not addressed.",
        "background": "There\u2019s a risk women of missing out on essential checkups/treatment if maternity exemption certificates are not extended to cover dentist closures due to Covid19. I\u2019d like government to extend certificates held at the point of Covid closure by the period of the closure.",
