        "additional_details": "The government should do this because a lot of people are getting their E-Scooter seized by the police for a reason that the government has made which I believe and many others is invalid. E scooters are just another form of transport they\u2019re not doing anyone any harm. E bikes are legal because they require input to make it move but that reason should not stop East scooters from being legal. Even though E scooters are illegal people still Ride them and they do not care what the government says about them so whether or not they are legal they will probably still be used by the general public.",
