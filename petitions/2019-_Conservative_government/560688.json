        "action": "Prioritise clinically vulnerable adults for the Covid-19 vaccine",
        "additional_details": "Clinically vulnerable under 65s are more likely to live with children or young adults, and find it harder to shield. Children are missing out on their education to shield their vulnerable parents, or living in fear of bringing the virus home. No child should be made to choose between their parent\u2019s life and their education. Clinically vulnerable adults are a relatively small group compared to all over 65s, and are likely to need hospital treatment for Covid, so prioritising them protects the NHS",
        "background": "It has been widely reported that clinically vulnerable adults will be the 6th group offered Covid vaccination, after all over 65s. This petition argues adults at high risk due to underlying health conditions should be a top 3 priority. Put simply, those who were asked to shield should be prioritised",
