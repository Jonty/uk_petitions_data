        "additional_details": "Car insurance companies for years have been making money of people's backs for a simple reason because the law allows them to do so.Not being able to drive your friend's car in a case of an emergency due to the fact that you would have to be insured on that exact car is simply unfair.Car insurance companies in the UK makes it complicated to have a car and are making it a luxury instead of a necessity. 1 in 5 jobs advertised requires a driving license and 63% of people need a car to get to work.",
        "background": "Many countries in the world have been using car insurance by insuring the car rather than the driver.Having to be insured individually on each car increases unnecessary costs and gives insurance companies space to overcharge drivers as much as they want without being regulated.",
