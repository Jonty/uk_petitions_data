        "additional_details": "Many tenants' original housing applications' stipulated their need for a spare bedroom for relatives' short-term stays. After the intro of the housing benefit surplus bedroom rules, housing benefit recipients became liable to a surcharge for their spare bedroom, as no allowance was made for their legitimate needs. This proposed change in housing benefit assessments will help to ease the financial burden of tenants who  wish to support their relatives throughout these uncertain times.",
