        "additional_details": "I want the safety of children at the forefront of all what schools do. My child has traveled home at 5 pm in the dark on her own due detention. Detention does nothing to children. It is the teenage version of the naughty step and poses massive risks when they are sent home with no regard for their safety or if they made it home. All schools should not be allowed to hold children after 4pm in the winter months with no plan on how they\u2019re going to get home safety and parental consent every time.",
        "background": "For all schools to be banned from detaining pupils after school in the winter months and sending them home in the dark with no regard for their safety",
