        "additional_details": "It is very common for familes to go to court over child arrangements. In most of these cases, the child will be placed in the care of parent A, with 'visits' to parent B. \r\nThis often leaves parent B with an inaddiquate amount of time with their child.\r\nIf it takes two parents to make a child, why should parent B now be less important in the upbringing of their children.\r\nChildren who have both parents, NEED BOTH parents\r\nLet parents be equal, with 50/50 custody",
        "background": "This petition is to request than on seperation of two parents, they are both granted EQUAL time with their child/children.\r\nUnless one parent can be proven unfit to care for their children, they should be granted 50% of the child's time.",
