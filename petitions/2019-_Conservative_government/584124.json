As a young female I felt violated on a large scale and shameful even.\r\n \r\nMy only lifeline was in the hands of the pedestrian.\r\n \r\nWe need greater street safety to get predators off the streets and keep our children safe. And as young people, we need to align to get our voices heard and heard now.",
