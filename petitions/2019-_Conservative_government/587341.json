        "additional_details": "8.3% of males and 0.5% of females have some sort of colour-blindness. The most common form - deuteranomaly - is red-green colour blindness, which can render two of the three colours on traffic signals less visible. Red appears as a dark-yellow which is more difficult to see than the amber signal which may result in drivers of vehicles not seeing stop signals. This is surely unsafe for all road users - including pedestrians - and makes such drivers more vulnerable to committing driving offences.",
        "background": "The Government should review the traffic signal colours, the highway code and signal standards to ensure meet the needs of the colour-blind. Traffic signals have used red for stop, red and amber to prepare, green to proceed if safe to do so, and amber to stop unless unsafe to stop.",
