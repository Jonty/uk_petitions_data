        "additional_details": "As a person with autism I have struggled with mock exams when they have been under standard GCSE conditions. From experience the high levels of pressure that come from being under exam conditions has caused me to not do as well as I know I can in my exams. If the exam conditions were to be more relaxed and de-pressurised I believe I would perform so much better in my exams & I am certain that students all across the nation fell the same way.",
        "background": "I want Parliament to change the way GCSE exams are held & to make it a more relaxed environment. As a person with autism, I can confidently say that this will benefit students with & without mental health issues. Reducing stress & pressure the current GCSE curriculum & exam program has on students.",
