        "additional_details": "We have already exceeded the 1st wave, which was more slowed down and contained when the first lockdown was enforced, and schools had closed down. COVID & schools remaining open is affecting the mental health of younger students, and has shown a drastic rise in cases of suicide within the younger population. I feel as though it's putting more strain onto the emergency services, which is overwheling them and causing them to be unable to cope with schools remaining open.",
        "background": "COVID-19 has mostly been spreading through schools & places of education. It's quite clear that with schools remaining to stay open, this is causing further damage to the UK and the economy. From a personal standpoint, with this new strain of COVID-19, people don't feel safe.",
