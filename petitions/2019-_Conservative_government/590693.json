        "additional_details": "Businesses can have crypto wallets, athletes can choose to be paid in crypto, PayPal lets us send crypto currencies across the globe in seconds and crypto.com lets us pay in digital currencies through their visa card. This topic needs to be addressed sooner rather than later so a proper infrastructure is put into place. This will expose our generation, and those to come to crypto preventing a future lost in tech which will come with a cashless world being moulded faster due to covid-19.",
        "background": "We have the option to be paid in GBP into our bank accounts, so it only seems fair that we should move forward as times change, having the option to have our maintenance loan paid in our crypto wallet, specifically in stable coins. The same amount is paid in a safe way, without risk of losing money.",
