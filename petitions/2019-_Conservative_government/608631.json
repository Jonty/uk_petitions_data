        "additional_details": "This loan is based on the assumption that energy prices are likely to come down in 2023, which they may not. It is wrong to enforce a personal loan on us, and interferes with our legitimate personal choices. Those of us on low incomes, who may already be in debt cannot take the risk of any further debts, especially with rising prices. As for those on high incomes, this loan will not even be noticed by them, so is a waste. Make it a choice to OPT IN for those who feel they can take the risk",
        "background": "We do not want this enforced loan. We want to be able to choose whether to take the risk or not, and manage our own budgeting. We want an opt in service.",
