The UK compensated slave traders and Onwership when slavery was abolished but never compensated the descendants of the enslaved - who actually needed and deserved the money! The UK has commuted horrendous crimes and colonised countries and continents. We want those impacted by the UKs vicious racist regime to Aldo be compensated.",
