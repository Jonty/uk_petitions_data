        "additional_details": "Universities look to the Government and regulatory bodies for guidance; however this has been minimal in this area. Students are feeling incredibly vulnerable and whilst this will be accepted once graduated- at the moment they are risking a lot with unnecessary travel and no payment. Many placement sites are over 1-2 hours from campus\u2019s- meaning students are being forced to take public transport to and from a hospital environment- simply to return and potentially transmit to other students",
        "background": "Advise uni\u2019s to pull students until the situation is more stable. Students are unpaid, unnecessary workers, concerned for the safety of other students and loved ones they return home to. Being transmittable before symptomatic places every other student at risk, particularly those more vulnerable.",
