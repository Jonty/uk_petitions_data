We have two dogs and because we are unable to fly with them, the drive is going to take us 15+ hours - likely over two days.\r\n\r\nOur dogs are very much loved by our family in England, and because of the drive, we will not be able to bring them back often. \r\n\r\nIn the UK, our pets are becoming more and more a part of the family. Please consider them being able to move freely too.",
