We need to bring the r rate down, slow the spread of the virus and keep everyone safe.",
        "background": "School children will have to live with the consequences of this pandemic for much longer then the rest of us so it is vital that we keep them safe. School students fall under the age group that is causing the highest rise in covid cases in the UK making it even more important to keep schools shut.",
