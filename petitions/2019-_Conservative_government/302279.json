        "additional_details": "The NHS has a relatively very small number of Intensive Care beds compared to other European countries. Given that COVID-19 is very clearly the biggest public health crisis 'in a generation' as the Prime Minister stated (12th March 2020), it would seem reasonable that these beds, and other health resources, owned or controlled by the private health sector in the UK may be made available to the NHS immediately, and otherwise, as may be required.",
        "background": "The UK Government should immediately move to requisition all Intensive Care beds, and other necessary resources, owned or controlled by the private health sector in the UK, in order to optimise the ability of the NHS to respond to the COVID-19 health crisis.",
