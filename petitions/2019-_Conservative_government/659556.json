        "additional_details": "Many residents local to Cannock and farther away have been sent 10 to 20 miles further than what is reasonable. This has put much pressure on Cannock residents minor injuries are now being sent to Wolverhampton, Stafford or Lichfield MIU. It\u2019s taking much of the residents time and money, filling up A&E units which should be left for more serious injuries.",
        "background": "We want the the Minor Injuries Unit at Cannock Hospital to re opened as now the pandemic is over and more resources have been allocated to Cannock Chase Hospital, and so to relieve pressure off of the NHS services. The reopening of this unit is essential.",
