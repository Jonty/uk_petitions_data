        "additional_details": "UK universities have already started to pave the way to decolonise their teaching material, and I would like this petition to advocate for British schools to do the same. By reviewing Western/ Euro-centric material in British schools, and elevating the resources, voices and culture of non-Western historians, poets, storytellers and countries (to name a few), children will learn to deeply engage with perspectives that differ from their own, and build towards a more socially just society.",
        "background": "Critically review the taught material (books, and resources) as well as the core, taught curriculum for all subjects across UK schools, to remove the dominant perspectives of Western/ Euro-centric writers and academics and replace with more diverse literature, voice and material.",
