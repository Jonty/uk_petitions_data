        "additional_details": "We would like the Parliament to consider this action due to the growing risk for the families of students that attend school. The 'rule of six' is unrealistic to maintain in the indoor scenes. Students mix in an indoor setting with 30 households 6 times a day with no surgical grade mask while learning. Closing for older students would not effect the working parents as they are able stay home alone. Students' learning would have less of an impact because they have access to online classrooms.",
        "background": "We would like the government to at least consider closing schools/colleges for Key Stage 3 and 4 down (Years 9-12) in the coming weeks or as soon as possible, in addition to taking necessary actions to prevent further spread.",
