        "action": "Abolish private education by nationalising private/independent schools",
        "additional_details": "The Coronavirus pandemic has shown us all the huge inequality between students of different backgrounds, with some students falling far behind their more privileged peers. We can't allow a segregated education system to exacerbate this inequality, with the richest students going to private schools that still qualify for charitable status! We believe private schools do not take pressure off the state. They simply allow the privileged to access superior education, reducing equality of opportunity.",
        "background": "This petition asks that the Government abolish private/independent schools by nationalising and converting them to state schools, and requiring that all young people attend state school in the future.",
