The Government website clearly states that recruiters cannot ask about this in interviews. You can find this here: https://www.gov.uk/employer-preventing-discrimination/recruitment\r\n                \r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a petition calling for the Government to fund an awareness campaign about this issue, if this is something you would like to see happen.\r\n\r\nYou may be able to get further advice from ACAS: https://www.acas.org.uk/if-an-employer-says-you-cannot-apply-or-rejects-you-for-a-job/checking-if-you-were-discriminated"
