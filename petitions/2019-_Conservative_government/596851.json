        "additional_details": "The Government\u2019s ambitions for eradicating extreme poverty in low and middle-income countries requires an approach to gender equality that is just and effective and includes people of all ages. Older women across the globe, but especially in poorer areas, carry out relentless paid and unpaid work with little or no choice, and often without support. They deserve to live with dignity, and to be given the help they need, as equal members of society.",
        "background": "Globally, older women contribute critical paid and unpaid work. In low and middle-income countries, older women are supporting children, family and friends, yet their rights and needs are not recognised or met. The new UK International Development Strategy must explicitly include older women.",
