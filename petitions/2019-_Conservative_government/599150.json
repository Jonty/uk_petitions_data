        "additional_details": "The NHS does a Stirling job. The Hospitals have kept working throughout the Covid19 pandemic and have continued to do so. The GP's however have failed to fulfill their jobs and people are suffering because of it. The risk on Covid still remains, but as we have over 80% of the population no double jabbed there should be no excuse for the GP's to not reopen fully. The rest of the country has returned to work and face the same risks as the GP's. This has to stop NOW. People are dying due to this.",
        "background": "The government should be forcing all GP's in the UK to stop Telephone/Video Consultations and open their surgeries again for sit down face to face consultations. If a GP surgery does not meet the required levels, that surgery should be warned and placed on a league table of failing Surgeries.",
