        "additional_details": "Allowing external exams to go ahead in 2021 is robbing students of their right to be fairly assessed. If instead the schools were given the opportunity to run the exams internally they could make it fair for every student, and unlike last year it would provide a basis of evidence for teacher predicted grades. Moving exams to late June/July only creates problems with turnaround time between marking exams and results day, and doesn\u2019t provide as much support to students as this solution would.",
        "background": "Schools should be allowed to do their own internal exams in replacement for externally assessed exams. This would allow each school to choose the content based on how much of the course was able to be covered. Teachers could then predict grades based on past work and these exams, heavily evidenced.",
