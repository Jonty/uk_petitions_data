        "additional_details": "After 25 years working and running community pubs this has been the most challenging two years I have faced. Brexit, Covid and now living costs. Energy prices have increased for me by 20%, others as much as double. Brewers are increasing prices, gas has increased, food and other suppliers too. April rightly sees minimum wage and National Insurance rise as well. All publicans need help now. Things are worse than Covid with the living cost crisis and global instability. Help us survive.",
        "background": "The whole nation is facing a living cost crisis. Hospitality is already facing increased costs, and has not had a chance to bounce back since Brexit and Covid. We urgently need the return of the 5% VAT rate put in place during the pandemic in order to balance rising costs.",
