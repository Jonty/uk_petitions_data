The Secretary of State updated MPs on the Government's plans for social restrictions and guidance from 19 July. \nHe also announced the outcome of the Government's review of domestic covid-status certification, also known as 'covid passports'. The Secretary of State confirmed the Government will not mandate the use of covid-status certification as a condition of entry for visitors to any setting, such as shops or events, at the present time.\nWatch the statement here:\nhttps://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/eacc6a97-9c80-4d44-b254-cfa537a2b1c5?in=17:02:41&out=17:52:16\nRead the transcript here:\nhttps://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2021-07-05/debates/803398B1-F845-43BA-A159-22E4CC6B9ECD/Covid-19Update\nRead the Government's report on its covid-status certification review:\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/999408/COVID-Status-Certification-Review-Report.pdf\nThe Government's review concluded that there would be a public health benefit to covid-status certification, but that the burden of implementing such a system, to businesses and individuals not yet fully vaccinated, would be disproportionate to that benefit at this stage of the pandemic. \nHowever, the Government has stated that individual organisations may make a discretionary choice to require covid-status certification (for example, via the NHS app) to help keep their premises safe, although the review has concluded that \"essential services\" should not do this.\nThe review also noted that the Government will keep the option of routine covid-status certification under review, and that certification could provide a means of keeping events going and businesses open if the country is facing a difficult situation in autumn or winter.\nWhat are Ministerial statements?\nMinisterial statements are a way for Ministers to bring an important matter to the attention of the House.\nFind out more about them here: https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/business/statements/\n",
