        "additional_details": "We believe the way Parliamentary debates are conducted creates a febrile environment where people who communicate differently fear they\u2019ll get ripped to shreds. We think this is unacceptable.\r\n \r\nA parliamentary candidate has withdrawn his candidacy because of the abuse he's received from political colleagues related to his stammer. People face these issues across society.\r\n \r\nIt needs to change. Parliament can lead that process of change by itself being inclusive and welcoming of people with communication differences.\r\n",
        "background": "We want the parliamentary authorities and Government, working with political parties, to consider how to make Parliamentary debates an inclusive environment for those who communicate differently by changing procedures and modelling behaviours where all members are treated with respect.",
