        "action": "To criminalise use of nitrous oxide for the purpose of getting high",
        "additional_details": "As a concerned parent and former user of nitrous oxide, the use of nitrous oxide for the purpose of getting high is currently only illegal to produce, supply, or import, but not to possess or use.\r\n\r\nThis stems from my continued personal struggles, 3 years post addiction. I urge you to act to make the necessary changes to existing laws and to implement effective enforcement mechanisms. I believe that this is an important step to protect the health and safety of young people in the UK.",
        "background": "The possession and use of nitrous oxide for the purpose of getting high should be fully illegal, due to the decaying of our youth and young adults.\r\n\r\nThis will require changes to the Psychoactive Substances Act of 2016",
