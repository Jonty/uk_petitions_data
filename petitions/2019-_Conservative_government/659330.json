        "additional_details": "To help students and the younger generation to become more independent and not have to worry about debt after university and also be able to learn about money and what to do with it. Students who take apprenticeships can be earning from day but Post-16 students can find it difficult to get a job and study simultaneously   Therefore the government should consider making the student wage so students can have this opportunity",
        "background": "Remove student discounts and replace with a student wage.  This would enable students who haven\u2019t chosen to go down the apprenticeship route to still be financially independent and have enough money to progress to higher education such as University.",
