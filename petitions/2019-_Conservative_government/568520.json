        "additional_details": "The reason for this, is because the summer exams would be cancelled due to Covid-19. This gives anyone who may have failed another chance to proceed into university without having to stay back at college another year. This should also apply to GCSE English. This is could really affect someones educational future and actually sticking to college which may have been affected by their lack of opportunity due to Covid-19.",

With circumstances of exams being cancelled, students should be allowed to retake maths in University so they do not have to stay at college another year to retake maths",
