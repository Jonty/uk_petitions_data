        "additional_details": "We want corporal punishment to be made illegal in the rest of the UK. Physical violence can never be a justified punishment - especially against children - and should be made illegal accordingly. The current law allows a parent to use corporal punishment but this is no longer in line with today\u2019s society, and change should be made to reflect the morals of today and their acceptability.",
        "background": "We want the Government and Parliament to make it illegal for a parent to use corporal punishment illegal, in all of the UK. Both Scotland and Wales have passed legislation to outlaw corporal punishment and the same should be for the rest of the UK.",
