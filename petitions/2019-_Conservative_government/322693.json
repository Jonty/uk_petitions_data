        "additional_details": "I lost someone very close to me a long time ago and know of many more cases where I believe if the driver had more knowledge of what to do in this situation it could have saved lives. I hoped that DVSA would have changed the test by now as cars are only getting faster, but this has not happened. Many drivers can drive safely in normal circumstances but as soon as their vehicle goes out of control drivers can panic as it\u2019s not a situation they have been in. Driving tests should account for this.",
        "background": "I want to see the driving test changed so learners are tested on what to do when a car goes out of control. Anyone sitting a test should have to pass a separate vehicle control test on a skid pan which race tracks all over the country have. This would also bring more revenue into race tracks",
