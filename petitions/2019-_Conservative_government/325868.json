        "additional_details": "Stop police forces using police horses in protests and riots. \r\n\r\nMounted police during these situations are rendered useless and are easy targets for attacks. This is not only dangerous for the police officers on the horses, but the horses receive physical and psychological damage which they can not recover from. \r\n\r\nThere are far more effective policing methods for these situations and does not put an innocent animal in the line of fire.",
        "background": "Stop using police horses during riots and protests in which the likelihood of them receiving physical attacks is high. \r\n\r\nHorses have been used for policing riots and as such have been viciously attacked, most recently in the 2020 BLM protests and were attacked using different weapons.",
