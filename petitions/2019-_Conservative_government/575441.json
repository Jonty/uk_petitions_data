        "action": "Relax visit-visa time restriction for foreign family members of UK residents.",
        "additional_details": "Due to the pandemic, many residents, who study/work in the UK, have failed to meet their oversea non-British/non-EU family members, especially their parents, for more than two years. These people are also making incredible contributions to the UK. It will be helpful to support their family time without affecting their work/study by extending their family stay time per visit. The decision also will benefit the UK economic recovery in the next few years due to an increasing amount of visitors.",
        "background": "Currently, the visit visas allow stays of less than 180 days per visit/year. We hope that the UK Government can allow the foreign family members of British residents to stay in the UK for a longer time per visit in the next 5 years, to relax the current restriction to 270 or 360 days per 1.5 years.",
