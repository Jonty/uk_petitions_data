        "additional_details": "Lockdown rules re travel for exercise are unclear. This was highlighted in a BBC report today about people driving only 5 miles for exercise being given penalty notices. Many people, such as in this report, and my own case, would regard driving a few miles, to somewhere we have traditionally used for exercise, and where social distancing is guaranteed, as reasonable behaviour. If instead I am forced to walk on more crowded streets from my doorstep, the restrictions increase my health risks!",
        "background": "There is no clear definition of \"local area\", the lock down provisions leave car parks/toilets open in amenity areas, but people are receiving penalty notices if they drive to them! Excessive restrictions are harmful for both covid and mental and physical fitness.",
