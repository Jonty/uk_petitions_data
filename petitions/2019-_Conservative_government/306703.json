Likened to the Blitz, we are pushing through this pandemic and for that we owe our NHS. Only twice has the George Cross been awarded to a collective; the people of Malta after their air bombardment during WWII and the Royal Ulster Contablury for their hard work in the Troubles. An award to this NHS is much deserved.",
