        "additional_details": "The reasoning for this is because a Flash GM or RT-CGM live monitor can be linked straight to the hospital/consultant which enables them to have access to your results. This allows them a better indication on how the diabetes is being controlled. I.e. Hypoglycaemic episodes. This can be viewed online, which DVLA could have access to. This would speed up the processing times and provide the medical evidence required for renewal of applications.",
        "background": "Current standards require Group 2 drivers (bus and lorry) to monitor finger prick capillary blood glucose levels every two hours, and are not able to use a live blood sugar monitor instead., I believe live monitors should be allowed as you get real time information from the sensor.",
