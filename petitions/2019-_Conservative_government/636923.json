In Millie\u2019s case it is believed she had a rare underlying auto immune condition that has no name and was mis-diagnosed as a mild condition in her younger years.\r\n \r\nWe want focus and commitment on research for non-cancerous rare disease. Too many of our children are dying due to the inequity in research, education and health equalities.\r\n \r\nFive children die every week from a rare disease. Often the child is misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. This needs to change.\r\n",
