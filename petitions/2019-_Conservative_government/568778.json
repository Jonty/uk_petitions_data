        "additional_details": "These are challenging and frustrating times for us learner drivers, as we have been unable to take our driving tests during the majority of 2020 and so far, the beginning of 2021 too - because of the Coronavirus pandemic. Whilst this is out of our hands, it's not out of the Governments or the DVSA officials'. We are asking for an extension to our theory pass validity, for those of us that have had our practical driving tests cancelled and/or postponed, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "background": "COVID-19 has affected so many people, learner drivers in more ways than one. We have had our driving tests pushed back countless times from no fault of our own. Now we NEED the DVLA to show us compassion, as they have in Northern Ireland, by extending the validity of our theory pass certifications.",
