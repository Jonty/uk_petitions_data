        "action": "Keep schools closed until at least September",
        "additional_details": "There have been reports that the Government are looking to reopen schools as early as June 1st. This is a premature move as we are still having approximately 600 COVID-19 deaths and around 5,000 people every day getting tested positive. Bearing in mind that when schools reopen, children will almost certainly not social distance no matter what guidelines are put in place. Spain and Italy have already closed schools until September and while Denmark have reopened, infections have taken a big increase.",
        "background": "We request that the Department of Education don\u2019t open schools as early as June 1st and we believe that the safest time to open schools would be September.",
