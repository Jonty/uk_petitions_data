The Equality Act 2010 says you must not be discriminated against because of your race, and there are also provisions for criminal offences to be treated as racist hate crime. These offences do not distinguish between different races.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for changes to existing legislation relating to race discrimination and racist hate crime, or calling for new legislation, but it would need to be clear what changes or new provisions you wanted to see."
