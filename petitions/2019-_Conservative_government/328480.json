As the years pass the affected families will need somewhere that we can gather as a collective to remember the loved ones we have lost, ordinary people who were taken too soon. The Nation will need a focal point to express the grief we all feel and should never forget.",

Although 75 he was was taken from us too soon, from falling ill to passing away 7 days later has had an enormous effect on the whole family, like so many others around the country.",
