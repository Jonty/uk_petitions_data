        "action": "Ban the use of police horses at protests",
        "additional_details": "When you factor in all the expenses for training, feeding, stabling, and outfitting, funding a single police horse is decidedly expensive. Horse units, usually deployed at large public events, perform poorly on accountability metrics like arrest rates. There is no need to bring these innocent animals into the firing line. Money used to train horses can be used for further police training to handle situations without excessive force or violence and to enforce higher regulation within the police.",
        "background": "Police horses are still used as an intimidating tactic at protests, including peaceful ones. The use of police horses is unnecessary and bring the animals into harms way. In addition, people are more likely to act in violent ways when police horses are commanded to charge or walk near people.",
