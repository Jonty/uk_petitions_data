        "additional_details": "The ongoing batch of international students due to graduate in 2020 have had a loss in months of productivity due to COVID-19 and it seems to stay such in the foreseeable future. This would result in a loss in opportunities for finding a job within the 6 month visa period after graduation. Extention of the post-graduate work visa to the current batch of international students due to graduate in 2020 would help them extend their opportunities for a few months after the effects of the pandemic on the economy.",
        "background": "Extend the post-study work visa due to being introduced for students graduating in 2021 to students graduating in 2020 to ensure equal opportunities which are compromised due to the effect of the pandemic. The pandemic has resulted in the loss of potential productive months of the current students.",
