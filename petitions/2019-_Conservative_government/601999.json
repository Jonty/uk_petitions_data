        "additional_details": "These are precious childhood memories being taken away from the children and their families needlessly. \r\nEvents such as football matches and pantomimes are continuing as normal with much higher audiences than small school plays.\r\nCertain schools have even built up the children\u2019s hopes by saying families can attend and then changed the rules suddenly, and no consideration of the children\u2019s mental health.\r\nThis is not fair and our children\u2019s lives should be back to normal as are everyone\u2019s else\u2019s.",
        "background": "A number of schools have put a stop to parents/guardians attending the school Christmas shows and blamed this on COVID, yet there are no other restrictions in place out of school.\r\nIt should be business as usual with families able to attend the school in person as no other regulations are in place.",
