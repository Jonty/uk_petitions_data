His school like many other schools and special needs schools is suffering due to significant cuts in education year after year, the current staffing provision of the school is unfortunately financially unsustainable: without bold measures, the school could slip into a deficit of nearly \u00a3400,000 this year and considerably more over the next two to three years. Due to this the school is being forced to close on Fridays from 1pm.",
