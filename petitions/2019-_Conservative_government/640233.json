This is the case for many people, who spend hundreds of pounds every time our prescription changes, which can be frequently. I believe this is unfair. Given my family history I also expect to be paying out for my children to have tests and I think that sight should be a right to everyone and should not put strain on people financially.",

This is a commodity that most people get for free. We want the Government to fund regular eye tests and free prescription lenses for everyone.",
