The people of Alderney welcome everyone but do not have the infrastructure or resources to enable asylum seekers to be landed in excessive numbers, it is too small to support more than its population. This will cause an impact to the environment and cause shortages of utilities to the whole of the population of island.",

The people of Alderney do not need this reminder of yet another group of displaced vulnerable people who are rendered homeless and destitute!",
