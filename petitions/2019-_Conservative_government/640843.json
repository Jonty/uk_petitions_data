        "additional_details": "I am a new mum and my partner was out with our daughter and he found himself in an uncomfortable situation which could have made other women uncomfortable too. I say this because there was only a changing table in the women's bathrooms. He had to resort to using the breast feeding rooms and even then there was no changing table. He had to resort to changing her on a chair, ultimately making his life and I'm sure many other mens life harder. he got continuous abuse from the public while he was changing our daughter.\r\nThere are so many single parents out there who need these facilities. This is a necessity for men to have this so that everyone around feels comfortable.",
        "background": "I would like the Parliament to put changing tables in mens bathrooms. It is hard enough having a child and men don't need the stress or fear of confrontation or judgement from the general public. every time I go out or you go out have you ever seen a mens bathroom with a changing table in it?",
