        "additional_details": "Colorado was one of the first US states to legalise Cannabis, and it\u2019s taxing system of 15% on licensed growers plus another 15% on final customers has brought the state in over $270 million in tax revenue. Compare that to the states annual Alcohol tax takings of only $45 million in the same year. A revenue stream of this size would be very beneficial to rebuilding the UK economy. It would also reduce the sale of illegal Cannabis which funds human trafficking, child exploitation and prostitution",
        "background": "Legalise the controlled growth and sale of recreational Cannabis in order to aide the rebuilding of the national economy. The shutdown of all no essential business\u2019s is forecast to plunge Global economies into another financial crisis, so now new forms of revenue now need to be considered.",
