        "additional_details": "I think the road needs reclassification to a motorway all the way to Grimsby. There needs to be hard shoulders for the safety of all road users as there are no safe places should your vehicle break down. I think the amount of HGVs coming and going from Grimsby and Immingham ports alone is reason enough to upgrade this vital route. I don't believe that the concrete surface was designed to last this long. \u00a370m is the current quote for resurfacing. We want full-scale improvements to create a safer, quieter route.",
        "background": "Upgrade A180 to motorway status and improve its condition. The road is concrete and I think very far beyond its useful lifespan. It requires much more than simple resurfacing. There are no hard shoulders and large numbers of HGVs using this route to travel to one of the biggest ports in the UK.",
