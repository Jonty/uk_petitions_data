        "action": "To decriminalise/ legalise the use as well as the possession of marijuana.",
        "additional_details": "To see a large reduction in crime rates as well as to help the police. By legalising weight will be lifted from polices shoulders meaning they can put the funding into real world problems such as domestic abuse as well as sexual assault. It can also be a means to pay back our covid debt across the UK. As well as creating hundreds possibly thousands of jobs across the UK and give people who have been arrested for possessing it a second chance.",
        "background": "Decriminalise or legalise the use and possession of marijuana. Due to marijuana recently being voted by the UN as a not dangerous drug so should therefore be legalised or decriminalised within the UK. This can also help us pay back our debt from covid and take pressure off of the police and courts.",
