Purchasers are now being told that if the sales don\u2019t go through in time they will miss out even though probate is a legal requirement and applications for probate are being delayed due to the pandemic. These sales could have gone through in time if not for the probate office back log. If it comes to cut off and the sales have not gone through purchasers may then have to pull out of the sales.",

Purchasers are at risk of losing out on the stamp duty benefit and being financially impaired and potentially sales falling through as a result",
