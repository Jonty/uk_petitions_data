        "additional_details": "Not only could this support environmental problems, it could also help counteract massive recruitment and retention issues in the social care sector. The Government must recognise the crisis the health service has been battling these last few years and help ease these stresses, by supporting the social care sector. Improving support for social care workers could help allow people the independence to be cared for at home, free up hospital beds, and boost employment by making social care work more attractive.",
        "background": "Social care workers are imperative to our society and our communities. By providing free public transport the Government can reduce costs for social workers and help tackle retention problems, increase recruitment and support uptake of public transport, potentially lowering CO2 emissions.",
