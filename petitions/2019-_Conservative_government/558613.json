        "additional_details": "I wish to allow participants to take their driving tests, these tests will be able to get more people from using public transport as well as the test itself being 1-1 with a clean environment where both members would wear gloves and masks to prevent the spread of this virus. The organisation of this has left many in confusion as they have had no contact from the dvla to say their test will be cancelled, this will also lose the dvla money also",
        "background": "This second lockdown is causing many people who are key workers who are needed to drive in order to support families to wait another 4 weeks to book another driving test. I believe this should not be the case as schools are still remained open which cause more virus to spread",
