        "additional_details": "The UK has no problem with genuine refugees. However, they are a minority. Any immigrant must come legally, must speak good English, undertake to respect UK law, undertake to respect UK culture and make a positive contribution to UK society. These people are likely to be economic freeloaders. I am the son of two legal immigrants from India and there is no racist intent in this petition.",
        "background": "We want legislation to be passed to stop all illegal immigrants coming to our shores with the help of EU countries. On arrival, they should be instantly deported. They are not refugees nor in danger. They have been through other safe countries. Genuine refugees come with their wives and children.",
