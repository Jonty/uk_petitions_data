Many short flights are unnecessary and with the exceptional railway network in the UK there is no reason why people should not take the train instead of flying.\r\n\r\nIn the current 2019-2021 environmental bill there is no mention of reducing flights or even of off setting carbon emissions caused by aviation. This is not good enough and this ban would be a simple way to reduce the impact of the UK to climate change.",
