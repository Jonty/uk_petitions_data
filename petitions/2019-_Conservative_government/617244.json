        "additional_details": "I and many others get \u00a369.70 a week carers allowance for caring for our family members who need a lot of support. Due to the amount of caring that is required it\u2019s impossible to get a job in many circumstances. This means many carers have to rely on universal credit. Universal credit allows you to earn a certain amount before deductions EXCEPT if you get carers allowance - it deducts \u00a3302.03 off each month. Carers allowance MUST stop being fully deducted from Universal Credit.",
        "background": "I want the government to stop deducting carers allowance from Universal Credit Claims. Universal credit allows people who are working or in self employment to earn a certain amount before deducting any UC. The government should stop automatically deducting carers allowance in the same way.",
