        "additional_details": "In the US patients are provided costly IVIG, in the U.K. the current treatment is opioids to mask the pain, yet pain is not the only symptom. SNF damage can also affect the autonomic nerves.These control multiple functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, digestion and bladder control. I ask that funding is provided in order to conduct larger clinical trials to understand the pathology and develop accessible treatments which will help prevent progression and cause further strain on the NHS.",
        "background": "Covid has been recognised as a respiratory condition yet the neurological affects can also be devastating. Small nerve fibre damage is now being recognised as a post covid complication yet the pathology is poorly understood. There is evidence that Covid has triggered an autoimmune response.",
