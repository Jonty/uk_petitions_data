        "additional_details": "With more than 56,000 Ethiopian refugees fleeing to Sudan, and the death toll reported as exceeding 1,000, the need for the conflict to be de-escalated is dire. Many citizens have already fled due to airstrikes, fearing for their lives. In addition to this, the conflict has caused property destruction, death and displacement. Ethiopia's contribution to the UK economy is likely to be reduced as the conflict escalates. We implore you to assist.",
        "background": "We would like the UK Government to provide foreign aid to the citizens of the Tigray region, who have been displaced by the violent clashes between the Ethiopian Government and the TPLF. De-escalation of the conflict through diplomatic action is also essential to facilitate a peace treaty.",
