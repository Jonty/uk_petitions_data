        "action": "Legalise the usage and purchase of pepper spray for self-defence.",
        "additional_details": "In today\u2019s society where crime rates are high and police response to calls (if can even be made) might not be speedy enough, legalising pepper spray can save someone from being a potential victim of crime. People would feel safe knowing they can defend themselves especially when having to be outside in the dark. Personal alarms are not effective (people hearing one might not think someone needs help) and often people don\u2019t want to get involved if one needs help. Self-defence is important.",
        "background": "The legal use of pepper spray as a self-defence tool needs to be authorised. Current self-defence tools are ineffective. Personal alarms can be misleading and with paint sprays, criminals can avoid public places until paint wears off + it doesn\u2019t create enough discomfort to cause them to stop.",
