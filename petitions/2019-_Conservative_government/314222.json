It is important for physical & mental health to exercise once a day however some people are acting extremely irresponsibly. We are asking for the government to impose tougher penalties to deter those from breaking the rules & preventing the spread of COVID 19.",

Although people have to exercise daily for mental & physical health, many are contributing to the spread of COVID 19 & piling more pressure onto the NHS by congregating in groups & behaving irresponsibly.",
