When it starts to happen you're advised to reposition your child.  However this does not always work, and the situation can deteriorate, and not self correct.  This condition can lead to further issues including jaw misalignment or severe headaches or even seizures.\r\n\r\nFor it to be government backed advice causing the issue on our children I feel the government should help treat the condition.",

This is not affordable for some parents, and can lead to severe life afflicting issues for children.  I would like this to be available for all in need on the NHS.",
