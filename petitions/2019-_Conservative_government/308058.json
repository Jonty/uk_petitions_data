Employees will get \u00a32500. This gap needs closing.\r\n\r\nMost self-employed have provisions for downtime, but this is unprecedented. They need urgent support from this government.",

Universal credit is not enough.\r\n\r\nThe Government should extend emergency subsidies to the self-employed.",
