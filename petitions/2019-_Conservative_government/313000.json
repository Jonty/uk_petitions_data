        "additional_details": "A-level exams are promoted as the most important exams for your future, therefore it is unfair to expect the current year 12 to: miss an unknown amount of learning time at school; apply for all the universities and apprenticeships they would like; catch up on work once back at school and take the A-level examinations in 2021 with no special consideration taken into account. For these reasons we are asking the government to consider some type of compensation or lenience within our exams.",
        "background": "The current year 12 would like some type of compensation in our A-level exams due to the loss of time in our learning because of the coronavirus. Like the current year 11 and 13, we are stressed, and would appreciate confirmation that our exams will be adjusted accordingly to the circumstance.",
