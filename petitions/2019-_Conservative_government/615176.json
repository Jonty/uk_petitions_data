        "additional_details": "Copyright law should compromise between the right of the creator to profit from their work and the right of the public to use that work for further creativity. Due to the growth of the modern economy, modern creators have the ability to profit from their work much faster, meaning that it seems wise to shorten the time that copyright lasts. Boldrin and Levine in their 2006 paper Growth and Intellectual Property suggested that the optimal length for modern copyright to last is two years.",
