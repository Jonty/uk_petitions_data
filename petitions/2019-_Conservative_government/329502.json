I understand that they had to be cancelled due to Covid 19 concerns however these results are an important part of my future and I believe the government is just messing with it . They are going to downgrade 33% of our GCSEs and  A level results . That\u2019s quite a lot. And it would be unfair because if this was just a normal year and teachers predicted me a grade I could have gotten the grade .",
