        "additional_details": "An estranged person is someone who has had no parental contact for at least 12 months, where this is unlikely to change.\r\n\r\nHigher education is not accessible to those without family support if it is to cause them repeated homelessness. There exist some universities and independent non-profits which offer year-round accommodation to a small proportion of the care-experienced and estranged student population. However, this is not enough and this needs to be mandated on a national level.",
        "background": "University students who lack family support can face homelessness during the holiday period, when university halls of residence expect students to \u201creturn home\u201d to their families. For these students, the halls are their only home. Thus, holiday accommodation should be provided to estranged students.",
