I have suffered terribly ever since and, only recently, decades later, have I begun the slow process of transition.\r\nI do not want others to suffer as I have, have their lives robbed from them or face homelessness.\r\nFully funded places at boarding schools would make it easier for children aged 16+ to choose to leave obstructive homes and live the life of their choice.",
