Although still learning they\u2019re expected to be on site the same as full time staff and pay over \u00a39000 in tuition fees for the privilege to do so. \r\n\r\nTuition fees for a course which is learnt at home.\r\n\r\nMaybe the government could think of student and at least scrap tuition fees and maintenance loans that they\u2019ve  accrued since the start of the pandemic.",
        "background": "I would like the government to consider wiping any student debt that an NHS student has accrued since the 16th of March 2020 when the first lockdown was put in place. Not only for student nurses, but student radiographers, student paramedics, student physiotherapists, etc",
