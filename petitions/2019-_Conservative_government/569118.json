Although still learning they\u2019re expected to be on site the same as full time staff and pay over \u00a39000 in tuition fees for the privilege to do so. \r\n\r\nTuition fees for a course which is learnt at home.\r\n\r\nMaybe the government could think of student and at least scrap tuition fees and maintenance loans that they\u2019ve  accrued since the start of the pandemic.",
