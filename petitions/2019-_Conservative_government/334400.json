We are yet to see the return of NLF despite most clubs being able to provide social distancing measures and guidelines which would keep us all safe. \r\nAt the time of starting this petition, Steps 1-7 are NOT allowed any fans inside the ground and all matches should be played behind closed doors. How can this be fair?\r\nOur Non-League clubs will not survive without gate/match-day income. We are yet to receive a firm start date. #LetFansIn",
