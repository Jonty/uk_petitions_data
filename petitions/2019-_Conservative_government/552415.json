        "additional_details": "It's not fair to say that because a family has a certain amount of children, their close relatives are deprived of the opportunity to see their loved ones for the first time, possibly ever.  Christmas is a time of unity, to spend time with others- we should entrust the people of the UK to make their own decisions on this day because we know how much people value freedom.\r\n\r\nWe propose that restrictions and curfews are lifted for 24 hours, with people able to see a maximum of 30 people over the day.",
        "background": "Whilst we acknowledge that limiting the spread of Covid-19 is vital, we argue the fact that to prevent people from seeing loved ones on a day where family and friends are meant to be together is fundamentally unfair, and arguably could be detrimental to some people's health and wellbeing.",
