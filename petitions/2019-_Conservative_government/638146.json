As stated above there are too many mistakes being made and delays which I believe are a result of working from home. For example I wrote to HMRC on 10.02.23 and received a response on 10.05.23. I know a lot of people who are having problems with public services whose employees are working from home still and I believe some of the delays with the NHS are down to admin staff working from home still.",
