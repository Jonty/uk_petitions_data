Current and prospective foster carers can already make a complaint about any aspect of the fostering service which affects them directly, and that fostering service will have its own process for dealing with such complaints. If you have a specific concern about the fostering service in your area, you could get in contact with them. \r\n\r\nYou could have a petition calling for the Government to hold a review of fostering services in the UK, and to fund local authorities to provide more fostering support workers, if that is something you'd like to see happen.\r\n\r\nYou may wish to sign this petition which calls for a similar action: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/615221"
