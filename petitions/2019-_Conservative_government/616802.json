        "additional_details": "I believe it is vital to that the education system helps people better understand and respect everyone equally. For example, if people are taught correct and respectful terminology at a young age, it is far more likely that they will use it in their future life. Teaching acceptance towards everyone could help reduce the number of hate crimes towards members of the LGBTQIA+ community, improve the mental health of members of the LGBTQIA+ community and aid the UK in becoming more progressive regarding LGBTQIA+ matters.",
        "background": "We want the Government to make the national curriculum more inclusive of LGBTQIA+ content, so schools are required to teach LGBTQIA+ topics in secondary schools. This should include adding LGBTQIA+ topics to History and Relationships and sex education (RSE) and health education curriculums.",
