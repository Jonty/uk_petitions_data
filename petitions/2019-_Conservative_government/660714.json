        "additional_details": "Network companies are not improving areas at all. Even a little bit of wind knocks out the network in rural areas (around 30kmh+). Most wired broadbands are very slow within the countryside which is why broadband networks are usually the only option for people living \"out of the way\". If you get rid of 3G it'll make things worse for people in those areas. Not better. What I would like is to keep network companies having 3G avaliable until all areas have stable 5G.",

It works better than 4G in the areas where 4G doesn't work well or exist. 5G still doesn't exist in most of the country. Wouldn't companies be working on it now to make things better? Nothing seems to be changing or improving.",
