        "additional_details": "I have a 13 year old who I\u2019m too scared to let out on his bike for fear of being robbed at knife point. We live in a low crime area but this is still happening to our young kids and it\u2019s becoming more and more frequent. Today it happened a stones throw from my door.\r\n\r\nBikes and phones can be replaced but the damage a knife point robbery does is irreparable, never mind the loss of an innocent life that can come from one of these situations. \r\n\r\nOur children should not live in fear of knife crime.",
        "background": "Police need more powers to stop and search anyone who they or the public feel may be in possession of a knife or bladed weapon. \r\n\r\nThey should then be given a harsh sentence of between 5-10 years in order to deter them and others of doing the same. No excuses.",
