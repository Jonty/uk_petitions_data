We do not need more sickness from this and all you are doing by introducing masks is bringing in more vulnerability, which could be avoided. Law can only be created with the consent of the population, according to the magna carta. This should not be mandatory, as it takes away an individuals sovereign right in deciding what is best for their own health and well being.",
