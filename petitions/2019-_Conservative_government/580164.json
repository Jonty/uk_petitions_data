        "additional_details": "A recent YouGov survey exposed that 97% of women in the UK have been sexually harassed in public spaces. This is outrageous. Pubs, bars and nightclubs are at the centre of this problem, and are not safe for women. This has to change. With a mandatory and appropriate number of security guards to capacity in such venues, coupled with a subsidy such that the venues can afford their wages, and a mandatory training for all guards in sexual harassment prevention, we can tackle this horrific statistic head on.",
        "background": "The Government should require an appropriate number of security staff in all pubs, bars and nightclubs, and subsidise security wages to reduce the costs of this requirement on venues. Security staff in these venues should also be required to take mandatory training on tackling sexual harassment.",
