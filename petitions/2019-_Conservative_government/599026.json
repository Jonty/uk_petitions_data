        "additional_details": "There is a critical shortage of nurses and carers.  A 30% salary increase for nurses and minimum \u00a315 per hour for carers will help retain and attract people to these roles by starting to recognise their value. The associated cost could be funded by, for example, increasing corporation tax from its current level (19%) to the level it was in 2013 (28%), stopping HS2, suitable council tax rates for second homes or those worth over \u00a32m, a 50% tax rate for those earning over \u00a3200K per year etc.",
        "background": "Proposals from the main political parties to address shortages of nurses and carers assume that the current level of pay should be the start-point for change. This is wrong. A fundamental shift is required to ensure the value of these roles is properly recognised and to attract/retain people.",
