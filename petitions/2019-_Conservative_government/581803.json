        "additional_details": "We are now aware the Country will have to live with the Covid 19 virus for a long while; to introduce an amendment within the Health and Safety act allowing Local Authorities to assess public places for their Covid safety and to then to award a rating next to their inspection. This will give the public a better understanding on how safe the establishment they are visiting is. The rating should create a safer environment, keeping business owners in check of the need to protect their customers welfare.",
        "background": "Based on the Food Standards Agency 'Scores on the Doors' rating system, public places such as shops, restaurants, supermarkets etc should periodically be inspected to check their Covid 19 safety standard. The rating would allow the public to assess the health risk before entering the premises.",
