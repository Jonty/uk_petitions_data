        "additional_details": "The Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme is of limited use to many UK employers, particularly the Entrepreneurs and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) which contribute 51% of GDP.  \r\n\r\nThe scheme protects banks by covering 80% of their losses, while employers are 100% liable for the debt.  Banks are also applying commercial lending terms and requiring personal guarantees from Directors.\r\n\r\nThis scheme is actively dissuading businesses from seeking help - this need to turn around.",
        "background": "The country must support employers during this crisis to enable them to maintain, run and develop their businesses though innovation.\r\n\r\nThe Coronavirus Business Interruption Scheme is not fit for purpose. It is risky, slow and supports banks not business. It must change or be replaced.",
