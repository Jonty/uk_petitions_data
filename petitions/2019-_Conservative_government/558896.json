        "additional_details": "When you compare the severity of crimes by UK law, Drug related crimes are being treated more severely in comparison to rape crimes. Drug crimes although cause gang related issues, do not leave anywhere near close, the impacts it has caused on innocent victims being forced to perform and take part in sexual acts against their free will. They are then left forced to carry the devastating effects of their mental health and well-being for the rest of their lives. We need justice for these victims.",
        "background": "Review and change the sentencing laws around these crimes. \r\nOur youth and adults are sexually abused and raped every day. Their abusers are facing less sentencing time and being released earlier due to \u2018good behaviour\u2019 Just for them to be a danger to society and leaving no justice for the victims.",
