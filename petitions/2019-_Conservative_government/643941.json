        "additional_details": "I have come across many American XL bully dogs who are extremely friendly, well trained and great to have as company. Instead of banning an entire breed of dogs, you need to start taking action on their owners! It\u2019s not the dogs fault if the dog has been raised and trained poorly. There are other breeds out there that are far more aggressive than this kind and this needs to be taken into consideration. STOP THE BAN.",
