        "additional_details": "NHS staff are using food banks and payday loan services to survive snd there are thousands of staff shortages and we have seen hundreds of NHS staff die over the last year. The proposed pay raise would amount to only an extra \u00a33.50 per week take-home pay for an experienced nurse. Nobody would think that is fair in the middle of a pandemic and it will do nothing to prevent NHS staff from leaving and we need all NHS staff now more than ever.",
        "background": "I am asking the government to reconsider the pay raise of 1% and  to recognise the value and contribution that NHS staff have made over the last year and pay them a larger pay increase. Giving NHS a higher salary would be starting point in view of the sacrifice made by so many during the pandemic.",
