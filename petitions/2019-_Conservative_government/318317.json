        "additional_details": "We would like the government to consider moving all band 2s especially those in acute areas up to band 3. We would also like the fact that second year nursing students have been offered this pay to be considered. despite the fact that many clinical support workers have dedicated years to the NHS and offer a much higher skill rate they are being disregarded. Clinical support workers are currently paid at the same rate as many other members of staff who do not have half as much responsibility.",
        "background": "Reconsider the pay scale for clinical support workers in the NHS, Band 2 are currently some of the hardest working and most frontline staff. Pay scale and banding does not reflect the importance and value of their role.",
