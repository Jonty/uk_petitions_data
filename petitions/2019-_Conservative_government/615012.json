        "additional_details": "On 13th April 2022, the Government announced plans to process Asylum Seekers who arrive by small boats in Rwanda. \r\nNot only is this avoiding responsibility the UK accepted when signing the Human Rights Act, but Rwanda is known for human rights violations such as forceful disappearances. This plan puts those running from danger in danger once more. \r\nFurthermore, this will cost \u00a3100,000 per person. It is unacceptable to ask the public to pay for an inhumane plan we did not ask for.",
        "background": "Reverse plans made with Rwanda to process Asylum Seekers there. \r\nEnsure that all Asylum Seekers who claim asylum in the UK are processed in the UK.\r\nAccept that Asylum Seekers arriving illegally have limited access to information regarding these policies and so this does not stop small boats.",
