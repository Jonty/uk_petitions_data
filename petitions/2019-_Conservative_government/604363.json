        "additional_details": "SUPPLY TEACHERS should not be agencies nor schools\u2019 cash cows and now we demand a return of what we worked for especially since it is a law and the government's action that the pay scale is for all teachers. The government has a duty to ensure that all are treated fairly. Supply teachers ARE BEING exploited with little to no regulations to protect them. It is now equivalent to slavery where schools, agencies, and Umbrella companies are sending supply teachers to their graves. Enough is enough",
        "background": "Supply teachers want equal pay according to our pay scale. \r\nWe demand backdated pay since the pay increased and what is owed to us since we were not paid to scale. We demand good working conditions as contracted teachers receive.\r\nWe need sick days just like contracted teachers.",
