        "additional_details": "A recent Sage paper reported that closing \u2018non-essential\u2019 retail would have minimal impact on the transmission of Covid. This is thanks to the hundreds of millions of pounds retailers have spent making their stores Covid-secure and safe for customers and colleagues.\r\n\r\nWe will come into 2021 with thousands of independent retailers bankrupt and hundreds of thousands of shop workers unemployed and unemployable, for evermore.\r\n\r\nPlease act now;  allow 'non essential' retailers to re-open.",
        "background": "The livelihoods of thousands of independent retailers are under threat.\r\nThis is unfair and unnecessary as they have spent millions on making their premises safe and hygienic.\r\nAllow them to reopen as a matter of urgency.",
