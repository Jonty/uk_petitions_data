The shops cannot keep track of who has been to shop already. Issuing a stamp book will allow the stores to see that a family household has already bought toilet paper, antibac wipes, nappies, etc for that week.",
        "background": "the public are issued with a weekly stamp book per house hold, they can then buy a set amount only of items per week. This enables others to be able to also get items for their families.",
