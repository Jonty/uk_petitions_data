        "additional_details": "By way of an example. Whilst Amazon do disclose the seller origin (consumers can select the seller name to disclose the address), this option is not available as a filter in product searches. Sellers from China for example dominate the Amazon market place. Consumers should have the option up front, to either exclude sellers and products from specific regions, e.g. China or search for product made in the UK, thereby allowing consumers in the UK to support local UK businesses if they so choose.",
