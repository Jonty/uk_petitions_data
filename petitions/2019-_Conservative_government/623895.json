        "additional_details": "A competition should begin with many UK sculptors propsong their memorial to Queen Elizabeth II. The whole nation should be allowed to vote on their favourite design.\r\n\r\nThat design should then live in perpetuity. For instance the Mayor of London might allow one on the \"4th plinth\" in Trafalgar Square.\r\nThere should be other memorials in other towns, villages and cities too.\r\n\r\nThis would ensure that the memory of our late Queen will never be forgotten.",
        "background": "We as a nation owe a debt of gratitude to the service and fortitude of her late Majesty. The impact she had on all areas of society over such a long reign is unsurpassed.",
