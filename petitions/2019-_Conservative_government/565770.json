        "additional_details": "I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s fair that Pearson test centres are not extending the theory test window of two years to help accommodate those people who have lost months on their theory test pass certification due to the pandemic. Millions of people will have to now re sit their theory tests because Pearson won\u2019t give back the months that all these people have lost.",
        "background": "I want the government to come to some sort of an arrangement with Pearson driving theory test centres so that they can extend the theory test expiry dates for those people who\u2019s driving tests were cancelled due to the lockdowns during the pandemic.",
