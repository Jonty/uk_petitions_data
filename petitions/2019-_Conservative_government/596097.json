        "additional_details": "There are multiple petitions for free prescriptions for people with certain diseases. But ANYONE who needs a repeat prescription regularly have prescription charges and many can't afford these. It is unfair that a handful of diseases have free prescriptions, meaning people with certain conditions don't have to pay but someone with an unlisted debilitating life-long condition has to pay for their prescriptions.",
        "background": "The Government should make anyone with repeat prescriptions eligible for free prescriptions so people only pay for one-off prescriptions. This means anyone with conditions that require ongoing medication (asthma, IBS, cancer, migraines, endometriosis, skin conditions) are all treated the same.",
