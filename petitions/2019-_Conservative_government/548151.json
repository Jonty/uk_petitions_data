        "additional_details": "The exam boards have cause a decrease in A-Level results by 40%. This has been cause by a large disregard of teacher's predicted grades. The Welsh, English and Scottish exam boards have failed to introduce effective systems which show student's full potential. Many students across the country have been extremely disappointed in the exam board's decisions. We need to stand against this.",
        "background": "We want the government to make exam boards across the country review all A-Level grades, due to the national unrest and exam board's disregard for teacher's predicted grades. I personally have been awarded the same grades as I achieved in AS Level, while I know my potential is much higher.",
