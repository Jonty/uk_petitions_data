        "additional_details": "The plan would release jobs for younger people, and money currently spent on unemployment benefits for non-working younger people could be paid as a reduced state pension at 60. People wishing to retire at 60 would be more available to help with child care of grandchildren which we already know is a huge and money-saving help to working parents, thereby benefitting the younger workforce and the economy. Potential for huge benefits to family life, mental and physical health, and quality of life.",
