        "additional_details": "Laws preventing the keeping, management and assistance of brothels should be completely abolished in order to make it safer and easier to monitor sex work. It can be dangerous to work in the sex industry, and legalising brothels could make it possible to protect sex workers and ensure all practices are within the law.",
        "background": "Currently, it's illegal to solicit for sex in public places or in institutions such as brothels. By altering legislation concerning sex work this will allow sex workers to find work without fear of harassment and create safer environments for sex workers to work in a comfortable, safe environment.",
