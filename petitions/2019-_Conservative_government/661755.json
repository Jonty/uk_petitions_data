        "additional_details": "As a supporter of hospices, it is heart-breaking to see many who have invested time and fundraising to keep hospices open struggle to cover the basic operating costs. Some have tirelessly fundraised to build precious rooms left empty because they cannot fund them due to cost constraints, placing added burden on donations. It is shocking, despite the reality that a well-funded hospice sector could ease the pressure on NHS and social care, hospices only receive between 20-33% of their funding from the state.",
        "background": "There are often hundreds of millions in annual FCA fines which go into the Government pot as a result of an injustice to the UK people. We believe there is no better way to use at least part of these funds than by allocating these funds to the hospice sector.",
