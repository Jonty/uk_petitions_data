It would be rounded up if not a whole number.\r\n \r\nStudents have missed 4 months of in-person teaching and face continued disruption through isolation or colleges not being fully open.\r\n \r\nWe all want students to take exams next year but there is significant variation in the level of educational input they have received which we believe makes it unfair to award based purely on exams, even if they are going to be later or have reduced content.\r\nThe government has created a teacher assessment format which can be used again in combination with exams.",
