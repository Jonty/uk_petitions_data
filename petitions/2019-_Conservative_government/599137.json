        "additional_details": "There is a critical shortage of nurses, but this can be addressed. A 30% salary increase should help retain and attract people by starting to properly recognise the value they bring to our society.\r\n \r\nThe associated cost could be funded by, for example, increasing corporation tax from its current level (19%) to the level it was in 2013 (28%), stopping HS2, increasing council tax rates for second homes or those worth over \u00a32m, a 50% tax rate for those earning over \u00a3200K per year etc.",
        "background": "Proposals to address the shortage of nurses do not adequately recognise the need for increased pay. This is wrong. A fundamental shift is required to ensure the value of this profession is properly recognised. A 30% increase would be a good start.",
