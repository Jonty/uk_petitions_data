        "additional_details": "Using previous data could result in unfair grading as the majority of this data may be inaccurate and unrepresentative of a student\u2019s ability. Most of these assessments are not always taken seriously, and could misinterpret students true potential. Students\u2019 GCSE exam results have often shown vast improvement compared to their previous data. We deserve an equal opportunity for improving and receiving fair grades. Although the option of doing our exams next academic year is available it is still highly inconvenient and sets back our future.",
        "background": "We want the Education Secretary and the Government to step in and review the exam board\u2019s decision on how GCSE and A-Level grades will be calculated and awarded due to the current coronavirus crisis. We want a better solution than just using our previous data to be the basis of our grade.",
