        "additional_details": "In parts of UK learners cannot even access a test that is 24 weeks away. Many learners can't even get a test appointment for 24 weeks in advance in their local area for several weeks. Wait times currently extend into 2023 in most areas. This causes additional costs and stress for learner drivers, and instructors can't take on new students. This backlog is creating a growing market of third party companies that use software to hold cancellations and sell them on to  learners at additional cost.",
        "background": "The Government should be extending hours of test centres during daylight hours. \r\nOpening new centres and stop all plans to close down some current ones\r\nHire more instructors to be examiners\r\nShorten length of practical tests to 25-30 minutes.\r\nStaff up number of examiners at test centers ASAP",
