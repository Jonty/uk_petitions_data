This is automatically deducted from there wages.  These NHS staff do an amazing job that is required . Why do they have to get charged to do a job that is important to everyone . They spend long hours at work . And at short notice .it would mean alot to all nhs staff if they was not charged to park on grounds . This is very costly for them",
