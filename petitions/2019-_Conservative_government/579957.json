        "additional_details": "What counts as annoyance? What counts as too loud? Who actually decides any of this? This bill has not been thought through and has been rushed out of frustration. The jail time they are proposing is absolutely ridiculous, why should a protester get 10 years when most rapists don\u2019t? This proves how incompetent and authoritative the government is, they don\u2019t care about rights, just power.",
        "background": "The wording is to vague, it is rushed and the sentencing is way to brutal. I really want it revoked but i know that won\u2019t happen. So the bill should be less broad and detail what counts as too loud or an \u201cannoyance\u201d, and the jail sentencing should be less severe.",
