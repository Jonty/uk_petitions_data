        "additional_details": "We believe it is imperative that disposable vapes are made illegal in order to protect public health. These products have become extremely popular, especially with young people, increasing risks of nicotine addiction and related health problems. Disposable vapes are often sold with flavours that appear to be intended to encourage use amongst underage users. Additionally, its single-use design significantly adds to the world's waste problem of plastic and electronics.",
