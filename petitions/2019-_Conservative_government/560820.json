        "additional_details": "Saudi Arabia is home to over 30,000 UK nationals, many of whom may wish to travel to the UK for the Christmas period. Saudi Arabia has lower levels of infection per 100,000 of population than Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE which were added to the Corridor List in recent days. \r\n\r\nSaudi Arabia is also a significant export market for UK businesses, large and small, and in post-Brexit Britain UK Plc needs to ensure that it can engage with markets like Saudi Arabia as freely as possible.",
        "background": "We would like the Government to add Saudi Arabia to the Travel Corridor List so that passengers arriving into the UK from Saudi are not subject to quarantine once the current lockdown ends.",
