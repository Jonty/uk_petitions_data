However, to enable them to do this they have been allocated up to an extra \u00a310,000 in expenses. Meanwhile our NHS Staff that we clap and applaud every Thursday at 8pm, see no benefit at all. This is despite the fact that they are fighting this virus everyday, putting themselves at risk. \r\n\r\nI propose that the extra \u00a310,000 allowance should be reconsidered and given to our NHS Frontline Staff.",
