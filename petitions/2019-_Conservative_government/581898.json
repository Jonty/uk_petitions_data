        "additional_details": "The ocean is currently being grossly overfished, destroying many vital ecosystems which are necessary for all human life. Banning the use of super trawlers would take a very important step to healing the ocean floor, would greatly reduce fishing related plastic waste that pollutes our own waters and the ocean as a whole, and finally, would also contribute to the prevention of the accidental fishing of dolphins, sharks, and whales off of our coastline.",
        "background": "We are interested in the banning of super trawlers to take a step in the right direction to heal one of our most important ecosystems. We hope this will help regulate overfishing in UK waters, and reduce the amount of fishing related plastic waste in the British Isles.",
