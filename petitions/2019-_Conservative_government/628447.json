        "action": "Properly fund Early Years. Remove the term 'childcare' when referring to EY.",
        "additional_details": "Since 1998, EY funding has increased by 53%.  NMW has increased by 289% over the same period, not including increased employer NI contributions, removal of SSP and increased holiday allowances.  The term 'free' and the term 'childcare' are both hugely misleading, and have led society to misunderstand and undervalue the development of children in the early years.  Settings are unable to provide 'free' due to the clear lack of funding as shown.  Our children have rights.  They need more.",
        "background": "Early Years has been grossly underfunded for the past 15 years.  We need a properly funded EY sector, not a babysitting service.  Proper funding will lead to high quality EY education from professionals.  Remove the term childcare to remove confusion about what young children need at this stage.",
