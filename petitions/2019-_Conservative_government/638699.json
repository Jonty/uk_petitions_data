        "additional_details": "Families can be taxed more as a household because an individual may have a higher salary, for example:\r\n \r\nFamily 1 has 2 parents, 1 earning \u00a38,000 a year and another earning \u00a360,000. Family 2 has 2 parents, both on \u00a335,000 a year.\r\n \r\nFamily 1 does not benefit from Child Benefit payments as they are deemed to earn too much, and have almost \u00a310,000 taxed at the higher rate tax, whereas family 2 are able to fully benefit from Child Benefit and pay less in tax than family 1 but have a higher gross annual income.\r\n",
        "background": "Allow households to choose whether to opt for taxation using personal thresholds or 'family thresholds', where personal thresholds are combined, as families with one higher rate earner pay tax at a higher rate even if their overall income would be within a combined standard rate tax threshold.",
