Family 2 has 2 parents, both on \u00a335,000 a year.\r\n \r\nFamily 1 does not benefit from Child Benefit payments as they are deemed to earn too much, and have almost \u00a310,000 taxed at the higher rate tax, whereas family 2 are able to fully benefit from Child Benefit and pay less in tax than family 1 but have a higher gross annual income.\r\n",
