        "action": "Reverse the 1.25% NIC increase and remove the upper earnings limit",
        "additional_details": "We believe the current system is unfair on lower paid workers, especially with the recent increase. With the current system there is an Upper Earning Limit - set at the Higher Rate Tax threshold of \u00a350,270 - beyond which an individual pays a lower rate of NIC (3.25%). This means those earning over \u00a350,270 pay a lower proportion of income in National Insurance than many lower paid workers. NIC should apply equally, without stepped rates.",
        "background": "We the undersigned want the Government to reverse the 1.25% increase in National Insurance contributions and remove the upper earnings limit on National Insurance Contributions, so that everyone earning above \u00a3190 a week pays 12% of the rest of their income on National Insurance.",
