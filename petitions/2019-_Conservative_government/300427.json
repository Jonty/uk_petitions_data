        "additional_details": "Putting live golf coverage behind a paywall means that the sport is being lost to those that cannot afford to pay for a subscription. While it also fails to capitalise on the huge numbers of people who enjoy the game. \r\n \r\nMartin Slumbers, the Chief Exec of the R&A, recently stated that 10.2 million people played golf each year in the UK. The loss of live coverage of these Majors, and the inspiration that it gave to those that watched, means that golf will forever lose generations of future stars.",
        "background": "For many years golf fans have enjoyed watching the greatest golf events on the planet live on the BBC - these include The Masters and The Open - for the first time in 2020 there will be no live coverage of Major golf events on free-to-air television. The sport could lose generations of supporters.",
