The dogs that have done this recently is awful for who\u2019s been involved but it\u2019s not the breed itself it\u2019s the owners of them,Banning a breed which a lot of people own I don\u2019t feel is fair it is down to owners they should be punished not everyone else with a dog they know wouldn\u2019t switch.",

We shouldn\u2019t all have to be punished.",
