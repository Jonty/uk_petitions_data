        "additional_details": "I buried my father today, he had dementia but sadly caught coronavirus and passed away two weeks ago. We couldn\u2019t be with him but he was cared for by amazing staff who were on lockdown along with the patients. As there are no tests being carried out outside of hospitals, it is impossible to say whether the carers are carrying anything in. This could have saved him but equally as  important there are amazing carers that are putting their lives on the line and their safety has not been sufficiently considered",
        "background": "Ensure that all residents and carers in homes and hospices are tested for coronavirus and any other virus that will follow. \r\nProvide PPE for care workers to the same standard as the NHS.\r\nLegislate for equality in level of care for NHS and care workers and patients.",
