Currently over 45% of new Covid-19 cases are attributable to care homes. As a result of the new restrictions now in place over 18 millions people have their freedom affected and restricted.  The only restrictions should be imposed on the categories proved to be at risk, i.e people with underlying health conditions or in care home, and isolation should be restricted to them. The rest of the population should live a normal life and respect the hands, face and distance directive and no further restrictions.",
