The school day has just been extended by 20 minutes so schools should complete all work required within the school day. Some adults do not work 6.5 hours 5 days a week and our children are made to. Many employers encourage staff not to take work home with them in order to improve work/life balance. Homework creates stress for children and families unnecessarily.",
