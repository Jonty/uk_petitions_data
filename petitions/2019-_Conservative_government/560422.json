        "background": "Dried pasta should be packaged in paper or recyclable plastic. A few brands already do. Ditto for dry lentils, salt, any & all long-life foods. \r\nGovernment can force change without spending a 'penne' of taxpayer's money. Simply ban non-recyclable packaging for long-life foods by the next election.",
