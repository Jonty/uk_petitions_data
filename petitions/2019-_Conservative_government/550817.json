        "additional_details": "We want the government as well as LGBTQ+ rights organisations to recognise polyamory as a kind of gender/sexual identification. This would mean that polyamorous people may not be discriminated against by the LGBTQ+ society and turned away from pride gatherings, but that they will also not be discriminated against by the general public.",
        "background": "We wish to add a second P to LGBTQ+, standing for polyamorous. At the moment, polyamory is not recognised as such. This means that many people in polyamorous could be discriminated against within LGBTQ+ society. It also means polyamorous people are not protected by the 2010 equality act.",
