        "additional_details": "After the situation many students faced last year it is apparent that cancelling exams fully will face widespread issues. Exams should be used to prove what a student has learned during there time in education but students this year have lost out on education and face to face contact with teachers which is one of the best ways for a student to learn.",
        "background": "Many students have missed about 4 months of education due to COVID-19. Some call for exams to be cancelled in 2021 but a reduction in content would allow for students to still sit exams and would be beneficial to students who have worked so hard during there academic life time.",
