        "action": "Ban the importation of wood pellets used for the generation of electricity.",
        "additional_details": "Using wood pellets releases more CO2 than burning coal. Because the government considers wood pellets as a renewable resource, by re-planting trees, the emissions are classed as carbon neutral and \u201chelps\u201d to get closer to the neutral target in 2030. This is not the case. Deforestation is happening around the world to supply the UK with wood pellets for burning, which generates around 11% of our energy needs. British taxpayers are funding this destruction of forests.",
        "background": "Importation of wood pellets should be banned and the use in power stations should be urgently reviewed. Burning of wood pellets must not be considered sustainable or a means of meeting net zero targets. Billions of UK green subsidies into this technology must stop.",
