        "additional_details": "HC1043's 'inadmissibility' rule changes:\r\n\r\n- Put refugees in danger by denying their claims outright due to passing through or deporting them to 'safe' 3rd countries like France & Greece, in which they face dire living conditions & overwhelmed asylum systems.\r\n- Effectively bar all refugees from finding safety here as it's impossible for them to reach the UK without passing through other countries.\r\n- Delay all asylum decisions without purpose as no return agreements have been negotiated.\r\n \r\nGive people fleeing war and persecution a fair chance to seek safety in the UK.",
        "background": "HC1043 changes seek to stop refugees from finding safety in the UK by:\r\n\r\n- Preventing them from claiming asylum in UK territorial waters when arriving lawfully by sea.\r\n- Making their asylum claims inadmissible if they are deemed to have passed through a 'safe' third country'.",
