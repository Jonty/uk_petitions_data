        "action": "Ban the use of Neonicotinoid Pesticides in order to protect bees",
        "additional_details": "Mr Eustice plans to allow the use of this chemical in sugar beet production, treating the seeds to prevent the spread of a virus in the crop. However, this will cause a significant risk to bees and other pollinators. \r\n\r\nNeonicotinoid pesticides should therefore be banned permanently, and not used even in the \"limited and controlled\" way proposed by the Environment Secretary.",
        "background": "Bees are major pollinators and vital to our eco system.\r\nWe have lost a third of our bee population and up to 50% of other insects in recent years.\r\nThe Government banned the use of Neonicotinoids in 2018 because of this, but now appears to have back-tracked on this wise policy.",
