        "additional_details": "Utility companies are run privately and many generate excessive profits, a large percentage of which is often paid to individuals via dividends and bonuses. We believe tax money should be used to provide, maintain, and innovate these services at the lowest price for society. Many are struggling to afford the basics, whilst private utility companies are generating vast profits and paying obscene salaries and dividends to a minority. We believe the public would benefit from these services being renationalised, and should have the opportunity to vote on this happening.",
        "background": "Let the public vote on renationalising all utility services that have been privatised, or are being contracted out to private companies. Renationalising these services would stop revenue from taxes being diverted to individuals via businesses as profit.",
