        "additional_details": "More funding should also be given to the NHS to help smokers quit. This could include counselling sessions & Nicotine Replacement Therapy.\r\n\r\nAdolescents who smoke usually rely on over-18s to buy cigarettes for them. If the age were raised to 21, teenagers would surely be less likely to procure cigarettes. During the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, protecting people's health is more important than ever. Cancer is one of the main causes of death, and should be prevented as much as possible.\r\n\r\nThe USA has already raised their smoking age to 21, as have many Asian countries. New Zealand is phasing out combustible cigarettes altogether.",
