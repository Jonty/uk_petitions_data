        "additional_details": "The goal of a development agency is to reduce and abolish poverty and human rights abuse. Merging DFID with the FCO will hinder this goal, and goes against the basic international development principles as outlined by the ICRC of neutrality (with regard to politics) and potentially impartiality.",
        "background": "Development agencies should be independent and apolitical. DFID should be an independent development agency, separate from the FCO. Aid should be provided based on the need of countries, not politics or the Government's 'connection' with other countries.",
