        "additional_details": "We believe this change is needed to ensure people feel they have had a fair trial, as per their rights under the Human Rights Act.\r\n \r\nI was taken to court over my cat but though I disagreed with the judgement I had no right to appeal.\r\n \r\nIn the criminal courts the burden of proof is higher, and rights to appeal a judgement are less restrictive.\r\n \r\nIn a 'small claims court' case where the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities there is no right to appeal if you disagree with the original judgement. I strongly feel that there should be a right to have case reviewed by a second Judge if someone does want to appeal.\r\n",
