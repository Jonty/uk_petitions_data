        "additional_details": "The moral reason: We believe people deserve to own what they make, but it's harder to justify human ownership of things no one made: Land and its natural resources. Thus, it is fairer to tax land than production.\r\n\r\nThe practical reason: Taxing production can reduce production but taxing land cannot reduce land. Competition between producers regulates prices of produced things, whereas according to the ONS land represents 60% of the UK\u2019s wealth, and half of land is owned by 1% of the population.",
