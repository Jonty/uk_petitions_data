        "additional_details": "In paying 0.7% or \u00a314.5 billion per year of the UKs Gross National Income to overseas aid the government is failing to provide for its it's own population. As a result we have seen infrastructure, the military, emergency services, NHS and social care cut to the point where they could be described as crippled due to lack of funding. Overseas aid may be wasted, if used at home the benifit to the UKs population would be enormous and measurable in terms of improving our society's well being.",
