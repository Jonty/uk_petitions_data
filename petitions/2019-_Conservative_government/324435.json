It would be a absolute travesty if this Zoo was forced into bankruptsy by covid rules that mean it has to stay shut. They are in desperate need of finance and at a time when parks and beaches that cant be monitored for social distancing are allowed to open, there is no good reason to keep this Zoo with its massive open spaces and well thought out monitoring of social distance closed. Please allow it to open before its too late.",
