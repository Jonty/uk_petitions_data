        "additional_details": "People are able to easily access fireworks which can be set of at any time throughout the year. Last night persons near to me set of fireworks at 10.30 pm without warning. This caused great stress to my dogs. Noise can be extremely stressful for people with dementia. Given the numbers of people living with dementia, sudden loud unexplained noises can cause a great deal of agitation and stress. We are selling explosives to members of the public, which, if in the wrong hands, could cause harm.",
        "background": "Consider banning the sale of fireworks to the public to safeguard vulnerable people, such as those with dementia, and animals from unnecessary stress.",
