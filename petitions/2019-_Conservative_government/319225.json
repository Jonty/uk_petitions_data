        "additional_details": "By making plant and tree sales exempt from VAT, this would reduce the costs to the public, thereby stimulating sales and make gardening more accessible to more people.  Gardening has a direct benefit to physical and mental health, and is an activity that has numerous benefits to an individual.  The garden centre industry is unique to Britain, and is held in warm regard by the general public.  Following lockdown, gardening and it's associated benefits will be more important than ever.",
        "background": "The UK horticultural industry has suffered unprecedented damage due to the COVID19 lockdown.  We would like all plant and tree sales to be exempt from VAT for at least 5 years in order to reduce costs to the public and thereby stimulate sales and regrowth of the industry.",
