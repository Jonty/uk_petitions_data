        "additional_details": "The level of understanding/competency in topics that were home taught still remains and testing to get a grade is still the same as sitting an exam. Whilst exams may be the fairest way, should all students have the same opportunity, students' education will have been affected differently during the pandemic and the added pressure of external exams may cause under performance. A-level students will also be competing for university places with many candidates who were given their predicted grade.",
        "background": "Ofqual announced that consideration of externally set short papers are to replace the 'cancelled' exams. As an A-level student I represent the next generation and wish for all students to have teacher assessed test or predicted grades, as many believe this would be much fairer than external exams.",
