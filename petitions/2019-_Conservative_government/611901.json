        "additional_details": "Approximately eight percent of people in jail have schizophrenia or psychosis. It is morally wrong that so many mentally ill people are in jail when they should be in a mental hospital so they can be cured instead of punished. I am asking the government to do this for reasons of morality. \r\nSeventy percent of people with schizophrenia respond to anti-psychotic medication, proving that with most people their illness can be managed successfully.",
        "background": "I would like the government to discuss how mentally ill people who commit offences are treated. Currently people who suffer from schizophrenia or psychosis go to jail if they commit an offence when they should be sent to a hospital to be cured.",
