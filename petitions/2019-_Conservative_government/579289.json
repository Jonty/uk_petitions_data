        "additional_details": "Learning physical self-defence or following \u2018survival techniques\u2019 is not always possible, practical, or effective. Pepper spray is legal in the US, Australia, and France, and is used to cause mild irritation to perpetrators, giving victims chance to escape.\r\nSevere, permanent damage from pepper spray is rare, but lower concentrations; age restrictions; license requirements for higher concentrations; \u2018safety\u2019 caps; penalties for intentional misuse, can counter safety concerns.",
        "background": "Legalise the ownership of pepper spray in statute, and for the legalisation of its use as reasonable force in self-defence against an immediate threat. In light of recent events; help people in the United Kingdom be safe.",
