        "additional_details": "The Levlling Up Fund was designed to fix economic differences between different parts of the UK that directly affect people\u2019s lives. \r\n\r\nThe terms of grants means that some smaller councils can\u2019t accept the risk associated with the grant, resulting in increasing poverty.\r\n\r\nSmaller councils, already struggling with current economic conditions, are unable to accept the level of risk associated with grants. This is distorting the process with more grants to affluent areas increasing inequality.",
        "background": "We want the UK government to review Levelling up Fund terms & conditions that place all risks of grant awards on Councils.\r\n\r\nRemove these terms or confirm that, otherwise well managed, projects that may be affected by unpredictable market supply conditions will not be further penalised.",
