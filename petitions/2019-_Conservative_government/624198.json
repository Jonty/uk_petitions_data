Buyers are less likely to enquire about a property without a floorplan\r\n2. A floorplan is more important than the main image or the summary description\r\n3. Home-hunters are less likely to arrange a viewing if there is no floorplan\r\n\r\nThe above relates to buyers, but it is the same for renters: requiring floorplans will result in less time wasted for all parties.",
        "background": "I want it to be a legal requirement for any property websites to include floor plans with metric dimensions on all property listings.\r\n\r\nSquared measurements can be misleading in certain rooms, so each dimension should have its own measurement - for example; a kitchen island, as well as the walls.",
