We need a population with the necessary skills, level of education or creative abilities to grow our economy and improve the wellbeing of the country. An educated population is a happy prosperous one, who can also pass to their children this learning and further develop the UK. Borrowing huge amounts of money could dissuade future leaders in industry and the arts.",
