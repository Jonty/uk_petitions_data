        "additional_details": "Many UK citizens have families in red list territories and haven\u2019t been able to reunite with family for months as a result of the pandemic. The cost of \u00a31,750 for hotel quarantine upon arrival makes it nearly impossible for us to visit our families. I am from South Africa (there are almost 250,000 South Africans in England) and even though we have a varient of concern in SA, home quarantine and test to release should offer enough protection especially if we are double jabbed.",
        "background": "We want the government to allow home quarantine and test to release schemes for double jabbed UK citizens (as opposed to \u00a31,750 hotel quarantine) in order to make it possible for us to reunite with our families in our home countries.",
