It is time that it is recognised as a medical condition to not only spread awareness about the extent of sufferers\u2019 anger or distress, but to provide appropriate treatment as well. To add to the growing list of the NHS\u2019 successes, people who suffer from Misophonia - fear or extreme hatred of certain trigger sounds - should be represented within the UK\u2019s medical system. It is important that sufferers receive treatment.",
