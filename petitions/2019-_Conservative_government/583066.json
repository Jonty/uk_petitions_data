My eldest son is 17 and my youngest daughter is 8 months old. In these 17 years this is something that has not improved at all. Having visited a theme park this week I spotted several smoking areas but nowhere to feed my baby. The smoking areas were cornered off with ash trays and a few seats. I found myself feeding my baby on a cold wet floor! This needs to change!",
