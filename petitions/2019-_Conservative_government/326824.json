        "additional_details": "Our communities are over-policed and underfunded. The Metropolitan police, instead of protecting us, are a discriminatory and divisive force that only serve to exacerbate existing social issues.\r\n\r\nWith adequate resources in areas that are currently underfunded, such as youth services, public housing and mental health services, the vacuum that policing and prisons fill with punitive and racist violence could be replaced with services that tackle the causes of harm and crime at their roots.",
        "background": "Defund the Metropolitan police and divert those funds into local, grassroots services that help us rebuild and unite our communities.\r\n\r\nWe demand proper funding of mental health services, youth clubs  and public housing instead of financing policing tactics that actively harm marginalised people.",
