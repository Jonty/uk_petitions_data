        "additional_details": "With teacher strikes becoming more frequent in the United Kingdom, the time available to receive teaching on A-level courses is becoming limited. It is unclear as to how many strikes there will be in the future, but now there have been plans to have more than one a week. Missing a minimum of two days of lessons in a week is incredibly damaging and stressful for students. In simple terms, the courses just cannot be taught adequately and there are no longer a sufficient number of teaching hours.",
        "background": "Advanced information, as given to those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, is vital and only fair if A-level students wish to succeed and fulfil their potential and so the Government should act to offer this as they are at a disadvantage.",
