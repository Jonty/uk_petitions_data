        "additional_details": "We need these rates to be revised by HMRC so they are up to date and fair. If a flight is delayed by an hour this can mean dropping from the 24-hour rate to the 10-hour rate. This is a common occurrence in air travel so crew are being penalised for something out of their control. The scale rates should provide a wider range of rates for different time intervals, so that people falling between rates are not unfairly penalised. Rates for all countries also need to be increased to reflect actual costs.",
        "background": "HMRC sets scale rate expenses for accommodation and subsistence paid to employees who travel outside of the UK, such as cabin crew. The rates are not reflective of the real costs for people whose work takes them abroad, and the way rates vary for different time intervals is also unfair.",
