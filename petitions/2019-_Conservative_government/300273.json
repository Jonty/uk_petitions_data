        "action": "To introduce video recording and broadcasting of proceedings in the civil courts",
        "additional_details": "This petition follows on from the welcome revelation that broadcasting will be permitted in the Crown Court.\r\n\r\nThe video recording and broadcasting of civil proceedings would greatly enhance transparency and the principle of open justice. Most civil cases are already recorded by audio, thus it is difficult to envisage why video recording would not be possible.\r\n\r\nRecordings could also assist practitioners seeking to appeal a case, aid in professional development and could inspire aspiring lawyers.",
        "background": "This petition calls for the introduction of routine video recording and broadcasting in the civil courts of England and Wales.  Whilst sought for all proceedings, it is considered that all cases in courts of record and all appeals (including the County Court) should be the minimum starting point.",

We're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government to do. It is currently prohibited to make visual and sound recording of court proceedings, with the exception of the recording and broadcast of sentencing remarks made by specified judges in the Crown Court when sitting in open court, where the judge has given their consent. Any recordings currently made in the civil or family court aren't made available to parties or the public. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition calling on the Government to legislate to enable routine video recording and broadcasting in the civil courts of England and Wales.\r\n\t\r\n"
