        "additional_details": "The Government must accept that the pandemic has caused such significant differential disruption to the education of the 2021 cohort that there is no way a one-size-fits-all approach could deliver a fair and equitable outcome for all. Students have had their lives turned upside down by this pandemic and face bleak future prospects. The government should be doing their utmost to give this cohort the best start in life  and this proposal ensures that.",

Students should be able to chose between being awarded their predicted grades used for UCAS or teacher assessed grades with the option to sit a mini exam.",
