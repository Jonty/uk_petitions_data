        "additional_details": "Unfortunately waste management companies are benefitting from not having to pay similar taxes to that which are imposed on land-fill.\r\n\r\nCommunities across the breadth of the UK have campaigned against waste incinerators as many do not want one in their town or city.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for this are clear:\r\n\r\n1) Incinerators risk harm to the health of local residents\r\n2) Incinerators can pollute the air with toxic emissions\r\n3) Incinerator emissions contribute to global warming\r\n4) Incinerators can harm the environment",
        "background": "We want the government to follow the example set in the EU by banning any new incinerators for the purpose of waste disposal. They should also ban pyrolysis facilities, and instead seek the solutions we need to reduce waste completely by investing in waste reduction, reuse and recycling.",
