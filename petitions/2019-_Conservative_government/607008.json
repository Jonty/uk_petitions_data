        "action": "Make Skilled Workers eligible for permanent residence after 3 years",
        "additional_details": "As the UK aims to attract skilled workers, it should lower the time necessary to attain permanent residence (ILR) to 3 years. This should make us more competitive in the global skilled workers market where nations like Australia and Canada offer permanent residence on arrival to people with the right skills.\r\n \r\nImmigrants should have deep links to the country before they are given ILR. So I am not calling on the Government to give permanent residence visas on arrival but after 3 years of residence.",
        "background": "The UK needs skilled workers. It is also right that skilled workers develop roots in Britain before they are allowed to live here permanently. However, people in the UK on Skilled Worker visas should be eligible to apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) after three years, not the current five.",
