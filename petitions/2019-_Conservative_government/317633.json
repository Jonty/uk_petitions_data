        "action": "Extend Theory Test Certificate whose tests are affected by the COVID-19",
        "additional_details": "Consider extending the theory certificate -many people including myself have previously booked a driving test for March which was cancelled due to the current situation and suspended for 3months. I have a test booked in June but my theory certificate is due to expire in June. If I fail, I will be left with 1 week to rebook another test which is not guaranteed. This is no fault of my own as I was hoping to have passed by now. I feel we are disadvantaged and have unequal opportunity.",
        "background": "Candidates who would have been due to take a test may have to face a retest due to expiring theory test certificates before practical test dates are issued. Making someone pay again needlessly through no fault of their own is no more than profiteering.",
