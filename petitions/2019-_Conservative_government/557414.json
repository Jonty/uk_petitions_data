        "additional_details": "Gyms are following strict guidelines provided by the government and are not high risk for transmission of COVID-19 - in fact they are a protective factor, this has been supported in research. Closure of fitness facilities leads to an increase in weight and a decrease in fitness levels, making the population more vulnerable to COVID-19 and therefore more of a strain on our health services. It also has a beneficial impact on mental health, which in the current times is more important than ever.",
