        "action": "Legalise, tax and control cannabis.",
        "additional_details": "The dangers often brought up by the government are preventable with education on Cannabis and control of the substance. The illegality of the substance has caused growers and dealers to grow and sell more potent and more potentially psychologically damaging strains in order to compete. The views held by the government at this point are doing more damage than good. It is vital that the government legalise, educate, tax and control this substance for the safety of the public.",
        "background": "The Government should reconsider their stance on Cannabis. Many of the concerns the government have about the substance stem from the drugs illegal status. Legalisation could benefit both its users and the government as it can be taxed and controlled.",
