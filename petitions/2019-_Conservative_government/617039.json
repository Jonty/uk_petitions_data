It is simply not fair or decent to let any businesses profiteer on the back of making ordinary people suffer financial hardships when it is simply not necessary. \r\nA government run utility company could offer mass employment and honest prices whilst making a modest profit to cover costs. This would also negate the constant tax incentives or payments to \u2018help\u2019 people cope.",
