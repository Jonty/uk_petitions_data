        "additional_details": "Unprecedented volume of residential property purchases/sales from summer 2020/2021 has exacerbated flaws in the process:\r\nHouse purchases/sales are biggest financial decisions in the lives of most. The process for buyers and sellers is high risk, expensive, cumbersome and inefficient as many are in chains for months. Costs climb as buyers and sellers pull out of deals. Severe impacts on mental health and wellbeing of failed transactions and 'living in limbo' waiting for transactions to finish.",
        "background": "Remove risks to buyers/sellers. Remove wasted costs. \r\nSeller conducts full survey and publishes results when marketing property. When an offer is agreed it is legally binding. Buyers must provide % deposit. Estate agents better regulated + pay compensation to buyer/seller if provide misinformation.",
