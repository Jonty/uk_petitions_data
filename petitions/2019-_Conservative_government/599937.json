        "additional_details": "Achieving this would make schools a shining example and beacons for environmental change. Not only would the energy efficiencies count towards our UK carbon reduction targets but the message sent out to all pupils and students in schools would be that of positive change, and would surely spread throughout society. There are just under 25,000 schools in England. A Government pledge to drive schools towards carbon neutrality would be an investment fit for everyone's futures.",
        "background": "The Government should pledge to cut schools' carbon footprints to zero. This could be achieved through the installation of air source heat pumps, solar panels on roofs, energy efficient lighting, better insulation and other energy efficiency measures.",
