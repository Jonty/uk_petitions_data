        "action": "Decriminalise cannabis derivatives for the upcoming recession, due to COVID-19",
        "additional_details": "If the UK decriminalised the sales/cultivation of cannabis for the upcoming recession due to COVID-19. The Police would no longer be wasting a million hours of their time and tax payers money, the courts can focus their attention on the real issues of organised crimes, with cannabis being decriminalised the families fighting to push for the NHS to prescribe cannabis can then cultivate in their own homes. The UK government could easily be making \u00a31BN annually based off 20% tax on illegal sales.",
        "background": "In 2020 we are more equipped with knowledge on cannabis than ever before, we are seeing the beneficial impact cannabis has on hundreds of medical conditions, it is something we need to have on hand and with  this I would like a public vote on cannabis consumption and cultivation decriminalisation.",
