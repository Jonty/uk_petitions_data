        "additional_details": "We are amongst the lowest paid carers in the UK and classed as self-employed but we care for some of the UK\u2019s most vulnerable and traumatised children. Many more children could come into care during this pandemic. Foster carers will be asked to take in even more new children, exposing themselves and their households to infection. We are willing to step up but at what cost? If we become too ill to care we may lose our income, our homes and the ability to foster in the future.",
        "background": "Working 24/7 through the lockdown, 55000 foster care workers look after 65000 children. On a low wage and with no sick pay, getting ill and self-isolating could cost us our jobs and the children their home. That\u2019s why we need the government to grant us Sick Pay.",
