For every meal my son has to weigh his food, internet search the carbohydrate content and convert that into insulin units to administer to ensure his blood glucose levels stay at a healthy range. Nutritional info is listed for food allergies, intolerances, vegetarian, vegan and the traffic light system so why are diabetics not supported and struggling to keep themselves alive.",
        "background": "Make it compulsory for all restaurants/food establishments/food packaging to list its carbohydrate content information on all foods/meals to support people with Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes as this will aide diabetics when administering their insulin.",
