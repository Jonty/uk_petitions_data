        "action": "Ban wind farm onshore asset development on green belt land",
        "additional_details": "We are concerned that in locations such as the Fylde, building windfarm onshore assets and laying the associated cabling on the greenbelt could hamper tourism, destroy high-quality farmland and ruin habitats for protected species. We want the available brownfield land to be utilised for development of wind farm onshore assets.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the use of concrete offsetting water in saturated land in the construction of windfarm onshore assets could increase flooding. We are also concerned that substations built close to homes and schools could be audible 24/7 and rural land would be industrialised when there are alternative routes, which we believe have far less impact. We think that such plans are being made for profit, not the environment.\r\n",
        "background": "We want the Government to ban wind farm onshore asset development on green belt land. We don't think local authorities are enforcing the National Planning Policy Framework to protect the greenbelt from inappropriate development. ",
