        "additional_details": "The proposed loss of many routes will surely impact many bus users, many of whom cannot use any other form of transport (for physical reasons). It will surely increase transit costs, making transport unaffordable for many.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of bus mileage will also result in increased car and taxi use, which will in turn release more pollutants into the environment.\r\n",
        "background": "The Government has required Transport for London (TfL) to make savings as a condition of its emergency funding, and as a result TfL is proposing to reduce the number of kilometres travelled by its buses by 4% by 2024/25. The Govt should increase TfL\u2019s funding so it doesn\u2019t have to cut bus routes.",
