        "additional_details": "Due to the disruption of COVID-19, as well as having inadequate time to prepare and the damage to their mental and physical wellbeing. Making students sit their exams in such unforeseen circumstances is unjust and unfair. Not all students have access to remote learning which leaves them at an unfair disadvantage from the start. Even those who do, have experienced untold amounts of stress and anxiety thought the year and will continue to do so throughout the pandemic.",
        "background": "I want all educational exams cancelled for students within England for 2021. Instead to have their grades determined impartially by teacher assessed grades based on their work in the classroom and mock examinations results.",
