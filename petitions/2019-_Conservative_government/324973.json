        "additional_details": "One spark from a barbecue is enough to set a catastrophic wildfire in motion. The ease of access to disposable barbecues leaves precious landscapes open to destruction on the spontaneous whim of a day-tripper. Already in 2020, many catastrophic wildfires caused by disposable barbecues have started across the UK & despite bans on use in place, are devastating landscapes that are of global environmental importance. Bans are not observed & millions of pounds of investment are going up in flames.",
        "background": "Ban disposable barbecues at the point of sale to protect habitats of internationally important species, to protect the ecosystem services that these landscapes provide [resilience to flooding & climate change, water quality] & to protect the natural beauty for the health & well-being of the public.",
