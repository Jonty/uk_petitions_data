        "additional_details": "Every day living for people with disabilities is more expensive than for those without. Lower mobility  means a need to heat homes more to avoid loss of circulation to limbs. Equipment needs charging. Disabled people have to pay for equipment for example a new wheelchair cost \u00a33000. Public transport is inaccessible. Many disabled people are unable to access well paid jobs through discrimination or because of a need to frequently access medical support. These benefits are essential not a luxury.",
        "background": "Government needs to give a categorical assurance that, in the Autumn Statement, they will rule out means-testing Personal Independence Payments, Carer\u2019s Allowance, Attendance Allowance and Disability Living Allowance for Children.",
