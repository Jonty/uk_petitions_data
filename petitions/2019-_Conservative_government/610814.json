        "additional_details": "Morally this is questionable as many are facing stark choices between energy and food. There is also an element of Energy Security as it places more reliance on the world energy markets.\r\n\r\nWe should be looking to help those in need and address our own future energy use. It is not an \u2018Energy Crisis\u2019, it\u2019s a Usage Crisis.",
        "background": "Many are in fuel poverty and yet many generate their own energy at home. Excess is sold to energy provides at very low rates via the SEG (5p/kWh) and resold back by them at much higher rates, (35p/kWh). This needs to change.",
