        "additional_details": "A simple blood test given to pregnant women would be able to identify some genetic disorders the woman may carry. By knowing this information further testing can be done to confirm whether the baby carries the genetic disorder. The parents and medical staff having this information would mean the parents are able to make an informed decision and the medical staff are able to put a plan in place for the baby after birth. This could lead to less babies dying from undiagnosed genetic disorders.",
