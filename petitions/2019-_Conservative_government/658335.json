        "additional_details": "Silica is naturally occurring in stone however some engineered worktops can be 97% silica. While UK stonemasons may be confident that they have the strongest health and safety measures in place to protect their team, we believe the risk of this material is not necessary when there are alternatives on the market.\r\n\r\nEngineered stone is a large market in the UK and we urge the UK government to ban the sale of this product.\r\n",
        "background": "We want high-silica engineered stone worktops banned due to the risk of silicosis resulting from silica dust particles when improperly cut. This stone is a common product in the market in the UK. Engineered stone will be banned in most parts of Australia.",
