My question is why are most of the working places, primary and secondary schools are normally open in which there is a much higher risk of contamination than universities? That's why we want these changes. If these changes can't be applied to this situation then we think that it would be sensible to decrease the courses' fees by a certain proportion according to the situation and negotiations",
