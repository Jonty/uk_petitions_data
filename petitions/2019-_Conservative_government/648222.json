Trying to pay for rent and care for a disabled child can be a struggle and we believe the Government's helping hand is not enough.\r\n \r\nFamilies with a disabled child receive an extra \u00a3146.31 of Universal Credit a month, and families with a severely disabled child receive an extra \u00a3456.89 a month. Considering the needs of children with disabilities, including dietary requirements, energy bills increasing due to medical equipment and parking fees for hospital appointments, we believe this is not enough.\r\n",
