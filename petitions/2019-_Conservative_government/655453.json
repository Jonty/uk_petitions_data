        "additional_details": "The Right To Buy provides tenants with something to show for years of paying rent. When it comes to owning your home, it can if necessary be sold to pay for care later in life, it also gives us less dependency on the state. A home that has been bought can be handed down to your children. If the right to buy was introduced to housing association tenants, it could provide hundreds of thousands of poorer households with the financial security that goes with owning your own home. We deserve our HOME",
