There have been measures taken to ensure that the public remain safe, but not enough is being done, or, not enough people are taking the rules seriously. \r\n\r\nThe transport services have been reduced but there are still plenty of workers still needing to travel, meaning more packed than usual which is not exactly recommended at this time. Some ask if they can work from home, but they are fired instead.\r\n\r\nIn the UK, an 18 year old has become the youngest victim, and a 21 year old both passed away due to the virus.\r\n\r\nChina had a very strict lockdown for 2 months, and now they are gradually returning back to a normal life. If we do the same, we can also go back to living normally.",
