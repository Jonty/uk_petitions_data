        "additional_details": "The National Student Money survey identified the vast impact of the rising cost of living on students. Some key findings were: \r\n- The average maintenance loan falls short of covering the cost of living by \u00a3439 a month, and the average student's parents contribute \u00a3150 a month.\r\n- Bills are the third most significant cost for students and are the area of spending which has increased the most since 2021.\r\n- 52% of students have considered dropping out due to finances.",
        "background": "Student maintenance loans have only increased by 2.3% which falls short of inflation, leading to students struggling with the cost of living. The current cold weather poses a significant risk to students' health as some cannot afford their heating - they should be eligible for cold weather payments.",
