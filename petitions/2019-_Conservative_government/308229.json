        "additional_details": "The rapid spread of the virus and interruptions to illegal supplies will lead to people taking unnecessary risks, consuming contaminated drugs, or going into withdrawal. This will be happening at a time when there is little medical or social support, and will lead to deaths, further pressure on the NHS, and further spread of the virus throughout our communities.\r\n \r\nUK law already provides for the prescription of drugs in the treatment of addiction, e.g. diamorphine. Please look at rapid expansion of this to vulnerable groups, where there are suitable legal alternatives available.",
        "background": "Self-isolation and social distancing will not be possible for many physically vulnerable people during the COVID-19 outbreak due to drug addiction. 'Safe supply' is a proven method of harm-reduction, and would save many lives.",
