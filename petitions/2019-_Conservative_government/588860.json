        "action": "End period poverty by making all sanitary products in England to free.",
        "additional_details": "Period poverty is a real thing with thousands of women suffering daily. Scotland have made all sanitary products free, and i believe we should follow in their footsteps. If this isn\u2019t possible, i would like for period products to be at least more accessible. I hope you agree and spend just a few minutes of your day to sign this petition and help make change for the better.",
        "background": "The average women spends \u00a313 on period supplies a month. For example \u00a38 on new underwear, \u00a32 on pain relief and \u00a33 on sanitary pads. This adds up to \u00a3306 a year. It\u2019s a natural process that we cannot help and it being so expensive to feel sanitary is so upsetting.",
