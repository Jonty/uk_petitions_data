The teams will still only work with around 1/3 of pupils in England by 2023, and are currently only in certain geographical areas.\r\n \r\nIn a survey by BACP and You Gov (2022), 82% of parents with children aged 4-17 believe counselling/psychotherapy should be freely available to all school children.\r\n \r\nWe believe not having a dedicated mental health professional in every secondary school academy and FE college in England risks exacerbating mental health issues facing young people.",
