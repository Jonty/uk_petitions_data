The teams will still only work with around 1/3 of pupils in England by 2023, and are currently only in certain geographical areas.\r\n \r\nIn a survey by BACP and You Gov (2022), 82% of parents with children aged 4-17 believe counselling/psychotherapy should be freely available to all school children.\r\n \r\nWe believe not having a dedicated mental health professional in every secondary school academy and FE college in England risks exacerbating mental health issues facing young people.",
        "background": "We believe the Government's plans to support children and young people's mental health in England are inadequate, and that all secondary schools and colleges should be required to have a full-time counsellor on staff. This is particularly important given rates of mental health issues and suicide.",
