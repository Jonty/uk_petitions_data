        "action": "Make it mandatory for solar power to be built and installed on new build houses.",
        "additional_details": "Housing builders and solar companies must liaise and develop plans to consolidate their actions. The roof will be a hot topic, but the house builders must take a shared responsibility with the solar installers for the production of a guarantee and warranty that protects the home owners should a roofing issue develop. But we need to stop taking from the environment under the illusion we are protecting it. If you want to protect it, build solar sites on roofs.",
        "background": "It makes no sense to take away green field sites to install solar power when we are building houses at an astonishing rate. These new solar farms are there to support the new houses so why not install them on the houses and keep the green fields, green.",
