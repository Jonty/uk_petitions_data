        "additional_details": "It is deeply unfair that the Government has opted to vaccinate its entire adult population first before offering any surplus supplies to vulnerable populations in other countries.  Both processes should occur simultaneously.  All lives are of equal value.  Vulnerable people in other counties will die whilst waiting.  Nationalism has taken hold across the world in many ways recently and this needs to be reversed.  This action needs to take place now to save lives.",
