        "additional_details": "Earlier in Liz Truss's premiership she stated that fracking would go ahead in areas as long as there is local support; as a constituent of Blackpool I can categorically state that there has already been passionate resistance to previous attempts to frack in the area. Fracking cause tremors which are a threat to peoples houses and livelihoods as seen elsewhere in the world, furthermore, fracking also disrupts and displaces wildlife due to noise pollution and the destruction of natural habitats.",
        "background": "To vote against fracking in the UK to uphold our country's commitment to the global fight against climate change and prevent the environmental disasters caused by fracking in other countries from occurring in our country; preserving our beautiful rural areas, its wilderness and biodiversity.",
