        "additional_details": "Many students are out of routine and find it hard to keep to the same level of learning with some lacking space/resources. A survey by the charity YoungMinds found 80% of teens/young adults say COVID made their mental health worse. An NEU member raised concerns that lack of changes to A-level content would increase inequalities created by COVID. The ASCL also warned the proposed changes are too little. As an A level student I believe the current decisions/proposals should be more realistic.",
        "background": "The current proposals for change to the 2021 A level examinations don't do enough to take into account the decline in students' mental health during lockdown as well as other aspects and the effects these are having on learning with teaching organisation also raising concerns over current plans.",
