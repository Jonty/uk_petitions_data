        "additional_details": "UK participation in the EHIC scheme ensures that British citizens visiting the EU, EEA and Switzerland for a temporary stay can access healthcare, including treatment of chronic or pre-existing medical conditions and maternity care, for free or at discounted prices. \r\n\r\nWithout continued participation in the scheme, the cost of travel insurance cost for UK citizens travelling to other European countries will increase substantially, especially for those with pre-existing medical conditions.",
        "background": "The Government should negotiate continued UK participation in the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) scheme beyond December 31st 2020.\r\n\r\nThis will ensure that UK citizens, especially those with pre-existing and chronic health conditions, can continue to visit European countries as they do now.",
