It could have reduced the impact on the economy due to less transmission, and it could have reduced the strain seen on the NHS.\r\n\r\nTens of millions of people's lives have been impacted. If the impact of this pandemic could have been reduced in the UK by limiting international travel, we need to know why decisions were taken, and who is responsible.",
