She had not had a check-up for the 18 months she had been on the combined pill. If she had received regular check-ups the clot could have been caught and she might still be here today. Her name is Riszka Szymkowska and she was 22 years old.",

Currently patients can easily get repeat prescriptions without seeing their GP or having any health checks. This can mean risk factors are missed.",
