        "additional_details": "The British Empire has often been glamorised and the global impact of Britain\u2019s colonialism downplayed. This has been reflected in the content taught. We have learnt all about the World Wars and would be horrified if Germany was refusing to teach their students  about it. So why should it be any different, English schools should have to teach children about uncomfortable history where Britain exploited people, and explain why it is responsible for racism today. \r\n\r\nEducation beats ignorance",
        "background": "Britain benefited from colonialism and politicianry for centuries. This needs to be represented in the curriculum.\r\nThe legacies of politicianry and colonialism have very real impacts on BAME communities across Britain today, and the English education system needs to recognise this.",
