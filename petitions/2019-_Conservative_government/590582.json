        "action": "Give COVID vaccines to the most vulnerable in other countries before UK children",
        "additional_details": "With so few people in developing countries vaccinated, there is a huge  danger of the Delta variant spreading fast unless vaccination improves. This will overwhelm health systems leading to a huge rise in deaths as oxygen runs out, healthcare professionals are affected and other care halted. Do we really believe that vaccinating young children in the rich world is as important and ethically justified as vaccinating key workers and the most vulnerable in developing countries?",
        "background": "The UK Government must share any available COVID vaccines so that they can be used to vaccinate key workers and the most vulnerable people in developing countries before using them to vaccinate children in the UK.",
