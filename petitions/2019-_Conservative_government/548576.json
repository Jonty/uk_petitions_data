Place the legal onus on the shops and relevent organisations not to admin or to not serve those who do not wear face coverings without evidence of exemption. \r\n\r\n2. Put in place a more effectively rolled out card system for those with legitimate grounds for exemption. They can keep their exemption card on them or on a lanyard and would not need to disclose the reason for their exemption. The cards would need to be issued based on evidence of their exemption. \r\n\r\nThis will save lives.",
