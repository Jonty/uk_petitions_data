        "action": "Censure the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)  for violations of License",
        "additional_details": "It is clear that for the last five years the BBC has been influenced by the actions of the US main stream media which has attempted to resist the wishes of THE PEOPLE with respect to the outcome of the BREXIT referendum and the election of the 45th President of the USA.    Followers of CNN, MNBC et al can witness the bias with which their so called investigative journalists broadcast opinions, not news, poisoning the real news. I have complained many times, formally, to the BBC with no impact",
        "background": "This petition is to ask Parliament to censure the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)  for repeated, and sometimes continuous, violations of its broadcasting license which requires the BBC to be unbiased",
