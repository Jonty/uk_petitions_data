        "additional_details": "So far, self-employed people, especially sole-traders, have had no reassurance that they could continue to trade during this period of hardship. They are faced with making the decision between working and applying for Universal Credit while thousands of employees jobs and salaries will be protected. The self-employed must also have 80% of their annual pay protected in order to support this important part of the economy who are extremely at risk.",
        "background": "In light of the new commitment to covering 80% of employees wages, self-employed will have no income protection and will have to sign-up for Universal Credit or statutory sick pay. This petition is to bring self-employed protection in line with those who are employed.",
