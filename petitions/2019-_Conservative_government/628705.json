Those living in rural areas are paying more for their electricity than those residing in more affluent areas of Britain.  If National Insurance, Income tax and VAT are applied equally throughout England, then there is no reason why the Daily Standing Charge\u2019 cannot be universally applied. \r\nAs Ofgem say, \u201cIf you live in Greater Manchester, you'll on average have a power cut once every 10 years whereas if you live in Cumbria or the peaks, you'll have a power cut once every 15 months, so broadly 7 times poorer supply.\u201d",
