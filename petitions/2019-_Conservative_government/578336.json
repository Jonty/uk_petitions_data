Thackery hadn\u2019t lived his life to the fullest. We rescued him from the RSPCA along with his brother in February last year. Having a cat is just like having a dog, they mean the world to people. A dog means the world to there owners just like cats and it\u2019s not fair that people do not have to stop for a cat.",
