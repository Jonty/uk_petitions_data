        "additional_details": "Many parents are left struggling with young people with Eating Disorders and are receiving no help, instead trying to battle the long hard journey on their own with no support. Young people are not being accepted for help or treatment until their weight gets to a certain lower level which is not consistent with NICE guidelines as early intervention is key. Parents are presenting at A&E depts with young people that are starving themselves and staff lack knowledge in eating disorders",
        "background": "Look at increasing earlier interventions for patients that present with disordered eating and eating disorders. Increase training for staff at A&E departments so they know what to screen for when a child is presenting with restricted eating in alignment with Marsipan checklists",
