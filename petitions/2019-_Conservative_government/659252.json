        "additional_details": "Although mild in many, chickenpox can be serious in some children and adults (even those that are not considered vulnerable). The scaring from chickenpox can be severe leaving people with lifelong scars. The vaccine has been used in other countries for many years, and a long-term US study disproved a theory about the impact on shingles cases. Chickenpox also has an impact on parents/guardians having to take unpaid leave from work to care for their child/ren who have chickenpox. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has now recommended its addition to the routine childhood immunisation programme, but a decision hasn\u2019t been taken by Government. We also think there should also be a catch-up programme.",
