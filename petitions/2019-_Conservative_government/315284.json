Most of us have our families in different countries and when giving birth we had other plans that included having the family around and not being in quarantine. These times are stressful for everyone, especially for any mom bringing a child to the world away from everyone we love. If online registrations are open it allows us to fly home to be with our families during quarantine and during this important time of having a child.",
