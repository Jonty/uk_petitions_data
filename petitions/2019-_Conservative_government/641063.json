        "additional_details": "Several Australian states have introduced new minimum and maximum sentences for one punch assaults that kill. We want the Government to take similar action, so that there are increased penalties for one punch assaults and deaths, to deter future crimes, and ensure offenders cannot receive lesser penalties that apply to other offences.",
        "background": "We would like the Government to pass legislation to introduce increased sentences for one punch assaults and deaths. My family has first-hand experience as our son was killed through a one punch assault - his assailant pleaded not guilty - he was found guilty and given a 7.5 year prison sentence.",
