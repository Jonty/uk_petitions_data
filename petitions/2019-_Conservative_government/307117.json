        "additional_details": "Many self employed people have lost all their work due to Coronavirus. Entire industries have had to shut down, causing people to lose thousands of pounds in what was previously guaranteed income. And now many of us have to stay at home and home school our kids as the schools have closed indefinitely, meaning we cannot look for other work. We must have an income to pay mortgages, rent, bills, food etc. Why should an employee get 80% of their wages paid but a self employed person not?",
        "background": "It's great that you're promising to pay 80% of the wages of employees to ensure they don't lose their jobs. But many self employed people have lost their income for the foreseeable future due solely to Coronavirus. So, like in many other countries, we also want you to cover 80% of our income",
