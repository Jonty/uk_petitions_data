Some trips are unplanned or are an everyday thing specially for people in County Donegal. \r\n \r\nIt would make a lot of EU citizens life hard as they travel to Northern Ireland frequently and some even have to cross Northern Ireland to get from one part of Ireland to another.\r\n",
        "background": "The Government should not require EU Citizens to take part in the forthcoming Electronic Travel Authorisation scheme. The scheme could affect EU citizens living in border counties in Ireland like Donegal and Monaghan.",
