        "additional_details": "We believe all resident parents should have the same rights as those with Child Arrangements Orders that say a child must live with the parent. Consent should not be required, particularly from an uninvolved, non-resident parent, no matter if they have PR. Requiring consent gives the non-resident parent the power to refuse or delay the request simply because they can, more so if there is a history of coercive controlling behaviour within the relationship. We believe this is wholly inequitable.",

This should be extended to resident parents without CAOs unless another court order prevents this.",
