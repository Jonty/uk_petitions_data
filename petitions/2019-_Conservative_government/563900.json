        "additional_details": "The government must listen to the advice from the LEDER group which has looked in detail at research and has advised that young people and adults with Learning Disabilities should be given a higher priority for vaccination against Coronavirus. For example, currently 18-34 year olds with Learning Disabilities are 30 times more likely to die from coronavirus than their non-learning disabled counterparts ( Research from Voiceability, Dimensions UK and the Learning Disability Mortality Review)",
        "background": "Public Health England states that people with learning disabilities were up to 6 times more likely to die from coronavirus than the general population. In addition the social isolation faced by this vulnerable group has been exacerbated by the pandemic leaving families and carers in crisis.",
