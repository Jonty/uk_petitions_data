Face to face teaching is a necessity for guidance and reassurance through a normal academic year, and yet it is now becoming harder to complete what is expected through such global pandemic. As GCSE\u2019s and A Levels are already cancelled, this should be the same for 1st and 2nd year university students for both academic and psychological reasoning.",
