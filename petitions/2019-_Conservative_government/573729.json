        "additional_details": "Because it is right and fair. People need to do something and learning is good. To give \u00a320 a week extra but not increase the maximum income threshold by \u00a320 a week is unjust. If the \u00a320 had not been given then those like myself would be doing a level 2 course by now, albeit online to start with in lockdown. The maximum income threshold to receive funding for a course was set last April and did not take into account the \u00a320 a week increase.  If we are not working, we need to learn. Was this a mistake or a deliberate attempt to stop people getting access to funding for a level 2 course or above.",
        "background": "Since lockdown the Government has increased Universal Credit by \u00a320 a week. Funding to do a level 2 course or above is available but only if your income is below \u00a3338 a month. Before the \u00a320 increase it was below. Now with the \u00a320 increase it takes it to \u00a3409. I want the government to change this.",
