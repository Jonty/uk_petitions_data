        "additional_details": "The country is facing massive economic uncertainty. The Chancellor's announcements in the PM briefing 20/03 were a huge step forward for businesses and employees, but our economy relies on self employed workers. Statutory sick pay is not enough to pay the bills through months of unemployment. The choice for childminders is to ignore the guidance, remain open and endanger others or face eviction. We must do more to protect them and our vital self employed workforce  during these difficult times.",
        "background": "How can it be right that a childminder earning \u00a325000 will be 5x poorer than employees on the same income? We welcome 80% income protection for those who cannot work because of Corona virus and statutory sick pay for the self employed. But these are hugely unequal benefits. Equality4selfemployed",
