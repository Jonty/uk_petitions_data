        "additional_details": "The Ukraine is under bombardment, under shot and shell, by a vicious and tyrannical foe, the likes of which have not been seen since the Third Reich. Adolf Hitler took piece by piece of Europe beginning with Czechoslovakia. Vladimir Putin has done the same, starting with the Ukraine. Ukraine can hold off the Russians for some time, but not forever, the same as Poland could not hold off the Third Reich alone. NATO has to act. Britain can make them. Please, for the sake of Ukraine and for liberty.",
        "background": "We want the British Government to ask the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to directly intervene in the war between Russia and the Ukraine. If the NATO is too cowardly to act, then we must stand alone. Regardless, we must stand against Russia.",
