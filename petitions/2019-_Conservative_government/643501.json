        "background": "We believe too much time, money and energy is channelled into the emotive subject of school uniforms.\r\n \r\nToo many children are isolated or excluded because of what we believe can be unfair and inconsistent school uniform polices, causing rifts and negative outcomes for students.\r\n\r\n",
