        "additional_details": "The prejudice and superstition that surrounds the over 53,000 Pagans in England today is very sad to witness. Many families have been practicing Paganism for generations, it is a long misunderstood faith that centers its beliefs in the natural world and doing only good. It is only the ignorance of others that prevents English pagans from being able to have equal rights in marriage. Legalizing Pagan wedding ceremonies will help to end the stigma that surrounds us, and give us the power to express our faith and worship freely.",
        "background": "Change English and Welsh marriage laws to recognize traditional Pagan wedding ceremonies in particular the practice of handfasting as a legal act of marriage. At present we must instead travel over the Scottish border to wed in accordance with our ancient faith. This is unfair and discriminatory.",
