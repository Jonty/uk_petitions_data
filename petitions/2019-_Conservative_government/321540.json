The aim of this petition is to end the injustice, legislation is needed. IPP was abolished in 2012 therefore, all prisoners serving on this sentence should have their sentence reviewed with a clear release date. The punishment has not always reflected the crime. Prisoners need a release date, an end goal as it is impossible to work towards nothing.",
