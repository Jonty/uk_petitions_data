        "additional_details": "Being around many people in education I can witness and understand the pressure and anxiety increasing due to this virus. To be told that we must be in school despite an urgent issue is very unwelcoming and can affect our quality of education furthermore schools have a surplus amount of people and we have been informed that the symptoms are similar to the common cold/flu please reconsider for the future of the next generation as we do not know how bad this will become",
        "background": "A school is a breeding place for bacteria and especially viruses to manifest and are effectively a hotspot for the virus to spread. With both children and adult susceptible to this virus it is essential education institutions to be shut if we truly wish for the virus to stop being spread and stop it",
