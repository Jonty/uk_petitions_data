When we are out, it is impossible to change his clothes/nappy on the baby change tables and it is unhygienic changing him on the floor.\r\n \r\nMany children with complex needs wear nappies well into childhood and beyond, so larger changing facilities or extendable tables being available when out and about is essential.",
