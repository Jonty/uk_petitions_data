Thousands depend on the arts for work and asking us to retrain and give up on what is a huge contribution to society is insulting and wrong, especially seen as how financially viable the arts is in terms of contributing to the economy. We need to talk directly to the artists affected and create a long term plan for regrowing the arts in our cities.",
