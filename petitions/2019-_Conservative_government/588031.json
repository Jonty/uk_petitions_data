        "additional_details": "I just watched helpless while an area of wasteland, taken by nature for over 10 yrs was bulldozed to oblivion. A fox den with young Cubs, a good population of hedgehogs who would not have escaped. Hedges full of nests, nests, wildflowers. W rang police wildlife officer and Derbyshire wildlife biodiversity officer. By the time we got them it was too late. They were heartbroken and say it happens all the time. Netting is also an issue, destroying swallows nests, bat roosts. All to avoid inspection.",
        "background": "Make it a crime for developers to evade current laws protecting rare species and breeding wildlife. They clear land prior to asking for planning permission. So nothing for biodiversity officer to see as it is already dead.",
