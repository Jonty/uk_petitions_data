It\u2019s sad to see politicians doing the bare minimum to fight against the crisis; they don\u2019t care enough and turn a blind eye to this crisis.\r\n \r\nWe all have been seeing these effects for decades now. It can only get worse from now if we don\u2019t take action NOW. NOW is when the action needs to start, not tomorrow, not next week, not next month, not next year, NOW.",
