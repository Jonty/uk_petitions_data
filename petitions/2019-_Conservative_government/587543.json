Any change that doesn't distract other motorists and increases the chance vulnerable riders should be noticed and identified on the road, should be welcomed and not be illegal. The ideal colour is probably purple as it cant be easily mis-identified due to the fact it isn't used by another road vehicle. This shouldn't be a mandatory change.",
