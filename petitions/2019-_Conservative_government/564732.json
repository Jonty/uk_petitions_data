        "additional_details": "The fact the government refunds coach and train tickets for the period of 23-27th December is insufficient. Many people had their tickets, including flights, booked few days earlier and coming back few days after Christmas which are not covered by the refund. Additionally, tickets had to be booked after 24th November where in fact, some were booked even before the first lockdown (March 2020) happened. Government failed to enforce sufficient restrictions for airlines to cancel their flights.",
        "background": "UK government announced with an absolute minimum notice introducing Tier 4 from Sunday, 20th December in London and the South East of England. It became illegal to travel outside of the tier, including abroad. As a result many people lost money for their flights as some airlines refuse to refund.",
