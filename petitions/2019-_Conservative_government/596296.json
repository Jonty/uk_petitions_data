        "additional_details": "HPPD is a real thing and many people suffer from it without any real known cause apart from abuse of drugs. This disorder is debilitating but in the UK it is not recognised and is constantly misdiagnosed as Psychosis even though it barely shares any symptoms. The US recognises it. Suffering from it is unbearable and there have been known cases of suicide because no one will take a second to understand what it is. Anyone who does there research into it will see it\u2019s real and effects millions.",
        "background": "I want research to begin into it by finding anyone who is currently studying it. It is real and is being misdiagnosed constantly and treating it with drugs in most cases makes it worse. It needs to be recognised as a disorder and the mental health teams everywhere need knowledge about it",
