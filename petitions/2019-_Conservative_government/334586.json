        "additional_details": "Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, wife of a political prisoner, ran as a strong opponent during the 2020 Belarus elections.  Despite gathering significant support, the Belarus government announced she only got 10%. Now she has had to flee to Lithuania.  \r\n\r\nVideos online shows many peaceful protesters being beaten beyond reason and taken away in vans, often at random.  One person has already died and many more have been injured.  Oppression like this should not be tolerated, especially in Europe.",
        "background": "Belarus has once again been subject to a rigged election.  Beyond this however, the government are now violently assaulting protesters of the results with extreme excessive force.  The British government has a moral duty to put pressure on Belarus for violating human rights.",
