        "additional_details": "The COVID-19 pandemic has created a backlog in driving test appointments, and some companies are taking advantage by selling practical driving tests for more than the original price. There have been reports of test slots being sold for \u00a3250.\r\n \r\nWhere companies have block booked tests this has worsened the backlog and reduced availability to learners who can't afford the higher prices and worsens the backlog. We urge the Government to ban this practice and create heavy fines on violators. This will ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to book a test and should help the backlog be addressed in a fair and equitable manner.\r\n",
        "background": "We are asking the Government to make it illegal for companies to sell practical driving tests for more than the original price (\u00a362 for weekdays, and \u00a375 for weekends). Any company or individual selling tests for more than the original price would be breaking the law and should face heavy fines.",
