        "additional_details": "Currently within literature, the only way to check whether a book is suitable for a certain age group is by checking for any content warnings, which are entirely voluntary, and are often too vague. This means young readers can easily access material which may be too adult for them, unbeknownst to them and their parents. We believe all literature should have an advisory rating, to help people choose literature which is right for them.",
        "background": "We want the Government to require Advisory Ratings, similar to those used within films (U, PG, 12, 15, 18), for literature, to help parents, children and vulnerable people choose literature which is safe and age appropriate for them.",
