        "additional_details": "It is not fair being penalised for offering a service to the community, especially during these difficult times. We have been working throughout the pandemic, under rain and sun, and yet current regulations prevent us from doing our job properly. We work long hours to then use our pay for a whole day or two to pay for an unfair penalty charge. Restaurants may take long to prepare the food, and customers may take longer to respond. Many times there is no safe place to park. We need concessions.",
        "background": "Food/groceries delivery drivers need more rights and freedom so they can do their job properly. We pay a special insurance to do our job yet we receive tickets if parking in front of restaurants and customer houses. We need to be able to park for at least 15 minutes without being penalised.",

You could therefore raise your issue with a local councillor who represents you. You can find out who your local councillors are, and how to contact them, by entering your post code here:\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors\r\n\r\nYou could also start a petition on the Haringey Council website asking them to create some form of exemption from parking requirements for delivery drivers in your area, if that is something you'd like to see happen. You can find out how to do this here: https://www.haringey.gov.uk/local-democracy/meetings/petitions\r\n"
