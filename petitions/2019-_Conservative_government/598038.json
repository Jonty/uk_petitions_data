        "additional_details": "Take today, I've counted 17 near misses and bad attitudes while cycling to and from work, a grand total of 1 hour 30 mins. I've previously tried to submit video evidence to Cleveland police, but they have no portal, no email and 'no time'. I've also reported parked cars in cycle lanes and debris to Redcar council, the response was 'cyclists are to cycle around the cars'. My local MP Jacob Young 'cant help'. There are people being killed daily on our roads nationwide, this needs to stop, now!",
        "background": "Cycling in my area has deteriorated drastically, well, general road safety from all road users. I'd like my local authorities to help out more, better law enforcement, better conditions of cycle lanes, more action on video evidence by the local police, more ethic towards greener transport.",
