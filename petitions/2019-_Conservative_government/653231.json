        "additional_details": "Personally, having children, it is extremely difficult getting a young child / baby out of a normal car parking spot, not being able to open the door to its full range. \r\n\r\nSome children are non verbal, and can become very physical, which would make it even more difficult removing the child, without damaging / scratching the car parked to the side of us. \r\n\r\nIt is even more stressful, seeing people without children, parking in those spaces, without there being any circumstances, like a disable spot.",
        "background": "I want the same rules to apply when parking in a disabled parking space, to parking in parent and child parking space. \r\n\r\nFor example, you must have a Blue Badge to display on the dashboard, otherwise, you could be fined or you could receive a parking notice.",
