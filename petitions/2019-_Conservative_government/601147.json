        "additional_details": "Every year there are devastating consequences for pets and wildlife (notably https://www.itv.com/news/westcountry/2020-11-10/young-zebra-died-after-being-spooked-by-fireworks-at-noahs-ark-zoo), alongside many people with PTSD or illnesses such as Autism. Banning the sale of noisy fireworks would at least make a difference for them. \r\nThis will not account for despicable members of society acting dangerously with fireworks, but will at least make a difference for the groups mentioned above.",
        "background": "Every year parliament debates banning the sale of fireworks to the public. Every year they refuse. We know the government won\u2019t ban something they make too much tax from, but given noiseless fireworks exist, why are they not as a bare minimum, the only fireworks being sold?",
