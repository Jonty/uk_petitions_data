        "additional_details": "Children\u2019s clothing and shoes benefit from not having VAT making them more affordable for children who grow quickly and need more clothing. The current older children sizes are not true to size so many parents now have to purchase adult clothing for their old children and teenagers at a significant price increase  including non branded school uniform. Adult clothing is subject to VAT so increases the price even more. My children have healthy BMI\u2019s but at 11&12 years old have to wear adults size",
