        "additional_details": "I have recently had a number of experiences, particularly with older drivers, which could have ended up in an accident if I hadn't anticipated something bad happening and slowed down beforehand. Many of these drivers seem to have eased back on the rules for driving and others may simply be ignoring them.\r\nA month ago, I was a witness at a car crash which happened only because another driver decided to pull off from a queue of parked cars without an indicator, causing the car in from of me to hit him.\r\nThis cannot keep happening, it is NOT normal to allow reckless people on the road. Just because someone has had to option to drive for decades does NOT mean they are still fit to drive.",
        "background": "Make anyone who has a license take another driving test once every 15 years. This means that a driving license will expire after that period of time, and the individual has to redo the test in order to drive. Once redoing the test and passing it the way a new driver must, they can drive again.",
