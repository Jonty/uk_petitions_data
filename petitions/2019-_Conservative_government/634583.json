You can find out what actions the CMS can take here:\r\nhttps://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7774/\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling on the Government to make non-payment of child maintenance a criminal offence, with custodial penalties for offenders, if that's what you want to happen. If you want the Government to make any other changes to how parents apply for child maintenance, or requirements to pay child maintenance, you'd need to be clear what changes you want."
