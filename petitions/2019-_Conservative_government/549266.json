        "additional_details": "We always put our focus on what is best for Non-EEA Immigrants, many of whom have lived here for over a decade and have never received benefits, while working hard to contribute to the economy. During Covid-19, many immigrants did not receive any government help and the Government has not reduced any immigration fees, which are affecting many of the most vulnerable and those who have not been able to work. To extend a visa, many immigrants must pay fees of over \u00a31,000 plus the IHS surcharge of \u00a3400 per year.",
        "background": "This petition has been started by the Immigrants WorkForce Association to call on the UK Government to reduce all immigration fees for all Non-EEA Immigrants by at least 50% during the Covid-19 and until the crisis has passed.",
