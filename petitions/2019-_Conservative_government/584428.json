We also need to boost our businesses. Our businesses are just as important as salons on the high Street or on street corners. Most salons don't pay business rates. Yet they have recieved a grant because they fall under the rates category. We want to understand why these businesses are exempt and why we have been treated differently. We want the same",

We are exempt from business rates just like many salons that are exempt but there's a large difference in payment. Salons have been allocated \u00a38000 yet the ARG Payment is \u00a31700.",
