        "additional_details": "Ways of showing greater balance are:\r\n1) to reiterate consistently that the general populations are not responsible for the injustices & harm suffered on either side;\r\n2) to fund the rebuilding of the Palestinian infrastructure & economy at least equally to the value of any military & other support to Israel, to publicly declare that it is doing so;\r\n3) to state that defending the right of Palestinians to dignity & safety while under occupation is not incompatible with Israel's right to exist.",
        "background": "HM Government has recently expressed its unflinching support for Israel's right to exist, but in a way that could be interpreted as ignoring the plight of ordinary Palestinians dating back to the British Mandate. To avoid undermining the two-state solution policy, a more balanced approach is needed.",
