        "additional_details": "Many pets are seen as an extension of the family. Many airlines allow pets up to 9kg to travel to most countries inside the airplane cabin, in their pet carrier, instead of in the cargo hold. However, they are not allowed on most airplanes coming to the UK, regardless of their size.\r\nThis not only distresses the pets and owners, it also risks their health and safety, having several cases of injured, sick, or even dead pets because of the conditions of the flight, as they are treated as luggage.",
        "background": "Change the rules of animal travel so they can travel with their owners (with all the documentation and vaccines in order) inside airplanes instead of in the hold with luggage.\r\nIt is allowed in many other countries around the world, including in the EU, South America, and the USA.",
