        "background": "There is a backlog of drivers ready to but unable to take driving tests in the UK due to lack of test availability.\r\nDVSA should allow experienced driving instructors to provide driving tests on behalf of DVSA.  This would reduce the burden on the DVSA and provide work for instructors.",
