Many children with additional needs, especially autism, will not understand the changes to their lives. Despite the best efforts from parents and carers, these children are regressing, self-harming, not sleeping and falling apart. They also cannot visit family or go places they enjoy anymore on top of the school absence. Not all ALN children will be struggling so this is regarding those that are.",
