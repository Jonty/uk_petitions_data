Public authority cannot interfere with the exercise of this right unless valid reasoning (such as suspicion of drugs or weapons). Ordinary citizens can no longer make another member of the public uncomfortable because of sexual desires, this includes the prohibition of catcalling, groping, displaying photos or drawings of a sexual nature and more.\"",
        "background": "Another article in the Human Rights Act of 1998 should pass - Article 15: The freedom from sexual harassment.\r\nThis allows citizens to feel as if they have legislation on their side and allows them to speak up and prevents harassment all together. Article 8 is not strong enough - more is deserved.",
