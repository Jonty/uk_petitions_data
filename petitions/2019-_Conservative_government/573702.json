Most of the time, the BRP card is also included in these documents. A warning message appears saying \"your biometric residence card or permit is not valid\" during the control exercised using the BRP number and date of birth on https://www.gov.uk/prove-right-to-work and this causes the employer/client to doubt that our legal rights are still reserved.",

Currently, there isn't any platform showing the status of extension, whether it's been issued and that our legal rights are reserved. This causes losing some rights & jobs until the application's concluded.",
