This is particularly dangerous for unaccompanied children who are vulnerable to both the dangers of the journey, often risking their lives trying to cross the Channel in small boats, and criminal groups who operate in and around unofficial refugee sites. Under 18s are children in law and should be regarded and given protection as such.",
