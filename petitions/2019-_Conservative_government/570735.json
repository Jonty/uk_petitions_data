        "additional_details": "While Universal Credit has been frozen for 4 years, inflation has risen by 10%, this has lead to it becoming much harder for UC claimants and their families trying to get by. \r\n\r\nExtension of the Universal Credit uplift for a minimum of 5 years would allow families to ensure the people who mean most to them will be able to eat and to keep their homes paid for in the troubling months ahead. \r\n\r\nThe Government should consider the uplift an investment as the money would flow back into businesses.",
        "background": "This petition wishes for a sensible extension to the Universal Credit uplift for a minimum of 5 years. \r\n\r\nIt has been reported that the Chancellor has considered giving almost six million benefit claimants a \u00a3500 cash payment instead of keeping the \u00a31,000 yearly uplift in Universal Credit.",
