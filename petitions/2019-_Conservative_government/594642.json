        "action": "Implement mandatory dementia training for hospital nurses/ healthcare assistants",
        "additional_details": "Every time I, or somebody I know, visit hospital, 9/10 there is an individual on the ward with a form of dementia. During our stays, the patient will have a period of being distressed and the nurses don\u2019t understand how to manage the outburst or de-escalate the situation. I am aware of the presence of specialised dementia nurses in hospitals, however, there aren\u2019t enough for each patient admitted- especially with the time needed to reach the patient when they become overwhelmed/ aggressive.",
        "background": "I believe that a basic mandatory training for all nurses/ HCAs regarding dementia and the handling of dementia patients should be implemented across the NHS.",
