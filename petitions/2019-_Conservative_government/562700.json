        "additional_details": "HM Government have a priority order to immunisation once a Covid19 vaccine becomes available and have chosen the elderly, the vulnerable and those working in the NHS. However people working in schools with little or no protection need making a priority to help keep schools open and to protect them. We have already lost many school staff across the country to Covid simply for doing their job. We know schools are transmission centres. It's time to give school staff the protection they deserve.",
        "background": "I want HM Government to make a statement to ensure that those working in our schools keeping schools open to help keep the economy running are given the same priority for vaccination as those working in the NHS.",
