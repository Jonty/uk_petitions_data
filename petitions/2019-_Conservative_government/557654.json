        "additional_details": "The number of COVID-19 cases is increasing, making on-campus classes an increasingly threatening environment for students and the family members who live with them. There is also currently a huge inequality of opportunities between on-campus and online classes. Students who attend on-campus classes are much more favored, making it unfair for students who want to attend classes online. Closing universities would favor a much safer and more equitable environment for students.",
        "background": "I would like the government to consider closing universities and move to online teaching allowing us to have access to education while being safe at home.",
