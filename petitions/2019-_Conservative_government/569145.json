        "additional_details": "We should not use brexit as an excuse to step backward in our environmental policies. These pesticides are lethal to bees and other pollinators which our environment desperately needs to pollinate flora and fauna. Bees alone pollinate 3/4 of all British crops, which makes the use of this pesticide incredibly counter-intuitive. The government claims it is committed to reducing our environmental impact but this would be a massive step back, seriously and permanently damaging the UK\u2019s ecosystem.",
