So many people have to live with others in flats and apartments where there is no access to outside space to relax or just gain fresh air for a prolonged period of time. All proposed new flats should have a balcony or terrace, or buildings converted to flats and apartments should have suitable outside space within the perimeter, or planning permission should not be granted.",

It makes sense to review the criteria for new build flats and apartments, and the conversion of existing buildings.",
