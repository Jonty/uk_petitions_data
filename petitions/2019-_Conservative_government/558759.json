        "additional_details": "Young people aged 13+ only have access to a limited number of resources for mental wellbeing support, this has led to a 12 month+ waiting period across the UK for children and young people. COVID-19 and lockdown measures have contributed to anxiety and depression in teenagers rising significantly, when care should be accessible to them sooner. My aim is to reduce the waiting period for these young people, give them the help and support required and prevent further detrimental actions occurring.",

More programs that are specific for young people with mental health difficulties should be accessible and easy to use, without long delays and waiting times.",
