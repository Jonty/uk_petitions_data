        "background": "Tourettes affects 1 in 100 children, yet the medical care provided is minimal and very patchy across the UK, some areas have NO care. \r\n\r\nThere are only a handful of specialist Tourettes centres in the whole of the UK - we need more of these to provide care for EVERYONE and we need NICE Guidelines.",
