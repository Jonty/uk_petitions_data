        "additional_details": "Customers often prioritise price, meaning that small businesses that have to charge VAT can lose out on work to businesses that do not have to charge VAT. Companies that do not charge VAT because they are under the threshold may have just started or be less experienced, which may mean that lower prices do not necessarily represent value for money.\r\n \r\nWe believe the VAT threshold should be increased, to enable fair competition between small businesses.\r\n",
        "background": "Take into consideration the effect VAT has on businesses once they reach the VAT threshold and have to charge VAT on their goods and services, and pay this to HMRC. Many businesses lose out on custom once they reach the threshold, because customers can go to businesses that don't have to charge VAT.",
