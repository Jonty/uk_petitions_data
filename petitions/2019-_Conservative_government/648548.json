        "additional_details": "Street theft is becoming more and more of a popular crime in London and across the UK. With 91,000 phones being stolen in 2022 and only 2% of these being recovered. The main issue the police face is that if the crime is committed and the suspect is wearing a balaclava they have no way of identifying them and close the case down more or less straight away. \r\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t the only crime that masked people are committing but they are protected behind the balaclavas they are legally allowed to wear.",
        "background": "Balaclavas, commonly known as ski masks or face masks, have unfortunately become synonymous with criminal behaviour, enabling anonymity and facilitating illegal activities.",
