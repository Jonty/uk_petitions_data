This will greatly harm our education system and pupils.\r\n \r\nInflation, rising costs and unfunded pay rises mean that the majority of schools expect to be in a deficit financial position at the end of this year (22/23).\r\n \r\nThis will lead to schools having to significantly reduce provision, such as spending on resources for pupils and staffing. Without further funding from the Government, school staff are likely to be made redundant. Properly funding education is necessary for the growth of our country.",
