        "additional_details": "The government has offered a pay rise of only 1% to NHS nurses, despite their hard work in saving countless lives during the pandemic. It is inexcusable to offer such a low pay rise now that the additional \u00a3350 million per week of funding for the NHS has materialised since the UK left the EU single market and EU customs union on 31st December 2020. The maths prove that the government can now afford much more than 1%: \u00a3350,000,000 x 52 weeks \u00f7 1,300,000 NHS workers = \u00a314,000 per annum per worker.",
        "background": "In 2016, Boris Johnson and others promised on the side of a bus that Brexit would facilitate an extra \u00a3350 million per week of funding for the NHS. Now that Brexit has happened, please use the \u00a3350m per week windfall to fund the NHS as promised with a \u00a314,000 per annum pay rise for each NHS worker.",
