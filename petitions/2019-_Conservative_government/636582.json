        "additional_details": "Autonomous weapons systems, sometimes referred to as 'killer robots', have already been developed. Further development is likely to reduce their size, operating range and enhance their kill capability through swarming. Once activated, they can operate without human intervention and can kill via pre-loaded algorithms. The costs of such technology can be small in comparison with conventional weapons and the economic argument for their further development and use is pervasive. If we want a safe world for humans, we believe this technology must be banned.",
