In these days of highlighting plastics water, we also  need to highlight plastics along our roads.",

Local authorities manage litter collection on the rest of the roads in England. It's not clear what changes you want to be made to the responsibility of National Highways and local authorities in respect of litter collection.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for the Government to increase fines people littering on public roads. We could also accept a petition calling on the Government to provide additional funding for litter collection on roads in England."
