        "additional_details": "We think it is unfair to prevent those relying on these bus passes from using them at any hour. In order to provide disabled people with more equal opportunities for education, work, and social life, these restrictions must be removed. Many jobs, schools and universities begin the day before 9:30am which immediately puts disabled people at a disadvantage. We believe there is no logical argument to defend restricting disabled people from accessing free public transport when going about their lives outside of their homes.",
        "background": "Many disabled people are limited to only using public transport, and are entitled to bus passes. This can be of vital importance for those attending work, school and social events. As such, we believe it does not make sense that these passes are invalid before 9:30am and after 11:00pm.\r\n",
