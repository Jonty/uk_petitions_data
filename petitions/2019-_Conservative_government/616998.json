But none of this affects our learning and we should be allowed to wear a locket with a family member in it, honour a friend by wearing a ring they bought us, compulsively dye our hair, or keep our nails on until they break because they were expensive, without worrying that we\u2019re going to be kept from our education, shouted at, put in isolation, sent home, or have our property wrongly confiscated. We should have the rights for these. Our body, our choice.",
        "background": "Disdain rules about hair, jewellery, makeup, nails et.c Staff waste their time punishing us on it when there is so much worse going on such as racism & rape threatening. An assembly was held about the \u2018one stud\u2019 rule by a teacher with three massive hoops in each ear. It\u2019s hypocritical & unfair.",
