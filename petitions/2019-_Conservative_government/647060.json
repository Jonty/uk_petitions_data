The cost of living crisis affects us all and the cost of heating one's home by electric or gas has increased dramatically in recent years. Solar heating may be an answer but many can't afford to have it installed and maintained.\r\n \r\nI believe that the parameters used to determine the average winter temperature in France and Spain, ahead of entitlement to this payment being withdrawn, were flawed and are not truly representative of the actual conditions.\r\n \r\nPensioners should not be deprived of benefits just because they choose to live in another European country.\r\n",
