        "additional_details": "Poultry in the USA is often soaked in chlorine to kill bacteria from faeces, because so many farms there are filthy and cruel.\u00a0\r\nSimilarly, cattle are injected with antibiotics and pigs are injected with the toxic drug Ractopamine to promote growth.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe US Government wants to sell these products in British supermarkets; products which do not meet EU standards.\r\n\r\nIn its desperation to get a post-Brexit deal, the UK government is getting ready to dump food and other standards to appease Trump.",
        "background": "We want any future trade deal with the US Government to guarantee animal welfare and food quality standards at least as good as those that are currently in force within the UK and EU.",
