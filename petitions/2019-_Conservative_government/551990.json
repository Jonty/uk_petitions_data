        "additional_details": "In the 1980s gay men were banned from giving blood entirely. Then in 2011 there was a one year wait to donate blood and in 2017 the wait was reduced to 3 months.\r\nThere is no reason to discriminate again a minority, people who need blood can\u2019t wait 3 months to finally recieve it. The pointless delay doesn\u2019t even make sense, seeing as the blood is tested for any fluid transmitted diseases before it can be used.\r\nAnyone can have an std, not just gay men.",
        "background": "I want Parliament to scrap the 2017 policy for gay men to abstain 3 months before a blood donation and make it the same as other healthy members of society. The policy purposely discriminates against a minority, it shouldn\u2019t be in use.",
