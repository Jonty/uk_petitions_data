        "additional_details": "After the passage of the National Security Law, China imposed an electoral overhaul that introduces a screening panel for candidates and marginalises dissenting views. Democratic campaigners are mostly barred from running for office.\r\n\r\nMost of the democratic campaigners in Hong Kong are on trial, in jail or in exile. All these persecutions on Hong Kong people are flagrant breaches of China's pledge of liberty and autonomy enshrined in the Sino-British Joint Statement.",
        "background": "G7 Leaders Summit will take place in June. As the year's host, the United Kingdom should impose sanctions on perpetrators of human rights abuses in Hong Kong, as a way to restore public trust in democracies when the Chinese Communist Party takes an authoritarian shift in this once-autonomous city.",
