If they can do reg checks and send auto-fines by mail, then they can set up auto-alerts, There must be some organisational obligation from their side to collect payments before they turn into fines and legal bamboozling wormholes that you can't escape from. Most of us will pay, you just need to give us a chance.",

You'll easily venture into chargeable zones and get stung with an \u00a380 fine. And most people would pay if they knew! TFL must be obliged to let us know instantly",
