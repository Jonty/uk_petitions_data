        "additional_details": "If a dog is on lead, it is for a reason, and is being controlled by its owner. Some dogs are reactive and will defend their owners and themselves if threatened by an off lead dog. We believe that one owner saying \"it's ok my dog is friendly\" is absolutely not an excuse for one dog to invade another dog's space. A dog and its owner should be able to walk freely without fear of other dogs causing intimidation to them. If a dog is on lead it is on a lead for a reason - do not let other dogs approach it!",
