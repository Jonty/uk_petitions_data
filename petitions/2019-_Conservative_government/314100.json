        "additional_details": "In short, not waiting for PPE supplies saves lives.\r\n\r\nPandemics in nature are global, this puts a huge strain on some supply chains which in turn adds delays on much needed PPE to the front line.\r\n\r\nWe should not be relying on other countries to supply PPE because:\r\n\r\n1. A global demand can mean low/slow supply.\r\n2. Other countries may invoke their own version of the \"Defense Production Act of 1950\" meaning companies that would usually supply materials may no longer be able.",
        "background": "The UK government should have a separate, emergency supply of PPE only available for use during pandemics.\r\n\r\nThe supply should be enough for all people in places of care for a 3 month period.\r\n\r\nStockpile to be reviewed every 5 years.",
