        "additional_details": "As a result of the awful timings of the school day, my school is located far from my house so I often have to wake up at 6:30AM for an hour journey, ready for lessons to start at 9AM. I would like the government to research more into this and make sure schools change their hours so it is more suited for our bodies. They say we need to study for GCSE exams but due to the awful timings of the days and our body clocks it\u2019s hard to focus in class with so little sleep.",
        "background": "The school days as of the present time are ruining sleep for many. As a teen, our body clocks are later than adults and children, meaning we go to sleep later and also wake up later. I would like the days to start and finish later so we don\u2019t lose sleep as a result.",
