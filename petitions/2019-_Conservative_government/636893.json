It should act as a deterrent for criminals to use more dangerous knives, as they could face longer sentences. currently the maximum sentence carries 4 year maximum sentence for any knife.",
        "background": "Introduce knife classes, so possession of knives with serrated edges or long blades can lead to longer maximum sentences than offences involving shorter knifes or knives that are not serrated. This would be a similar approach to classes for drugs.",
