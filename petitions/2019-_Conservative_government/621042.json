In the news, we have seen disturbing cases of people\u2019s rights being abused, in some cases without their knowledge. This has had a detrimental impact, not only on those effected directly, but on a larger scale.",
        "background": "Human Rights are some of the most fundamental and essential components in creating a society that embodies dignity, equality and respect.\r\n\r\nTherefore, human rights education should be added into the curriculum as a compulsory element, so every young person receives equal education surrounding this.",
