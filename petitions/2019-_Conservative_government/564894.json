        "additional_details": "Clearly, the tier system is not working, therefore we need a nationwide lockdown of the highest tier, to stop any more transmission of the virus and its mutations.\r\n\r\nThe economy will suffer more if we keep jumping from tier 1 to tier 3 and back again. \r\nThe rules have been too relaxed, and we need clear decisive leadership which we have not had. \r\n\r\nPeople are dying and will die due to this new mutation. We need to curb this virus and its mutations now to stop a catastrophe.",
        "background": "We need one strict lockdown similar to the one in March, in order to bring the rate of transmission down ASAP, especially due to the new mutations. \r\n\r\nWe don't know what the new mutations can do and therefore must act now to stop further deaths.",
