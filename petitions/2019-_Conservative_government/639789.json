        "additional_details": "At present a UK Financial Institution is able to register people on Fraud Prevention Platforms simply on the \u201csuspicion\u201d of fraud without proper evidence. This can prevent people from accessing credit or having their bank accounts closed. \r\n \r\nFinancial Institutions are allowed to put people on \u201cfraud prevention\u201d platforms like Hunter, Synectic solutions and CIFAS to warn other institutions of fraud. This is like putting a \u201cblack mark\u201d on an accused defendant with no opportunity for them to defend themselves. It puts off other institutions from taking an objective decision on an applicant.",
        "background": "We want the Government to create a law to ensure that a UK financial institution is only able to register people on fraud prevention platforms (e.g. Hunter, SS & CIFAS) if fraud is proven and not simply on the suspicion of fraud, which is what these platforms allow.",
