        "additional_details": "We believe these measures are crucial to rectify the substantial shortage of test slots, especially evident in London. Opportunities to exploit the system with automated bots and accounts to acquire and profit from test slots should be prevented to prevent exacerbating the scarcity for genuine learners. Implementing these reforms could be pivotal to restoring fairness and accessibility within the driving test allocation system.",
        "background": "1. Ban accounts for driving instructors (ADIs) to book driving tests on behalf of clients\r\n2. Implement a policy where test cancellations are made visible on the website once daily at a specific time, such as 11am.\r\n3. Make it unlawful to profit from the sale or early acquisition of driving tests.",
