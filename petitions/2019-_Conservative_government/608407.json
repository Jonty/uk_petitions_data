        "additional_details": "According to charity Pigeon Rescue, when released, too many doves do not immediately return \u2018home\u2019 to their owner. Instead they can become very docile, weak and disorientated, and struggle to find their way back and due to their pure white colour they can fall prey to other animals. As they are not wild birds they can struggle to survive and find food as they lack necessary survival skills, especially during winter when there is less food for them. This practice is cruel. Please sign to help make this illegal.",
        "background": "Make the release of captive doves illegal at weddings/funerals etc. These doves are often born and raised in captivity and are being released all for profit and money. I feel this is animal cruelty and can result in these poor birds starving to death or being victim to predators.",
