In general sudden lockdowns are bad for everyone's mental health and knowing what is coming up is much healthier. Get rid of the unknown and let us plan for the future.",

If we set a couple of planned circuit breakers now, for example 2 weeks in February and a further 2 weeks in April, this will help us safely get through the winter and help with business planning and also for everyone's mental health.",
