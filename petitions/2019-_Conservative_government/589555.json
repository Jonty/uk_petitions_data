        "action": "Make it a legal requirement for drivers to stop and report if they hit a cat",
        "additional_details": "Too many cats are killed by motorists, many of whom do not stop. This means animals are left to die and worried owners never find out what happened to them. At worst, it allows malicious drivers to escape without repercussion.\r\n\r\nIncluding cats under the Road Traffic Act 1988 would grant more protection for them and deter dangerous drivers.\r\n\r\nThe law currently only covers working animals but many cats have jobs too, such as mousers or therapy animals. They equally deserve to be covered.",
        "background": "Give cats the same status under the Road Traffic Act 1988 as dogs. This would require motorists to stop at the scene and report to the police if they have hit a cat. Police could also prosecute motorists who fail to do so.\r\n\r\nThis would protect cats from bad drivers and give closure to owners.",
