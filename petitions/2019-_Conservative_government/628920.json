        "additional_details": "As motorhomes are not used on a day to day basis, they should not be subject to the \u00a312.50 daily charge to travel out of london when the owners live within the new Greater London ULEZ zone. If you are to take a break in your motorhome you would be charged not only to leave the ULEZ zone but to return as well on another day this would mean an added \u00a325 to any trip. I think that government should add motorhomes to the exception list for owners within the new zone.",
