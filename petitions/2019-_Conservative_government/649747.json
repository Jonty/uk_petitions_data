Teachers say they give up their time to do thing for us but that\u2019s their choice they have chosen to join the job we don\u2019t chose to go to school and make us in a mood all week and hate our lives. School starts far to early I\u2019d much prefer it to start later. Please let this happen for children now and future generations",
