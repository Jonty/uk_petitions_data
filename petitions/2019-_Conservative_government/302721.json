        "additional_details": "The main aim of the government against a pandemic should be to reduce the risk of infection and death to the public as much as possible. There is no concrete proof that immunity can be developed against the new coronavirus. It is a riskier plan than others and therefore it does not make sense to use this plan given that there are other plans used by other countries that definitely work and keeps its citizens safe, such as lockdowns enforced by the military in Italy.",
        "background": "Herd Immunity will most likely lead to significant cases of COVID19 and number of deaths. The government should reconsider its response plans and follow advice from organisations such as the WHO to deliver a plan that benefits the public as much as possible and keeps people who are vulnerable safe.",
