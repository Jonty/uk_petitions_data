        "additional_details": "I think it is justified to increase the minimum wage for Under 18s and Above School Leavers Age due to discrimination/agism, people this age most likely have to pay higher insurance rates on vehicles, have to travel for work or school which can be assisted, but they also are the key people that will help the United Kingdom in the future. Allowing people this age to start saving now could increase the likelihood of the UK being in a better position in the future.",
        "background": "As of right now, most people are paid the normal minimum wage of above 18 and bellow 18. You cannot underpay due to gender, religion etc. As that would be discrimination, agism is a form of discrimination so lowering the Minimum wage for people under 18 should be classed as discrimination.",
