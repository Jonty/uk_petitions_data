        "additional_details": "By allowing MPs to determine what if any rules to impose about 2nd jobs they could simply choose an outcome that is most advantageous to them as a group. MPs are well paid compared to the average UK worker and many other workers have clauses in their contracts that state that having a 2nd job isn\u2019t allowed unless signed off by their manager or director. A 2nd job takes focus away from their current job and may result in a conflict of interest. Let the public decide.",
        "background": "Arrange a referendum to give the general public a vote on MPs second jobs. We believe MPs can\u2019t make this decision themselves as it directly affects them, so they have conflicted interests. If the Government and Parliament believe in a democratic society they should trust the voting public on this.",
