        "additional_details": "There is also the likely hood that many school children and college students will need to isolate and study at home in the event of any covid cases in their class bubbles. But not everyone has enough income to pay for broadband services to facilitate home studying. I personally know of more than one child whose parents can not afford to provide them with Internet services, and their education has suffered as a result of the previous lockdown. ISP's can help by offering free services for Nov 2020",
        "background": "Given the overwhelming number of people who will need to work from home during the November lockdown, and the financial hardship many face during such time, I call upon Internet service providers to offer free broadband internet services for the month of November - or at least a payment holiday.",
