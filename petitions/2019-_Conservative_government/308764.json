The intention is that an event, which is both unforeseen and of great consequence, can cause problems to any of the parties to fulfil their obligations. \r\nMany events are recognised as Force Majeure such as earthquake or hurricane.\r\nHowever, some unscrupulous companies are using lawyers to obviate these clauses and small businesses or consumers cannot afford to resort to law.",
