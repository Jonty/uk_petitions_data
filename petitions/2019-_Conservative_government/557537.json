        "additional_details": "Other years are able to do their lessons at home and decrease the spread of the virus. This means schools have less chance of closing so year 11s can have full attention from teachers including one on one time with students. We have missed lots of education, but this may give time for teachers to help us succeed in our mocks and starting preparing us all for real GCSEs.",
        "background": "I think schools should close but keep year 11s in. This will decrease the spread of the virus and have all the attention on year 11s during mocks. Year 11s have missed so much and need full attention from teachers.",
