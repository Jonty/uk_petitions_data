        "additional_details": "Current policy only guarantees non-eviction, but then relies on landlords and tenants to 'establish an affordable repayment plan' with no legal mandate of leniency for tenants. We cannot rely on people to be reasonable, there must be legal recourse to back this up. \r\n\r\nLandlords are some of the wealthiest in society, we must ask them to shoulder more of the burden.",
        "background": "There is no legal requirement that landlords pass on the savings from mortgage holidays. As such, many renters are paying the same rates despite earning 80% or less, and many businesses making 0 revenue still have rent due. The average london resident spends 40%-50% of their normal salary on rent.",
