        "additional_details": "The key benefits:\r\n\r\nHealth: SAD could be reduced as people could use the longer evenings to socialise and engage in leisure activities such as sport.\r\n\r\nSafety: It could prevent 80 deaths and more than 200 serious injuries on UK roads every year.\r\n\r\nEnvironment: CO2 pollution could be reduced by at least 447,000 tonnes each year, due to a lower electricity demand for artificial light in the evenings.\r\n\r\nTourism: UK tourism industry could be boosted by \u00a31bn every year due to longer and lighter days.",
        "background": "Around 1 in 3 people suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder in the UK; moving on to SDST could greatly combat this. Rather than wasting the precious hour of light in the morning, on a commute or in an office, we could utilise it in the evening, after work, for socialising and outdoor activities.",
