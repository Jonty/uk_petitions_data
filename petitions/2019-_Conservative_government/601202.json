        "additional_details": "People with a positive PCR test within the last 180 days are now eligible for the NHS Covid pass which recognises their immunity status allowing them to travel throughout Europe and enter events in the same way as double-vaccinated people.\r\n\r\nHowever, when it comes to the NHS Test and Trace, people with natural immunity due to recovery from infection within the last 6 months are still required to self-isolate if they were in contact with someone who tested positive, even if they don't have symptoms and can show a negative PCR test. This needs to be updated in line with the current scientific evidence regarding immunity gained after natural infection with Covid-19.",
        "background": "The government should consider including people who have recovered from natural infection (as proven by a recent PCR test or antibody test) on the list of exemptions for NHS Test and Trace self-isolation when they were in contact with a person who tested positive.",
