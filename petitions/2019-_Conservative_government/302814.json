Instead they are claiming it is 'no longer necessary' despite the tests being widely unavailable even when 'necessary.'   This is at odds with the current advice from the World Health Organisation.   \r\n\r\nPeople who may be infected can not at present find out if they are, increasing the risk they will not self-isolate, and will infect others.",
