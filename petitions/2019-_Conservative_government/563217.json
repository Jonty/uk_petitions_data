        "additional_details": "I want the government to consider introducing a change to the Learning Support Fund and allowing Nursing Associate Students being eligible for the funding package as if we do not have the direct entry requirements for the Direct Nursing degree we technically lose out on funding as once we complete the Nursing Associate course we go directly into year two of the nursing degree meaning not only are we losing funding we are also struggling to afford placement and living expenses during this time.",
        "background": "I think as a nursing associate student that has to attend mandatory placement and also learns everything a nurse learns in year one that we should be eligible for this funding as some students have to access this course enabling them to move to the nursing degree course,However we don't get funding",
