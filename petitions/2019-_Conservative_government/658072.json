        "additional_details": "All development sites must undergo hedgehog surveys by qualified ecologists to inform planning decisions.\r\nCompulsory mitigations must include:\r\n1. Legally require 13cm x 13cm gaps in all new fences & walls to allow hedgehogs to move freely.\r\n2. Protecting existing habitats by prioritising the preservation of hedgerows, scrubland & other natural features crucial for hedgehog survival within development sites.\r\n3. Enforcing responsible practices during construction to minimise impact on hedgehogs.",
        "background": "The way we develop land has a direct impact on hedgehog survival.  Preserving existing habitats and incorporating hedgehog-friendly features into new developments are essential for reversing their decline. \r\nDevelopers must be required to conduct hedgehog surveys & implement mitigation measures.",
