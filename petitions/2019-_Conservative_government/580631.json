Not only is this bad for the environment, but it\u2019s also a highly dangerous drug which is now becoming a major issue. \r\n\r\nWe need to make these products harder to access. Businesses who use these regularly should require a license to purchase them, and all other purchases of these should be illegal.",

There needs to be some way to regulate the purchases of these canisters. As they are for kitchen use, businesses should require a license to purchase them.",
