        "additional_details": "Social services are under a lot of pressure to decide whether they deem a child safe or not, with manipulative parents this must be a challenge. Give them longer to assess the situation, with unplanned weekly visits occurring for at least 2 months. Also extra professionals, if needed to assess child\u2019s behaviour/relationship with parent or person reported (I.e. child psychologists).\r\nThere are many other things: \r\nlike evidence found in recent cases, I.e. phone communications/cctv etc., it should be a priority to investigate fully before the case is closed and the worst happens!",
        "background": "Clearly, the current system isn\u2019t working. I feel that a continuous assessment period of around 2 months, a visit at least once per week would be much more efficient to assess child abuse than 1 single visit and 1 judgment- based decision made. There needs to be clear evidence before closing case.",
