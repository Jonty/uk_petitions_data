Especially those who don't have a driving licence and can't ride a bike. E-scooters would be perfect to the more responsible adult.",
        "background": "Make e-scooters legal to anyone over the age of 18 to commute to work. Its better for traffic and the environment, Its easier for people to travel that can't ride a bike and don't have a driving licence. I do think people over the age of 18 will be more responsible.",
