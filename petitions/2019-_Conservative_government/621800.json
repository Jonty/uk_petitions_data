        "additional_details": "I have 2 adopted sons, both with early life trauma and attachment issues. We've faced years of crisis and a short-term adoption breakdown.  The ASF approved dyadic developmental type psychotherapy, which provided minimal change and re-traumatised.  Neurofeedback therapy identified significant anxiety state, proving high intensity trauma therapy to be too overwhelming.  Recent self-funded neurofeedback work succeeded beyond our expectations and we believe it should be accessible under the ASF.",
        "background": "I need an urgent change to the Adoption Support Fund to include Neurofeedback Therapy as a type of approved therapy and made eligible for payments from the ASF.  As an adoptive parent, I've found Cognitive Behavioural Therapies, seen as the therapy of choice with trauma, is not the best approach.",
