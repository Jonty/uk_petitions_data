        "additional_details": "The FA are looking increasingly more likely to cancel the 2019-20 season. Significant amounts of money, emotion and effort have been invested in this season, by fans and players alike. It would be a gross act of injustice to see this go to waste. Liverpool are on course for the highest points total in history, and their first title in 30 years. If the FA can rearrange the season to accommodate the World Cup, they should show the same respect to fans as they do to the corrupt FIFA bureaucrats.",

Matches can be played before the start of the next season and, if necessary, in midweek and behind closed doors.",
