Every morning and after school pick up vehicles \u2018park\u2019 up and take their children into school leaving the mums/dads who walk to school with their children having to cross a busy road without the view of the full road. It\u2019s a matter of time before some innocent child gets knocked down just simply trying to cross the road.\r\nPlease help us change this. Be a good role model and PARK SAFELY!",
