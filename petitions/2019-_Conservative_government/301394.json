        "additional_details": "I've witnessed the growth of the two local Universities from having a combined enrolment below 10,000 students to more than 26,000 in 25 years. This expansion has only been possible due to a large number of private homes being brought and rented as HMO's. The situation has devastated local communities with high HMO concentrations within certain districts. This issue is mirrored across the Nation in Towns & Cities as the Universities have expanded unchecked year on year.",

Some towns and Cities have areas with very high HMO concentrations vs. permanent residents which adversely affects the local community spirit.",
