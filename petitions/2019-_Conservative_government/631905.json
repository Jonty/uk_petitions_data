This has been a difficult journey for me, and I am still in the process of my diagnoses. If screening had been available when I was 18, I believe this would have been a much easier process for me. I am creating this petition for young women in the same situation as me; I don\u2019t want anyone else to experience what I\u2019m going through.",
