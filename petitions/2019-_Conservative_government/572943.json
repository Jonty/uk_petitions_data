        "action": "Deliver our extra Covid Vaccines to the lowest income & hardest hit countries.",
        "additional_details": "\"Be safe, be smart, be kind.\" (WHO Director General) Our extra Covid vaccines offer an opportunity. As the virus mutates, it is in our enlightened self interest to vaccinate as many people globally. Varying quality data collection & analysis makes it challenging to define which countries are hardest hit and in greatest need but working with the WHO & local partners we can support those countries most in need. Hopefully, other nations will share this vision at the G7 Summit that we host in June.",
        "background": "The UK has ordered far more Covid Vaccines than we need. If Parliament concludes, after debate, that the extra vaccines would do more good elsewhere, I'd like a commitment to deliver all these vaccines to a country/countries that the World Health Organisation (WHO) considers to be the most in need.",
