        "additional_details": "With rail emissions approx 13 times lower than air, removing the option to fly would make a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions. \r\n\r\nAt a time when we need to do all we can to cut carbon, we should follow the lead of France and Spain who have banned, or are considering banning, domestic routes where rail provides a viable alternative.\r\n\r\nThe 4.5 hour cut-off includes Lon-Edinburgh and Lon-Glasgow, two of the UK\u2019s most-used flight routes, where journey times are comparable with rail.",
        "background": "Follow France\u2019s lead and remove air routes where there is a direct rail link of 4.5 hours or less, to help rapidly bring emissions down in line with the UK\u2019s legally-binding net zero targets.",
