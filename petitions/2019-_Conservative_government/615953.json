        "background": "Please consider psoriasis as a disability and invest more money in finding potential causes and a cure for all types. In the meantime, support the sufferers that are hit with crippling psoriatic arthritis also. Thank you for joining me in this campaign to raise awareness and more support.",

Similarly, eligibility for disability benefits is based on the impact a disability has on a person's life.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore already the case that people who have narcolepsy, where this has a a \u2018substantial\u2019 and \u2018long-term\u2019 negative effect on their ability to do normal daily activities, would be protected under the Equality Act.\r\n\r\nDecisions about making reasonable adjustments for people with a disability are a matter for individual service providers, not the UK Government or Parliament.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about disability discrimination here: https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/advice-and-guidance/disability-discrimination\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do, such as funding more research and support for psoriasis, if that's something you'd like to see happen.
