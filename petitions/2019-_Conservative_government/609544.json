        "additional_details": "For too long, the UK and it\u2019s overseas territories have been reliable and secure deposit-boxes for the Russian elite. Many of the UK\u2019s most premium properties, much of them in London, stand empty - the holdings of kleptocratic oligarchs in whose interest the Putin regime primarily acts. As part of the sanctions prepared in response to Putin\u2019s illegal invasion of Ukraine, these ill-gotten properties should be seized, and if necessary their ownership should revert to the British State.",
        "background": "The UK government should immediately seize all properties across the UK, many concentrated in the luxury districts of London, owned by oligarchs linked in any way to the Putin regime. Their ownership should be suspended, pending cessation of illegal hostilities against Ukraine.",
