        "additional_details": "It is crucial that sensitive location and medical data is collected and stored securely.\r\n\r\nWith a centralized approach, all user data is collected, processed, and stored on a single centralized system.\r\n\r\nWith a decentralized approach, user data remains on the handset of the individual. Used only to serve anonymous alerts to other app users after a confirmed diagnosis.\r\n\r\nTo effectively combat Covid-19 the app will need to be used by up to 60% of the population. This means public trust in the app is key.",
        "background": "NHSX are developing a contact tracing app to reduce the transmission of Covid-19\r\n\r\nWe request that the app use the more secure decentralized model of data collection (meaning data stays on a user's device) rather than putting user privacy at risk by storing data externally on a centralized server.",
