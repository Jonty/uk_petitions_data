        "additional_details": "Education is a key part of many people's lives; the gateway to their future. However, as much as it is useful to know about the past and the wonderful Shakespearean literature, we also need to be aware of the new emerging things in our society. The UK prides itself in being a multicultural society but there is not enough mention of other cultures in the materials that students are taught. The Government is responsible for the national curriculum, and should ensure this includes culturally diverse content.",
        "background": " \r\nWe want more cultural diversity in the national curriculum to widen students' knowledge about the world they will be going into in the near future. The Government needs to show that we are a multicultural society through what the young people are taught. Show that the future is bright.\r\n",
