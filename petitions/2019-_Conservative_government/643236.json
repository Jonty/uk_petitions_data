        "additional_details": "Misuse of fireworks by the public has escalated dramatically. In my locality it is not unusual to be woken multiple times of night by firework displays after the legal cut off of 11pm, sometimes at late as 2am. This is a public nuisance. The misuse of fireworks is tough to police and so the problem must be fought at the source. Drug gangs use fireworks as a means of marking their territory. Fireworks upset children and animals and are physically dangerous if mishandled.",
