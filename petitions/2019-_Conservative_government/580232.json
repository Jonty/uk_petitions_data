        "additional_details": "Large numbers of parents are been ignored when expressing concerns over their babies allergy symptoms. Healthcare professionals are dismissing symptoms relating to allergies as standard baby issues (colic, eczema, sensitive baby, etc.) due to a lack of understanding. This then results in both the baby and parents needlessly suffering, until symptoms are so extreme that they end up in hospital and being properly diagnosed.",
        "background": "The Government should fund more training for healthcare professionals on recognising allergies in babies. Cows' milk allergy is one of the most common childhood food allergies. It is estimated to affect around 7% of babies under 1. Yet many babies end up in A&E after symptoms have been dismissed.",
