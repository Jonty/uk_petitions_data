We are going through a cost of living crisis, there is war close to us, we have lived through a pandemic and Brexit. It is time we are able to influence politics and say who we would like to represent us. We deserve a choice rather than another candidate stepping forward from the party that is currently in control. We have been under the same party leadership for a long time. It is time for a general election.",
