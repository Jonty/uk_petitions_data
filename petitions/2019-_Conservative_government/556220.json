        "additional_details": "Challenge Sky Sports approach & shame big corp on the ethics of double charging for services. The people who will suffer most are those who can least afford to watch their football teams. Sport is a welcome distraction but many fans cannot afford to pay \u00a315 for games in addition to subscription fees. Premier league clubs and organisations like Sky Sports should be contributing to the communities that have supported them and established their current significant wealth. Not asking for more money.",
        "background": "During the pandemic many people have taken reduced incomes or lost their jobs. It\u2019s a scandal while we need distractions, such as sports, Sky has greedily chosen to introduce Pay Per View for Friday Saturday & Sunday games. This strategy was not openly shared when we signed up to 18 month contracts.",
