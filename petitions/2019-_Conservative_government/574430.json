        "background": "There is strong evidence that Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) are found in UK food packaging. There are extensive studies that show these \"forever chemicals\" are an immanent threat to public health. They should be banned from manufacturing, like the global ban on the use of PFOA",
