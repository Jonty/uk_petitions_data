        "additional_details": "I want children of this generation to be the ones that bring change upon this racist world. For them to actually appreciate the culture, history, their ancestors. For them to know slavery wasn't a 'long time ago' as some people like to state and they shouldn't just need to 'get over it' because it is a staple in history and in many lives. They need to know what happened after slavery. Segregation, night downtowns, lynching and the introduction of the KKK and other Far Right neo-Nazis movements which are still active today and children are unaware they have grown up thinking the world is perfect. Well, it isn't and it is not a happy, absolute place they are told it is. Black children and children of colour are not learning about the horrific things their ancestors went through.",
        "background": "Change the curriculum in schools to teach children more about Black History in-depth and other relevant things that are happening today such as the war in Yemen. The school is teaching censored topics when what they should be teaching is the whole truth especially for older years in secondary.",
