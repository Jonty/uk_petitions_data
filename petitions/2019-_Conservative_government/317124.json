Students have been stuck in home (apart from key worker\u2019s children) for nearly two months and have not had a chance to socially interact with their friends or express themselves out of school and in school. Many teens are also dealing with metal heath issues and it\u2019s hard for them during this time. And students would find it helpful to dress in non uniform to feel more expressed and comfortable.",
