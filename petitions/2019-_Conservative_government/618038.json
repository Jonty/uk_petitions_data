Since the price hike carers are unable to afford to put fuel into their cars. Since April where I work, we have lost around 20% of staff where they have gone into other professions where they are not required to use their own vehicle. Carers should be given discounted fuel to subsidise costs and keep people in the profession as they provide an essential role within communities.",
