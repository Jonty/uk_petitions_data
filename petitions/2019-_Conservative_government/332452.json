        "additional_details": "Despite other public sectors receiving a pay rise many NHS staff were left out despite them still coming into work everyday, gowning up in PPE and fighting the Coronavirus and saving many, many lives. Boris Johnson himself said he 'owes his life to NHS staff', they deserve more than a weekly clap. \r\n\r\nAlthough the three year pay rise deal was agreed (previous to COVID-19) it is entirely unfair to keep these departments who were crucial in and still are fighting the pandemic out of the pay rise.",
        "background": "All NHS staff should receive a pay rise for their outstanding hard work during the COVID-19 pandemic. \r\n\r\nNurses, porters, paramedics, healthcare workers, hospital cleaners etc were all on the front line fighting this deadly virus and saving lives.",
