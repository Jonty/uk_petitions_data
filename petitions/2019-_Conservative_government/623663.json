        "additional_details": "On 6th December 2017, former Prime Minster Theresa May said:\r\n\r\nWe disagree with the US decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem and recognise Jerusalem as the Israeli capital before a final status agreement. We believe it is unhelpful in terms of prospects for peace in the region. The British Embassy to Israel is based in Tel Aviv and we have no plans to move it.\r\n\r\nNo status agreement has been agreed, moving the embassy at this time will mean favouring one side over the other",
        "background": "We urge the Government not move the UK embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Juresleum.\r\n\r\nIf the UK is serious about its commitment for last peace in the Middle East it must not move the UK embassy. \r\n\r\nThe UK Government does not recognise Juresleum as being the capital of Israel.",
