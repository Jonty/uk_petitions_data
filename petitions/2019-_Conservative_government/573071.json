        "additional_details": "As a school governor and a parent of daughters in both secondary and primary schools, I know how far the standard of education has improved since I was at school - my children have better maths skills than I did at their age, greater appreciation of English grammar, and an opportunity to experience scientific and technological discovery to far greater degree. \r\n\r\nBut languages have been marginalised. In response to budget cuts and league table pressure, the scope of language teaching has narrowed.",
        "background": "The breadth of education in most subjects has improved over the last 30 years, but language teaching has gone backwards. \r\n\r\nMost children only ever experience one foreign language, and can drop it entirely at 14. This puts them, and the nation, at a cultural and economic disadvantage in later life.",
