        "additional_details": "The last two years, schools have been disrupted a lot by the pandemic. The government has always acted late in planning what would happen with exams both in summer and in January. Therefore the government should start considering and announcing what arrangements can be made for 2022, as lessons online are not a substitute for school learning. There are many disadvantaged kids that don\u2019t have the same opportunities and it widens the attainment gap.",
        "background": "The Government should be planning with exam boards what arrangements they will make for the 2022 exam sets, and should announce this as soon as possible to avoid another crisis. This can be reduced content, more lenient marking, delaying exams or telling the topics (as planned for this year).",
