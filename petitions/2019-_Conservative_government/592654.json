        "additional_details": "Narcissistic abuse is a type of abuse where victims are often intentionally chosen, groomed and conditioned. The perpetrators lack empathy, compassion, morals & conscience and often take pleasure from hurting, abusing and shaming their victims. Perpetrators often instil fear into their victims to get them to comply to their demands, using threats and gaslighting.",
        "background": "The recent Domestic Abuse Act created a statutory definition of domestic abuse, which recognises psychological and emotional abuse, but we believe Narcissistic abuse should be made a specific criminal offence, to make it easier to tackle this type of abuse and take action against perpetrators.",
