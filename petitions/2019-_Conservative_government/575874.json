        "additional_details": "Software solutions are being deployed for the purposes of actively monitoring the actions of individuals in the workplace, public parks, retail outlets, etc. \r\n\r\nIt is unrealistic and unethical to implement A.I systems that activity monitor and track a persons' every move. Not only would this completely violate the privacy of an individual, but breaks the boundary of what is acceptable. The use of A.I for monitoring purposes is dangerous, grossly immoral and leads to totalitarianism.",
        "background": "A.I related technologies set the negative precedent that it is okay for a company or even government, to monitor an individuals' every move. A.I technology used for the monitoring of individuals to ensure the compliance of policy encroaches on man's right to privacy and is tremendously unrealistic.",
