        "action": "Government to make all businesses provide defibrillators in the workplace.",
        "additional_details": "It's been proven by medical specialists that some one who suffers a heart attack has a 75% more chance of survival if a Defibrillator is present. and there is a very low percentage of companies who even have such a life saving devices on site. In doing so this could lower the number of workplace deaths and more importantly save someone's life.  I believe from Mark's campaign all companies should follow suit in situation and issue Defibrillator's on all workplace sites all over the UK",
        "background": "Following the news of the death of young Oliver king a decade ago his father Mark King issued a campaign to make all schools to be issued with them. I truly admire Mark for doing this and his commitment to make this happen and I think his campaign speaks for all.",
