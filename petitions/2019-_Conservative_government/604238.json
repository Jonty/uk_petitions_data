        "additional_details": "People should not be forced to self-isolate if they have recently tested positive, and are therefore at less risk of passing Covid-19 to others.\r\n \r\nA lot of people have caught Covid-19 recently in the UK. If someone that has caught Covid recently leaves the country, on the return they'll have to do a PCR test on Day 2, which may be positive and mean a person has to isolate for 10 days, even though they may not be infectious.\r\n \r\nScraping this test for people who have recently tested positive for Covid-19 will reduce the barriers to travel and should be better for businesses.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to scrap the requirement for UK arrivals to take a PCR test on Day 2 after arriving in the UK, where they have tested positive (NHS PCR) in the UK less than 2 months before their latest arrival in the country.",
