        "action": "Fully legalise the production, sale and use of cannabis in the UK",
        "additional_details": "Until now the UK government has continued to claim that cannabis causes harm while at the same time allowing us to consume unlimited amounts of cigarettes and alcohol which have been scientifically proven to be far more harmful. The government has already legalised cannabis for medical use. In fact in 2019 alone the UK government exported 320 tons of medical cannabis worldwide making the the biggest exporter in the world. It's time they stop pretending and allow us to choose to consume or not!",
        "background": "As demonstrated by various other countries recently the legalisation of cannabis has had a positive impact. As proven in the US alone it has created a new booming industry not only creating 1000s of jobs but has also benefited the country by bringing vast sums in taxes.",
