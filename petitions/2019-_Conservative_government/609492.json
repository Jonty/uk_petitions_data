        "additional_details": "So far the UK waived the visa fee only for certain categories of Ukrainian family members of British citizens: spouses/civil and unmarried partners (that have been living together for at least 2 years); parents of children of under 18 and relatives of the same household with medical condition that require care. The Home Office must  urgently develop a special visa category for all those that fall outside of these requirements or provide evacuation assistance in Ukraine to bring them here.",
        "background": "Following Russia's attack on Ukraine many are now in danger but won't qualify for asylum. Many Ukrainians settled in the UK or naturalised as British citizens have family stuck in Ukraine, yet won't meet current visa requirements for their relatives joining them in the UK, when they must be able to.",
