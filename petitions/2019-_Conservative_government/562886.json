Many students could have taken a smaller maintenance loan and lived at home rather than paid for accommodation. Students are also expected to pay the \u00a39250 for a lesser standard of education compared with other years. The decisions surrounding these issues have been made my parliament without the consideration of students and how it affects them which need to be discussed.",
        "background": "Discuss the ramifications of their decisions on university students regarding Christmas travel window and fees. Students feel they are not getting the same standard of education as we would in 'normal' years, especially with lack of face to face and paying for accommodation that is not needed.",
