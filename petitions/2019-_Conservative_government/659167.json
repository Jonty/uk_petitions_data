We think there are clear disparities and gaps in law enforcement responses and we want them to be addressed.\r\n \r\nA public inquiry could place pressure on police to ensure missing cases of Black people are treated with the seriousness and urgency they deserve. The inquiry could consider how the government and law enforcement should work together with communities and the strategies that could be used to help give missing people the best chance.\u201d",

We have seen cases where Black people have gone missing and were found dead, with little media coverage. We want a public inquiry to be launched.",
