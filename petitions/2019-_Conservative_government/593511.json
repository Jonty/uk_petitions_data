In the UK at the moment, we need more delivery and distribution drivers. Could the relevant Government Department please provide a Bursary for those who are able and willing to become HGV or other delivery drivers. This is a national crisis that needs urgently addressing. Expecting individuals to pay out of their own pocket for these skills is rather too much at this point in time",
