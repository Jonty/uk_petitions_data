        "additional_details": "There is a shortage of health workers such as nurses in the NHS and this is exacerbated by health workers being employed by private companies such as AIS to conduct face to face assessment for people on benefits. \r\n These assessments cost the taxpayer a lot of money as well as using up valuable personnel. \r\n  If these assessment were stopped these people would be freed up to work in the NHS, and the money spent on them could also be used for the NHS during the Corona outbreak.",
        "background": "The Government must stop the DWP face to face Assessments for disabled people on benefits so that the health professionals employed making these assessments will be available for the NHS during the Corona outbreak, ensuring better care for those most vulnerable to the Corona virus.",
