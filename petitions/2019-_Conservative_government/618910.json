They are not something that is a needed requirement to improve the lives of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe NHS is what everyone will benefit from, including the hard working staff that struggle with the demands on them and the money would be better used for reducing waiting times, recruiting/training much needed staff, more paramedics/ambulances, improving support services and overall care and saving of lives.",
