        "additional_details": "I see everyday the struggles and frustrations of teens/young adults who do not want to go to college, who do not want to study anymore. They want to work and earn money.  I believe the current education system does not suit everyone and we need to move with the times. With mental health challenges on the increase, I believe forcing young adults into colleges and classrooms is not always the best.",
        "background": "I believe there are many teens who do not want to go onto full time education and want to work. A modern YTS scheme could assist their work placements and give them the opportunity to earn and learn life skills. College and apprenticeship learning does not suit everyone.",
