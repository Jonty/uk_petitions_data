        "additional_details": "Lifestyles have changed hugely in the last 5 years with a big increase in eating on the go, especially in vehicles (the UK uses over 2bn disposable coffee cups a year). The growth in e-commerce has created many jobs that require people to work out of cars and vans. Bin infrastructure has not changed and waste collection budgets reduced.  As a result roadsides are used as a dumping ground for all forms of litter and waste. ",

All media channels need to be used.  The campaign also needs to include frequent road signs to reinforce the message.",
