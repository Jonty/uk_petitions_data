        "additional_details": "Our planet is at a tipping point. Unless we use more renewable energy rather than fossil fuels, climate change will increase significantly. Solar power is a proven method for powering homes, and works well in most weather conditions. Installing solar panels on all new-build houses would reduce pressure on the National Grid, but would also provide a valuable energy resource for the grid to compensate for properties without solar. It would also be cost effective, especially on an estate scale.",
        "background": "Every new house that is built in the UK should be required to have solar panels installed on the roof, by law.",
