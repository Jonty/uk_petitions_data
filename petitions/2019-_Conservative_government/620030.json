We believe that the CPS is too lenient in bringing prosecutions against under 18s. A Government review could identify any issues with decision-making, and make recommendations for change where necessary.",
        "background": "We want the Government to review how rape and sexual offences committed by under 18s are handled by the criminal justice system, and in particular how decisions to prosecute are made. We believe that too many offences are not prosecuted because the CPS believes it is not in the public interest.",
