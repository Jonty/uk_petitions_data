The safety of the public is put at risk by this.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, horses are often subject to injury and put in frightening situations. Even a well-trained horse can react unpredictably when in a hostile situation, which is often instigated by the Police. \r\n\r\nProtest is a legitimate tool for making voices heard. However, it is evident that the use of police horses puts all involved at risk unnecessarily.",
