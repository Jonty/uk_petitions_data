        "action": "Apply the energy price cap to blocks of flats with communal heating & hot water.",
        "additional_details": "Blocks of flats with communal heating and hot water pay commercial gas rates which are not capped. With commercial gas prices looking to rise to perhaps 15 p/kWh this is a 5 fold increase in the cost of gas for flats with communal heating and hot water. A block of flats that had a \u00a350,000 gas bill is looking at a potential increase to \u00a3250,000 at a time when other costs are increasing above inflation such as insurance. This is unaffordable and unfair for those with communal heating/hot water.",
        "background": "Apply the equivalent energy price cap to communal heating and hot water in blocks of flats based on the number of flats in a block. A block with 50 flats would have the price cap applied for a single property x 50.",
