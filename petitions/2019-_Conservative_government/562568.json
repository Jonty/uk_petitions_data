        "additional_details": "Covid 19 has made many more people realise the essential and equally valuable contributions that people from different classes make. However, the life expectancies from people from working classes is lower than wealthier people living in neighbouring boroughs. Similarly the characterisation of people as 'chavs', 'having a chip on their shoulder' or attending 'bog standard comprehensives' is both insulting and limiting of people's potential. Access to education and employment ought not to be related to class nor ought salaries of those from poorer backgrounds remain lower than people from wealthier backgrounds performing the same employment roles.",
        "background": "Amend the Equality Act 2010 so that class discrimination is a prohibited ground of discrimination or introduce a separate Prohibition of Class Discrimination Act.",
