These cases should be referred so they can be heard by a Judge in court.\r\n\r\nFindings are being made by Lay Magistrates daily in Family Court proceedings yet Lay Magistrates only have to be in receipt of 3.5 days basic training, some private study, and then assigned a 'mentor'.\r\n\r\nMagistrates are not necessarily trained in victim behaviour after abuse, ability to recognize a pattern of abusive behaviour and recognizing controlling and coercive behaviour.\r\n\r\nI would like the Government to ensure that family court cases where domestic violence is an issue are only heard in court by a Judge.",
