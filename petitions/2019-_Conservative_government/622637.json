        "additional_details": "As a vulnerable young adult myself, I understand that young adults between 18-25 can still be very vulnerable due to their mental and emotional wellbeing, and I also know that access to adult mental health services isn't as abundantly available for some, and the process can be challenging due to the conditions young adults may be facing. The waiting list for CAMHS is also very long so there's children who are waiting for support but are ineligible as they reach adulthood before being seen.",
        "background": "As most people are aware, CAMHS is a mental health service on the NHS that aims to provide therapeutic and psychiatric support to children and young people under the age of 18 for mental health needs and learning disabilities (such as autism, ADHD/ADD, etc).",
