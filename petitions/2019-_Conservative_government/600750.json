They do and they are. Many are scared to come out of their homes because they get chased by gangs, some of whom carry knives and are involved in the illegal drug trade. It is unacceptable that there is fighting in broad daylight going on in town centres, muggings and stealing. The Government must take action now.",

They are a valuable resource in dealing with crime and anti-social behaviour. They are a deterrent and help to make the public feel more at ease.",
