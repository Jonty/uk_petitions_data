        "additional_details": "We're not safe until we're all safe.\r\n\r\nThe government must work with others to share knowledge and scale up supply such that the World Health Organisation confirms sufficient CoViD-19 vaccine has been distributed to at risk groups in all countries.\r\n\r\nWe, as British citizens who are not in at risk groups, PLEDGE to insist the government achieve this before undertaking to vaccinate ourselves against CoViD-19.",
        "background": "We believe it unacceptable that Britain is among wealthy nations who have bought up enough CoViD-19 doses to vaccinate their entire populations nearly three times over by the end of 2021, while nearly 70 poor countries will only be able to vaccinate one in ten against the virus next year.",
