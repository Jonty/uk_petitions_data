        "action": "Extend theory test certificates to be valid one extra year, due to the pandemic.",
        "additional_details": "I believe that an extension of theory test certificates for people who have passed just before this global pandemic has occurred should have a fair chance in having the opportunity to pass their driving test. As this pandemic has caused tests that were booked to be cancelled and for some people more than once. This is heartbreaking for a person. I find it very upsetting that for a person like myself, may never pass my driving test due to the current cancellations all across the UK.",
        "background": "Theory test pass certificates are only currently valid for 2 years from passing. I think this should be extended to an extra year from 2021, for example if a person has past their theory test in February 2019 this persons theory test will be running out February this year.",
