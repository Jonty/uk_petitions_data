        "action": "Replace all spirometers that falsely correct for race/ethnicity from the NHS",
        "additional_details": "In 1864, a study was conducted that totalled to a 613 page report in an effort to try to prove that black people\u2019s lung capacity was lower than that of white people\u2019s in order to justify slavery, arguing that black people needed forced labour to stretch their lungs and to \"vitalise their tainted blood\". This is vastly untrue, but because of this false belief, BAME individuals today are more likely to receive inadequate treatment for asthma. The worst consequence of this is death.",
        "background": "Due to prior forged and false evidence about BAME individuals having lower forced vital lung capacity (FVC), data-altering spirometers were created in the 1800s that still exist today and are in use. We ask that all of these are removed from the NHS and teaching and are replaced with updated models.",
