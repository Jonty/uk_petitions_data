        "additional_details": "Whilst I appreciate that people have not asked for the Covid 19, people who have been furloughed have effectively had leave and been paid for it. It does not seem fair for people who have been working during the lockdown to be penalised for this and for these individuals to have to pay this money back. They would also have already paid their tax and national insurance for this period.",
        "background": "If the government aims to recoup the monies paid to furloughed employees  by increasing taxes, it would perhaps be appropriate to look at tax codes for those who have been furloughed and amend those accordingly.",
