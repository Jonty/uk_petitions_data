        "additional_details": "Requiring in-person voting at the House of Commons, in 2020, when digital voting has been working just fine for the last few months, is not just farcically antiquated. It is discriminatory towards shielding and disabled MPs, and in turn disenfranchises huge swathes of the electorate. \r\n\r\n261 votes in favour to 163 against means that 226 Members had to abstain. This vote cannot be deemed anything like fair, representative or democratic. We all deserve better.",
        "background": "The House of Commons should immediately disregard the members' vote, held on 2/6/20, and reintroduce remote digital voting for MPs on parliamentary issues.",
