        "additional_details": "It is important that we learn about racism and be educated on it In schools. Even though you might not think it affects you, it may affect a friend or even a family member. Sometimes we may not notice that acts of racial discrimination has taken place as they are now in the form of microaggressions. If we are educated on race and how it makes an impact, we can use this to help recognise it and in turn be impactful. This should go alongside side reforms to tackle racial discrimination within school.",
