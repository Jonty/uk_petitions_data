        "additional_details": "New evidence quantifies IQ and functional loss risks - also ADHD /ASD increments - augmented if fluoridated water is used for infant formula in place of breast milk. \r\n\r\nAll this harm stands against ever more derisory caries restraint via fluoridation since 1975. Topical fluoride in pastes and varnishes plus regular inspections and conservative treatments - free to every Sottish child via ChildSmile - promote real caries reductions. \r\n\r\nUK Parliament must ultimately reject blinkered DoH legislation.",
        "background": "This Federal Court trial seeks to establish that EPA must regulate fluoride ion ppm in US drinking water to remove all unreasonable risks to fetal and infant brain development found at 0.7 ppm. On 7 June NTP's revised report should enable Judge Chen to redirect EPA and Plaintiffs. Follow this case.",
