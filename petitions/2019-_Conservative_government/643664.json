Why not instead of focusing all the attention on a dog breed which results in a witch hunt for dogs resulting in thousands being killed for absolutely nothing, focus instead on the cause which is bad ownership and humans either not being firm enough with their dog and respecting other humans or over disciplining them.",

Instead we should focus on ownership laws and make the owner take more responsibility for their dogs. A dog should not suffer for bad owners",
