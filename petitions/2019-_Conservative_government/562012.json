It will save jobs, lives, and livelihoods.\r\n\r\nIt is not only a moral obligation but a social obligation. You sit back behind your closed doors and do not understand the impact you are having by forcing those that rely on this trade to close.\r\n\r\nOpen your eyes, there is a world beyond your agenda and it will collapse without help.\r\n\r\nThank you",
        "background": "The Government are destroying the Hospitality Industry.\r\n\r\nOpening up other sectors but not the Hospitality Sector is criminal and will lead to thousands of job losses, and millions unemployed.\r\n\r\nWe propose opening it, on the 2/12/2020, under previous guidelines from the first lockdown.",
