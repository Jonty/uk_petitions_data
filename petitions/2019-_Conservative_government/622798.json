        "additional_details": "At present there is a nationally accredited Building Better Relationships (BBR) programme that aims to increase understanding of motivating factors in domestic violence, reduce individual risk factors linked to violence and develop pro-social relationship skills. There is no equivalent programme for women who are found guilty of domestic abuse offences. We believe this means female abusers are not receiving adequate support to rehabilitate and change abusive behaviour.",
        "background": "We want the Government to establish a national rehabilitation scheme for women who have domestically abused male partners. We believe current rehabilitation schemes are insufficient, and do not offer equivalent support to the national scheme for men who commit domestic abuse offences.",
