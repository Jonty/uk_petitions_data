There is no equivalent programme for women who are found guilty of domestic abuse offences. We believe this means female abusers are not receiving adequate support to rehabilitate and change abusive behaviour.",

We believe current rehabilitation schemes are insufficient, and do not offer equivalent support to the national scheme for men who commit domestic abuse offences.",
