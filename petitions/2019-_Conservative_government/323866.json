        "additional_details": "Using \u201cminority\u201d and ethnic in the same phrase as a label connotes that if an individual is not white, they are not part of the country. Research shows that words with certain connotations affect the way an individual processes that word. Consequently, if a word with a negative connotation is used to label a group of people, that negative feeling will be associated with that group. Majority = superiority, Minority = inferiority. In order to fully establish equality, this needs to change.",
        "background": "Instead, have a list of all of the ethnic cultures that exist. If equality truly is to exist, it need to be felt by those in all ethnic backgrounds on every level. If a word is to be used to categorise people who are not black, use a phrase that will not demean the value of that persons heritage.",
