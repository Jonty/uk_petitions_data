        "additional_details": "I want them to do it because it unfair for certain students to get preferable treatment and not have to use their student loan for rent yet some students do. It is unjust, especially as everyone is suffering the same financial burden. The government need to support university students during this difficult time. Personally I have lost my job and get the minimum loan at not fault of my own, and to hear certain students have been relieved of this stress is not equal.",
        "background": "Many universities have suspended the rent for the uni ran student accommodation leaving many students in private tenancies still having to pay rent. want landlords to provide the same service for all students and suspend final rent payments, with the government supporting these landlords funding.",
