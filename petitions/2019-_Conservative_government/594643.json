        "additional_details": "Year in year out countless Greyhound dogs are killed or neglected due to losing their competitive strive, not being viewed as profitable or being injured and deemed unfit to race. I do not believe that retired Greyhounds are adequately protected by current animal rights laws. In my personal experience of caring for neglected greyhounds, I strongly believe it is a misconception that they love to race. These dogs deserve forever homes, they are not disposable money makers.",
        "background": "The Government must make Greyhound racing illegal, and introduce penalties for killing dogs that are deemed unfit to race and breeding more than two litters per dog for racing activity. Laws must also be put in place to protect retired greyhounds and prevent them from further harm.",
