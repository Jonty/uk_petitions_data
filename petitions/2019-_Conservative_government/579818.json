It is disgusting that women feel they are unable to walk the streets alone at night or simply for exercise. The app would have the ability to track your location whilst using it so if there was any signs of danger you\u2019d know where the person is and can respond right away through the app. Also having volunteers on the streets on the evening being vigilant adds an extra layer of protection for the public.",

Too many people go missing or are taken from the streets whilst alone and completely unaware. Not enough is done to prevent this.",
