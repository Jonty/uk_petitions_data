        "additional_details": "The European Commission plans to ban cages for all farmed animals, potentially by 2027, and will also look to prohibit the import of food from caged systems. This would result in the UK lagging behind the EU and may add bureaucracy to trade with the UK\u2019s largest export market - possibly damaging the whole British farming sector.\r\nThe UK Government must work to secure by 2027, across the UK, a ban on the use of:\r\n-barren, enriched and \u2018combi\u2019 cages\r\n-farrowing crates for sows\r\n-individual calf pens",
        "background": "Every year across the UK, millions of farmed animals are kept in cages, unable to express their natural behaviours and experiencing huge suffering. These inhumane systems cannot be the future of British farming.  The UK Government must legislate to \u2018End the Cage Age\u2019 for all farmed animals.",
