        "additional_details": "Anyone can become a dog trainer or dog behaviourist. There are so many online courses that dish out certificates, for as little as \u00a330 but for people achieving these certificates, it can be dangerous for them, the dogs owners but more importantly, the dog, due to the lack of experience and practical ability of the trainer. All current and aspiring dog trainers and behaviourists should belong to a membership organisation and follow a code of practice, set by said organisation.",
        "background": "A standard, such as a tier system should be implemented, to grade, upon the qualifications they have achieved. Dog trainers and behaviourists must belong to a reputable membership body and have gained practical as well as theoretical assessment.",
