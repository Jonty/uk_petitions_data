        "action": "UK Government to offer Covid-19 vaccines to all British nationals overseas",
        "additional_details": "The UK will donate 100 million surplus coronavirus vaccine doses internationally within the next year. Yet many thousands of overseas British nationals have no prospect of being vaccinated against Covid-19 in their host country and with travel restrictions in place are unable to return to the UK to be vaccinated. The purpose of this petition is to raise awareness of this issue and ask the UK Government to prioritise Covid-19 vaccines for all overseas Brits as part of its international effort.",
        "background": "Many British nationals living, working and travelling overseas are unable to access Covid-19 vaccines in their host countries. I would like the UK Government to now prioritise overseas British nationals by offering them a vaccine through the Diplomatic missions.",
