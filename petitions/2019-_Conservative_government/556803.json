The government has not addressed the severity of this Issue. \r\nAn Anti-Islamophobic narrative, Legislation and Law needs to be pushed forward by the government, to be addressed by all members of the public, organisations, governing bodies and people whom hold significant positions, in order to hold Islamophobic people to account and be scrutinised. \r\nWe need change parameters to be put in place. \r\n",

A stance to stop the widespread and condemn all types of Islamophobic remarks against Islam & Prophet Muhammed S.A.W is required in order to ensure the safety of all Law Abiding Muslims.",
