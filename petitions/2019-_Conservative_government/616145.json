        "additional_details": "My 18 week old little puppy Ralphy was attacked and killed by a supposedly \u2018safe\u2019 unmuzzled greyhound on May 4th 2022.\r\n\r\nDog breeds such as greyhounds, that have traditionally been bred to hunt small animals such as hare and deer, are more likely to attack smaller pets if the dog isn\u2019t handled correctly. There have been an increasing number of dog attacks on humans and dogs over the years. I think that if all hunting dog breeds were required to be muzzled in public, my 18 week old Yorkshire terrier, weighing just 2kg, would not have been killed.",
        "background": "The Government should require all hunting dog breeds such as greyhounds to be muzzled when out in public. Breeds like this may appear to be friendly, but under certain circumstances can switch in a split second and attack unprovoked.",
