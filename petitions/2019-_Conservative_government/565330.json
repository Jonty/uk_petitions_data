        "additional_details": "Love conquers all. Love offers hope and faith which is desperately needed in these times. It is a human right to be able to form an official married bond, and this should never be stripped away from us as it currently has been. We never know when this world will take us (especially in this current climate), so it is not just to allow only deathbed weddings. Marriage progresses lives, and the economy through buying a home/car, having children, fees of document changes, loans etc. We need to marry",
        "background": "The Government should change the guidance on Civil Wedding ceremonies to allow them during the current pandemic regardless of tier or national lockdown restrictions. We ask that a maximum of 6 guests to be able to attend if the venue space allows to maintain social distance.",
