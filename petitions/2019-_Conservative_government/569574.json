The gov allow local authorities (LA\u2019s) to fail children & refuse to assess them leading to low success rates poor mental health & preventing them from being able to contribute to society as an adult.\r\n\r\nMake it law that they are automatically entitled to assessment, with their consent & that they MUST be assessed in a given timescale. The attached link\u00a0https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/tribunal-statistics-quarterly-january-to-march-2019 shows that LA\u2019s aren\u2019t correctly identifying needs. Of 3770 send tribunals 09/2019-08/2020 only 190 of those were won by LA\u2019s, just over 5%. This means the LA\u2019s failed 95% of the SEN children in cases taken to tribunal that year. This has to change, please sign.",
