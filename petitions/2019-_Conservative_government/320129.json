        "additional_details": "The closure of schools, whilst necessary, has meant that students in year 10/12 are now faced with the task of learning the many different specifications and courses independently at home. A heavy period of disrupted teaching puts these students at a disadvantage when it comes to sitting their public examinations next summer, many of which are crucial to students reaching the next step in their education. \r\n\r\nThe least the Government can do is ensure that the impact of COVID-19 on our lives and education will be taken into account when it comes to the 2021 A-Level and GCSE examinations and not let thousands of children's crucial education suffer.",
        "background": "To promise that the students sitting their A-Level/GCSE examinations in the summer of 2021 will be granted some sort of special consideration due to a heavy period of disrupted teaching as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
