The Civil Service Commission can investigate complaints about breaches of the code.\r\n\r\nMPs are subject to the House of Commons Code of Conduct, of which honesty is one of the general principles of conduct. The Committee on Standards and the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards can investigate complaints about breaches of the Code of Conduct.\r\n\r\nMinisters are subject to the Ministerial Code, which requires the principle of honesty to be honoured at all times.
