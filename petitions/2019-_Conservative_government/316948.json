        "additional_details": "The government have only promised financial aid for those who are isolating, not those who are caring for a seriously ill person. There are more and more people slipping between the gaps because of the government not providing the correct guidance on this, allowing these shielded people to potentially be collateral.\r\n\r\nWe must show compassion and consider the  danger as well as the anxiety induced for those whose loved ones have conditions that make them particularly vulnerable to Covid-19.",
        "background": "This is a petition calling for people living in a household with vulnerable people during the Coronavirus crisis to be protected from losing their jobs and paid 80% of their wage regardless of  profession. As a society we must protect those who are protecting others or we risk losing even more lives",
