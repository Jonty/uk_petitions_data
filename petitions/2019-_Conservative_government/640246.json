Many times this place has saved me and it's where my family know where I am and can find me. This can save police and NHS time.\r\n \r\nMy safe space is a car park, but I have to pay for parking and the car park is not always open. This means my 'safe space' is not always available to me. I want the Government to provide funding so local authorities can set up 'safe spaces' in their areas that are always available to people with mental health issues.\r\n",
