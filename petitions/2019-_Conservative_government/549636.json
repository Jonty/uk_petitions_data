        "action": "Require a licence for the sale of pet animals in any circumstance",
        "additional_details": "If all sales required a license this would make it much easier to spot those not adhering to this. It would also make it easier for members of the public to check their seller before a purchase, rather than relying on intuition.\r\n\r\nThis would not negatively impact responsible pet sellers as these are already required to have a licence. The fees for licences could go some or all of the way towards covering costs for license issuing and continued monitoring, including regular microchip checks.",
        "background": "The Pet Animals Act 1951 dictates that keepers of pet shops must have a licence, and Lucy's Law bans third-party puppy & kitten sales, but many who sell pet animals are excluded from these requirements due to infrequent sales or selling of older dogs. This loophole makes enforcement much harder.",
