        "additional_details": "I think all kids in education should be held back a year in school so no child moves from their Current class and they all go back in September 2021 to resit the year. I think the only new intake for 2021 should be nursery children creating a nursery\u2019s class 1 and 2 for the new intakes and the kids being held back a year. I have a child who got predicted grades in 2020 at school and now will have predicted grades at college for some kids it\u2019s 2years of predicted grades (let\u2019s help our children )",
        "background": "Due to covid education for children has been so hard and having predicted grades has caused so much confusion for young people it would be nice to see positive change and think about holding all children in education back a year please",
