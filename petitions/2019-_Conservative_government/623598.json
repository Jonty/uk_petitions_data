        "additional_details": "In the words of President Macron, \u201cto you, she was your Queen, to us, she was THE Queen\u2026The most constant symbol of Great Britain\u201d.\r\nShe was indeed, an inspirational woman.\r\n\r\nBritain has fewer bank holidays than most European countries; France has 11 compared with our 8, Spain has 14. We believe we need a new public bank holiday to mark our greatest Sovereign\u2019s lifetime; a Queen Elizabeth Day. This is a fitting permanent memorial to Queen Elizabeth the Great.",
        "background": "Queen Elizabeth II was our longest reigning Monarch, and the Nation's, and I believe the World\u2019s most popular ever Monarch. A day for our Nation to come together and celebrate the life of the Queen.  As longest serving monarch, her service and term as Head of State will never be repeated.",
