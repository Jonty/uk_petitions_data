        "additional_details": "Currently such relatives have to pay for expensive private tests at days 2 and 8 of their 10 day quarantine. In addition to pre-arrival and pre-departure tests, the fees make it too expensive to visit dying relatives. The current system can mean that terminally ill relatives are left alone. Funding should be provided to make these tests free on humanitarian grounds for those of us who have to frequently enter the UK to give practical and emotional help to the elderly and terminally ill.",
