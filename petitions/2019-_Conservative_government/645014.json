        "additional_details": "I believe this will rectify what I consider to be an unfair and unnecessary requirement, strengthen ties within the Commonwealth, promote equal treatment, and improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of immigration processes. In my view these changes would not only benefit Nigerians but also contribute to the UK's international standing and diplomatic relationships.",
        "background": "I urge the Government to review and ultimately revoke the requirement for Nigerians to prove their English language proficiency through exams as a prerequisite for working or studying in the UK. Given that English is the national language of Nigeria and Nigeria is a member of the Commonwealth.",
