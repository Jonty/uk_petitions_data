Sometime after the 20 week scan his heart and lungs stopped growing. If a scan was performed maybe things could be different. He could not have survived if delivered earlier but at least I could have prepared myself for the worst. When you\u2019re told your baby is perfectly healthy to then be told he\u2019s passed away has a big effect on that family\u2019s mental health.",
