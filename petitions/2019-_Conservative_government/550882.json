        "additional_details": "Though this is an ambitious plan, even if delivered in full the project has questionable rationale and limited benefits. It will siphon off huge amounts of taxpayer cash to a handful of big companies to complete a project that may not even be needed by the time it is complete (if a vaccine is found), and distracts from the work that needs to be done now to find a vaccine, control the virus and protect communities. If delivered this may even increase the spread by changing human behaviour.",
        "background": "If there are unlimited funds to address the pandemic, I want parliament to see all the scientific advice and debate options on the best use of taxpayers' money. I suggest supplementing existing infrastructure and growing testing capacity might be a more realistic, cost-effective alternative.",
