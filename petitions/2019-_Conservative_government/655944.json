        "additional_details": "Creating AI-generated pornography without the consent of the individual(s) depicted in it is a violation of that person's dignity. It can be designed to humiliate, denigrate, and violate a person for the pleasure of others. We believe it is at its mildest analogous to sexual harassment and at its worst to sexual assault. It is an affront to human decency, and it has no place in a civilised society. Legislation is needed to curtail its creation.",
