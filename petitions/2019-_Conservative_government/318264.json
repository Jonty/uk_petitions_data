        "background": "The scheme, announced by Chancellor, was a great solution however the extension only helps extra 200,000 employees but thousands of new starters fall through the cracks due to a loophole.\r\nTo qualify, employees now must be on a PAYE  -RTI payroll submission on March 19, not just be on the payroll..",
