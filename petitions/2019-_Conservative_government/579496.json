        "action": "Include sexual assault mitigation in the curriculum, save women from violence",
        "additional_details": "Secondary schools are the prime environment to undo the normalisation of violence against women. Some schools host sexual assault awareness weeks but encourage women to 'be careful' rather than teaching others to stop assault. For example, women are taught not to walk alone at night, not to leave drinks unattended at a party. This does not stop the violence! 97% of women have experienced sexual assault or harassment. This must be stopped. We deserve safety, to do nothing is to be complicit.",
        "background": "We must fight the crisis that is violence against women. To achieve this, the curriculum in secondary schools must include how to mitigate sexual violence- how to spot warning signs in friends behaviour, how words encourage violence, how to protect others and further means of reducing violence.",
