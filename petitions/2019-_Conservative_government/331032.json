        "additional_details": "I have worked within the removals industry for over 20 years. Year on year I keep thinking that the \u201csystem cannot get any worse \u201c but it unfortunately does.\r\nProperties falling through at the last minute. Solicitors delaying moving dates as late as 4pm the day before.\r\nMonies not being transferred within business hours, meaning that a whole chain of buyers/vendors goods could be on a vehicle for days.\r\nWe regularly have clients in tears on the phone due to the immense amount of stress caused.",
        "background": "The English Conveyancing system is failing.\r\nHomebuyers & Vendors are under an unfair amount of stress and anxiety, caused by a system that in 2020 should, & could be an infinitely smoother experience.\r\nI Feel that a great amount of good could come from an enquiry into these failings.",
