        "additional_details": "We stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people. But, the Government\u2019s first priority should always be to serve its people.\r\n \r\nDuring these difficult times, with soaring inflation, rising bills and rising taxes, many UK citizens are struggling to make ends meet. In favour of the interests of the British people, we believe the UK Government must cut public funding for Ukraine in favour of more financial support in the UK to help people in these difficult times, and to relieve pressure on public services.\r\n",
        "background": "The UK Government has announced an additional \u00a350m to support Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThe UK is facing an economic crisis of its own. In a time of crippling economic conditions, with many struggling to heat their homes and feed their families, the Government should focus on more public spending within the UK.",
