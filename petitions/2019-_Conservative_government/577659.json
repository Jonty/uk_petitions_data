        "additional_details": "Businesses which have large overheads but pay their business rates contribution via rent to their landlords are severely disadvantaged by the current Covid-related grant schemes. The local authority ARGs provide only a small fraction of the support available to businesses with a business rates account. These businesses have been closed by the state but are not eligible for the same level of state help. Providing a similar level of support is fundamentally fair and to not do so risks jobs.",
        "background": "ARG grants, including for businesses which do not have a business rates account, fall well below the support on offer to other companies. This is unfair and harms many small business owners and risks jobs. More help is needed.\r\n\r\nWe ask for parity of grants for those provided to other businesses.",
