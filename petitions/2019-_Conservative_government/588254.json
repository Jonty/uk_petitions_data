        "additional_details": "With the successful vaccination campaign in the UK as well as the continuous successful progress Portugal have produced in their own one, plus the fact statistics show that in the 100,000 of British tourists that visited Portugal, only 6 tested positive... This to me looks like it's now become almost full on political which means there is a reason other than covid that has made the UK gov create legislation to reduce travel to Portugal. Well, that is wrong, unfair and inhumane.",
        "background": "Since the covid restrictions started I only seen my family twice. Maybe for someone who does not share a strong bond with their family it's not a problem and they probably even welcome it, I moved to the UK because I could see them every 6-8 weeks year round. I feel alone, sad and empty.",
