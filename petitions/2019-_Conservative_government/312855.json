This is detrimental to the fact that an access course is a year-long meaning that during the national emergency there's no chance to get the grades they're predicted to receive. Worse off these students are having to pay an average of three thousand pounds. Meaning if they fail the course and aren't able to go to university they can't pay it back.",
