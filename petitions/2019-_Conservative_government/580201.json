        "additional_details": "The Australian government has an ongoing public awareness campaign called \u2018Stop it at the Start\u2019. It aims to help break the cycle of violence by encouraging adults to reflect on their attitudes, and have conversations about respect with young people. More information is available on their campaign website: www.respect.gov.au/the-campaign\r\n\r\nThe UK government should commit to a similar, long-term public awareness campaign to prevent violence against women.",
        "background": "Too many women in the UK encounter harassment, intimidation, threats, violence and associated silence. The UK needs a public awareness campaign to stop the cycle of violence against women. It doesn\u2019t start with violence. Tougher sentencing has its place, but prevention is better than cure.",
