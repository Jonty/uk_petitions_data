        "additional_details": "We would like the government to do this because though times have changed and more equality has been achieved the statues of those people represent a disgusting time in history that was unlawful and horrendous. Though they may have been erected for other reasons those people were still politician traders and for that reason they should not be standing. The U.K. is now a diverse place but injustice still exists for some minority groups. The tearing down of these statues is a great start to change.",
