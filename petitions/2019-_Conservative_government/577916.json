Many MPs, including the President and State Counsellor, were arrested.\r\n\r\nA group of elected parliamentarians have formed the CRPH to continue the functions of parliament as entrusted by the people of Myanmar.\r\n\r\nGiven our historic ties with Myanmar, the UK parliament can play a leading international role by recognising the CRPH.",
