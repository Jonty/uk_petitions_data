        "additional_details": "Practically, there is parity of position between health and social care: Social care employs more people than health, is intrinsically community based and supports a large number of the population. However, there is a significant lack of parity of esteem between the two. The government\u2019s recent early response to the COVID-19 and the March 2020 budget was exemplary of this lack of parity. This includes the pay and rewards of staff, professionalisation, funding, training and political discourse.",

We would like parliament to debate how to support social care during COVID-19 and beyond so that it automatically has the same access to operational and financial support.",
