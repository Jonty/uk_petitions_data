To offer IGCSE exams, 95% of which are taken in private school, offers a clear advantage to the life chances of these pupils and is grossly unfair to state-educated pupils at the same level. Children deserve to be offered the chance of the same qualification at the end of 11 years of education, regardless of background or financial means.",
