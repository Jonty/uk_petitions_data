You can find out about this here: https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extreme-pornography.\r\n\r\nYou could have a petition calling for accessing any pornographic online content to be made illegal, if that is something you'd like to see happen.\r\n\r\nIf you do choose to start a new petition, please ensure you use your full name, as we can't accept petitions started using just a first name."
