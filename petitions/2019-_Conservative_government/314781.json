A fitting comparison can be made with the fight against Coronavirus by its award to the NHS and the recognition of all other organisations and individuals efforts through award of the George Medal and a separate personal award.",

Public gratitude to the NHS and other frontline \u2018soldiers\u2019 should be made tangible by awarding the George Cross to the NHS and George Medal to other frontline services. Strike a separate medal for award to all others involved in the fight.",
