        "additional_details": "With violence, crime and bullying on the rise more than ever,  it would be beneficial for schools to introduce a  self defence class as part of the national curriculum.  Too many children are being killed and bullied.  It is a life long quality and would provide confidence and comfort knowing that if needed they are able to protect themselves.  It also teaches them self discipline, self control and is also keeping them fit, focused and alert.",
        "background": "Make martial art part of the  national curriculum within schools as part of the psyhical education programme. This has many benefits including mental health, physical health and a sense of security and ability to protect themselves if ever needed.",
