        "additional_details": "I own a motorbike over 600cc, & the tax cost is \u00a393 pa. I own a 1.5 diesel car that is \u00a330 pa tax. My son has a 1200cc petrol car that is \u00a330pa tax. There does seem to be a mismatch here!!  As motorbikes are not tested for emissions, how were these rates set? Have they ever been reviewed? I would suggest the sulution is to test a range of different cc bikes & see what the actual polution rates are, & then reduce the banded rates accordingly. I would be very interested to see the results.",
        "background": "Motorbikes are not currently tested for emissions, unlike cars, but seem to be taxed at a high rate, & are not big polluters. I am not sure how the current level of tax was established, but it seems very high when compared to cars. I would like to see a reduction based on polution levels.",
