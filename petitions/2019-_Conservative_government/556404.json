        "additional_details": "1. Harms to long term health and wellbeing are outweighing the benefits of lockdown\r\n2. A one-track response to rising cases threatens more lives and livelihoods than Covid-lives saved\r\n3. Covid deaths alone can no longer be used as the unilateral measure of harm. \r\n4. The wider harm to babies, children, young people and adults can no longer be ignored\r\n5. Ensure a middle-ground view is heard, emulating the Swedish model\r\n6. Ensure the economy and forgotten public health threats are not overlooked",
        "background": "1. Include leading economists in talks before unchallenged decisions are made\r\n2. Reverse the current measures, ie: tier systems/lockdown measures, closure of hospitality and all health advisories, and restrict these to the 3% of vulnerable individuals rather than the 97% of the healthy population",
