        "additional_details": "If the government can provide these services to asylum seekers at taxpayers' expense then they can also provide the same levels of support for UK citizens - some of which may have paid into the welfare system, may be HM Service veterans, may have fallen on hard times, may need mental health support. People shouldn't be sleeping on the streets, cold and hungry, whilst we provide alternative services to people seeking asylum in the UK.",
