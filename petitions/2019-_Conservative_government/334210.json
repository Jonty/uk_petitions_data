        "additional_details": "The wedding industry is worth \u00a310bn/yr and yet is disproportionately penalised in current regulations. One example is the use of masks - currently families can celebrate in a restaurant without masks, but if sat in a church, masks must be worn. The govt has said that 2m is safe,1m requires extra precautions: therefore guests who sit 2m apart shouldn\u2019t need masks. \r\nThousands have already rescheduled their day; this restriction means many are delaying further, preventing the industry recovering.",
