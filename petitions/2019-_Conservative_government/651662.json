To act in government any longer without calling a general election is to make an utter mockery of democracy. The Government's 'Rwanda migrant resettlement plan' was ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court and the PM's response is unacceptable. To defy the courts is disgraceful and the Government needs to be held accountable immediately. Give the people a choice. Give the people a general election. Now.",
