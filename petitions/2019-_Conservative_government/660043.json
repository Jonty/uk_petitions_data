        "additional_details": "According to the NHS 2022 youth mental health surveys, in 2022, 18.0% of children aged 7 to 16 years and 22.0% of young people aged 17 to 24 years had a probable mental disorder. The surveys also found that 11 to 16 year olds with a probable mental disorder were less likely to feel safe at school (61.2%) than those unlikely to have a mental disorder (89.2%), and that this group were also less likely to report enjoyment of learning or having a friend they could turn to for support.",
        "background": "I believe CAMHS waiting lists are unacceptable, especially when a child is in crisis. Since COVID, we think CAMHS has been struggling with staffing, resources and funding. I think the Government should take youth mental health more seriously and provide more funding.",
