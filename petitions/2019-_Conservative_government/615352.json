        "additional_details": "The use of agricultural land for small, certificated camp sites can be a financial boost for local tourism, which is important to many communities. However, the current provisions for Camping Associations have allowed one site to expand from 5 to 85 units throughout the year with no planning control despite local authorities' objections and concern from MPs. At present these concerns appear to be ignored & this review should consider whether existing exemptions & requirements are fit for purpose.",
        "background": "The Government should review planning law, particularly the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960, to ensure that local authorities have the powers and resourcing they need to refuse consent for temporary holiday sites that place an unsustainable burden on local infrastructure.",
