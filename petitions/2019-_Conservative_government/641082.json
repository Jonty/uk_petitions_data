        "action": "Create a statutory press regulator to tackle sensationalist and damaging stories",
        "additional_details": "Recent sensationalist, damaging claims and relentless, intensive coverage about celebrities from tabloid newspapers should invite Government action which recognises the impact these stories have, and holds newspapers to account in cases of falsehoods and lies.\r\n \r\nStatutory regulation could rebalance the duty of care owed to individuals on both sides of the story and properly hold newspapers to account for damaging and untrue stories which cause harm, by imposing financial penalties. A regulator could also review editorial decisions to publish potentially damaging stories.\r\n",
        "background": "To protect the physical and mental health of celebrities and others in the public eye from sensationalist reporting by newspapers, we want the Government to introduce a statutory press regulator which can hold editors and media outlets accountable, and impose fines for irresponsible reporting.",
