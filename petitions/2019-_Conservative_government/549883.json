Yet certain communities are still susceptible to a weaker, mutated form of the virus due to pockets of under immunisation. My son didn't receive his flu vaccine at school last autumn as I missed the deadline for opting in due to a lost letter. Parents who are anti-vaccine are more likely to take deliberate action than parents who are pro vaccine.",

Legislation should be passed to make school-based vaccines opt-out; so parents who do NOT want their child vaccinated must take deliberate action.",
