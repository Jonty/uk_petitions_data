Yet certain communities are still susceptible to a weaker, mutated form of the virus due to pockets of under immunisation. My son didn't receive his flu vaccine at school last autumn as I missed the deadline for opting in due to a lost letter. Parents who are anti-vaccine are more likely to take deliberate action than parents who are pro vaccine.",
        "background": "Currently parents of children under 16 must opt in to school based vaccinations. This requires the majority of parents to perform a deliberate action. Legislation should be passed to make school-based vaccines opt-out; so parents who do NOT want their child vaccinated must take deliberate action.",
