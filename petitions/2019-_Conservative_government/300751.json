        "additional_details": "This needs to be a law , not an optional register and therefore the government need to pass this as soon as possible to prevent the horrific pain and suffering suffered by animals in a daily basis.\r\nAs it stands there are court fines and minimal jail sentences. However, life time bans on keeping pets for such offenders can only be enforced if there is an Animal Abuser Register. \r\n\r\nWill you please show your compassion and support by signing this petition so vulnerable innocent animals have the protection they deserve.",
        "background": "An animal abuse register needs to be introduced in the UK so people who have abused a pet (or animal) are registered accordingly.\r\nIt should be on a data base which is transparent to relevant animal authorities including the police, veterinary practices, breeders and registered animal charities.",
