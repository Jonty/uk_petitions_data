If they were chosen by someone deemed unfit for office, they cannot be deemed fit themselves.\r\n\r\nThis is the most brazen example of cronyism, and we, the people, deserve better from those we elect to govern.",
        "background": "The resignation honours system exists for the outgoing prime minister to honour those they deem worthy, usually for their support in office.\r\n\r\nIf the PM leaves dishonoured, they should not be allowed to ask HRH the King to confer such honours.\r\n\r\nDoing so is an insult to King and country alike.",
