        "additional_details": "Evidence shows that adding calorie labelling on menus risks exacerbating all eating disorders. However, there is limited evidence supporting the idea that calorie counts on menus will lead to a reduction in calories purchased by the general population. \r\n\r\nIt takes those suffering with Eating disorders years to overcome their fears of 'restaurant food.' By introducing calorie labelling it will make it much harder to eat at any chain restaurant without experiencing intrusive thoughts and anxiety.",
        "background": "I want the Government to consider the grave impact of introducing mandatory calorie labelling on people suffering with Eating disorders. They must stop the proposals to mandate the adding of calorie information to Restaurant Menus.",
