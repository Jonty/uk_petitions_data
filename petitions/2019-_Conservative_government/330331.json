        "additional_details": "Covid-19 is has prevented learner drivers from booking and taking tests. Almost \u00a31 million has been lost by expired theory certificates caused by Covid. Why are you not extending theory test certificates when you have extended MOTs by 6 months? The DVSA told me it is written in legislation and can\u2019t be changed yet the Coronavirus pandemic was unforeseen for this law. If I can\u2019t take a test, how is it fair that I miss out on my 2 year time period down to something out of my control?",
        "background": "All theory tests should be extended by the duration of lockdown. Covid-19 has meant that learner drivers who have paid for and achieved their Theory Certificates are not getting their full 2 years through no fault of their own. Mine and many others\u2018 theory Certificates are due to expire soon.",
