        "action": "Introduce Proportional Representation for UK Parliament Elections",
        "additional_details": "Parliament must pass this to increase the proportionality of Parliament, to show the full range of diverse political opinion in our country, instead of the limited range we have on offer currently. For example, at the 2019 General Election, the Green Party recieved 2.7% of the vote; but only 0.2% of total seats. No matter what political stripes you come from, I think we can all agree that this is unacceptable. A Committee on PR should be introduced to evaluate the different options on offer.",
        "background": "We would like Parliament to vote for a system of Proportional Representation (PR) to be used at the next General Election, as well as permitting it for local elections in England. This is to combat the anti-democratic nature of our antiquated electoral system, & to increase diverse representation.",
