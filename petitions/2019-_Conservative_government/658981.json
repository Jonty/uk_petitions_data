        "additional_details": "Currently the families of murder victims have no recourse against an unduly lenient sentence if they do not apply within 28 days. I am campaigning for this change because 28 days is not long enough when a family is grieving. My sister was murdered in 2013, we believe her killer meets the criteria for a whole life order but he was only given a minimum sentence of 35 years. We believe this is too low, and that we should have the right to apply to have this sentence reviewed.",
