It is an incredibly hard decision to move a relative into residential care & these individuals are mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, grandmothers & fathers, sisters and brothers. They are not forgotten - as relatives we care and love them as much, if not more just as if they were living with us. \r\nThe nursing staff & carers are putting themselves at risk by going to work & require testing to ensure they are safe.",
        "background": "Our nursing and care homes are home for our relatives but they have to have people entering and leaving the building in order to provide them with the love & care they all need. They too are self isolating as requested by the Government so they need protection to support their wellbeing.",
