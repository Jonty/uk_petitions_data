Changing it to be the descendants of HM The Queen rather than George V (who died early 1936) is just natural. Instead of Princess Alexandra, The Dukes & Duchesses of Gloucester and Kent, we can have Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie as well as the children of The Earl and Countess of Wessex; Louise and James. The Wessex children in particular have shown to be very close to the Queen.",

They've served their country and had their time, but get the York Princesses to represent us since they're in their 30s.",
