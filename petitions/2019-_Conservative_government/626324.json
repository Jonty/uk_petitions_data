        "additional_details": "No other employee is paid a vast sum of money when they leave a job - by choice or force.  MPs bring in cuts to all areas, we have had austerity which affected those who could I\u2019ll afford to have less money, yet they are overly generous with themselves and the Prime Minister.  Considering it is the MPs and Prime Ministers who have driven the country to the appalling state it is in, they should not be paid any sort of allowance.  We are rewarding failure, especially in recent times.  It must stop",
        "background": "Stop paying every ex PM an annual allowance, the sum of \u00a3115,000 is unnecessary as they are no longer in position.",
