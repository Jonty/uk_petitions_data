        "additional_details": "The average person over 40 who can afford to save for retirement are already scrimping and saving all they can.\r\n\r\nThe UK has the worst state pension in the developed world- in 2016 it was only worth 29% of average income. The EU average is 70.5% meaning that UK pensions receive more than two times less than comparable countries.\r\n\r\nAny further taxation on over 40s to fund a Social Care Crisis, that progressive governments have neglected is unjust and could increase poverty levels.",
        "background": "Instead of taxing the over 40's to pay more to fix the social care crisis, start by going after large tax avoiding individuals and large corporations.\r\n\r\nIncrease Corporation Tax for larger companies with over 100 employees, stop banking bonuses and bail outs for wealthy entrepreneurs.",
