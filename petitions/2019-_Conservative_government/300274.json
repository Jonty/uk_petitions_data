        "additional_details": "The government has a large majority in Parliament on a minority of the vote (56% of seats on 43% of votes cast). This is not a mandate for any ruling party, because only voters in marginal seats can influence results. Safe seats usually do not change party, discouraging voter turnout. The government\u2019s forthcoming constitutional commission must review the current voting system in a non-partisan manner. Opinion polls consistently show public support for a system in which seats match votes.",
        "background": "First Past The Past is the electoral system currently used for elections to the Westminster, local councils in England and Wales, and constituency seats in devolved administrations. This system does not accurately reflect votes cast and needs replacing with a proportional representation system.",
