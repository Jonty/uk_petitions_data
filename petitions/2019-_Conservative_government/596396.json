        "additional_details": "There has been huge inconsistency in the interpretation and application of the complex breeding regulations and guidelines of The Animal Welfare Regulations 2018 by local authorities, in particular using the \u2018Business Test\u2019 to require small home dog breeders selling or advertising even one puppy or litter to obtain licensing. Many good small home dog breeders are being required to apply for dog breeding licences or face prosecution if they fail to do so as a direct result.  Many small home dog breeders are also now being required to give up retired dogs to meet licensing or planning requirements. This is discouraging small home dog breeders from breeding and encouraging large scale breeders instead. #Save Sue. https://www.spaldingtoday.co.uk/news/im-a-prisoner-in-my-own-home-9214442/",
        "background": "Many small home dog breeders are suffering as a result of licensing requirements under Animal Welfare Regulations 2018. The Government should remove the complex \"Business Test\" to allow small breeders to breed, advertise, and sell up to 2 litters a year without being required to apply for a licence.",
