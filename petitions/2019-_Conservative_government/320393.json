        "additional_details": "Why are the Catholics still being denied the use of their churches?  Parliament is sitting, supermarkets  are open, and Garden Centres to follow suit.  Surely, if common sense and the principles of social distancing can be applied in these places, why not churches? \r\nIn Italy, churches have remained open, for private prayer, throughout the lockdown.  I don't understand, why, in Britain, this cannot be the case too?   I can only speak for Catholics, but I'm sure, the same applies to others too.",
        "background": "The immediate opening of our churches for private prayer in these harrowing times.   It would provide a sense of normality for the Catholic faithful to be able to make a visit to the Blessed Sacrament and foster a sense of well-being.",
