I am also a self-employed, so I was not getting paid for 3 months. Even though I had some bad symptoms, I was refused an early ultrasound from NHS, and going private is not always an easy option for everyone. By providing earlier screenings, you could prevent help detect and prevent ectopic pregnancies, and the cost this creates for the NHS. An ectopic pregnancy  can be fatal and more action is needed. An ectopic pregnancy can also affect mother's mental health.",
