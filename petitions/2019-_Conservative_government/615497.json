        "additional_details": "The government should be supporting citizens returning home from Shanghai, as other nations are. They should understand that pets are being left behind and people are stranded in Shanghai without means of relocating their pets. This is due to oppressive lockdown measures which have stopped the processing of documents for international travel (test results and corresponding travel paperwork). The situation in SH is unsafe and worsening, support UK nationals in their return home with their pets.",
        "background": "Due to the recent Covid epidemic in Shanghai, many UK citizens are being forced to abandon their pets as they cannot retrieve the necessary documentation from Chinese authorities. This petition seeks to provide support for UK citizens who wish to return but are unable to receive all documentation.",
