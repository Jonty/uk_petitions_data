        "additional_details": "In order to gain a test appointment people often have to wait for months (sometimes a year). In some instances, the appointments are rescheduled by DVSA at less than one week's notice. Some people are unable to get to the university or work due to the lack of a driving license and the inability to get one, which I believe is due to the inefficiencies of DVSA.",
        "background": "The government should ensure that the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) is funded and run efficiently in order to clear backlogs, ensure that driving test examiners are conducting a minimum of 6 tests per day and that there are enough examiners, and ban the resale of the practical tests.",
