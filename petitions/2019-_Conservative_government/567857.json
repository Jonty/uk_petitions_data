        "additional_details": "Provisionally registered pharmacists have been working throughout the pandemic have been acting as responsible pharmacists for 5 months now and this is more than enough to demonstrate competency. We would like the Government/GPHC to take action to this similar to doctors/nurses who had exams scrapped. The exam is set to take place in March after months of delay which poses a health risk. With provisional pharmacists under long hours of work for at least 5 months they have already proved their capability.",
        "background": "Provisional pharmacists have faced months of unprecedented uncertainty and pressure to perform as pharmacists as well as the stress to sit their final exam with the General Pharmaceutical Council. The exam is irrelevant as they have demonstrated the skills of competent pharmacists.",
