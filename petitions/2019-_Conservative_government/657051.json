        "additional_details": "I believe that now more than ever children need to have a basic understanding of how to help someone who has become injured or ill. With the increase in violence between teenagers and the carrying and use of weapons there is no greater risk that these life saving skills could one day be needed. In turn it will also be an additional accreditation for them when leaving school for their CV\u2019s. We should be preparing our children for real life after school and not waiting until it\u2019s too late to help them.",
        "background": "I want the government to make it that First Aid training is mandatory on the curriculum for all school age children from the age of 14.",
