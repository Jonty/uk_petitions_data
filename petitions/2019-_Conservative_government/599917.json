        "additional_details": "Bird keepers in NI and the RoI make a huge contribution to the bird  fancy in the UK. The above changes mean that the vast majority of those fanciers cannot not attend events in England, Scotland and Wales.\r\nWe fear that an already dwindling hobby could lead to many fanciers giving up keeping rare varieties, pure and traditional breeds of poultry and caged birds, which could put many breeds at risk, and be to the detriment of bird keeping across the UK and Ireland, as well as businesses such as livestock auctioneers",
        "background": "The introduction of the border down the Irish Sea has meant that caged bird and poultry keepers in the NI and ROI wishing to move birds to Exhibitions and Auctions to and from GB need to meet strict rules, EU Health Checks and or quarantine. We ask for these changes to be reviewed.",
