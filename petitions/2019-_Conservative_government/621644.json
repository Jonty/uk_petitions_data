PAYG meters can be cut off and whilst the energy companies are making record profit and raising the average bill to over 4k, they will have to ensure safety of there vulnerable. Write into law that they will not be self disconnected. This could be done by the companies applying a credit to the bills using data they have on average usage, or allowing the meters to run although there are debt owed. we need to do more",

This could be done via a weekly amount put on to the meters or allowing meter to apply debt.\r\n\r\n",
