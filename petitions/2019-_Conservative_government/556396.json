The paper says it is to help with housing shortages. We believe this is not true and that proposals are to help developers, as housing shortages are not to do with planning laws and there are a million unbuilt houses with permissions.\r\n \r\n3. We believe these reforms will result in destruction of our countryside and urban green spaces, harm biodiversity.",
