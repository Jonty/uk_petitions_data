LGBT teenagers are 5 times more likely to attempt suicide than their heterosexual peers and are more than 8 times more likely if they come from a family that rejects their lifestyle. It did not happen by chance that my life as a gay man approaching his 40s is drastically better than of previous generations, therefore I want to do my small part in continuing this amazing progress. \"Be the change you want to see in the world\".
