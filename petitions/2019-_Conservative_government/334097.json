        "additional_details": "Without therapy, victims go unheard and this can have long term impacts on their health. The NHS states that 1 in 3 people who experience a traumatic event will develop PTSD. How can we let victims go so long without the support that they deserve? After going through such events, they require a higher level of care and support than what is currently offered. Many cannot afford specialised trauma therapy, lets make it a requirement to offer it to all who need it and allow victims to be heard.",
        "background": "Currently, victims of abuse aren't receiving enough support before/after court proceedings. They are advised against going to therapy in order to prevent contamination of evidence. Often, abuse cases are complex and can take months, or even years to reach the stage where victims are able to get help",
