        "additional_details": "Currently if you buy a car on the 20th of the month for example you will need to tax it on that day to drive it . You are then charged from the 1st of that month . This is unfair . If a business were to do that eg electricity company there would be an independent review and millions of pounds in compensation awarded why should the government be any different . Surely the system can divide yearly road tax by 365 days just as easily as 12 months ? This is blatantly wrong and needs to change",
        "background": "When purchasing road fund license on a vehicle the owner must pay for tax from the beginning of the month . Why can\u2019t the government consider calculating the road tax on a daily basis and refunding previous owners on a daily basis. The system could easily be adjusted to make it fair to motorists .",
