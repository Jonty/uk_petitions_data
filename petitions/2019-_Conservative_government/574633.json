A health minister should be someone who has an expertise dealing with health. Matt Hancock has an economics degree. We want a health minister who cares about mental health and has the best interests of the people. Matt Hancock\u2019s best interest is to stay in power! Remove him!",
        "background": "Please remove Matt Hancock from parliament. He is acting in a facist way, making the UK a dictatorship. We understand that many countries are using rules to stop the spread, however we believe Hancock is incompetent. He is un-empathetic to those struggling with mental health.",
