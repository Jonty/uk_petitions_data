        "additional_details": "Many home educated children found themselves without exam qualifications in June 2020 when exams were cancelled. Many had self studied without tutors and had no way of having their grades predicted. Now they face the same issue in 2021. Some students are facing having their exams cancelled for a second time. The Government needs to either allow International examinations to continue or find a method to support home educated children to achieve their exam results.",
        "background": "The government needs to put in place a way of allowing home educated students to gain grades either through allowing exam centres to host International examinations (i.e IGCSE, IAL) or provide an alternative method for these students to gain the grades they deserve.",
