        "additional_details": "The pandemic and cuts to stop smoking services has led to an increase in smoking rates for some groups. The UK has lost momentum in this public health opportunity and we could miss the nation\u2019s 2030 smoking free target.\r\n \r\nVaping has helped many people to quit smoking, with the NHS saying nearly 3 million smokers have used e-cigarettes, and over half are now smokefree, contributing to at least 22,000 additional quitters a year.\r\n \r\nA ban on smoking and vaping strategy is the clear action that could help us achieve our smoke free ambitions.",

Vaping has helped many people to quit smoking and the Government needs to seize this opportunity to transform the nation's health.",
