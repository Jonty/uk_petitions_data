        "additional_details": "Palm oil is a huge contributor to deforestation in tropical climates, areas booming with wildlife, areas which many animals have called home for thousands of years. The deforestation caused by palm oil plantations have had a substantial negative impact on these areas, causing mass death and extinction of the animals living there. in Borneo, dozens orangutans are killed every week due to the production of palm oil.\r\nThis needs to end, and this is a start.",
        "background": "The Government should require products containing palm oil, where it has not been certified that this has been produced sustainably, to include labels showing the harm palm oil production causes, so consumers are made aware of this.",
