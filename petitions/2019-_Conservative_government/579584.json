        "action": "Protect our right to protest peacefully within the uk",
        "additional_details": "We want the government to protect our right to protest peacefully by revising the wording of this bill- which has changed the term \"domestic terrorist\" to \"aggravated activist\" (i.e anyone who risks arrest by taking part in a protest). We also want the government to remove the ability to make \"serious annoyance\" or \"inconvenience\" a criminal offence, since these terms can be used by police to arrest and prosecute peaceful protestors (which is in direct violation of HRA Articles 10 and 11).",
        "background": "At the moment, Priti Patel is rushing a new Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill that will make protesting punishable by jail time. This will give Patel powers to define \u201cserious disruption\u201d to communities and organisations, which police can then rely on to impose conditions on protests.",
