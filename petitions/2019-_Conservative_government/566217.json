        "additional_details": "In addition, there will be some difficulties in administration of testing amongst many SEN children for a variety of reasons. Special schools will be unable to rely on testing as a way of ensuring school is covid free, as well as being unable to always understand when a child is unwell due to communication difficulties. Government currently expects SEN schools to remain open but should understand that the staff working in these environments are at considerable risk and should be prioritised.",
        "background": "The unique requirements of working with children with additional needs means that social distancing and effective use of PPE is virtually impossible. Vaccinating special school staff will also offer protection to the children and their families.",
