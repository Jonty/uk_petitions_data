The current NHS statistics for looked after children\u2019s mental health are grossly outdated, from 2002. Those not in care under 18 had their last mental health stats developed in 2017. How do we know if we are doing this group of people right if we have no way to measure our successes as a nation? During the pandemic, it is essential and common duty to look over those care experienced.",
