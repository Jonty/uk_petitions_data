It is impossible for many to obtain an NI number however whilst this office is providing such limited service. This affects all applicants from other countries, and can bar them from working and paying the right amount of tax and will result in a backlog of rebates in the future.",

As a result, very few applications for NI numbers can be made and those made prior to the office's closure are stuck in limbo.
