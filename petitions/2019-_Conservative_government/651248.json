        "additional_details": "According to the 2021 Census , the Chinese ethnic group in England and Wales numbered 445,646 people or 0.7% of the population . These numbers show how much of an impact the change we are proposing would have on so much people as it's not a small group of people that this change would positively impact we hope that Parliament would consider giving the day off.",
        "background": "I want the parliament to understand that Chinese New Year is comparable to Christmas for many minorities. It should be at the minimum a one day off for many people without affecting their pay or attendance as it connects people more with their culture and allows others to learn more about the day.",
