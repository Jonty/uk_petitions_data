Dogs may be (and have been) from puppy farms or stolen,  and without prohibitions and restrictions, they are being bought to be used as bait and for other horrible purposes.\r\n\r\nLegally prohibiting & restricting animals being sold online reduces the abuse of these sites to sell ill or stolen animals, or to gain easy access to animals to use as bait or for sport. Without these changes to law, this abuse will continue.",

Tight requirements on sites that sell animals-further protection will ensure they are not stolen, or from puppy farms & have had health checks. Achieve this via collaboration with vets & animal charities. A simple paywall (minimal fees) is not enough.",
