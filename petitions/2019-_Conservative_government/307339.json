        "additional_details": "It is very important to the people of the UK that the NHS is a public institution without private business interests. The pressure from the public led Johnson to promise the NHS would be protected from trade deals; putting a deal through quietly during the Coronavirus crisis would be unethical and lack transparency.\r\nGiven that Trump recently made a bid to make a German Coronavirus vaccine US-only, (which could prolong the crisis) involving the US financially in our medical system could be a direct health risk to us.",
        "background": "As the Coronavirus escalates, there are concerns that a trade deal between the UK Government and the US deal might not exempt our NHS, leaving it vulnerable to privatisation and in direct contradiction to promises this would not happen.",
