        "additional_details": "I would like to ask the government to support us during these difficult times a little bit more And at least give us 80% of the monthly wages. We all have lots of monthly commitments and 67% is nothing to survive on. Specially in hospitality sectors, we are already loosing all our gratuity which is a key to our wages. Please review the scheme and bring back the 80% if you like us to survive financially without loosing our homes and everything we tried really hard to gain. Thank you.",
        "background": "During this pandemic we should be united and help each other out in anyway possible. Lots of people lost their jobs and many more to loose their jobs because of Covid-19. One of the most important element of surviving is the help from the government. 67% of the wages is nothing to survive on!",
