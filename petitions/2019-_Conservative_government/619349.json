        "additional_details": "While many cancer patients are denied insurance due to their current or previous illness, others are quoted exorbitant fees for short breaks - including one patient recently quoted \u00a37,000 for a two-week trip to Canada and another \u00a31,000 for a week in Spain. \r\n\r\nSome patients live with stable disease while many other patients who have recovered from treatment for aggressive types of cancer and are in remission are categorised alongside patients with active cancer and ongoing treatment.",
        "background": "Cancer patients are currently being denied valuable respite as they are unable to secure affordable travel insurance (or even any at all). The travel insurance industry must review its procedures around access to affordable insurance and establish a new model.",
