        "additional_details": "The celebration of politician ownership and systemic racism should have no place in this country - even if these people where rich and powerful in other significant ways. The celebration of politician ownership and systemic racism also should have no place in this country if the prime minister and his cabinet claims to support the Black Lives Matter movement. The erection of solar panels in their place would assist battling the climate emergency (an issue that the UK has done very little against).",
        "background": "Statues of politician owners should be torn down and replaced with solar panels or other forms of sustainable energy production. Perhaps plaques could be erected also explaining why these statues where torn down.",
