        "additional_details": "The UK is lagging behind many EU countries, with a donation rate under half that of Spain. 1000s of children and adults in the UK die due to lack of donor organs. Many, many families stop donation going ahead if they don't know their loved one\u2019s decision. Even people on the Organ Donor Register can, and do have their decision overturned.\r\nDespite the Opt Out system, it\u2019s vital to join the NHS Organ Donor Register & TALK TO YOUR FAMILY. Anyone can need a transplant. It could be you, or a loved one.\r\n",
        "background": "The Opt Out system (2020) still allows grieving families to overturn their loved one\u2019s decision to donate their organs. It is proposed that members of the public are asked on Government forms: a) their organ donation decision b) if their families are allowed to overrule that decision after death.",
