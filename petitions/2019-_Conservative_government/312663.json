        "additional_details": "The economy has halted due to the coronavirus crisis. This has meant businesses already struggling due to brexit are facing the toughest time ever. This has also meant negotiations are unable to take place between the UK and Brussels. By extending the transition period, we are able to ensure the British economy has a chance to recover and secure the best deal possible to guarantee that the British economy can thrive once we get over this.",
        "background": "Coronavirus has meant that negotiations cannot take place between Brussels and the UK. The current economic crisis will only deepen if we cannot get a suitable deal to ensure the British economy is able to cope once the transition period is over in December.",
