        "additional_details": "Since 2010 rough sleeping has more than doubled. Overall, an estimated 320,000 people are homeless in the UK, with approximately 4,000 to 5,000 people bedding down each night. In 2018 alone, 726 people died while homeless. Yet councils respond to this by erecting anti-homeless architecture around the country. This is unethical. The government is only making it harder for already-vulnerable people to find a safe space to spend the night. Ban anti-homeless architecture.",
        "background": "Anti-homeless architecture includes street spikes, slanted/curved benches, armrests on benches, barred corners, rocky pavements etc. These make life harder and more dangerous for the homeless and rough sleepers. Parliament must ban anti-homeless architecture to protect the safety of rough sleepers.",
