        "additional_details": "A system of voting as reclusive as the Conservative Party Leadership, where it was totally unknown how many members there were and attempts to establish this figure were batted aside, is a disgrace for any nation that claims to be democratic. If a Prime Minister resigns, it should be down to ALL of the British people who replaces them.",
        "background": "The election of Elizabeth Truss was dictated by approximately 0.0011% of the UK population. For a country to brand itself as democratic, this is completely contradictory and needs to change. When a Prime Minister resigns as PM and Party Leader, this should automatically trigger a general election.",
