        "additional_details": "The current process of buying and selling property in England and Wales is essentially flawed and means increased time and money is spent on a poorly performing process that ultimately benefits neither the buyer, the seller, any agents or solicitors (as many are fixed fee now). The Scottish system offers to buy and sell are legally binding at the point the offer is made and accepted. This ensures trust in the process and speeds up the process of housing transactions, once offers are agreed.",
