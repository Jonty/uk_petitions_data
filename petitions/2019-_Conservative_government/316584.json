        "additional_details": "I have been an emergency NHS worker for the past 10 years and been subjected to many acts of violence and assaults.\r\n\r\nRecently I was assaulted and spat at whilst at work. The individual was arrested and charged however the decision was made to issue a caution as it was his first offence.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately assaults on NHS occur daily and many are dealt with through informal or low-level resolutions.\r\n\r\nThis does not send a clear message that violence against NHS staff is unacceptable.",
        "background": "Change the law to remove the option for those charged with offences of violence against NHS employees to be dealt with by way of a police caution or community resolution. If there is enough evidence to charge an individual for the offence, they should be prosecuted even for first time offences.",
