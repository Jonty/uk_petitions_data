        "additional_details": "As we are now entering the 2nd lockdown, the courses are becoming even harder. We are doing a 2 year course in less than a year of working, Students are teaching themselves due to online work. This is not fair! Other years have had 2 years of teacher taught in person time, we have less than a year of teacher taught work and yet the course has changed minimally, its simple, you have not done enough. Now is the time for change. Before it is too late",
        "background": "The Government must ensure the exam boards drastically reduce the course content for A-Levels, they have focused so much on GCSEs and A-Levels have had minimal changes. The content for A-Levels must have much more reduction, the content must be reduced not only for coursework but the exam work too.",
