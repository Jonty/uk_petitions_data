        "additional_details": "This country needs structural change to ensure every worker feels supported should they fall ill or be advised to self-isolate, especially in times of emergency. The minimum earnings threshold of \u00a3118 per week leaves an estimated 2 million people who work low income jobs or zero hours contracts with no financial support available to them should they fall ill or be advised to self isolate, disproportionately affecting women, ethnic minorities and migrants. Everybody deserves fairer sick pay.",
        "background": "The \u00a394 per week statutory sick pay (SSP) is only available to those who earn over \u00a3118 pounds a week. We demand the government scraps this minimum earning threshold to provide SSP for all who need it.",
