        "additional_details": "Supermarket staff are on the frontline just as much as Pharmacists, and supermarkets will stay open as they have throughout Europe. The staff here have been given no protection whatsoever, unlike Pharmacists. Anyone who will be at risk and mingling with society should be protected. These staff members will come into contact with those with mild symptoms who decide to go out, and more so those who don't show any symptoms are likely to still go shopping. This will cause the disease to spread.",
        "background": "I want the government to put safety precautions into place for those working on the frontline in supermarkets. All of the staff there will be exposed to the floods of customers that will come day in day out. All of the staff in the supermarkets should be forced to wear protective clothing and masks.",
