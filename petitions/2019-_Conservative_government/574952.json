        "additional_details": "I love my dogs being off lead however safety comes first. If it was made law for dogs to be on the lead in public areas, people could actually go for walks without the fear of dogs running over to them and their dogs. This would dramatically reduce dog bites and make it far easier to train dogs. \r\nWith the dramatic increase in people purchasing dogs, there is no better time.",
        "background": "I am a professional dog trainer. On a daily basis I see dogs/people being attacked by off lead dogs. You cannot walk around a park etc without someone\u2019s dog running over. \r\nFriendly or not, the dog on the lead may not be. Since lockdown this issue has got worse and has become incredibly dangerous.",
