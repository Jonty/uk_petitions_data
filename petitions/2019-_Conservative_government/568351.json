        "additional_details": "Students last year were given the option to sit their A-levels in the summer of 2021 to increase their grades if they didn't feel prepared for the autumn series. With the latest development of summer exams being cancelled and replaced with CAG's, these students are at a disadvantage unless they can have their UCAS predicted grades, which are what their university offers are based on. This would allow them to have a better chance of getting into university this year.",
        "background": "Students resitting their A-level subjects from last year should be allowed to receive their UCAS predicted grades as their final grades this year as CAG's may be inaccurate due to how these students haven't been in a school environment in 10 months or more.",
