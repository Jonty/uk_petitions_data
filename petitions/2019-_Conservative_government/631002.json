        "additional_details": "We believe large companies are exploiting what should be a healthy housing market for their own profit-driven objectives. These companies buy family homes in quiet neighbourhoods and turn them into HMOs with little regard for the neighbourhood. Some areas have seen increases in excess rubbish on the streets and anti-social behaviour, and declines in property value. Tax payers can end up funding rent for HMOs for those being housed by the Government or in receipt of financial support for accommodation. Neighbourhoods are suffering and we want the Government to act.",
        "background": "Introduce stricter regulations regarding HMOs, including requirements for monthly inspections of HMO properties to ensure they are fit to live in, limits on the maximum number of people who can reside in an HMO property, and limits on the number of HMO licences local authorities can grant.",
