        "additional_details": "We in the UK have a long held right to freedom unless duly convicted by our peers. Instead, we have all been held under house arrest with no trial and not even allowed to examine the models that supposedly require the lost of our human rights.\r\n\r\nThe death rate for under 50s appears to be very small or 0.2% of those tested and likely close to 0.01% of the total population which is similar to flu. NHS hospitals whilst busy have the capacity to deal with those under 50 returning to normal life.",
        "background": "End the lockdown for those at low risk which includes most under 50s households or households with young children and single adults. Then as NHS capacity allows, have a staged return for other groups. The elderly and most vulnerable will be protected till the virus naturally dies out.",
