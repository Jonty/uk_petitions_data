        "additional_details": "Many members of our school community believe we face the issue around food produced by our catering team - whether it be the portions do not reflect the price, the portions are not satisfactory for the student etc. We developed our understanding of this by bringing the topic to our catering team, where we learned that these current prices are as low as they can be, due to the insufficient funding given to schools by the government. \r\n\r\nWhile we appreciate the pressure on the government due to the cost of living crisis, we believe that funding for schools is vital - the future of our generation lies in the hands of those in power, and we wish for their support in building a bright, healthy future for all young people.",
        "background": "While we appreciate that the cost of living crisis is taking a toll on our economy, we, members of the future generation, believe that an increase in funding for schools is vital to allow our children a better future, with the correct health, well-being and education - in order for success.",
