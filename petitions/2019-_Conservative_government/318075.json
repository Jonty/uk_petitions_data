        "action": "Ensure that teenagers are still allowed to start medically transitioning",
        "additional_details": "This section appears to prevent teens from even taking puberty blockers, which, in themselves, are not harmful to anyone. Often, this is the only action minors are allowed to take in their medical transition and if they are allowed to move onto further 'irreversible' steps, it is usually because their gender dysphoria is so debilitating that they are unable to function in society or are contemplating suicide. This would damage the mental health of so many teens and is not suitable to enact",
        "background": "There are currently talks of including a section under the new Gender Recognition Act that would prevent teens from medically transitioning and I feel like it is imperative that it is removed.",
