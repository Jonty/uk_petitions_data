        "additional_details": "New forests absorb carbon dioxide, help biodiversity and help the UK to meet its carbon footprint target.\r\n\r\nAt present, a mature tree lost in the course of a development is replaced, if at all, by a sapling on site. The net loss of carbon trapping is detrimental to the local environment and the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThere would be a formula whereby the funding for replacement saplings depends on the size of the tree lost. \r\n\r\nThe national and global benefits of more forestation will accrue wherever it is done.",
        "background": "Tree growth is an effective means of trapping carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. The UK has one of the lowest forested areas in Europe.\r\n\r\nMature trees are lost in housing and infrastructure development.\r\n\r\nWe want Parliament to legislate to ensure these trees are adequately replaced.",
