        "additional_details": "Domestic abuse, whether emotional, physical, psychological, or sexual, is one of the most damaging things that anyone go through. In 2018, 700,000 victims of domestic abuse victims were thought to be male, making up for a third of victims. Despite this, only 0.8% of refuge beds are reserved for them according to the charity ManKind Initiative, with some men being forced to travel 150 miles to get help. By increasing the amount of refuge beds available, we can prevent men from suffering alone.",
        "background": "I'm calling on the Government to fund more help for men trying to escape from domestic abuse situations. This includes funding more refuge beds for men in towns and cities across the UK.",
