        "additional_details": "Many MPs have not lived in their constituencies prior to being nominated by a party. This has created, at least in the minds of many of the electorate, a disconnection between the real needs of a constituency and the \"career politics\" seemingly demonstrated by some MPs.\r\n\r\nThis would help to ensure constituencies are not represented by career politicians more concerned with personal advancement than representing their electorate. It should also stop political parties \"parachuting\" individual candidates into areas purely because that area is seen as a safe seat. Individuals who have lived, and preferably been employed, in a constituency for at least a decade may be able to better connect to the electorate.",
