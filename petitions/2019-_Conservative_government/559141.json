        "additional_details": "Over 2million people have been told to shield across the U.K. However official guidelines state that parents/carers and siblings can still go to work or school - as long as they distance within the household. \r\n\r\nFor many families this is impossible due to the care needs of their loved one - dressing, bathing, feeding etc. Meaning they\u2019re constantly putting their loved one at risk. As well as this, parents can not shield if they\u2019re caring for children who are going to school, as well as their vulnerable child or if they are vulnerable themselves. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately due to government guidelines, many hospitals are unable to support families in their need to shield due to not being able to divert from said guidelines.",
        "background": "We want the government to review their stance on shielding and give support to whole families to shield, as for many, shielding can only be effective if the whole family shields.",
