Go be expected to continue studying for unknown exams, after spending a day completing online lessons is very mentally draining. Pupils are under enough stress trying to submit enough data to teachers to receive good \u201cassessed grades\u201d which is what was originally promised to them. It is very unethical to now try and add in some new made up \u201cmini exams\u201d.",
