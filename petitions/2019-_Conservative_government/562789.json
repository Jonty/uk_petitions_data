        "action": "Stop charging interest on student loans",
        "additional_details": "The coronavirus pandemic has trigged economic turbulence of unprecedent proportions. Many students are struggling to find work. Relatively high interest rates set on young people is an unnecessary and unfair practice that should cease with immediate effect.\r\n\r\nThe economic gain from the interest is negligible. They also have the combined effect of worsening an individual's financial profile and also discouraging students from diversifying their skill sets if it could delay entering the work force.",
        "background": "The Government should freeze interest on university student loans. This extra burden on students is felt more acutely in the recent economic downturn. This does not require a complete abolishment of the fee process but rather an empathetic way to help students in times of national hardship.",
