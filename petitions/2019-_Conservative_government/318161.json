        "additional_details": "We are being made to feel as if we barely have a choice in the matter, as if there is nothing we can do to stop it. This is not true. We can stop this act from being passed, and in doing so save lives. This is an unacceptable attack on Trans people and their right to exist as themselves. The very basic thing that we are asking here is do not pass this act. If you do, it'll be a huge step backwards in the acceptence and progression of our society. Let people be who they are.",
        "background": "This act will prevent Trans under 18s from transitioning. This is unacceptable. The government does not get to decide how we exist or who we are. Being trans is a medical condition, for which the treatment is transition. Would you tell someone not to fix their broken arm? This act cannot be passed.",
