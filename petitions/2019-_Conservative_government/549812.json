        "additional_details": "The Food Information Regulation No. 1169/2011 requires any drink with a caffeine content over 150mg/L to be labelled \"high caffeine content\". Yet the food standards agency recommends daily consumption not to exceed 200mg daily. This makes it difficult to regulate intake as many products with a high content but below this threshold are not required to declare this. This is especially problematic for those who have been advised to limit their caffeine intake for medical reasons.",

Many products which have a high caffeine content are not required to declare this, yet the FSA has advised consumers to limit their caffeine intake.",
