        "additional_details": "The months of enforced closures of pubs and lack of financial support will inevitably lead to numerous business failures with thousands of pubs failing to reopen. Unless action is taken these pubs will be acquired by property developers and demolished or converted, being lost as pubs permanently. The pub sector must be given time to recover to its previous strength and this can be enabled by ensuring the buildings they trade from are not taken away.",
        "background": "Parliament needs to pass a law to prevent pubs that have been forced to close from being redeveloped and lost to the community forever. The law should be time limited (e.g. five years) in order to allow sufficient time for the sector to recover and then market forces can resume.",
