        "additional_details": "From October 2020, the NHS surcharge for two and half years visas would cost a family of four over \u00a310,000.  A family of four would have to pay over \u00a340K over a decade before being eligible for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILTR). Unison and others have called for the NHS surcharge waiver for NHS and care workers to be extended to all migrant workers. We are calling on the Government to remove the NHS surcharge permanently for all Migrants workers and their Dependents.",
        "background": "Non-EU migrants\u2019 workers are working and paying taxes and National Insurance which contribute towards the NHS. The NHS Surcharge means these workers pay twice, adding unfair costs on low-paid worker. BME Suffolk Support Group want this surcharge to be scrapped for migrant workers.",
