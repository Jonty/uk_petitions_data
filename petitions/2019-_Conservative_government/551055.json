The dog is a wreck and I don\u2019t know how long it will take to bring this dog a semblance of peace and happiness. She must have been kept in a cage and was totally neglected. She is petrified of humans. If the prices of dogs was regulated, these vile and cruel extortionists would not find it so attractive to engage in this practise.",
