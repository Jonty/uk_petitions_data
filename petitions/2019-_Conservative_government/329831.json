We pay for these trees so why can we not use them to pay tribute to our loved ones. It\u2019s disgusting how everyone\u2019s personal possessions have been treated and totally disrespected the deceased and their families.",

All just thrown in without any compassion or respect!! We would like this decision to be overturned to allow personal memorials on our trees that we pay for.",
