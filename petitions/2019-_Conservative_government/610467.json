        "additional_details": "It has been 7 days since Russia has started an unprovoked war on Ukraine. As NATO is unable to support Ukraine with military action, the UK has to put as strict diplomatic and trade restrictions as possible. As the restrictions that are already in place did not stop Putin from taking the lives of thousands of innocent civilian Ukrainians, it is absolutely necessary to take extra actions, namely, embargo Russian oil and gas as soon as possible.",
