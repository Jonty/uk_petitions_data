        "additional_details": "We are in an age where we prompt men to come forward and speak openly, yet in written Law it plays out that women cannot be sentenced on rape charges and highlights using the 'he' pronoun that men can and, in doing so, creates the atmosphere that men cannot come forward as they do not have the integral support required by the legal system to make them feel supported and safe. This review would be the first step in providing baseline support to male rape and sexual assault victims.",
        "background": "It has been 18 years since the Act was published, and in the 2003 version it utilities the pronoun 'he' when referring to rape and sexual assault, as well as other sections, creating the statement that men cannot be raped or sexually assault.",
