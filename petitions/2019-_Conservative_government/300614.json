By shortening the school days, students wouldn't be as stressed about going to school and their grades could be higher. Fewer school hours per day would permit students to have enough time to study, complete school assignments, participate in after-school activities and be able to get to bed by a decent hour.Teachers can provide more 1-on-1 time with each student in their classroom, allowing for specific weaknesses to be personally addressed and also complete and mark students work which would release pressure of them which is known to help performance.",
