        "additional_details": "People on UK Ancestry visas have paid for their visa, and must come to the UK planning to work, and pay the healthcare surcharge. It is unfair that they have to pay international fees at university. Many students see the UK as their home and do not intend to return to their home countries. Please help us attend university and better contribute in the UK.",
        "background": "The Government should make it so students on UK Ancestry visas are eligible to pay home fees at UK universities and not international fees, which are much higher. This is a particular issue as they cannot access student grants or loans.",
