        "additional_details": "Culture Secy Dowden is wrong to claim Channel 4 needs to or should attempt to compete with Netflix or Amazon, that its growth must increase and only privatisation can accomplish this.\r\nIt will not benefit from privatisation; it is hard to imagine a private broadcaster commissioning such a large, diverse no. of programmes from independents aross the regions or nurturing diverse talent as actively at grassroots levels. 4's Paralympics, Covid-19 coverage, eg are why we need C4 to remain public.",
        "background": "Halt all plans to privatise, part-privatise or sell off Channel 4 for a minimum of five years.  Channel 4 is doing well financially.  Its newly-increased presence, spending and employment in the regions is creating important employment and stimulating the economy which needs time to grow.",
