        "additional_details": "Hundreds of people have died trying to cross the Channel to seek asylum in the UK. No more asylum seekers should have to lose their lives to access safety, and their human right to asylum. The UK Government needs to establish safe routes to those currently taking the perilous journey into the UK. Implementing deterrents does not stop asylum seekers trying to enter the UK, but instead merely increases the chances of death.",
        "background": "The Home Office wants to make crossing the English Channel 'unviable' for people seeking asylum in the UK. Seeking asylum is a fundamental human right. The Government needs to acknowledge this, and offer humanity and help to those risking their lives for this right, through safe access to the UK.",
