They are putting their lives at risk every day to save the lives of others. They are seeing death on a scale they thought they would probably never see, and this is where I think funding should come in to support them with their mental health or other concerns or issues they may have, during and after these difficult times.",
        "background": "I think the funding should go towards counselling for problems such as bereavement, PTSD and family counselling for all NHS staff. Also making sure if any financial issues arise due to long term sickness from work, the government will support staff and acknowledge the work they have done.",
