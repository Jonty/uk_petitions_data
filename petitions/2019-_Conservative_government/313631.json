It is surely hard for ministers to expect other sectors to take a hit, when they are not doing the same... it might also restore some kind of public trust in MPs, which in my opinion, was severely damaged in the last term.",
        "background": "I believe as most workers and sectors will be drastically affected by the pandemic, it is paramount that MPs are seen to be doing the same as other members of the public. Therefore a 20% cut in the annual basic salary would be a good start for the length of this parliament.",
