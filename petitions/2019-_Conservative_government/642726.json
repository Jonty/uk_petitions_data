        "additional_details": "Most Healthcare Managers are dedicated professionals. However, they are responsible for significant decisions which affect patient care, yet they may not be held accountable for their impact. We believe that more babies' lives might have been saved if Healthcare Managers had acted sooner on the concerns of consultants. Patients & families could also refer if they had concerns. This should improve patient safety in the wider NHS.",
        "background": "To introduce regulation of Healthcare Managers to ensure that they are accountable for their decision making and its impact on patient safety.  We are petitioning for a change in the law so they can be held to the same standards as other healthcare professionals via a proper, independent regulator.",
