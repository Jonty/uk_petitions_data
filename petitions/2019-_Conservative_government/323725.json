        "additional_details": "Coronavirus & some social distancing is likely to stay for the foreseeable future. There are people whose lives and livelihoods won't return to normal even as lockdown is slowly lifted. They will be the first to be affected if further waves come (tourism, leisure, spa, gyms). Some people won't survive further lockdowns without re-skilling to give them an alternative source of income. This could reinstate their own financial security so they could avoid needing government handouts in future.",
        "background": "Thousands of people in sectors worst affected by coronavirus (leisure, arts, well-being, spa workers) may need to re-skill in order to move to a new job after losing a business or job due to the coronavirus lockdown. Prioritise these grants for the 3 million self employed who received no other help.",
