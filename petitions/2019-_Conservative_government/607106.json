        "action": "General election to be held within 3 months of change of Prime Minister.",
        "additional_details": "The leadership of the UK should not be at the discretion of party members. Voters make decision based on: leadership of a party, its manifesto and a constituency candidate. Given the media coverage of elections in the postwar era, the leadership of a party is critical to how this decision is reached. It is undemocratic to force a leader on the electorate who hasn\u2019t won a general election. The power invested in the position of PM must only be held by those who are elected to it by the people.",
        "background": "If the leader of the ruling party in the UK (the PM) has to leave office due to ill health, death, rejection by own party or because arrested then a general election should automatically take place 3 months after the departure of the PM. This allows time for party to appoint a replacement to stand.",
