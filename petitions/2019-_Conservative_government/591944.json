        "additional_details": "When people report the perpetrators, social media companies say they can't do anything because it doesn't meet they community guidelines. How can that be when hate crime is illegal. The government should make new legislation and fine companies a lot of money for every user that does it. This will force companies to do more because they won't want to lose money. Simply just saying do more isn't working they need more aggressive pressure.",
        "background": "Social media companies needs to do more to ban people who write racist or hate comments. They flag up covid words fine and they flag up political words fine but racism and hate they do nothing about it, even when people report them.",
