All because of this Nurses dont stay in UK, they jump to other countries and thats why there is shortage of this occupation. They are to be treated nicely and government should show interest in this matter to support the existing NHS nurses and do something for their well being.",
        "background": "Nurses who come from abroad leaving all their loved ones are to be considered, rather than being ignored. Once they come here they bring their spouse and kids. Husbands do part time and look after kids. The renewal fee for Tier 2 is too much, they make it some how, soon after that comes ILR.",
