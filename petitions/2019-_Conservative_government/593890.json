        "additional_details": "In the UK alone, 264 million manual plastic toothbrushes are thrown out every year. Each one of these plastic toothbrushes is non-biodegradable, meaning they'll last in the environment for over 600 years causing damage to wildlife and littering our country. There are already a variety of green alternatives available today, like bamboo toothbrushes which are readily biodegradable. Toothbrushes do not need to be harmful to the environment, so let's ban manual plastic ones.",
        "background": "We would like the UK Government to ban the sale of manual plastic toothbrushes in the UK by 2025. Manual plastic toothbrushes are a notorious example of harmful plastic waste, and there are a variety of environmentally friendly alternatives in the market to move forward with.",
