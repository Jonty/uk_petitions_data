        "additional_details": "A 2012 YouGov survey found that 78% of men and women admitted to speeding. These results show that drivers are speeding and breaking the law. What is the cause? We believe the cause is that modern cars have become much faster, but on the other hand much safer. Cars have shorter breaking times and increased safety ratings compared to 50 years ago. There are countries that have implemented higher speed limits such as Germany. We could also to look into their statistics to address our concerns.",

We would like the government to trial a 100mph limit, and then to implement it or discontinue based on results.",
