        "action": "Pay healthcare students for the work they do while on placement.",
        "additional_details": "Some students, especially those in their final year of university, are expected to perform the same tasks as their qualified peers, except for free. To work 12-14 hours a day during this climate with zero support is unforgivable. The Government should pay these students appropriately as band 3 staff or above depending on their current qualifications, as without the student support during this crisis, the healthcare system would suffer.",
        "background": "During the pandemic, healthcare students such as paramedic students & nursing students have been forced to work the same long hours as their paid mentors, to take the same risks, and on their 'days off' to balance their university work as well as part time jobs, leading to higher levels of burnout.",
