        "additional_details": "While additional NHS respoders are sorely needed to carry out vital duties to mobilise support for the most vulnerable members of our communities, it is highly inappropriate that this is launched as an unpaid volunteer intiative at a time when an unprecedented number of people in the UK face severe hardship and income inseceurity as the country is under lockdown measures.\r\n\r\nThe government need to change this intiative into a paid workforce, to adequately support the population as a whole.",
        "background": "The government has called on fit and healthy adults to sign up as NHS volunteer responders to help up to to 1.5 million vulnerable people confined to their homes for three months. This intiaitive should be launched as paid work force rather than as an unpaid volunteer intiative.",
