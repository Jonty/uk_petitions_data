        "additional_details": "I recently went into a cafe in a busy park, ordered some coffees and asked if they could fill up my water bottle with tap water. I was told they would only give me tap water in a single-use plastic cup.\r\n\r\nThe park was very busy with families and children. We should all be doing the little things to cut down plastic pollution (ie using a reusable water bottles). The fact that many of these families would have had a disposable plastic cup as their own free drinking water option is disgraceful.",
        "background": "Cafes and restaurants should have a duty to refill reusable water bottles, if requested to. Our fight against plastic pollution is happening now and we should be encouraging everyone to make the small changes. Cafes and restaurants should not be able to refuse to refill water bottles with tap water.",
