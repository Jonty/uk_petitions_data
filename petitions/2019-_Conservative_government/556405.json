        "action": "Allow two households to meet in England in addition to the Rule of Six.",
        "additional_details": "Everyone living in the same house, unless isolating, are sharing communal areas and therefore likely to share Covid 19 should a member of a household contract the virus. Six different people meeting up from six different houses could infect the members of their households should they contract the virus, which is a far greater risk than two households coming together. The rule of 6 restricts larger families significantly, as well as two families with children to meet, or grandparents visiting.",
        "background": "Six people from different houses are permitted to meet in England. This allows those six people to return to their individual houses and potentially infect every person in their household. \r\nAllowing two households to meet will allow two families to meet (particularly bigger families).",
