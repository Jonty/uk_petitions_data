        "additional_details": "Since 2010 London has lost 104 Youth Clubs, not only has this lead to a dramatic increase in violence but young people have nowhere to go to get the support we need. By reopening Youth Clubs young people will get off the streets and into a safe nurturing environment. This is particularly important due to COVID-19 as young peoples mental health has suffered and not everyone has an effective support system at home. Youth Clubs will provide emotional, social and physical health benefits.",
