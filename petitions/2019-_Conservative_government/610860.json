        "additional_details": "The huge rise in energy bills is caused by increasingly expensive fossil fuels. These are responsible for 85% of the rise in bills in the UK according to energy think tank Ember. Green energy saves people money, ends our reliance on gas and oil imported from Britain's enemies and helps limit the flooding and extreme weather caused by climate change and which damages so many communities in Britain. We need to move much faster to achieve these benefits than 2050.",
        "background": "The rising price of fossil fuels is placing an unaffordable burden on the British people. Our reliance on imports of foreign fossil fuels also weakens our national security. We need to ditch our expensive and dangerous reliance on oil, coal and gas far quicker than is currently planned.",
