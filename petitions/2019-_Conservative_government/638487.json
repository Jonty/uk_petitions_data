        "additional_details": "When VI people go into a restaurant, it can be quite demeaning to have parts of the menu read out to them. They can't access the whole menu, and relying on staff or family can make them feel helpless. Having a Braille menu promotes independence. \r\nInformation should be accessible to everybody, disabled or not. Our lives would be much easier if even small things like Braille menues were available. \r\nBusinesses can go to All Things Dotty, who can create Braille menues tailored to their needs.",
        "background": "All restaurant chains should have a Braille menu.\r\nThe Equality Act states that every business should have information in other formats.\r\nIt should be LAW that restaurant chains have Braille menues for visually impaired people, to help in our fight for accessibility for everyone.",
