        "additional_details": "We owe a debt to all Front Line NHS workers who have maintained our NHS and managed to greatly assist in treating sufferers of this awful Covid virus and keeping the NHS going. The Budget announced a !% pay rise for those staff, even though the rest of the public services are on a Pay Freeze. When it comes to the Parliamentary debate on MPs pay,  will award themselves substantially more than 1%? I believe in no Pay Rises for MPs until there Front-Line NHS workers are offered substantially more",
        "background": "We the undersigned believe that if the UK Government insist on restricting the pay rise of front-line NHS workers to merely 1%, in the time when they have been the corner stone of this Counties fight against Covid, then all MPs should forfeit their own right to a pay rise for the next three years.",
