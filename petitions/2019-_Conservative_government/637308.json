        "additional_details": "We believe the current system is unfair to those on low wages and pensions. No one earning or receiving other income of under \u00a321,000 a year should pay income tax, and this should be increased in line with inflation in future. Many people are in crisis - we believe it is time that those who are better placed to pay, do so.",
        "background": "We believe it's unacceptable for low paid workers and pensioners to pay tax on anything below \u00a321,000, which is just over what someone would earn working 38 hours a week at the National Living Wage. The revenue should be recovered from those in higher earner brackets (over \u00a3140,000) and businesses.",
