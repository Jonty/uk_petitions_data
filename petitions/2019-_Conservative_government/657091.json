        "additional_details": "We think the use of facial recognition technology in public spaces needs specific, detailed legislation put in place to more clearly define its use and prevent abuse. Although CCTV is allowed in public spaces, facial recognition software creates a digital print of an individual's facial features and can be used to identify a person whether or not they have committed any crime. It can be hard for the public have to understand how this data will be used and stored.\r\n\r\nIf you are happy to accept that suggestion, let me know and I will publish your petition. If you would like something different, let me know and we can discuss the wording.\r\n",
        "background": "Currently people do not have any option to consent or object to the processing of their biometric image when facial recognition technology is used in public spaces. We think the use of such technology should be banned until specific, detailed legislation is put in place.\r\n ",
