I gave a call to 999 they sent me to a Police Station which had the doors closed and I was locket out side and discovery I had a device stick on the car to track me the police came to me just 6h late.",
        "background": "The Government in UK must stop just think about make income from Marshals road traffic and start to increase a number of Police offices on the road because I can see 2 or 3 Marshals every square in UK but I don't see a police officer in a radius 3 miles. And when you call needed everyone is busy.",
