        "additional_details": "We hear a lot about how Scotland wants to leave the UK and rejoin the EU, that's their choice and good luck to them. It would be helpful to know how the English feel about the union with Scotland and if they would like to end it as much as the Scottish do. Isn't it important to know how both sides feel about Scottish nationalism and wouldn't it be fair to give both sides a say in the matter.",
