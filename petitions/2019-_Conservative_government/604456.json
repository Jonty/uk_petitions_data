        "additional_details": "I am the victim of sexual historic abuse and suffered years of abuse through my childhood. After building up courage to report my abuser, it went to Crown Court the judge was bound by the 1956 act and as a result was only able to sentence the offender to 20 months in custody. \r\n\r\nI have a life sentence of suffering, he has only 20 months custody, where as today laws he could have had 14 years. This does not give sexual abuse survivors the confidence to report their abuser, when sentences are so outdated. \r\n",

The Sexual Offences Act 1956 as enacted is out dated and can leave victims feeling it is not worth coming forward about historic sexual offences.",
