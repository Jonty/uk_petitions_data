For SP assigned more than 50 miles away from their family homes - who are forced to live in SFA, should only pay Capital Gains Tax at the appropriate level to their annual salary after deductions including mortgage and interest payments. This should only apply to SP with one let property only.",

SP rarely make any profit and in most cases make a loss overall.",
