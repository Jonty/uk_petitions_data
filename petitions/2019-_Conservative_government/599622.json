They need to be more ambitious with their target and act now to mandate that councils use the waste hierarchy. The waste hierarchy promotes the following steps in this order: Prevention, Reuse, Recycling, Other Recovery, and Disposal.\r\n \r\nSecond hand, the circular economy and reuse should form a larger part of the national - and international - net zero strategy.",
