Medication is vital for managing the disease to avoid further health complications and surgical procedures. An IBD sufferer can pay for 4 or 5 prescriptions within a month, depending on the disease severity. Each prescription costs \u00a39.35 and is rising. Free prescriptions reduces financial stresses for many with IBD and provides support to treat the illness. ",
