        "additional_details": "In the UK there are hundreds of dog thefts each month, and more so during the current pandemic. \r\nDogs are being stolen out of kennels and gardens, and are being used for puppy farmers for over breeding, bait and goodness knows what else. We as British citizens want more to be done to clamp down on dog thefts. These being mainly working dogs - spaniels in particular, that are being stolen, they are our pets and part of our families. We cannot stress enough how traumatic these things are to not only to the dogs but to the real owners.",
        "background": "The Government need to be more strict on thefts of dogs be have a heavier penalty on this to try and prevent it happening more. People are losing part of their families through others stealing dogs from their homes and this is something the Government need to realise and clamp down on.",
