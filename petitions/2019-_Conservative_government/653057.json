        "additional_details": "Police car chases can place the public at risk of serious injury/death of often stolen and uninsured cars. Offenders often have no consideration to the potential damage to property and/or the risk of injury/death they can impart on others.\r\n \r\nThen, even if a vehicle is stopped by the police, it can be difficult to identify the driver, and so secure a prosecution. We believe making it an offence to be in or on a vehicle that fails to stop when required by the police would make it easier for people to be charged when a vehicle fails to stop.\r\n",
        "background": "Where motor vehicles or motor bikes fail to stop when required to do so by the police, currently only the driver/rider is guilty of an offence. We believe all people in/on a vehicle should be held equally responsible and face prosecution.",
