        "additional_details": "It is not simply whether children and teachers will be safe, even if children are less likely to suffer, and even if teachers are vaccinated, children WILL bring the virus home to parents, putting every household at risk. While it\u2019s awful to think of anyone suffering with the virus, there are many single parents who would have no help with their child if they were hospitalised, or worse. I certainly wouldn\u2019t want my 4 year old to find me passed out, or end up in foster care.",
        "background": "Keep schools closed until the vaccine is fully rolled out, or in the least give parents the option to keep children out of school without the threat of fines, court or losing their school place.",
