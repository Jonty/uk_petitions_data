People are not clear on what is expected of them. \r\nAsking people not to do something such as go to the pub should be enforced. \r\nPeople are becoming more confused. \r\nWhy are we doing things differently than other countries. Surely the science is the same everywhere. \r\nRe-open community testing centres.\r\nOur Government looks weak and our nation a joke due to the lack of action being taken.\r\nDo not ask people to stop doing things- tell them they have to.",

Why doesn't that include children in educational settings?\r\n4. Do not tell people not to go to pubs etc, close them.",
