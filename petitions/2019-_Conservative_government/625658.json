These children need support of a government wanting to fight for them and support them that understand it\u2019s duty of care to our children. Children are being unable to receive the support and education they deserve and need. Every child should be able to have a school place but that isn\u2019t the case with all special needs children. \r\nThe system is broken children with additional needs are getting forgotten and left to struggle on there own. We need more specialist school, teachers and places made available for our growing population. More and more secondary mainstream schools being built but NO new specialist schools being built.",
