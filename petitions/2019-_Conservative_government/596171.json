        "additional_details": "This will see the nightclub industry financially hit, DJ's who dont want to get the vaccine out of work, take away human rights of the right to choose if they want the vaccine or not and will limit them to what they can do for entertainment at night.",
        "background": "The scheme is a pointless exercise as even with double jabs you can contract and spread covid, the more sensible option would be negative tests to ensure that anyone entering the club is not infected reducing the chance of the spread of covid and we ask that you scrap the plans for this.",
