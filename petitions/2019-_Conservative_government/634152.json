Obviously If the tattoo's in these places are rude or racist then yes we understand for us to be refused the job in certain sectors but we should get equal rights and not just looked at like scum.",
        "background": "Iv been refused jobs or had management tell staff that they didn't know was friends of mine that I'm not the sort they hire after I got an application form and I have hand and face tattoo's. (Non rude or racist) I think its wrong where we are meant to give everyone equality but we receive none back.",
