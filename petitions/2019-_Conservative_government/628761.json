        "additional_details": "The aim of the review should be to produce national guidelines for all Local Authorities to adopt. This could encourage more women to enter the profession. \r\n\r\nCurrently less than 3% of drivers are female. The industry is in crisis and needs more drivers. Drivers are lone workers and are at higher risk of being victims of crime. Depending upon where a driver is licensed their safety and security may vary. Drivers nationally should be protected. This could include access to the same provisions such as CCTV or Safety Screens. Ensuring safety will encourage more drivers to train and will retain current drivers.",
        "background": "The Government should conduct a review of the safety and security of taxi/ private hire to look at how lone drivers can be protected. They should consult drivers, industry leaders and stakeholders. ",
