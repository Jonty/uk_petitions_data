Many small businesses are facing massive overhead increases that mean they need to make their premises more efficient and increase sales. Hitting the threshold increases paperwork and accounting fees as well as the actual bill, and many service businesses can\u2019t reclaim much VAT and even on the flat rate scheme it is absorbing potential profit, making some businesses unsustainable. Bring the threshold in line with inflation to give small business a chance.",

Due to soaring costs, some businesses are forced to increase prices and are hitting the VAT threshold and fighting a battle to absorb yet another cost or increase prices again, lowering demand during the rising cost of living.
