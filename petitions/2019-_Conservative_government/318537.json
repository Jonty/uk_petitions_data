(Pornography, bullying etc) education may benefit from this because without the social media platforms children will have less distractions from their school work. The amount of child suicides has risen tremendously. The rate of deaths among under 25s increased by 23.7%, reaching 730 deaths in 2018. https://www.samaritans.org/about-samaritans/research-policy/suicide-facts-and-figures",

There should be consequences for people bullying on these platforms (social media platforms should be held accountable)",
