        "additional_details": "The freeze was part of the Government\u2019s response to the 2008 financial crisis. It\u2019s led to benefits today being 6% lower than they should be. In 2019 the chancellor said that the Government had \u201cturned the page on austerity\u201d. The freeze has saved the UK \u00a38 billion. \r\n\r\nThe coronavirus has put the poor under a particular financial burden. Some of the most vulnerable in society rely on welfare to keep them safe and healthy. Benefits have increased but only temporarily and not for all. It\u2019s time to reverse the freeze.",
        "background": "Between 2016 and 2020, the Government \u201cfroze\u201d the rates of welfare benefits and tax credits. Payments weren\u2019t increased in line with inflation. We want the Government to restore benefits to the levels they\u2019d be at had the freeze not occurred.",
