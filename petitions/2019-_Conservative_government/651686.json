Parties like the Liberal Democrats are constantly harassed by the FPTP system, showing a clear failure in a fair democracy of our country. A fairer system such as the Additional member system, as used in Scotland, would greatly improve our countries\u2019 elections and the say of the people. Parties with more votes would get more seats - It\u2019s as simple as that.",

This disproportionate system of parties with numerous voters getting less seats is not working and is an unfair representation.",
