Also that they look at the response times in rural  areas surrounding these towns as they are greatly exaggerated in the average times given for the service as a whole.",

They are using the faster response times in large cities to mask the fact that they are already missing response times in smaller towns. With the new move to close even more stations, lives will be put at risk",
