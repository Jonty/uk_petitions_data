Plastic guns CANNOT be sterilised and pose a great risk for bloodborne pathogen transmission/infection.\r\n\u2022 Piercing guns cause significant tissue damage due to blunt force trauma and can shatter cartilage.\r\n\u2022 The length/design of gun studs is inappropriate. Butterfly backs have many folds where fluid/bacteria can accumulate.\r\nPlease refer to https://safepiercing.org/piercing-guns/ for more information.",
