        "additional_details": "International students are suffering as everyone else suffers in this pandemic. Parents are being made redundant and cannot meet their children's demand for education. Furthermore, international students are only allowed to work 20 hours on full-timee study, and 0 hours on part-time study. This had anyways shackled international students with their financial needs. Additionally,  part-time jobs are being reduced due to the economic of the pandemic. This is also highlighted by the current press.",
        "background": "International students pay \u00a312,000 - \u00a324,450 per academic year towards their tuitions and the facilities of the University, however the current Pandemic is not allowing students to benefit these facilities. What the students pay is not worth the education and services they are currently receiving.",
