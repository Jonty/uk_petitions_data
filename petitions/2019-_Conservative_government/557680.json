        "additional_details": "To ban pubs and other hospitality outlets from selling alcohol to take away will make the survival of these outlets almost impossible. There is no logical reason to do this as people can simply buy alcohol elsewhere. This is not fair on the hospitality industry. To ban all alcohol sales in response would be idiotic. Just think of the US prohibition era.",
        "background": "In the first covid-19 national lockdown pubs and other licensed premises were allowed to sell takeaway alcohol subject to their licence conditions.  \r\nThis was one of the few lifelines for pubs and the breweries supplying them. Now they cannot sell takeaway alcohol but shops and supermarkets can",
