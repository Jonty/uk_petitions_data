        "additional_details": "Only 21% of gas and electricity consumers switch suppliers to take advantage of price competition (UK Power - 'How many people switch energy?'). The majority of people who switch are well educated, computer savvy, moneywise and probably wealthy.\r\nThe market is therefore not supporting the government's intention of 'levelling up' the uk economy. On the contrary, the current regime favours the wealthy and disadvantages the less wealthy. Forcing utility companies to reward customer loyalty will achieve significant levelling up with little or no government expenditure and remove an immense amount of hassle from the lives of uk citizens.",
        "background": "Gas and electricity consumers who do not switch supplier are currently heavily penalised for their loyalty. The people who switch are computer savvy, moneywise and willing to make the effort to frequently switch suppliers. They are generally well off. The poor are therefore subsidising the wealthy",
