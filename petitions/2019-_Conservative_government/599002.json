        "additional_details": "We would like the Government to reinstate English PGCE/PGDE student bursaries for the year 2021/22 and reimburse expenses already incurred by these students this year. With many subjects receiving funding, there is no justification for English students not to receive financing. During a time where the demand for teachers is so profound, there should be no hindrances. This will only cause a shortage in ECTs and severely impact prospective students, especially students from a low income and those of an ethnic minority.",
        "background": "Bursaries for English PGCE/PGDE student teachers were withdrawn this year, along with subjects such as History. As a core subject, this is very unjust. As students, we understand that Covid 19 has caused funding, but as teachers in training, we have a number of expenses that are not covered for.",
