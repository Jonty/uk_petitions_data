        "additional_details": "On the 3rd of January Prime Minister Boris Johnson was quoted by the BBC saying that there was \u201cno doubt in (his) mind that schools are safe\u201d this is a direct contradiction to the information relayed on the 4th publicly stating \u201cschools are to only stay open for key workers children\u201d. This requirement should be a principal across all age groups as the rate of infection is exactly the same in early years settings.\r\nThe swift delivery undermines all child workers and should be reviewed immediately.",
        "background": "All schools are now closed due to national lockdown and are only open for key workers. However all early years settings (0-5) are to remain open to all. Employed key workers children should still be able to access these services but to allow access for all is a contradiction to closing the schools.",
