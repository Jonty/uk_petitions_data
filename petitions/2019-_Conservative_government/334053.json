Babies, toddlers and very young children are not making the decision for themselves to receive body modification. Chain stores that offer piercing do it on the permission of the parent and sometimes continue even when the child is crying or clearly unsettled.",

Too many babies and young children have their ears pierced based on due to the vanity of their parents. Ear piercing standards vary from place to place but many are pierced by teenagers with minimal experience.",
