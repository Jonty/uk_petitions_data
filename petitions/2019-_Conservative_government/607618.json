        "additional_details": "The concept of \"Tax on Account\" is similar to a savings plan. That is, to pre-pay some amount of money against a future bill.\r\n\r\nHowever, for self-assessment tax payers (ie. all higher rate earners, and a few others), paying the tax bill itself is a burden enough. Whatever pre-payment was done the year before is largely negated by the requirement to pre-pay for next year.\r\n\r\nWe call for the requirement for Payment on Account in January to be scrapped.",
        "background": "HMRC/HMT should stop collecting \"Tax on Account\" in January. It's already enough of a burden to self-assessment tax payers to pay the tax they owe, that they shouldn't additionally have to pay a speculative amount for future tax not yet due (which may be on earning not yet made).",
