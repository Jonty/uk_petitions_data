        "additional_details": "In a bid to bring our communities closer, the celebration will be street, garden and balcony parties or other venues on a designated day. The government will announce when lockdown is due to cease and the celebration day should follow the final day of lockdown. This will be a pinnacle day in our nation's calendar every year to remember what a great nation we are and how we came together at a time of need for one another. Just like Remembrance Day, we will not forget these hard challenging times.",
        "background": "Introduce an annual day of street party celebrations to recognise the efforts of all our local authorities, NHS, those who have sadly passed, the whole nation for staying home during lockdown and our current government in what is set to be the hardest challenge we have faced in our lifetime.",
