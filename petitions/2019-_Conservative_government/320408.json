        "additional_details": "A child\u2019s early years shapes them for life. It defines what type of learner they will be and it provides the foundation for all their knowledge that will follow. They need play, social interaction and a broad range of carefully planned resources; none of which will exist if they return in June. Our youngest children will be sitting 2 meters apart at desks for hours. Their learning stifled. They (for most children) will learn far more at home playing, with their families.",
        "background": "Wait to send Early Years and KS1 children back to school until more of our society has returned to \u201cnormal\u201d with the rate of R continuing to decrease. Optimistically July, likely September. Protecting this group and school staff from the virus. Whilst preserving good early years practice.",
