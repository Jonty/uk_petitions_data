Your petition calls for quarantine and testing rules to be changed, but it appears the only change you want is for the quarantine period for travellers from amber-listed countries to be reduced from 10 to 5 days.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
