        "additional_details": "We request the government to protect our children from being indoctrinated with racially-divisive teaching that Woke & Cancel Culture promote, which brackets and labels individuals based on skin colour and ethnicity. We request that if it does become compulsory to teach the British Empire in schools, then all elements of it must be taught, the good as well as the bad, which includes Britain's role in ending the slave trade and the spread of civilisation and democracy across the globe.",
        "background": "We are becoming increasingly concerned about the spread of Cancel Culture in British educational institutions. This not only extends to portraits of royals being torn down or statues removed from universities but the worrying push for compulsory education of BAME mistreatment, both past & present.",
