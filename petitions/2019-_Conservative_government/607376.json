We also want the government to abolish the rules on NHS staff having to be fully vaccinated as again this is a personal choice and any attempt to force the vaccine would be a violation of our bodily autonomy and would breach human rights law and international treaties on medical treatment.",

Being vaccinated is a choice which the individual can make under the Humans right Act 1998, we should not be restricted in traveling or work as both vaccinated and unvaccinated can carry the virus",
