        "additional_details": "This will be essential in urban spaces, to provide key habitat for native fauna, assist in gains for biodiversity in the uk and more importantly, carbon drawdown. There will also be less management involved in maintaining natural, self sustaining trees and shrubs, which grow better to the uk climate, soils and do not create dead areas of vegetation build up, crowded and overgrown areas which require maintenance and are unsuitable for British fauna. This is fundamental to British biodiversity.",
        "background": "Government should restrict the purchase & planting by new housing developments & home owners of non-native plants, trees & shrubs on highways, property & open spaces. In order to achieve net gains for biodiversity, native species such as bees and hedgehogs, would benefit by planting native flora.",
