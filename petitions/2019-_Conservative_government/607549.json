For those who could not work due to covid-19 restrictions and were therefore furloughed, their employers were still required to pay their employees' national insurance contributions to the Government as if their staff were still working. This means their eligibility for ESA should not have been affected. You can find out more about this here: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-for-wages-through-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme.\r\n\r\nIn any case, any decision to seek private medical treatment, and decisions on how to pay for it, are personal matters for individuals and not something for which the UK Government or Parliament are directly responsible for.\r\n\r\nYou could have a petition calling for increased NHS funding for mental health support to those suffering due to the Covid-19 pandemic, if that is something you'd like to see happen.\r\n\r\nYou might also like to sign these petitions, which call for related actions:\r\n\r\n'Reinstate Furlough and Self-Employment Support due to Fresh COVID-19 Disruption': https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/604502\r\n\r\n'Increase funding for crisis and acute mental health services': https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/600251"
