        "action": "Legalise the use of e-scooters on roads with certain requirements",
        "additional_details": "At the same time as it allows the road user some freedom, it also forces them to be more responsible with it. They should have to make sure they adhere to a certain speed for the safety of others, wear a helmet to ensure their own safety. A licence plate ensures that a person can be tied to their own vehicle if they were to accidentally cause damage. If e-scooters were legalised it would allow many road users to be able to claim for insurance if their e-scooter was damaged or thieved.",
        "background": "Many people believe e-scooters are dangerous, it is more the person who rides it who needs to be checked rather than the vehicle itself. Putting in certain restrictions will allow some road freedom to those who wish to use e-scooters for commuting and reducing their carbon footprint.",
