        "background": "There are current \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 cruelty laws to prevent animal suffering, but none which relate specifically to the treatment of dogs during warm/hot weather i.e. at what outside temperature should they not be allowed to be taken for a walk, transported or left unattended in a car. Specific rules are needed.",

However, walking or transporting a dog in extreme heat can already constitute an offence of causing 'unnecessary suffering' under the Animal Welfare Act 2006. You can find out more about this here: https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/45/section/4. This means it's not clear how what you want to happen is different to the law as it stands.\r\n\r\nYou could have a petition calling on the Government to amend the Animal Welfare Act to specify the temperature above which animals should not be walked or transported, so long as you specify what you want that temperature to be (or how you want that temperature to be determined by others)."
