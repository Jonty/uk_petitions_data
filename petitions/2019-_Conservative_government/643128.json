        "additional_details": "It is legally required to report if you run over a dog, deer etc but why are cats not reported. Any pet owner especially cat lovers and owners will understand but cats bring a sense of peace, they become a part of our lives, we had only just started to make memories with out kitty but what about those who have had their cats for years. If this driver had stopped, knocked on a neighbours door we could have saved kitty but instead he had to suffer alone even though we spent all night looking for him. Kids are heartbroken, and i am struggling to come to terms with how cruel one must be to have a 9 months old cat turn in their wheel and check on its welfare. Do we as humans not have a resposibilty to speak up for those that do not have a voice.",
        "background": "I am kindly requesting the goverment to please put a law in place for drivers to stop and report if they have run over a cat. A couple of days ago we lost our cat on the road after a van ran over him, when we found him it was too late. Cats lives matter too. Cats are a part of a family too.",
