        "background": "While the Wider Service Medal rightly recognises the contribution of Service Personnel fulfilling crucial operational roles, it only dates back to December 2018. We want the criteria to be backdated to the start of all operations that are still ongoing, such as Op KIPION and Op KIPION MCM.",
