Adults are not going to these places to participate, we are only going to take the children.

        "background": "I would like parliament to ban places charging for adult entry on childrens venues such as soft plays, farms and activity centres. If it is a child based activity with no adult involvement, just being a spectator then the entry charge should not be legally allowed.",
