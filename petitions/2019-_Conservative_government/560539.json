        "additional_details": "More than half of patients die within 3 months of diagnosis, for my Grandfather it was just 9 days. Diagnosis of this cancer can take a long time, often with many visits to the doctors & possible misdiagnoses along the way. Around 80% of pancreatic cancer patients are not diagnosed until the cancer is at an advanced stage. At this late stage, surgery is usually not possible \u2013 this is the only known treatment that has the potential to cure the disease.",
        "background": "Research into this cancer has been underfunded for decades. It only receives 2% of the UK cancer research budget. This is 3 times less than research spent on breast cancer. By investing in researchers, earlier diagnosis & better treatments & care can be found to treat one of the deadliest cancers.",
