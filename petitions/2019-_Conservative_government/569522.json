        "additional_details": "In the interests of reducing the spread of Covid-19, saving lives, easing the pressure on the NHS and being fair to independent shops, we ask that the government requires all high street shops still open to the public to only sell \"essential\" items like food, toiletries, medicine, and basic cleaning matierials.  For example, Tescos, Sainsburys, Waitrose, Morrisons, Poundland, WHSmiths, etc,  should not be allowed to sell fiction, DVDs, toys, candles, bowls etc.",
        "background": "We should like the government to be clear about what is a \"non-essential product\", and ban all shops, including supermarkets and chains from selling these products. Hundreds of shops, defined as \"non-essential\" have had to close, whilst chains can still sell these very \"non-essential\" products.",
