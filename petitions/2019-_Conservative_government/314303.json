        "additional_details": "Thousands of customers are disgruntled at Hoseasons as a result of their policy on cancelled holidays due to COVID 19. Hoseasons are insisting customers rebook or have their Hoseasons account credited to the value of the holiday. Many people are unable to rebook due to issues all getting leave at the same time or maybe the holiday was booked for a special occasion. Hoseasons should refund anyone who has been affected by the Coronavirus outbreak",
        "background": "Hoseasons have refused to refund customers who\u2019s bookings have been cancelled as a result of COVID 19. They should be made to refund these customers as the holidays they paid for are not being provided.",
