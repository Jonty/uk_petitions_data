        "action": "Resolve the energy crisis through Green energy not by fracking or oil and gas",
        "additional_details": "Resolving our energy crisis by extracting every last drop of oil, every last whiff of gas, and by fracking will contribute to global warming. Global warming is already causing widespread problems, it would be selfish to contribute further to those.\r\nThere is no advantage to turning to oil and gas, for instance offshore wind farms can be built in about the same timescale (and in some cases faster) than new oil and gas. Green energy (on or offshore) will reduce energy prices and help the climate.",
        "background": "Resolve the energy crisis by investing in green energy; green energy comes on stream about as quickly as new oil and gas or fracking but doesn't harm the environment. It is also sustainable and lower cost. End the exploration of new oil and gas fields and fracking and back green energy instead.",
