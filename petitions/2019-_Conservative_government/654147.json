        "additional_details": "I have done my own survey of the lack of bike lights in my home city of Cambridge. I have calculated that between 30 and 40% of cyclists I observed are riding bikes without any form of suitable illumination.\r\n \r\nWhile cyclists must have front and rear lights lit at night, cycle retailers do not have to supply bikes with lights. They are an optional extra. A bike is a heavy and potentially dangerous object that can inflict severe injury. You would not be allowed to buy or own a car without lights. Why should the same not be true of bikes.",
        "background": "At present a person can ride a bike without working lights during daylight hours. A significant number of cyclists ride bikes without any form of illumination especially after dark. This can be a severe danger to other road users and the cyclists themselves.",
