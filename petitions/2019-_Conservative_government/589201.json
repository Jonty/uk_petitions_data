        "action": "Stop using the National anthem at sporting events featuring the England team",
        "additional_details": "In a time when the Union is under threat, it is highly divisive that the National anthem should be appropriated by England while the other home nation teams have to use another song. God Save the Queen belongs to all the people of the union, not just the English. How can a supporter of Scotland or Wales feel any love for their national anthem when it is used in honour of the opposition? We risk making our anthem an object of hatred.",
        "background": "Pass a law to prevent the use of the National anthem, which is the anthem of the United Kingdom, that is to say Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as well as England, when an England team is playing. Propose a replacement like Land of Hope and Glory, or commission a new anthem for England.",
