This is really detrimental to vulnerable people\u2019s mental wellbeing. Testing regularly and being vaccinated with social distancing is enough. It is not fair. The face to face groups are vital for people on the spectrum who struggle to leave the house and gives them that vital social time with people alike. Therapy groups also, they need that connection.",

Having bars and clubs open and making social groups online is not fair. Most are vaccinated, test regularly and always practice social distancing. It\u2019s vital for their mental health.",
