        "additional_details": "The need to include baby-changing facilities in all public toilets is rooted in the principles of gender equality and shared parenting responsibilities. There has been a significant shift in societal norms in recent years, with more fathers actively participating in childcare and taking on equal responsibilities alongside mothers. The lack of baby-changing facilities in men's restrooms creates unnecessary challenges and discomfort for fathers when caring for their children in public spaces.",
        "background": "We're urging the Government to enact legislation that mandates there should be baby-changing stations in all men's and women's public toilets, equipped with changing tables, nappy disposal, and sanitation supplies, to cater to the needs of babies and toddlers.",
