        "additional_details": "Current legislation may well lead to the removal of illegal economic migrants but that will not stop the escalating illegal traffic across the Channel and indeed other coastlines around Europe's borders. Banning the sale of these boats will seriously hinder these criminals and existing stocks can be immediately seized on \" the suspicion\" they might be used for 'an unlawful purpose' pending a total ban being imposed by the EU. Commercial Compensation will be much cheaper than processing migrants.",
        "background": "These boats are not designed for cross channel migration and as a result many have died. These boats are being used by organised crime for people smuggling not for saving lives  . Clearly these boats should be heavily regulated and licensed to prevent their unlawful use.",
