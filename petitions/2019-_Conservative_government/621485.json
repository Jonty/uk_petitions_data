By just putting the words 'flavourings,' or 'natural flavourings,' you are hiding what we are putting in our bodies, and not being transparent. Back in the Victorian times, additives were put in bread to make the colour whiter, or the bread seem heavier or thicker, milk also- those were toxic substances- people didn't know then, & don't now. 'Flavourings' are unnatural chemicals, but what chemicals? We have a right to know. Health>profit",
