We want the Parliament to debate this topic and to write to Her Majesty the Queen on our behalf to respectfully propose a change in the titles being used to be more appropriate to what we are actually celebrating today.",

Parliament should debate the name of these titles in today's Britain and propose a change to ensure they reflect today's society",
