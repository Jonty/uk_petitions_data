        "additional_details": "To that end, I am calling for all Door Supervisors and Security Officers to be routinely issued with handcuffs, side-handled batons and PAVA spray. Training, for the former, already exists. However, Door Staff are not allowed to carry or use batons and PAVA spray; yet their issue could drastically reduce the number of violent assaults, in all front line security operations and in particular, those against Door Supervisors and Security Officers.",
        "background": "With the increase in the number of assaults against Door Supervisors and Security Officers (including several which have resulted in death); I believe that all Door Supervisors and Security Officers should be allowed to protect themselves, their colleagues and the customers in their charge.",
