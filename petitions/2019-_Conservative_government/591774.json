Blocking or temporarily deleting abusive comments is not enough. Disgusting words that should never be okay to stay in the public or in a workplace should stop being allowed online, more action should be taken to protect high profile people from any kind of abuse because they are also people.",
        "background": "Take action and protect people online. Enforce a law to make social media owners really regulate the social media space. New fake accounts should be traceable to the owner and racist/abusive comments should go straight to their employer or police depending on the severity.",
