        "action": "Do not impose visa penalties on Russian or Belorussian nationals",
        "additional_details": "While the Russian aggression in the Ukraine is despicable, the Russian regime is not a democracy.  Many Russian nationals disagree with the actions of their government. One of the only avenues open to them is escape.  The UK should not be blocking this.  Furthermore this is a golden opportunity to entice highly skilled labor from Russia to the UK. Draining Russian brains is something that should be pursued not hindered.  Giving visas to highly skilled Russians should be expedited and prioritized.",
        "background": "Changes to the Nationality and Borders Act could allow the Home Office to make Immigration Rules that impose visa penalties.  However we strongly urge the government to avoid imposing overly broad penalties on Russian or Belorussian nationals who have no known connections to the regime in Russia.",
