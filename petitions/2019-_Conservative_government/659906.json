        "additional_details": "We believe provision of changing facilities are inadequate, and that this seriously limits the lives of those that need to use them. It can mean young people and adults are unable to access the community equally due to a chance of being unable to be changed whilst not at home.\r\n \r\nWould you like to sit in soiled underwear for up to an hour until the nearest changing places? No. Neither do disabled young people and adults.\r\n",
