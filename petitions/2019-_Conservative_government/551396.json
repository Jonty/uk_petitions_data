As a parent I\u2019m wanting to take my children out to protect them from Covid-19 and many other parents feel the same. Smaller bubbles may help prevent Covid cases in schools. Many class rooms are small and there are often too many children in one class. The 2 metre rule should be carried out so no children are sitting too close together.\r\n\r\nPlease everyone sign and help to keep our children safe and slow the spread of the virus.\r\n",
