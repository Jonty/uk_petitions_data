        "additional_details": "I have personally started a new job in the last month for a restaurant, which has more than one across the world and was off to a great start, but now has no choice except to terminate employee's contracts due to tier 3 restrictions. The restaurant was doing exceptionally well considering it was running for only a week, partly due to clients knowing about it from the other restaurants globally. Apart from my own place of work there are many other people suffering due to the 30th October clause.",
        "background": "I want the government to allow businesses especially those in hospitality who have opened a new restaurant to furlough workers who have been employed up until the tier 3 restrictions were placed dependent upon location.",
