Children deserve and have the right to both parents in equal proportions. A child should not have the burden of witnessing one parent fight through the family court simply to care for them in the same way as before the separation occurred.",

An equal shared care default should negate the need for costly proceedings in the family court, which should help improve the lives of children and reducing the mental health toll to all involved.",
