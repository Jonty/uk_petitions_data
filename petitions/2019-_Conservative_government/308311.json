        "additional_details": "For majority of employees in the country, Statory Sick Pay (SSP) is not a liveable wage and would put many into severe debt. \r\n\r\nEmployees have been told to either work and get full pay, or self isolate and be paid SSP.\r\n\r\nEmployees feel they have no choice but to continue going to work, because they cannot afford to live on SSP if they are to self isolate for the recommended 12 weeks. This endangers them, physically, and also mentally.",
        "background": "For employed staff, who fall under the vulnerable bracket and should self isolate to get full pay. If the company cannot afford to fully pay their staff, to make them apply for government funding so staff can get paid at least 80% of their wage.",
