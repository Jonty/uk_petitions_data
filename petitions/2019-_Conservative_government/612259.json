Schools are crying out for more help, and we want the Government to mandate and fund training for all staff in mainstream schools, to improve the experience of autistic students.\r\n\r\nI know your original petition referred to your son, but we don\u2019t publish petitions that contain personal information about minors, as they could be identifiable from the text of a petition, and name of the petition creator \u2013 which is published alongside a petition.",
        "background": "In my experience, children with Autism are still widely misunderstood within mainstream schooling. This can have an enormous impact on not only their ability to learn but their mental health. We want the Government to require and fund training on autism for all staff in mainstream schools receive.\r\n",
