This would have been picked up easily if they measured his placenta during routine scans, and he wouldn't have died if hospitals make it compulsory to do so.\r\n\r\nSo many other babies are dying every day because of this, and it is so easily preventable.\r\n\r\nPlease, help to prevent more babies dying unnecessarily.",

It requires 3 measurements (width, height, and thickness) that can be entered into a formula to determine the volume of a placenta in cubic centimetres.",
