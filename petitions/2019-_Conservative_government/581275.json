        "additional_details": "In the UK same sex marriage is legal and afforded the same rights as heterosexual marriages.\r\nHowever, if within this marriage adultery is committed with a person of the same sex this is not recognised by law as adultery, the law only recognizes heterosexual adultery as grounds for divorce.\r\nIf marriage between same sex couples is seen as equal in the eyes of the law why therefore is adultery not recognized between same sex people as grounds for divorce. This law must change.",
        "background": "Allow same sex couples to file for divorce on grounds of adultery whether that adultery happen with a male/female/trans individual.\r\nUpdate the current law which only recognizes adultery when someone commits adultery with a member of the opposite sex.",
