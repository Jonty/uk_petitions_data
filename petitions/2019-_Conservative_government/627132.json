Me being spiked was NOT my fault, and if thorough searches were done, young people would feel safer about going out and having fun. I'm now scared to go out, and no one should live in fear of going for a night out with friends. It was my friend's birthday, we were all dancing and having a laugh and the night took a horrible ending. I was unconscious, vomiting and unable to move.",
