        "action": "Automatically upgrade A2 motorcycle licence to A license after 2 years.",
        "additional_details": "We believe taking the same Mod1/Mod2 tests a second time, just on a different capacity bike, doesn't make any difference to training or safety standards.\r\n\r\nIn the past, an A2 rider would be restricted to two years before achieving a full unrestricted motorcycle license. I propose we now return to that scheme again\r\n\r\nFor car drivers of any age or experience, once a full license is obtained, they are able to drive any capacity car of their choosing. This is discrimination against motorcyclists.",
        "background": "Now that we have left the EU, we should go back to previous law (pre-2013) whereby motorcycle licenses were automatically upgraded from an A2 licence to an unrestricted licence after two years. Riders should have learned the necessary skill in these two years to ride bigger bikes.",
