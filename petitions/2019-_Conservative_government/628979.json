There is no where else for them to go. Both preschools are full with long waiting lists. \r\nEarly years settings provide an essential service to our youngest children. \r\nWe support the very early communication skills and nurture the growing child.\r\nOther local settings are full meaning children have no where to go. This is not fair and these children are being let down",
