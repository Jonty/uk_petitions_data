The explantory Notes to International Criminal Court Act 2001 explained that the jurisdiction provided for in the Genocide Act 1969 was more limited than is provided for in the ICC Act.\r\n\r\nIf you want the Government to change laws relating to genocide, you could start a new petition explaining clearly what changes you would like the Government or Parliament to make."
