        "additional_details": "Obesity is largely caused by poverty; the soaring prices of fresh fruit and veg mean those struggling the most financially can only afford the most packaged, processed, and calorific foods, which often have little to no visible information regarding their calorie content. Tackling obesity therefore must take a different approach. Those who cannot afford to buy such foods certainly would not choose to eat at an expensive chain restaurant. This performative tackle on obesity is superficial targeting of the wrong group so the government can once again claim to have tried. It is not good enough anymore.",
        "background": "As the NHS mental health services continue to deteriorate under poor leadership and funding from the current government, thousands of eating disorders continue to go untreated and spiral daily. The later health complications these result in are more severe that had intervention not occurred sooner.",
