        "action": "Increase SSP, suspend utility bill payments and \u00a31000 lump sum for everyone.",
        "additional_details": "We need the government to dig deep and provide more financial aide to the self employed, zero hour contract workers and other low wage families that barely live above the bread line and live from payslip to payslip. Increasing SSP rate and a one off lump sum will greatly improve people\u2019s chances to stay afloat and weather this storm while a suspension on utility bill payments will help even the elderly and most vulnerable.",
        "background": "During the coronavirus crisis we need the government to step in with real solution to support not only business but struggling families. Financial aid isn\u2019t coming fast enough with families forced to  work when they might be sick or know someone is sick because they need to pay their bills.",
