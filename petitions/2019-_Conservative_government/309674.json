        "additional_details": "The Gov needs to take the health and safety of our construction workers seriously as the Scottish Gov has and send them home.\r\n\r\nFamily members who are most vulnerable are essentially being \"forced\" to work as they cannot risk the financial burden of not working, whilst companies continue business as normal.\r\n\r\nIt is STILL deemed \"safe\" for Construction workers to remain on site, so long as they are 2m apart. This is unacceptable and not doable.  Health and Well-being must be the priority.",
        "background": "The purpose of this petition is for the Government to take action, to close down all Construction Sites / Businesses imminently, providing them with financial support to be able to be at home in isolation - to even be provided with the same 80% package which has been afforded to others.",
