        "additional_details": "Too many children are losing regular and meaningful contact with parents because one is restricting access. The only option for the excluded parent is to surrender or spend thousands of pounds fighting through court to retain or regain their place in their child's life. Many people simply can't afford to fight and even when they are able to find the money they are often left in the hands of magistrates who have wide discretion and can make unfathomable judgements that cannot be challenged.",
        "background": "When relationships end, often there is a dispute over the care of the children. It is very expensive and proceedings favour the mother despite the Gender Equality Act 2010. The default in such events should be to 50/50 shared care, on the assumption it is feasible and there is no risk to the child.",
