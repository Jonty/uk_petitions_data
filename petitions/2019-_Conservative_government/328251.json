It also includes other motorcycle clothing and safety equipment for other activities.\r\n\r\nThis issue needs addressing urgently as it could affect a person's chance of survival in the case of an accident. Consumers are misled into thinking they are purchasing a piece of equipment that has been tested, approved and will protect them in the case of an accident when it has not.",
