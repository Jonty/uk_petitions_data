        "additional_details": "There is much omitted from the curriculum on Britain\u2019s colonial history. By excluding the evils of British Imperialism, along with how members of the African Diaspora contributed to the British nation-state, British children are robbed of understanding how colonialist ideology was implemented. This stunts the growth of racial equality and equity in the UK, hindering the racial esteem of Black British children. \u201cIt is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men.\u201d Frederick Douglass.",
        "background": "Include honest, contextualised reading of British history which informs of the brutality of colonialism in the school curriculum. Teach & educate children about the economic, political and social advantages they enjoy today as a result of the colonial extraction and plunder their country engaged in.",
