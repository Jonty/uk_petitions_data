        "additional_details": "We cannot allow chemical manufacturers within the UK to profit from the production and export of banned pesticides. Chemicals have been banned for use within the UK due to potential health hazards like reproductive failure, endocrine disruption or cancer, and environmental hazards like groundwater contamination or poisoning of fish, birds, mammals or bees. The Government should ensure such chemicals are not produced in the UK or exported from the UK to other countries.",
        "background": "The UK is Europe\u2019s biggest exporter of pesticides banned for use in the EU. An Unearthed and Public Eye investigation found that the UK exports 32,188 tonnes of banned pesticides (almost 40% of the total from the EU) and that much ends up in poorer countries like South Africa, Ukraine, and Brazil.",
