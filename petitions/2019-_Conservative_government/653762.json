        "action": "Allow family of BN(O) nationals to get a British passport",
        "additional_details": "The Government has said that the National Security Law imposed by the Chinese government constitutes a clear breach of the legally binding Sino-British Joint Declaration. The Government launched the Hong Kong BN(O) visa in 2021. Still, BN(O) visa holders who have Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Passports have faced a dilemma when deciding whether to renew their passport. Allowing them to get British passports would mean they wouldn't need to renew their HKSAR passport.",
        "background": "Children and other family of BN(O) holders cannot inherit British National (Overseas) status. The UK has a proud historical and ethical commitment to BN(O) holders. We believe allowing family of BN(O) nationals born after 1997 to get British passports can fully demonstrate its commitment.",
