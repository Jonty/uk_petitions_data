See:\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-spring-2021/covid-19-response-spring-2021-summary\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition calling for pubs, restaurants and other hospitality venues to be included in Step 1 of the roadmap, if that's something you'd like to see happen."
