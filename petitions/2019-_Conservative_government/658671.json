        "additional_details": "Taxing bonuses discourages employees from striving for excellence. If a significant portion of a bonus is lost to taxes, the incentive to go above and beyond diminishes. This can ultimately harm businesses seeking to retain top talent and maximize productivity. \r\n\r\nBonuses often represent a substantial portion of a middle-class worker's annual income. Taxing these bonuses places an undue burden on families already grappling with rising costs.",
        "background": "Rising living costs squeeze hardworking families. Taxing employee bonuses, a reward for exceeding expectations, only makes it worse. Exempting bonuses from income tax would provide financial relief and incentivise top performance, ultimately benefiting businesses and the economy.",
