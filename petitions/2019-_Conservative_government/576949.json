There ended up being complications and he had to go to a ward which is where he caught Covid. We ended up losing him to Covid pneumonia. It is my belief that if patients were offered the vaccine as part of their pre-op process at whatever age (if wanted), risk would be reduced and it could save patients and families a lot pain and also reduce the workload for the NHS.",
