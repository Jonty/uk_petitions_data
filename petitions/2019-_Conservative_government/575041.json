        "additional_details": "There were talks about people being awarded \u00a3500 to stay home when tested positive for COVID. Differently from this negative approach, a \u00a3500 voucher to be spent on specific heavily affected business given to the workers who were more exposed to the pandemic could be a tremendous impulse to the economy and to these humble tax payers. They were keeping businesses COVID safe, cleaning, driving buses, sanitising streets, being receptionists, security, post men, going to work daily and not clapped .",
        "background": "The UK economy has been heavily affected by the pandemic. Certain busineses suffered more than others. Low income workers (>28k y) with jobs that didn't allow them to work from home were exposed to COVID & costs. \u00a3500 voucher to workers to be spent on certain business would benefit the UK as a whole",
