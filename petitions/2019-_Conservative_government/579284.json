        "additional_details": "The government was supposed to use a more subjective method of assessment for TAGs this year, and by using assessments sat at home it is impossible for student's grades to not be affected by living conditions. Those caring for children or living in busy houses will not have had a quiet exam condition to take these in and those who have limited internet access also will have struggled to take these assessments. Using these will skew the results to negatively impact poorer students.",
        "background": "During the lockdown, many students have had limited WiFi access, been caring for children, or are from busy households. Assessments sat in these conditions are impossible to be fair and will disproportionately negatively impact working class students who do not have access to the same resources.",
