It's also not clear which species you wish to be repopulated.\r\n\r\nYou could start a petition calling for a ban on fishing on 80% of UK rivers and other waterways, specifying which species you wish to be preserved, if that is something you'd like to see happen. If you choose to do so, please be sure to include your full name as we can't allow petitions to be started with just a first name.\r\n\r\nYou may wish to sign this petition which calls for a related action: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/581588"
