        "additional_details": "Preston has been awarded \u00a320 million for several projects, including the redesign of Ashton Park, as part of a LUF round 2 bid. Plans for Ashton Park include adding a floodlit 3G sports pitch, a 2-storey sports pavilion, an extra car park expected to have over 100 spaces, and six adult and junior football pitches. We believe this will change Ashton Park from being a traditional park for community use into a football hub.\r\n\r\nThe Council did not hold a consultation in advance of its bid. Preston Council did run a consultation after the bid and around 80% of respondents objected to the development. Despite this, the Council is going ahead with its scheme. We hope this petition will help prevent bids for Levelling Up Funds that do not have the support of local people.\r\n",
