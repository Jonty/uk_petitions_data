        "action": "Review social distancing in theatres every month, we can't wait until November.",
        "additional_details": "Theatre cannot be produced overnight, the industry needs time to plan. Waiting until November to establish a possible date when the industry can reopen ensures the further erosion of morale, the certain damage to tens of thousands of related livelihoods and the possibility that countless venues may close their doors permanently.\r\nAlready UK theatre has suffered an estimated \u00a390m loss owing to the cancellation of the 2020-2021 panto season, with calamitous knock-on effects.",
        "background": "We petition for social distancing in theatres to be reviewed every month, as soon as the House of Commons reconvenes in the early autumn\r\nThe decision to wait until November to review the guidance is compounding the economic devastation facing this world-leading sector & jeopardising the industry.",
