        "additional_details": "I want the Government to allow all youth sport, including indoor sports such as netball, to continue during lockdown within the modified guidelines. As a mother of two teenage girls I fear the impact on their mental health of sporting activity being stopped again. There is absolutely no reason why they can\u2019t carry on with the modified guidelines in place.",
        "background": "Youth sport and sport club training is an essential and integral part of many children\u2019s\u2019 lives. If they can go to school they should be allowed to play sport. Children have suffered enough and it appears that children are at lower risk from Covid-19. For the sake of their mental health allow sport.",
