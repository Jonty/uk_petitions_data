        "additional_details": "The UK government recently authorized \u00a31.4bn of arms sales to Saudi Arabia to continue its war in Yemen and subsequently reduced its aid to the innocents suffering starvation and disease as a result of the war.\r\n\r\nFormer Conservative international development secretary Andrew Mitchell said the move (to reduce aid) was \"unconscionable\" given the desperate situation in Yemen.\r\n\r\n\"The British people have a proud history of stepping up and supporting those in needs, but the actions of the government yesterday betrayed hundreds of thousands of Yemeni children as he chose to leave them to starve.\" Preet Kaur Gill",
        "background": "The decade-long conflict in Yemen has left an estimated 20 million people - two-thirds of the population - dependent on humanitarian assistance while two million children are acutely malnourished.",
