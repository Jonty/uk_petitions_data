        "additional_details": "There are more than 9 million stray, and 1.5 million feral cats in the uk (Cats Protection, 2018). Neutered tom cats are reported to live 62% longer than intact males, and spayed female\u2019s 39% longer than intact females. The average lifespan of a stray cat is just 2 years. Intact female kittens can be impregnated at only 4 months of age. Intact toms spread disease and fight, so often end up with infected wounds. The British Veterinary Association strongly support the routine neutering of cats.",
        "background": "Make it a legal requirement for owners to neuter/spay their cat, and for kittens to be neutered no later than 4 months of age. Registered cat breeders are to be exempt from this law. This will help reduce the stray population, lessen the strain on rescue charities, and save thousands of cat\u2019s lives.",
