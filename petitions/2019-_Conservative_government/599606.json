He hasn\u2019t seen either of them for over a year when he has done nothing wrong, and unless he pays thousands of pounds in court fees which he doesn\u2019t have, will never be allowed to see them until they are 18. Fathers deserve more rights as fathers, and it should be a legal right to coparent instead of the mother having the final say.",
