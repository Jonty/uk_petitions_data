Many people are on low income and living on welfare benefits. We believe, local businesses and some of their suppliers took advantage - and continue to do so - of local people because of the coronavirus. Now, vulnerable people, single parents, elderly and people who lost their jobs finding it very difficult to buy anything as they cannot afford or able to buy. We hope the Government will work with the local authority and trading standard to make sure this does not happen in the future and take any corrective measure to provide relief and help now.",
