        "additional_details": "Government are responsible for making sure NHS workers get paid. MPs have consistently voted to give themselves a pay-rise, voted against NHS pay-rises, and refused to show that they actually respect the work NHS staff do. The situation is more dire than ever, the NHS is more constrained than ever, and mental health and financial stability hangs in the balance. If government truly want to honour the NHS workers as heroes, they must show it. They must literally pay in respect.",
