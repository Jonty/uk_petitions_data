        "additional_details": "Boris Johnson needs to rectify this injustice now.  People are willing to die for this cause, as witnessed on the news.  If the government can spend billions on nuclear weapons, and tax breaks for the rich, Giving a full pension to the Gurkhas, should not be a problem.",
        "background": "The Government should give the Gurkhas the same amount of pension as the British army.  The Gurkhas have fought for Britain, without hesitation or thought for their own safety.  They are respected throughout the world, for their bravery.  Not to give them a proper pension, is unforgivable.",
