        "additional_details": "Members of Parliament already earn a full time wage and this doesn\u2019t take into account all the extras they can claim for, when not in Parliament the MP should be doing Constituancy work.  This should mean an MP has no time to hold down a second job, which as many know is often paid work for either being a figurehead for a company, or acting as a lobbyist.  If an MP has time do do a proper second job he is NOT doing his primary job as a Member of Parliament to the level it should be done.",
