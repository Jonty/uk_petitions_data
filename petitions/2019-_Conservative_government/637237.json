        "action": "Grant type approval exemptions for vehicles that have ceased production.",
        "additional_details": "Many serviceable vehicles are scrapped at great cost to their owners and the environment because certain type approved model specific parts are no longer available new E.g. Air-bags, catalytic converters, headlamp units. The list of parts potentially includes every vehicle component either as individual parts or as assemblies. Owners should have the freedom of choice to repair their older vehicle with alternative components or component removal that would still enable the vehicle to pass an MOT.",
        "background": "Many vehicle manufacturers produce vehicles with components that are unique to that model. When the vehicle ceases production, manufacturing of model specific parts often ceases too. The legal requirement to remain type approved should end when production ends. This would avoid premature scrapping.",
