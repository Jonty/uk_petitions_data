        "action": "Make teaching of age-appropriate sex education compulsory from Year 6",
        "additional_details": "Sex education is not compulsory at primary school. Nowadays, many children are exposed to sexually explicit material before they start secondary school. The BBFC stating that over half of 11-13 year old have watched pornography. Therefore we should be educating our children before they are affected by the ideas of unhealthy and fake relationships shown online. I propose that ideas of consent and safe sex should be taught from Year 6 (ages 10-11) in England.",
        "background": "According to Rape Crisis 5 million women have been raped or sexually assaulted since the age of 16 in the UK. One way to help prevent these events is to educate children from a younger age. Mandatory education of sexual relations, focusing on consent, from Year 6, could help solve this issue.",
