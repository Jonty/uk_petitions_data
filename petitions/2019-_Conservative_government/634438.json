        "additional_details": "It is our belief that defibrillators should be commonplace and readily available. About 95% of people who suffer a Cardiac Arrest will die before reaching the hospital and 30,000 people this year will have a Cardiac Arrest. Communities and charities throughout the country work extremely hard to raise funds to buy defibrillators.  Why does the government make it harder by charging VAT.  Help us to get more life saving defibrillators available to the general public. Stop charging VAT.",
        "background": "Less than 1 in 10 people in the UK survive an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. We believe there aren\u2019t enough public access defibrillators available 24/7.  Having one available in an emergency can be life saving, especially in areas where ambulance response times are longer.  Please stop charging VAT",
