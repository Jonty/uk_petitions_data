        "additional_details": "Currently year 9 and 10 have not been informed whether they will be sitting their exams or not. This means they don't know whether they should be revising or not, when if they could be spending it on core subjects it would be more beneficial. This promotes stress and a negative mindset towards the subjects if they don't know whether they will be able to share their knowledge through an exam. Alongside this, it is a major disadvantage as they will not have been taught the subject in a long time.",
        "background": "Would like for a decision to be made on whether or not year 10 or year 9 examinations have been cancelled. There is uncertainty and students are left confused whether they should be revising or not.",
