        "additional_details": "I have many friends and family who are currently separated from seeing family members as they are on the \"front-lines\" fighting the COVID-19 virus. They are putting their own lives at risk for everyone else, in much the same way as a soldier or member of the armed forces. This virus will leave families without mothers and fathers, not as a result of coincidence but as a result of concerted effort to save the lives of others. We need to recognise this - not just with claps, but financial support.",
        "background": "The COVID-19 epidemic is unprecedented. Everyone is feeling the strain of it, but it is our healthcare workers that are really the ones fighting the front lines. This is no different from a global world-war, and we should not just recognise our NHS workers with claps, but pay increases and a bonus.",
