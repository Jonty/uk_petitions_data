        "additional_details": "However, uni students have been overlooked once again. We have limited access to resources, with all learning being remote. Though, it may be argued we are receiving high quality teaching online. This is far from reality, online teaching is not of the same quality as face to face teaching. If this is the case why has university teaching not always been online. We demand to be considered for a change. It is neither just or ethical to pay a fee of \u00a39250 for disrupted learning.",
        "background": "The government should reconsider reducing university fees. After a third national lockdown many uni students feel abandoned. We are still expected to produce the same high quality work despite receiving  a fraction of the help. All other sectors of education have been considered.",
