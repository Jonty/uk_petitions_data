        "additional_details": "Reports have been surfaced that the UK Govt is trying to abandon reforms to the Gender Recognition Act making it easier for trans people to legally change their gender. Trans people shouldn\u2019t have to prove their gender to a doctor. They also shouldn\u2019t  be waiting years to be seen at a gender clinic. Additionally, children under 18 are having to undergo the wrong puberty which makes later transition more difficult. Pubescent children should have access to hormone blockers (a reversible treatment)",
        "background": "Trans people deserve more than the bare minimum. Doctors shouldn\u2019t be able to choose if a person can legally change their gender. Additionally, reforms are also needed for medical support, so people aren\u2019t waiting years to be seen and access to gender therapy and reversible treatments for under 18s.",
