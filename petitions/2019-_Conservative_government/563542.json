        "additional_details": "A recent survey found that approximately 1 in 29 children suffer the loss of a parent or sibling, which equates to roughly 1 child per class. Growing up with the pressures of school and society is difficult enough for children, but the addition of grief can make it an even tougher process - leading to mental health struggles and behavioural issues. This is why it is vital for schools to help children to process the emotions that follow the impact of loss.",
        "background": "Losing a parent myself, I am aware of the emotional struggle of grief. As a trainee teacher, I have also seen the impact that grief can have on children's overall school experience. I am petitioning for the Department for Education to introduce a policy to help children through bereavement.",
