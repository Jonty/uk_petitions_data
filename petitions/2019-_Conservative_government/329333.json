        "additional_details": "Continuous Assessment throughout year 11 to allow students to get the best results after an unprecedented disruption to their education.\r\nAlthough students have been maintaining a level of work through remote learning this is no substitute for content covered in a classroom and will leave gaps in most students knowledge. \r\nThis will lead to increased pressure and stress for students worried that they will not have knowledge to complete exams.",
        "background": "Year 10 students have missed 4 months of teaching time which will drastically impact on knowledge of content for exam in summer 2021, Year 11 is already a stressful and pressured time for young adults in normal circumstances without expectations that they need to also catch up on missed content",
