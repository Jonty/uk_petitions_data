        "additional_details": "A complete ban on conversion therapy is vital to protect the mental health and human rights of transgender people. Conversion therapy is a practice aimed at changing someone\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity. This harmful practice lacks scientific basis, promotes stigma, and leads to significant psychological distress. A comprehensive ban supports inclusivity and student well-being in university environments, reinforcing the UK\u2019s commitment to equality and human dignity for all.",
        "background": "Eradicate the 'coerced' requirement and fully ban all trans conversion therapy, closing legal loopholes to safeguard transgender rights and mental health more effectively.",
