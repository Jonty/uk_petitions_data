Then other key workers such as supermarket staff may get a night shift that they can\u2019t get a lift to due to mental health public transport is a no and walking in the dark is a danger! Any key worker/ essential worker this is a key part to work",

In the first lockdown key workers were still allowed so I think they should bring that back ASAP!",
