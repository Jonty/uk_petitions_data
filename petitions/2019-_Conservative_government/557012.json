This seems an illogical choice considering the second wave of the virus coincided with schools/colleges reopening. Whilst we value the importance of children's education, surely the lives and health of our nation should take priority.",
        "background": "In the event of a second nationwide lockdown, it is our belief that to reduce the spread of covid 19 to the lowest possible factor, all schools and colleges must be closed and children should be home schooled. As parents it is our first hand experience that children will spread the virus.",
