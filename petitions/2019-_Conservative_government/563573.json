        "additional_details": "This long term investment in education could benefit those that have medical conditions, long term illness, student\u2019s suffering bullying and older students to improve their education. We cannot delay to see more loss of life before the government looks to take action into alternatives. This investment will help people avoid losing out on their education and save many lives. The Covid 19 pandemic has shown that changes need to be implemented urgently, the government needs to make this a priority.",

This will help prepare for any future pandemics due to the impact on those affected by Covid-19 including pupils, teachers and family members and the number of lives lost",
