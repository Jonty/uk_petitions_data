        "additional_details": "We believe that confidence between the public and those in public office and the public sector has been damaged and that this ban would help to restore confidence, trust and integrity in those who hold public office or work on behalf of the public. It would help to show credibility and openness in our institutions and would respect the people of this country.\r\n \r\nWe think this ban would also help to ensure that, in any future national crisis, those working in public office or the public sector will follow the government\u2019s rules, rather than dismiss them.\r\n",
        "background": "We want the Government to ban any public servant, who has been found to have broken COVID rules, from holding public office or a position in the public sector. We want this ban to last for life and we want this ban to include MPs, civil servants and everyone employed through the public purse.",
