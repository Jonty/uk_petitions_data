        "action": "Ban Ofsted inspections until Covid is truly over.",
        "additional_details": "School staff are humans too. They worked throughout the pandemic, whilst Ofsted did not. Not only is Covid still very real, causing staff to have time off but now the Omicrom variant is about to add more pressure. Not only are Teachers having time off, headteachers of decades are quitting due to Ofsted. Finally, children need time to catch up and recover and learn to be in a school environment. Ofsted are so detached from schools, they need a full inspection themselves before being allowed back.",
        "background": "The government have given Ofsted money to ramp up inspections. However, due to Covid there is already an enormous amount of pressure on teachers to catch children up. Countless teachers and headteachers are now suffering with their mental health. Ofsted offered no support during Covid.",
