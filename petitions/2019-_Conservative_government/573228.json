This is a real opportunity to at least help the mental and physical recovery of many of those affected. Bee inspired, do something different. Reverse this ridiculous legislation and do your bit to save the bees and the United Kingdom.",

Importing bees is a vital part of future beekeeping.\r\n\r\nPest & diseases come in all shapes and sizes. You have the chance to stop the losses and allow imports to continue.",
