This would increase monthly net income in order to live.\r\n\r\nSomeone earing \u00a324k a year will pay over \u00a3300 a month in tax and National Insurance, which is a drastic amount for am individual already struggling. Incomes are not matching the cost of living crisis that is taking place, and the Government must do more to support people on low incomes.",
        "background": "We would like the Government to rethink income tax and National Insurance thresholds. The cost of living is rising and becoming a crisis. More and more people are struggling to provide for their families. The Government should remove income tax and NI for those earning under \u00a324k a year.",
