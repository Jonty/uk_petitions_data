        "additional_details": "As a mum of 3 boys, I love to take my boys to the park. However on occasions we will now avoid parks. My youngest son has Cerebral Palsy, Epilepsy and is Registered Blind. He loves to be swung high, to go down fast slides and loves to be included. More importantly he deserves and has a right to access our local parks.\r\n \r\nHowever now my son is aged 7, it has become more apparent the lack play equipment for him. There is equipment out there and change can and needs to happen. A Government fund could help achieve this.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to recognise the importance of ensuring that all play parks are inclusive by design. Council's need funding to bring about change and to be able to install accessible equipment. Without funding it will take many, many years for change to happen.",
