At this age young people are becoming more independent, taking driving lessons, and having to pay increased prices on public transport. Young people aged 16-17 are entitled to a minimum wage of \u00a34.81 but 18-year-olds are entitled to at least \u00a36.83. Increasing the minimum wage for 16-17 year olds could encourage young people to seek out employment.",
