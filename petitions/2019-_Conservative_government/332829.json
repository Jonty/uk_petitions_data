This is permanent. Currently someone falsely accused of a crime can apply to the National Records Deletion Unit to have their Police National Computer (PNC) records deleted, but there is no guarantee they will be successful. All PNC and Police National Database (PND) records should be automatically expunged for victims of false allegations or arrest where no charges are filed.",
