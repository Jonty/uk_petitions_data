        "additional_details": "1. DFID vets all giving assiduously.  It is NOT a \"giant cashpoint in the sky.\"\r\n\r\n2. Overseas aid is not to promote our national interests, it is to promote the interests of the poorest and deprived.\r\n\r\n3. It expresses British values: generosity, compassion, concern, and more.\r\n\r\n4. Our diplomatic, political and commercial intersts are served by the Foreign Office and by various trade ministries.  That is not the purpose of DFID, and never should be.",
        "background": "Keep the Department For International Development independent of the Foreign Ofiice.  The aims of the two departments are complimentary but not identical.  The proposed merger signals that we will help others in the world only if there's \"something in it for us\".",
