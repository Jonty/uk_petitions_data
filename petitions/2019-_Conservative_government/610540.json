        "additional_details": "Currently thousands of children cannot study their chosen sport as part of GCSE or A Level PE, as their chosen sport is not on these lists. This gives them two options - 1) choose a different GCSE or 2) study PE but choose another activity. This gives their peers who already undertake activities that are on these lists a massive advantage. It can also mean that young people drop out of martial arts at this age.",
