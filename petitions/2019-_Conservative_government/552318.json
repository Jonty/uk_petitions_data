        "additional_details": "For most Universities across the UK lectures will be online for the foreseeable future due to the current Covid-19 climate. Although the Coronavirus situation is out of the Government's control, the price of the tuition fees is. \r\n\r\nThere is a common consensus amongst students that online teaching is inadequate when the price of a degree is \u00a39,250 per year. For many students, practical work is a vital part of their degree but this cannot be carried out. \r\n\r\nStand with us and support students during this difficult time.",
