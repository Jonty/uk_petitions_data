        "additional_details": "Because patients who get admitted to CAHMS inpatient services often come out with more trauma, it is a very inhumane environment and many units have a lack of care and lack of safety when it comes to looking after their patients. People loose there lives because of lack of training. Patients who are discharged struggle with PTSD and flashbacks and nightmares after being in these places. Not all of them are bad, but the majority are. And they need more funding in order to make it a safe and caring environment.",
        "background": "Make sure that patients have access to the right care when inpatient in UK CAMHS mental health wards, more training, more awareness and more care for young people in mental health hospital facilities. More staff, more care, more treatments.",
