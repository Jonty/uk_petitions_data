        "additional_details": "Some people may have to wait weeks until they are due to be paid again and have little to no food left. Being paid weekly will allow those who have to isolate in the upcoming weeks the chance to be able to get the most basic essentials in. If the public is able to access their money more often it will slow down the panic buying and also allow parents  to be able to feed their children. As some rely on schools to do this.",

People are bulk buying when they are getting paid monthly due to FEAR that the food will sell out. \r\nThis may give the most vulnerable and those who have to isolate the chance to get a small stock of food.",
