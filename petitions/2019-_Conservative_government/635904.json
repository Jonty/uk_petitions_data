The UK has the authority to reject them under Article 61 of the IHR, but any such rejection must be within 18 months of their adoption.\r\n \r\nParliament must be given the opportunity to vote on whether to reject the amendments that have already been adopted, and also the 307 proposed amendments that are currently being negotiated by the UK delegates to the 76th World Health Assembly. The UK has not proposed any of the 307 amendments.\r\n",
