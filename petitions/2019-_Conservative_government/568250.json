        "additional_details": "This \u2018medieval anomaly\u2019 is outdated and offensive. The fact that there is any possibility of being forced to pay any amount of money towards a Church, particularly one to which you do not belong to, is archaic and counterproductive towards the accepting and equal society that we should be striving for. Although insurance for this is cheap, as such an event is \u2018uncommon\u2019, the mere fact that this is a possibility should be rescinded. All religions, and lack thereof, should be treated equally.",
        "background": "Eradicate the need of Chancel Repair Liability Insurance, and the potential to be called upon and forced to pay money towards the repair of a Church simply because you live within a certain area. Payment towards such things should be a choice, not a legal necessity.",
