        "additional_details": "MPs, rightly, claim expenses related to working within constituency, and London. They have equipment that could be re-purposed for working from home, as businesses had to. Why should they be allowed an additional \u00a310k to enable working from home?\r\nThis is a complete waste of public funds and MPs should debate how this could be better spend supporting front-line staff, key workers, those in financial need or small businesses.\r\nhttps://bit.ly/2JRECdD",
        "background": "The limits regarding the (much welcomed) furlough, and other support for businesses leaves many people at risk of serious financial suffering. It is therefore abhorrent and inconsistent with the public for MPs to be offered an additional \u00a310k of expenses to work from home.",
