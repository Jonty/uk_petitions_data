        "additional_details": "At present this is a mess. Some services can take O/S grid reference and some cannot. Some can accept numeric easting/northings. Some can accept GPS WGS84 latitude/longitude. But there is no common standard that they must all accept. We have a long standing national mapping reference system - Ordnance Survey grid reference. Insisting all services can handle this creates a safety net. Obviously accepting other options as well makes sense, but let's set a minimum requirement.",
        "background": "At present emergency services can handle various location references, but it is not consistent, so it is not clear what system a person needs. It would be good to have a minimum requirement to accept locations using the existing standard national mapping reference system (Ordnance Survey).",
