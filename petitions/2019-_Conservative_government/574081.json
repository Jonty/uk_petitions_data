        "additional_details": "The UK hospitality sector's turnover fell by \u00a372 billion last year, equivalent to nearly \u00a3200m a day in lost sales for businesses. Operators would not have survived without the rent moratorium. Having not traded for almost a year, many will now fail if they have to pay back even half the rent they owe, when the moratorium is lifted! The government must  #givehospitalityabreak, and extend the moratorium, by three months. Businesses will need up to two year years to pay off half the rent they owe!",
        "background": "The government must extend the rent moratorium for another three months and legislate to allow tenants to repay half of the rent owed for 2 years. This will mean we can avoid mass liquidations when the moratorium ends. We need the government to #givehospitalityabreak!",
