Is that not insane?\r\n\r\nAverage London home is 14 times salary, unaffordable for most. Average new build is 700 sq ft, smallest in Europe, one quarter the size in the US/Denmark. In 1920 UK homes were twice the size. Persimmons \u00a31.1 billion profit, and 3x profit margins (compared to other countries) for matchboxes in an artificially inflated market.",

Use all that revenue for new house building. \r\n\r\n3. Rent controls in London like US\r\n\r\n4. Require a minimum room/unit standards.",
