        "additional_details": "Children have no place in war, they are completely innocent in this conflict. Whilst it is unlkely President Putin will agree to this request, it is a non aggressive and very reasonable humanitarian move. It has no ramifications to the Russian people and it would show Putin's true colours to those who would support him if he were to publicly deny this request. Children have a right to be protected by the world.",
        "background": "The UN has the capability to petition Russia for  a temporary ceasefire to allow children, accompanied by one parent, to be safely ecavuated from the war zone. The UN also has the resources to assist in undertaking evacuation. \r\nWe ask the UK Government to approach the UN with this proposal.",
