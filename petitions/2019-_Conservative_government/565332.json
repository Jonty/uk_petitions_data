        "additional_details": "Social care workers are expected to support people who may need assistance of varying degrees with activities of daily living. They are not nurses and aren\u2019t specifically trained to look after acutely unwell residents. With outbreaks of Covid-19 in care and residential homes, all staff were expected to adjust their role accordingly. Contracted staff are being thanked for this however agency workers, many of whom worked alongside doing the exact same job, are not eligible.",
        "background": "Currently all health and social care staff including NHS, students and support workers are eligible for the \u00a3500 bonus payment. However, this does not extend to agency workers despite many of them working long hours in high risk environments to cover staff shortages and help keep care homes afloat.",
