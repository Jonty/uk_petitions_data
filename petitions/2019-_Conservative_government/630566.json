        "additional_details": "Defamation law only protects those that can afford to take legal action. However, too many people are becoming victims of false statements being made about them - particularly online where there is a wide audience. These actions can have detrimental impacts on an individual's life: from ruined reputations, job losses and mental health issues. Expanding legal aid to cover defamation cases could help protect people from defamation.",
        "background": "Legal aid is currently not available for defamation cases. This means that people, who may not have a large income, can have their reputations and lives ruined by false statements made about them, and be unable to afford recourse. The Government needs to expand legal aid to help prevent injustice.",
