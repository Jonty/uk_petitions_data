        "additional_details": "We believe the global economy is not in a position \u2013 technologically or ethically - to wean itself from fossil fuels in the time scale required to meet our net zero targets. So, we need to stop global warming before we stop using fossil fuels. We can do this by making fossil fuel firms clean up the carbon footprint of their products.\r\nAs students, we call upon Parliament to act swiftly on this in the interests of not just the young but everyone.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.carbon-balance.earth/ctbo-explained",
        "background": "Parliament should pass a law that imposes carbon takeback obligations (CTBOs) upon all producers of fossil fuels. Starting from a low base \u2013 say 10% by 2030 - these CTBOs should increase over time. All new fossil fuel production licenses should have 100% CTBOs integrated into them.",
