The route offers international students \u2013 who pay a premium at UK universities \u2013 work experience, connections in the UK workplace & a chance to mitigate study costs\r\n \r\n2. It helps to keep UK higher education competitive in a global market. Without it, we believe that many universities \u2013 which rely on international fees would risk going into the red\r\n \r\n3. Employers & economy: it's been estimated that the economic benefit of international students to the UK is \u00a341.9 billion and the route offers employers access to talented graduates\r\n",
