        "additional_details": "For many students, their student loan does not cover living costs, so they work part-time. This year this has not been possible. Families that previously supported their children financially are facing financial uncertainty and for many on furlough, 20% less income. Not only are university students unable to get part-time employment but they are missing out on furlough. Now on top of this students are expected to continue to pay rent on accommodation that they are not allowed to return to.",
        "background": "University students are asking for much-needed support, support that the rest of the country receives while we receive nothing. We are asking for this support in the form of refunds in rent as it is not our decision to not return to the rooms that we are paying for.",
