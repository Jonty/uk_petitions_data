        "additional_details": "This system has been successfully implemented in other countries and is highly relied upon by their citizens for warnings and alerts. This has been previously successfully tested in the UK so why is it not implemented. It would save time and money on other services due to only 4% of the UK households not owning a mobile (2019). This service would be crucial for location based alerts regarding health, weather, terrorism and many other global issues we all have to experience in the UK",

The UK is a developed Western Country and lacks in this key service to countries such as Taiwan, Peru and Romania - i.e. Corona warnings",
