        "background": "We are starting a campaign to discourage 'NFA' being used, as a definitive outcome, by Police and Local Authorities.\r\n\r\nWe are asking that when a young person makes a disclosure relating to a past \u2018NFA\u2019 investigation, that this be re-opened and re analysed with any new evidence.",
