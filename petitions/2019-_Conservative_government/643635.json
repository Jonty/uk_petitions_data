        "additional_details": "It\u2019s unfair to use these dogs as a scape goat. It\u2019s humans that are the problem. The dogs are large, strong and quick which makes them a risk in the wrong hands. But that is not the dogs fault. You wouldn\u2019t drive a car without lessons because it would pose a risk. So you have lessons and have to pass a test. Why can\u2019t we do that with certain dog ownership? If these are banned, the irresponsible owners will just turn to another breed.",
        "background": "Instead of banning a breed for which many are nice, loving dogs, we should bring in measures to help reduce the risk. Licenses for owners, mandatory training, regulation around breeding. These dogs aren\u2019t bad, but they can be dangerous in the wrong hands.",
