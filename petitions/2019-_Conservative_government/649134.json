An understanding of legislation can be of limited help if one doesn't have access to precedent through which to interpret it. Therefore, keeping a record of this nation's legislation without also keeping a similar archive of important cases that have shaped said legislation, means that those with less legal experience may only be looking at half of the law. A corresponding case archive would help those without legal knowledge.\r\n\r\n",
