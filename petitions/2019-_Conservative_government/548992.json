        "additional_details": "Recent research appears to show secondary aged pupils spread the virus like adults. I appreciate it is important for children to be in full time education however with schools being advised that social distancing of pupils is not necessary I worry that with many older pupils (Year 10/11) in bubbles of 200-250 they could cause local outbreaks of Covid-19. We hope secondary pupils will not suffer badly from this virus, however they could pass it onto vulnerable family members and elderly relatives",
        "background": "The government should offer all secondary aged pupils and school staff a weekly COVID-19 test, ideally the less intrusive, lower cost saliva test.",
