        "additional_details": "The English people have maintained a continuous presence, culture, and social structure in the land for millennia, evidencing a deep-rooted connection to their ancestral territories. Their unique linguistic, ethnic and historical identity aligns with the UN criteria for indigenous peoples, emphasising the need for their recognition to preserve this English heritage. Formal recognition supports the right to self-identification. The English are already a minority in at least 80 UK constituencies.",
        "background": "We call for the formal recognition of the English people as an indigenous native population. Create a legal framework to safeguard their interests, acknowledging the historical, cultural, and social uniqueness of the English as original inhabitants with strong and enduring links to Great Britain.",
