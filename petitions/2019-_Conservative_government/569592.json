        "additional_details": "Considering the 6 months of quarantine last year we have lost the motivation to do anything which has affected us a lot mentally. Remote learning hasn't been very effective due to lack of internet, resources(laptops/phones etc.) and lack of face to face lessons. We would be given the opportunity to improve the grades from now on. Therefore, having exams would not be fair to all students. So, we believe having any sorts of assessments will be unfavorable to the results of the students.",
        "background": "We believe the government should go easy on us and cancel any type of tests this summer and grade us based on weekly assignments or homework submissions.",
