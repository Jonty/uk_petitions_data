        "action": "Keep the ban on the use of the neonicotinoid 'Cruiser SB' pesticide in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Neonicotinoid pesticides are proven to cause severe harm to bees and other pollinators. The government promised to keep the ban of this pesticide after leaving the EU unless there was change in the evidence of its harmful effects. There has been no such evidence. Bees and other insects pollinate many of our plants including the crops that we eat as well as performing other vital ecosystem services. We need urgent action to safeguard and boost their populations, NOT cause further declines.",
        "background": "The government should not allow the use of the bee-killing pesticide 'Cruiser SB' in the UK and keep the ban of its use now that we are no longer part of the EU.",
