        "additional_details": "Many children, as young as 12-13 years, are attracted to vaping, when ordinarily they would not have considered smoking cigarettes. Vaping products, including those illegal in the UK, seem to be readily available. My local garage has brightly coloured vaping products in a basket for \u00a32.00. Vaping is a pandemic, the medium- and long-term effects of which, are yet to be known",
        "background": "Confront the producers of vaping products and stop them from marketing their products to target children and young people by advertising flavours and packaging designs that appeal to non-smoking children. Make producers change to plain packaging, with health warning like cigarettes. Must have age ID",
