        "additional_details": "It is really important for children of all ages to start knowing the truth about grief. And why it happens, and why people feel grief and how. \r\nLosing someone happens to everyone in this world yet no one really knows how to deal with that emotion. People around them don\u2019t know either so can\u2019t offer help. Grief isn\u2019t talked about enough and it\u2019s a taboo subject when death happens. It shouldn\u2019t be an awkward subject yet it is because not a lot of people know how to handle it.",
        "background": "I want you to make it essential that all schools, primary and secondary touch on the subject of grief. Whether it be made into a whole subject category or a topic every one learns about. It\u2019s important to incorporate it into mental health. And to learn about death and grief.",
