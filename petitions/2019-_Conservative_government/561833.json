        "additional_details": "Many of us were looking forward to a new GPU for our pcs or a new console to wile away the hours during this pandemic. However, not many of these have seen the light of day. A trip to Ebay for a new GPU, PS5 or Xbox will see confirmed pre-orders, not even the device, listed for thousands. Due to this infrastructure being allowed to mature in the clothing market organisations have easily been able to acquire hundreds of devices that were very limited in number and high in demand.",
        "background": "I would like the government to shut down these scalpers, using the unlimited fine as they see fit, releasing these lost devices to the market once more. GPUs, nextgen consoles all of which were supposed to bring joy to those stuck at home, hardly any of these have ended up in the hands of consumers.",
