        "additional_details": "Rents are high in the UK, and rentees overpay to keep the roof over their heads, often for years. Yet they struggle to save the initial deposit to buy the property. The requirement to save 10% of the rent as the deposit will help rentees to get on the property ladder. The money can be used by local authorities, and building co-ops as a secured bond  to build houses - this will act as a stabilising factor to house prices in long run, and generate revenue stream to boost deposit savings.",
        "background": "10% of each rent will be saved on deposit scheme that will let to use their saved money to buy a property. As the rents are regulated by free-market, the deposit will be funded partly by rentee, by landlord, and as deduction in income tax paid by landlord = initial deposit to buy a house.",
