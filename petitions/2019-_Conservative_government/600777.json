        "additional_details": "Extending the current ban on the amount of microplastics used in our products should have many benefits: It should reduce the amount of virgin plastic being produced, reduce plastic pollution in our oceans and other ecosystems, reduce the adverse health effects microplastics can have on humans and animals, and incentivise research into plastic free/ bioplastic alternatives. Reducing dependence on plastics and protecting marine ecosystems could also help the UK reach its net zero carbon targets.",
        "background": "To reduce plastic pollution and encourage businesses to produce greener products I would like the Government to extend the ban on the use of plastic microbeads to include leave-on cosmetic products, and also ban the use of microplastic emulsifiers.",
