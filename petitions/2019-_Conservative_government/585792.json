This could in turn have great effect on the populations of urban insects and mammals thus helping with wildlife right up the food chain.\r\n\r\nI am very concerned about the state of urban greenspace. Though there are many wonderful designated greenspaces in urban areas there needs to be more focus on using all available land. For instance, the reduction of mowing on grass areas that do not need to be kept short would have a big impact. It would promote the growing of small wildflower and grassland areas all over urban areas. These would act as habitat and as migration routes for all manner of invertebrates and small mammals.",
