        "additional_details": "The law Needs to be changed so that any person involved in a serious or fatal accident has to stop and stay at scene and report straight away to help the injured on the road or they revive the maximum sentence for life for leaving a person to die on road. \r\n\r\nAt present the British law acts as an incentive for law braking drivers to flee the scene of the kill someone. I want the sentence to be a deterrent from other drivers doing this and maybe we will be able to save lives on the road",
        "background": "The law allows someone who is involved is a serious or fatal car crash to leave the scene, and report the accident later.  \r\n\r\nI would like people who are involved in fatal accidents and drive off, leaving the victim injured or dead to receive life sentences to stop them driving off",
