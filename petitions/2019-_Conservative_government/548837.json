I want the sentence to be a deterrent from other drivers doing this and maybe we will be able to save lives on the road",
        "background": "The law allows someone who is involved is a serious or fatal car crash to leave the scene, and report the accident later.  \r\n\r\nI would like people who are involved in fatal accidents and drive off, leaving the victim injured or dead to receive life sentences to stop them driving off",
