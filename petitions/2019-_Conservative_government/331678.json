        "additional_details": "I would like our elderly to get free TV Licences because they have worked all of their lives and also our elderly don\u2019t receive much money with their pension so we need to look after them so they can put their money towards important essentials like food, bills etc. Within these hard times due to the Coronavirus elderly people are needing to self isolate and the only form of company is their TV.",
        "background": "Our elderly people should be allowed to have entertainment in their homes since a lot of elderly suffer from Mental Health problems and some are also vulnerable and can\u2019t get out.",
