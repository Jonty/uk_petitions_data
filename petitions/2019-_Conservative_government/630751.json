        "additional_details": "In 2003 fur farming was banned in the UK. Through EU laws, trade in cat, dog and seal fur has also been banned. Powers in the Retained EU Law Bill may mean Government could repeal existing fur trade bans with little or no influence from Parliament, when it should be extending them to all animals. A 2022 poll shows 77% of Brits believe Government should ban fur imports. \r\nThe UK imports fur from millions of animals annually. If it\u2019s too cruel to produce here, it should be too cruel to sell here.",
        "background": "The Government must commit to keep vital bans on imports of cat, dog and seal furs, and extend legislation to ban the import and sale of fur from all species. The UK banned fur farming because it is so cruel, we must stop importing that same cruelty.",
