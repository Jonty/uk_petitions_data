To back this up. Figures have shown since the uk was locked down Londons Covid19 cases have still risen where other have gone down. Yet London is in a tier lower than areas with a reduction in cases.",
        "background": "The UK public have a right to request that a new general election take place. This is due to the current incompetence of the handling of the Covid19 pandemic and the local lockdown measures in place which do not match up to the figures of cases displayed on their own website.",
