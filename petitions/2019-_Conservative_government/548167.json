        "additional_details": "It is apparent that the process used has not been fair on a large number of students and the grades awarded do not reflect either the CAGs or the students true potential.\r\n\r\nNo student should be awarded a U for an exam they did not sit.  Nor should their grades be suppressed by an algorithm.  The failure to use CAGs demonstrates a lack of trust towards the profession and has resulted in great inequality.\r\n\r\nNo student should be disadvantaged as a consequence of an ineffective process .",
        "background": "We want the DFE and Awarding Bodies to use the Center Assessed Grades provided by educational settings to award both A-Level and GCSE grades to students.  The use of mock grades is not appropriate and the CAGs represent a well informed and secure measure of student ability.",
