        "additional_details": "We want VAT zero on battery systems used with renewable energy generation, for home or business use, regardless of when this is installed.\r\n\r\nRenewable energy promotion is part of UK Government strategy.\r\n\r\nMany homes and small businesses have on-site renewable electricity generation, such as Solar Photovoltaic or Wind turbine.\r\n\r\nAt the time of writing, if a property owner orders a renewable energy system with simultaneous installation of a battery, this is NOT liable to VAT. Retrospective addition of a battery is currently liable to VAT.\r\nFor many system owners, the battery option may not have been available at time of install. The current difference in tax liability is unjust.",
