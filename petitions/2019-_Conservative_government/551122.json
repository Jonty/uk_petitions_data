'The government should review how primary schools assess and provide support for children with dyslexia, (as delays in primary school) can have a substantial and long-term negative effect on children, with a view to establishing a clear process for all primary school children. Parents should not be left alone with this, children with dyslexia need to be assessed and a qualified dyslexia teacher appointed to monitor them.",
        "background": "Schools are failing kids with dyslexia by refusing to acknowledge it or fund support. Parents are having to pay for private assessments to help their child progress. Kids are getting behind and not receiving sufficient support. Even when diagnosed teachers often don\u2019t know what support to provide.",
