        "additional_details": "700 pm is equivalent to paying back a mortgage. Most young professionals in London earn an average of 20k to 25k. Also these house shares tend to have 6-8 people living together which is a lot considering the price. I've looked at spareroom recently and people are trying to charge 800pm for a mon to friday let. This is not acceptable. How are young people expected to buy a property if landlords are charging this much for houses that have not been renovated since the 1990s.",
        "background": "Put a Maximum cap on rooms to rent in a house share in London. Single rooms have increased to a minimum of \u00a3700 pm since 2019 and with no improvement of standards.",
