        "additional_details": "Given the damage she caused to the UK and the economic panic that was a direct result of her policies, it is not suitable that she is allowed to reward anyone who helped her in to office as Prime minister. \r\nThe aim of this petition is to allow members of the public to prevent Liz Truss from having the luxury of adding anyone to the House of Lords. It is not deserved and should not be allowed.",
        "background": "Former Prime minister Liz Truss only served as a Prime Minister for roughly 7 weeks. Her short leadership was marred by an economic crisis and government crisis, caused in part by Truss's mini-budget for the United Kingdom.",
