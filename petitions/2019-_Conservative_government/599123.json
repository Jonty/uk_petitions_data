        "action": "Ensure corona vaccines administered abroad are fully recognised by NHS",
        "additional_details": "At present the NHS only recognises Corona vaccines administered in the UK and as a result those whom have had the vaccine abroad are subject to different isolation rules. This is inexcusable given that the information is electronic and can easily be verified and updated on their system. Not doing so is \r\nboth descriminatory and is impacting many UK citizens lives. Ensuring this is done will help the economy by reducing the people needlessly having to self isolate upon being a COVID contact.",
