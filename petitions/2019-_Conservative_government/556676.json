        "additional_details": "This year's cohort have been badly let down by the CAG's, and the right to appeal their grades was obstructed by the Government. Students taking exams this autumn have to play catch up, at their own and their parent\u2019s expense, which has taken its toll on their mental health. Perhaps the government could ease their relentless anxiety by bringing forward the results days?",
        "background": "Many students have not been in education for almost 7 months. Parents have been footing the tutor bill as catch-up classes failed to materialise. Some students may need to do resits. Are parents expected to carry on paying for lessons until January to prevent any loss of learning?",
