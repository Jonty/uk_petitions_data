It should be a high priority to ensure they are healthy. Other petitions are dealing with providing safety equipment and testing for NHS staff, but many, who are exhausted from their supremely difficult work, need help accessing food now.  In our massive gratitude to them we have to push for them to have direct access to food so they can rest and eat off shift.",
        "background": "The amazing NHS staff are risking their lives each day but many cannot buy food for themselves due to working long anti-social hours and the empty shelves caused by stockpiling. The government need to start direct distribution outside healthcare facilities to help keep NHS staff fed and healthy.",
