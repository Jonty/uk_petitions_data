        "additional_details": "Right now schools do not have to inform parents or carers if their child is in an afterschool detention. This is wrong, some students walk to school and especially during winter when its dark early their parent has no idea where they are. This is also leading to wasted journeys to collect the child. For safety reasons, it is important that schools inform parents or carers if the child is in detention so someone can either collect them after school or they can be aware their child will be late",
