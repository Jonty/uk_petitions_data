        "additional_details": "Due to the fiasco of the A level grading this year where some people have entered university on centre assessed grades, some people have lost out and are going to have to sit the exam.  This process is completely and utterly unfair for some people that have no choice for this as an option.  Therefore, the grade boundaries need to be lowered, considering any studying now for the exam is independent and not school based; we have been now given less than two months to revise and prepare.",
        "background": "To ensure that the grade boundaries in the autumn term A level exams are lowered considering a global pandemic, school closures and the failure of the Government relating to the A level result catastrophe.",
