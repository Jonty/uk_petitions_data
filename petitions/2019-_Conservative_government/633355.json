        "additional_details": "Farms nationwide are being bought by large corporations who plant trees over entire farms to \"offset\" carbon emissions. This takes valuable land out of production, can increase the price of farmland & put farmers out of business by reducing opportunities to expand or invest. Monoculture plantations (often of non-native species) do not encourage biodiversity. This must be stopped, especially when there is evidence that well-managed grassland and rotational food production can be at least as effective as carbon sinks as trees.",
