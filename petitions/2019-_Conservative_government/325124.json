        "additional_details": "Permissive pathways and public rights of way should be open to all, particularly in places of public interest. Following a dispute with a landowner who recently replaced a gate with a stile, preventing many local people from accessing a pathway to a scheduled CADW monument, we discovered that many people across the UK were experiencing this problem. This has been a particular issue during the Covid-19 outbreak, when UK Governments advise us to exercise on our own doorstep.",
