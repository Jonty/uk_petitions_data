        "action": "Advocate for the immediate reopening of girls' secondary schools in Afghanistan",
        "additional_details": "Beyond the financial impacts of this ban, there are human impacts like the shortage of female teachers, doctors, nurses and other key workers affecting future school attendance, increased adolescent pregnancy, reduced educational attainment, and increased child marriage and infant mortality.\r\n\r\nFailure to achieve fair and equal access for all will inhibit the country\u2019s prosperity, force women to live in the shadows, and cause a further breakdown in the functioning of Afghan society.",
        "background": "In several Afghan provinces, under community pressure, Taliban officials allowed girls\u2019 secondary schools to reopen, but the vast majority of these schools remained closed.\r\n\r\nAs of 27th October 2022, it has been 403 days since the Taliban banned teenager girls from school.",
