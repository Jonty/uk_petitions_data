        "additional_details": "Senior Police leaders know very well what needs to be done to restore faith in our law enforcement officers, and to return real justice and professional standards to our regional constabularies. The appointment of Police & Crime Commissioners, sometimes who have little knowledge or real experience of Police work, was a cynical attempt to convince the general public that voting for their popular choice of candidate would resolve all of their problems. It hasn't. It costs too much. It has failed!",
        "background": "Police Services across the UK are failing. Our streets are unsafe, the vast majority of crime goes un-investigated, and the Police are crying out for more resources. The introduction of so called \"Police and Crime Commissioners\", was a pointless and misguided policy, and must be abandoned.",
