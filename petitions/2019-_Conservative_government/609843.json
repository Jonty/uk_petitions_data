It is important that Ukranians know that they will be able to escape and feel welcome in another country. The UK Government has allegedly stopped accepting visas for Ukranians that wish to seek asylum UNLESS they have British citizens. This is iniquitous and it weakens the message of the UK government that they are supportive of Ukraine in any mean.",
        "background": "The UK Government and Home Office must review their decision to not accept visa applications from Ukranians despite the ongoing crisis in their country. It is not their fault that they feel forced to leave, and it is important that they know that the UK is a safe haven for them to move to.",
