        "additional_details": "The joy of reading is often to allow oneself to escape reality, to relax, to learn and to grow. For those who have experienced trauma (particular of a violent sexual nature) this joy is immediately curtailed by the use of sexual violence as a story telling tool, causing distress that may otherwise have been avoided if a trigger warning were presented at the outset of the story or on the cover. This is not a call for censorship but simple fair warning as is applied to TV, films, games and music.",
        "background": "Enact legislation requiring all UK publishers to include trigger warning on books they publish. This should include (but not be limited to):-\r\n- sexual violence/abuse/rape\r\n- domestic violence\r\n- racial abuse/hatred\r\n- denigration or abuse of people within the LGBTQI+ community",
