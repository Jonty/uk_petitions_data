        "additional_details": "Despite a parliamentary debate on the use of real bearskin hats by the Queen\u2019s Guards over a year ago, nothing has since changed.\r\n \r\nBears continue to be killed and their fur used for caps when a faux fur alternative is already readily available and has even been offered free of taxpayer charge until 2030.\r\n \r\nWe believe that as long as fur is still being imported and sold in the UK, the cruelty will continue.",
