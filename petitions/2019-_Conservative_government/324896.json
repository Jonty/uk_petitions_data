        "additional_details": "I want the Government or Parliament to do this because I think it is important that employers and their employees are educated on what is racism, how it can be reported and handled, what racism looks like and to provide awareness of racism in the workplace. Work forces can be very diverse and it is important that all races are respected and protected while they work. I have personally seen racism within a workplace and the effects it has on the minorities within the environment.",
