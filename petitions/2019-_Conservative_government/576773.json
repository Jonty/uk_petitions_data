        "additional_details": "Due to the risks of this type of biological research, the potentially dire consequences for public health should altered viruses or bacteria escape from a lab, and the potential for weaponisation should the research fall into the wrong hands, this type of research should not be done. Any potential benefits of such research are far outweighed by the risks.\r\nThis petition asks the Government to pass legislation to ban all such research in the UK, and to commit to lobbying for a world-wide ban.",
