Our young people need to understand that it's about a lifestyle, how you carry and conduct yourself and not lip service or just showing up on Sundays for service. I would like the government through parliament to facilitate the redress of this in order to allow clear identity among people the Christian faith which will hugely impact on morals, gang violence and many other crimes.",

I would like to submit a request that the definition as stated in the Oxford and Cambridge dictionaries be revised and changed to reflect the truth of what aligns with the Bible.",
