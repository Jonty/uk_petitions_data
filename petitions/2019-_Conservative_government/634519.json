        "additional_details": "Gambling ads can be seen and effect vulnerable groups and should be banned, even though gambling itself can remain legal for willing participants.\r\n \r\nGambling ads often suggest anyone can get rich, but the main beneficiaries of gambling are the gambling companies.\r\n \r\nWe believe gambling advertising brings no benefit to society; and that it is a malicious tool designed to divert money from those who need it the most, to those who need it the least.\r\n \r\nOther nations such as Italy, Belgium and Singapore and United Arab Emirates have applied similar policies, and we want the UK to follow suit.\r\n \r\n",
