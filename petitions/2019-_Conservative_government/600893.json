        "additional_details": "With the rollout of 5G, AI and smart technology, we now have the ability to set up autonomous drone ports. These could be remotely controlled and allow hedgehogs to be safely flown across the M25 in drones, so that they are unharmed. It is unacceptable that every year thousands of hedgehogs are being squashed on our public roads. They deserve better. Britain should be at the forefront of animal welfare, and this is a safe and green method to enable their secure passage across the M25.",
        "background": "Set up strategically located drone ports, so that hedgehogs can be safely transported across the M25 motorway. Too many hedgehogs are needlessly losing their lives every year as they are killed attempting to cross this busy highway. This must be brought to an immediate end.",

Highways England is responsible for the operation, maintenance and improvement of England's motorways and major A roads, but isn't responsible for transporting wildlife across the road network."
