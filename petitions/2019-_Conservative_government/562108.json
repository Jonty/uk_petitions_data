It\u2019s been a tough challenging year for all, with some not seeing their families. Retail workers have done more than enough to remain open during the pandemic to feed the nation. Give something back to them and require all shops to close on Boxing Day to allow them to spend quality time with their loved ones and let them enjoy their Christmas.",
