Although British slavery is not taught within the education system, citizens of this city are very aware of Liverpool's involvement in the slave trade and are appalled by the glorification and the simultaneously brazen attempts to erase the atrocities these men and this city committed.\r\n\r\nThis is not to erase the city's history but to rather acknowledge it in our systems and not hold these men in such high esteem.",
        "background": "We are asking to change the names of streets in Liverpool which are named after slave traders; Parr Street, Gladstone Road, Sir Thomas Street, and Penny Lane as this is a blatant glorification of these men.",
