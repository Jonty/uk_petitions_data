Feel our children won\u2019t be getting the best education possible. Have been told I don\u2019t have to put this school down as a choice but if I don\u2019t get into those I do put down, my child will be put somewhere there is space; again taking away choice. Lots of concerned parents in the area. Money put into schools doesn\u2019t improve teaching.",
        "background": "Only 1 secondary school in catchment area which has been consistently poor for decades. No good-outstanding school in area. Poor quality of education offered to children in B60 1 area.",
