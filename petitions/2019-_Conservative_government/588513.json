        "additional_details": "The BBC have reported that some young women have received messages of a sexual nature from up to 11 different people in one night, and that 9 in 10 young women have experienced sexist name-calling or were sent explicit photos or videos. Staff should be trained to recognise and challenge these comments, as many members of staff do not know how to communicate with students about this issue. Sexual harassment is degrading and humiliating, and young women should not have to deal with it in school.",
        "background": "The Government should require school staff to be trained in how to tackle sexual harassment, so that they can properly safeguard young women, and deal with unacceptable behaviour. I have witnessed sexual harassment in schools, but school staff have failed to take adequate action.",
