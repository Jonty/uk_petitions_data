As a family, we spend a lot of time going around litter picking, we are keen to protect nature, we want to help protect and keep plastic-free for us and future generations. That\u2019s why we want the Government to think of the environment and stop schools selling single-use plastic water bottles, or giving these to students.\r\n\r\nPlease help us to raise awareness of this issue by signing our petition, and hopefully, the Government will hear our collective voices and consider making a change.",
