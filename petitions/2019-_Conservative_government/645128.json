I am not a pensioner however I see many struggling financially.  Please help make it slightly easier for disabled pensioners on attendance allowance to afford to keep their car by treating them the same as disabled people under pension age. Disabled people should be treated equally regardless of age.",

This in itself is ageist. Whether on DLA/PIP or Attendance Allowance, people should be treated equally & fairly.",
