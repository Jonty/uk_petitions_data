        "additional_details": "We believe this is important as often disabled people have been denied sick pay which means they they often have to work to make a wage to pay bills and other bare minimums \r\n\r\n\u201cI have a disabled pass, because I am not allowed to drive. However l, these do not work before 9:30am which mean that I have to pay for my travel though the city centre which is expensive for people like myself on minimum wage as my job starts at 9am\u201d \r\n\r\nBecuase I cant qualify for other financial benefits to assist with my transport it can often be difficult for me to get to work on a daily basis\r\n\r\nI understand that I\u2019m not the only person who struggles with these challenges that many other disabled people have to deal with on a daily basis",
        "background": "We would like for concession passes and elderly passes to work before half 9 as it is discriminatory that disabled people can not get the bus before 9:30 even though they often have jobs and other important commitments which helps pay for the necessities in life.",
