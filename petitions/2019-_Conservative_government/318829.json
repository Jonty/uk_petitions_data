Im currently stuck in a situation where I don\u2019t have a choice, if I don\u2019t go back we won\u2019t have money to live on, if I do my baby doesn\u2019t have any childcare. This leaves people with only one option and that\u2019s to take unpaid maternity or leave to take care of the child. If you aren\u2019t in a public funded company you get furloughed for childcare, I\u2019d like to see the same for public funded company\u2019s.",
