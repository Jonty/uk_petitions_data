I would like Government to investigate how to ensure that all NHS hospitals acknowledge and learn from the care mistakes made; and how create an NHS where failure is not ignored but is used to maximise patient care.\r\n \r\nWe think hospitals need to be more closely scrutinized and monitored to prevent any future failures from occurring. A Public Inquiry could identify changes which could help achieve this, which the Government can impose.\r\n",
