People who are not employed but unable to work may be entitled to support under Universal Credit or other benefits.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petition, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nFund full sick pay for employees that are off work due to COVID: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/551962\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for additional support to be provided to people who have been affected by Covid-19, but it would need to be clear what support you want to be provided, and who to."
