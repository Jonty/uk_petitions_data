This area is so costly to study due to expensive supervision, course fees and other maintenance. Within the industry it is well known to be expense and is highlighted before enrolment which means losing a lot of urgently needed talent based on financial circumstances. Qualified students enter into the NHS sector so the Government should fund grants and make student finance available in line with other healthcare courses.",

Course fees are rising year on year, restricting who can afford to take these courses, when they are essential to ensure a thriving economy working at their full capacity.",
