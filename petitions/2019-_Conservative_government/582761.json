        "additional_details": "During the pandemic, there has been an increase in mental health issues for many people, from people suffering from loneliness to others experiencing anxiety and depression etc,. The need for more therapists and mental health care workers is crucial to see us through this mental health crisis that is unfolding. Without government support many trainees will be demotivated to complete their training, especially when economic hardship is hitting nearly every hardworking family in the UK.",
        "background": "A trainee therapist would need to train for a minimum of 4/5 years. All self funded. There are many additional costs not only course fees.  Most forego so much to make this sacrifice to follow their calling. Will the Government and Parliament consider grants for those training in mental health?",
