It is incredibly stressful to try to memorise many quotes and references to these texts in a short amount of time, so therefore it would make sense if next year's GCSE was open book.\r\n\r\nIn addition, with an open book exam, students will be able to focus more on learning the optimal way to write an exam than worrying about learning 100 random quotes",
