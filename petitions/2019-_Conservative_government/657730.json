        "additional_details": "This petition urges the Government action to recognize unpaid carers' crucial role in healthcare. We demand legislation for formal recognition, making it easier for loved ones to be referred to necessary services and ensuring our insights are taken into account, to help achieve better health outcomes for our loved ones (and for our own health) as we have a unique viewpoint as their carer. We are playing an indispensable role and deserve help and recognition for this.",
        "background": "Formalise recognition of unpaid carers to ensure their involvement in healthcare decisions. We want unpaid carers to be recognised in law so they can more easily refer the people they care for to health services, and be involved in decisions about healthcare for the person they care for.",
