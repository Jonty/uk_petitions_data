As the spread rate increases we should take precaution and move back to online learning so that teachers do not become ill and learning is not as disrupted.\r\n\r\nSchools and universities have little to no ventilation and have been using windows to allow for air flow. The cold temperatures have led to an increase in illness within both the teaching and student body. Online learning would prevent this.",
