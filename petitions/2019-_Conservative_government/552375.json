        "additional_details": "HM The Queen, and the Royal Family, are one of the world\u2019s wealthiest families. At a time of crisis, when many UK taxpayers are struggling to make ends meet, it is inappropriate to increase the Sovereign Grant to subsidise commercial losses incurred by the Crown Estates arising from covid-19.\r\n\r\nMillions of pensioners, savers and other investors have had to absorb losses on their investments, which have not been subsidised by HM Treasury. It is inappropriate to ask taxpayers to pay a higher Grant.",
        "background": "It is inappropriate that losses incurred by Crown Estates arising from covid-19 are subsidised by an increase in the Sovereign Grant to Her Majesty The Queen. The Sovereign Grant should be reduced and funds used to help ordinary people survive the covid-19 pandemic.",
