        "additional_details": "It is quite frankly a disgrace that so little funding has gone into ME/CFS in the past few decades. The new pandemic is long Covid and we believe sufferers are not receiving enough help due to lack of research into treatments and cures. We need urgent funding for research into the pathology of these conditions. This should include research into mitochondria and the autonomic nervous system of patients with these conditions.\r\n \r\nMillions of people are missing out on their lives. The Government must act now.",
        "background": "Around a quarter of a million people are suffering with ME/CFS in the UK and over 2 million with long Covid. Many of these people are severely disabled. There are no cures of specific medicines for these conditions. Urgent funding is needed for research to find effective treatments and cures.",
