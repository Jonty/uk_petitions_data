        "additional_details": "Exploitative pricing and vast windfall profits are immoral, intensely damaging to society, its individuals and businesses.  Social cohesion and social mobility, family security, health and welfare are all being obliterated.  A government should stand up for the people and the public purse rather than facilitate corporate greed.",
        "background": "The government\u2019s refusal to tax the massive profits made by private energy companies and instead to SUPPLY them taxpayers\u2019 money is an outrageously irresponsible use of public finances.  This petition demands that the use of public money is fair, fully scrutinised and directly for the public good.",
