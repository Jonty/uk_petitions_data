        "additional_details": "As beauty consultants, we are not allowed to refuse physically handling customers - even if we detect alarming symptoms. With Covid-19 becoming a startling pandemic, it is even more fundamental that shopping centres close down. From the public journey to work, touching door handles, makeup products and the faces of others, and all to promote unnecessary purchases at such a critical time: we are constantly putting not only ourselves at risk, but also those around us. We must all stay safe, and act now.",
        "background": "Close down unnecessary businesses, such as shopping centres, to help stop the spread of the Covid-19 Virus, and to protect staff members, customers and their families from the risk of catching the virus and thus contributing to its growth. It is essential that we all stay at home to stop the spread.",
