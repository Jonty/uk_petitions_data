        "additional_details": "The gender recognition act claims to be protecting women and essentially make it impossible for transgender people to be able to transition without getting the verification that is extremely difficult to get in the first place. A very little amount of people actually detransition and many end up having to skip getting the verification because the process is so difficult. The life expectancy for trans people is 30-32 years old. We need to change that. They deserve a long happy life without being constantly worried if they can actually ever live in peace about their transition.",
        "background": "Theresa May promised changes to the Gender Recognition act, and the opposite has been done. We need to change this so more transgender lives can be saved and not lost. The act is protecting women but that includes the transgender ones too, they deserve to use the correct bathrooms.",
