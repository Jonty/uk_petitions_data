        "action": "Remove age as the basis for setting the national minimum wage",
        "additional_details": "Currently, people aged 16 are paid \u00a34.30 an hour in jobs which people aged 25 and over  will automatically earn more than double that, regardless of either individual\u2019s current financial or living situation. \r\n\r\nThis fundamental inequality seems unjustifiable in its current form. Many young people under 25 will have the same financial needs of someone over 25, notably students who need to work to fund their studies. \r\n\r\nPaying the same wage for the same job seems a fair and natural system.",
        "background": "The current system of an age-based minimum wage is outdated and unfair on millions of young workers across the country.\r\n\r\nA system which takes into account one\u2019s economic needs, such as an individual\u2019s living situation, would be a more sophisticated way of setting the minimum wage for young people.",
