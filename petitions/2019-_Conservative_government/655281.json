        "additional_details": "Despite the Government's ban on some single-use plastics in October 2023 we continue to see fruit and vegetables wrapped in single-use plastic.\r\n \r\nEach time an individual buys groceries wrapped in plastic they continue to add injury to the environment by adding this non-recyclable waste into the ecosystem.\r\n \r\nImagine, if there were another species on this planet that generated toxic waste each time it consumed food - would you want to co-exist with it? Let's change for a better future.\r\n",
        "background": "We believe it is ironic that while many retailers claim to be environmentally friendly by offering recycled carry bags, they continue to sell vegetables and fruits in pre-packaged single-use plastic wrappers. This continues despite the ban on some single-use plastics in October 2023.",
