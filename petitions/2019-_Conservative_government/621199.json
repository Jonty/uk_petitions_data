There have been no significant developments since SSRI antidepressants were developed more than 50 years ago. One single dose of psilocybin has been shown in studies to reduce the distress of those with terminal illness and treatment-resistant depression. No other intervention has been shown to have such significant long-term benefits after just a single exposure.",
