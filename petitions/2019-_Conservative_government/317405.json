The World Health Organisation claims cities with higher pollution rates are seeing more deaths from COVID-19. You have been taking action on the coronavirus from the science, why not do the same with our Climate?",
        "background": "Air pollution levels in the UK have dropped significantly since the country went into lockdown. Greenhouse Gas emissions have dropped by 60% in the UK from last year. From this we are observing cleaner air, more wildlife and clearer skies. This is better for our health and our environment.",
