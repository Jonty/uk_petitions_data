The use of children as a weapon in separation wars is cruel to both the parent and children involved, but the only recourse is to take the matter through the Court system, which many people simply cannot afford, yet are ineligible for legal aid.\r\n \r\nMaking legal aid available in such cases, could also encourage ex partners to allow shared access.",
