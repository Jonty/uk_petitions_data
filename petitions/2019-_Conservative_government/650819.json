        "background": "Ideally  the sale of fireworks to the general public banned,  now if we can\u2019t ban people from buying them, we can at least SILENCE all fireworks!  There\u2019s no need for the noise,  people go to watch the pretty fireworks in the sky not the explosive sounds that come with it!",
