        "additional_details": "At the start of lockdown we were categorised together with the hair industry. An industry like beauty which involves contact with clients. With PPE and correct cleaning measures in place how is a beauty salon any different to the Hairdressers? \r\n\r\nBeauty Salons should re-open along side the other business on July 4th with PPE helping the public with their mental health as well as the economy and small businesses.",
        "background": "Beauty salons are essential for the mental well-being for a lot of people. It seems unfair that Hairdressers are allowed to re-open on the 4th July, along side Pubs other industries but beauty salons can't.",
