        "additional_details": "The last few years there has been a rise in depression and mental health issues. From talking with people who are experiencing this and hearing of the many people taking their own lives daily there is not enough being done.\r\n \r\nUnfortunately, NHS support for people suffering from depression can be over-reliant on antidepressants, or involve long waits to receive therapy. I believe if more people are given the option to of accessing fitness and wellness coaches we can help save more lives.\r\n",

We think there should be Government funding to provide the many people struggling with depression and mental health issues with 1-to-1 or online sessions and support from personal trainers and wellness coaches.",
