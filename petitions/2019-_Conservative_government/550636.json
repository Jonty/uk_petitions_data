        "action": "End all lockdown measures.  Restore a free and open economy.  Return to growth.",
        "additional_details": "We desire this outcome because there appears to be an overemphasis on preserving a \u2018covid death/case\u2019 at the great expense of the majority of society.  New data shows that the CFR and IFR are significantly lower than modelled.  There appears to be a lack of understanding of the second order effects of lockdown from both an Economic, Wealth and Health perspective.  A robust economy is the bedrock upon which our great society and NHS rests, any further stifling harms society rich or poor.",
        "background": "We want the Government to end punitive lockdown measures that negatively impact the Economy.  We want a reversal of scientifically unproven mask wearing policies that ultimately deter people from operating a free economy, we want a reversal to free markets without ill thought out intervention.",
