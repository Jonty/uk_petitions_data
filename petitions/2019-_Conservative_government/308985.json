Powerpoints, especially where recordings are not available, are not sufficient and learning/exam revision is almost impossible for those with children at home now schools have closed, or who have a no quiet place to study. Some students are at a major disadvantage to others through no fault of their own and grades/placement offers may be affected. Under these unprecedented and stressful circumstances, we should NOT be expected to continue as normal.",
