        "action": "Legislate for plastics companies to make biodegradable Single-Use products.",
        "additional_details": "Plastic producing companies are intent on making more and more polymers which will never biodegrade, remaining in our environment forever as nano plastics. Since the '70s, they have refused to take responsibility for their products once sold. Only government legislation can make such companies responsible for their products to lifespan end. Biodegradable single-use products will be safe. Government legislation will make these companies responsible for the manufacture of such safe products.",
        "background": "Scientists are working hard to create biodegradable Benign Plastics from crude oil. This petition asks our government to legislate for companies to make single-use biodegradable plastic articles, once they are available and to prohibit making single-use plastics from the current polymers.",
