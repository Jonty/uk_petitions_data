        "additional_details": "In order to save lives, university courses need be taught online. We currently live in frightening times. Students both from overseas, and nationally are starting to go to university across the UK for face to face lessons. This is putting people with underlying health conditions at risk, family members (for those who are commuting), and people who live in and around all these areas. It is not safe for universities to be taught face to face.",
        "background": "We need the government to make universities teach students online rather than face to face. There is an obvious increase in figures amoungst university students. Some students have underlying health conditions, or live at home with family members who do.",
