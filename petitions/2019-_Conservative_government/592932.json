        "additional_details": "The requirement of vaccine passports is allowing the granting of domestic privileges based on health status. Everyday activities will become contingent on a medical procedure. Whilst many may not be affected by being unable to attend clubs or the young frequenting these places, this plan undermines all of our liberties, and there is no word to where this plan will end.",
        "background": "Requiring vaccine passports to undertake certain activities is discriminatory, unethical and unconstitutional. This will create a two tier society and automatically exclude others. We all deserve to choose what goes into our bodies without being coerced. A coercive choice is no choice at all.",
