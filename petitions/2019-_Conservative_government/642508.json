It wouldn\u2019t cost too much to reinstate the link between the two towns. Also, get both Epping and Ongar councils on board, and hopefully they both will support the idea.",
        "background": "I want the Goverment/Parliament to ask Transport for London/London Underground to look into the possibility to reinstating the closed section of the Central Line between Epping and Ongar. This link between the two towns was closed in 1994 by London Underground.",
