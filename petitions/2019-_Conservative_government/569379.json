Face masks and gloves did work well in other countries. So, why we should pay extra money for COVID testing which cost extra \u00a3150 per person in private test centers? Family of 4 people should pay \u00a3600 to price for their holiday. That is unfair to everyone. Make testing in the airports, quick and free of charge. Stop COVID testing speculation across the United Kingdom.",
