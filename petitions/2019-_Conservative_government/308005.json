        "additional_details": "Many students have had to return home in order to eliminate risk for themselves, care for relatives or provide extra income in this difficult time. Others have returned home simply to be with their families during this crisis due to University facilities being suspended. Rent payments on student accommodation should be reimbursed or suspended if students have had to return home during this crisis as it is unfair for students to pay for accommodation that they aren\u2019t using for health reasons.",
