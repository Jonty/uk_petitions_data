        "additional_details": "I am very passionate about this as I find it appalling that there is a nationwide issue on provision for disabled people in parks. Disabled people are being left out and excluded from using facilities in their own communities as they are unable to use and access much equipment in local parks. A family with multiple children where only 1 child is disabled often end up leaving one child out and excluded if they go for a family trip to the park - seeing their siblings have fun without them.",
        "background": "Fund local councils to provide adapted equipment like swings and roundabouts that are accessible and wheelchair friendly. Help make parks accessible for disabled children and adults, and give them access to basic park amenities that they should already have access to within their own communities",
