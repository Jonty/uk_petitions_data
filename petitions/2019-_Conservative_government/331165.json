There is no cure. 1 in 10 women suffer within the workplace due to no support and in some cases, losing jobs due to this condition not being recognised and treated as a disability.",

Laws and policies, including the Equality Act, don't list specific conditions and define them as disabilities. In most cases, it\u2019s the impact that a health condition has on the person\u2019s life that qualifies them for support or protection under the law.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about showing that you're disabled under the Equality Act here:\r\nhttps://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/discrimination/protected-characteristics/showing-you-re-disabled-under-the-equality-act/\r\n\r\nIf you'd like more funding for research into endometriosis, you might like to sign this petition instead: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/328570"
