        "action": "Stop surplus supermarket food going to waste",
        "additional_details": "At present, supermarkets are left by the Government to regulate their own food waste, with donations and redistributions entirely voluntary. As a result, well over 100,000 tonnes of edible food is thrown away by supermarkets every year. \r\nFood waste worldwide accounts for 3.3 giga-tonnes of greenhouse gases per year and there are currently record numbers of UK citizens having to rely on food banks in order to access a basic human right. \r\nThis legislation will save people and our planet.",
        "background": "Impose legislation that makes it illegal for larger supermarkets to throw away surplus food, with hefty fines issued for non-compliance. This will force supermarkets to install better food waste monitoring systems and redistribute any surplus food to charities and food banks.",
