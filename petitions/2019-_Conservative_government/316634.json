        "additional_details": "It may seem strange, to ask for an old man to be knighted (or a gong of some sort) for walking round his garden. Look at it like this.\r\nDozens of unknown, high positioned bankers, lawyers, judges, etc (jobs for the boys club), get knighted every year, and for what? For doing their high paid jobs well.\r\nRarely people in low paid jobs who do their job well get a gong. The salary represents the so called skill of the job, not the fact that people in all jobs can't do them well enough for recognition.",
        "background": "Tom is 100 years old this month, and I'm sure walking around the garden on a zimmer frame, is as much of a challenge for him as any high flying job.\r\nThe millions he has raised, is not even for him, but for our NHS charities. Let's see if sheer numbers of support can send a gong Tom's way.",
