        "additional_details": "We believe too many people who deserve PIP are struggling to get even the standard rate of it. Some people are falling short by just 1 or 2 points. The same problem exists with eligibility for the enhanced rate. Missing out on the standard or enhanced rate of PIP also deprives people of increases to other benefits.\r\n \r\nBy making these adjustments the Government can show the people that it is there to help them. It could help reduce the adverse impacts that people are experiencing because they have missed out by 1 or 2 points.\r\n",
