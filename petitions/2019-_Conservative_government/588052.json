Many have sold their homes under exceptional circumstances such as growing family, economic reasons or loss of work. Some parents are unable to continue their careers after having children, as the cost of childcare can outweigh the benefit of working, and this can force them into rented accommodation with little hope of getting back on the property ladder. This can be a particular problem for military families.",
