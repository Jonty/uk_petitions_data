The government should make sure that our cemeteries, burial grounds and gardens of crematorium where our loved ones are at rest are not neglected. It is very upsetting walking into cemeteries and other places of burial and seeing that they are getting neglected by our local councils yet they still cut other areas and maintain roundabouts with plants etc.",
