        "additional_details": "Employed people are able to get 80% income support (up to 2.5K), as are the self-employed (80% of trading profit). However, if your self-employed trading profits are below your 'employed' income, your employed income is then classed as your 'main income', and you can't claim the 80% grant. Many self-employed will not get any income support, or considerably less than 80% of their normal income, because of their second jobs (including key workers). Don't penalise them for having more than one job.",

Self employed with a second job should not be denied the grant or lose much of their income support if their employed income exceeds their trading profit.",
