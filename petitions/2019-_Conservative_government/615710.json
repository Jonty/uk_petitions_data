We want both made permanent in time for this summer.\r\n \r\nHospitality businesses are still hugely affected by the lasting impact of COVID.\r\n\r\nThis is a revenue neutral way to help them recover fiscally and pay off Government loans like Bounce Back, CIBLS, and Recover Loans.\r\n\r\nIt also has a significant impact on local communities, with friends, families and loved ones able to enjoy food and drink outside in the sun.\r\n\r\nSummer is coming; please act urgently to save it for small businesses.",
