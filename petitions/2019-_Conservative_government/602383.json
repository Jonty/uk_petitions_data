        "additional_details": "Rawhide edible chews pose a choking and blockage risk. If your dog swallows pieces of rawhide, it can get stuck in the oesophagus or other parts of the digestive tract. Sometimes surgery is needed to remove them from the stomach or intestines. A rawhide blockage can lead to a dogs death ! \r\n\r\nRawhide contains toxic chemicals and although only in trace amounts this can still cause E. coli contamination and salmonella that even humans can be at risk of when coming in to contact with said bacteria.",
        "background": "Christmas is approaching and yet again i see pet shops and pet isles stocked up with rawhide christmas themed treats. Not everyone knows the dangers of rawhide and people put trust into stores assuming they wouldn\u2019t sell something aimed for dogs that is harmful & potentially life threatening to them",
