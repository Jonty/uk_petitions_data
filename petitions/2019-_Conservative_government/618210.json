It is every parents responsibility and duty to raise, protect and provide for their children and this joint responsibility should be legally binding from the moment baby is separated at birth. No longer should a parent be able to restrict access to medical information about anothers persons child.",

As a father can only know if his child is his biological child by ways of a DNA test is it not time we equalise this privilege for all?",
