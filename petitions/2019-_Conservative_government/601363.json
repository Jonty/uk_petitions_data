        "additional_details": "There have recently been several very public examples of serious misbehaviour in parish and town councils. This has brought this level of government into serious disrepute. Central Government hopes that the \u2018ballot box\u2019 will sort out this problem. It will not. Many councils are having ongoing problems with recruitment for new councillors as the community are not willing to become involved after seeing such behaviour. Regulation is seriously needed.",
        "background": "At present the Office of the Local Government Ombudsman is only responsible for County and/or District councils. It cannot therefore sanction other levels such as councils at town or parish councils. This needs to change so that these councils come within its remit.",
