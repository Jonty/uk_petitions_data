        "action": "Stop MPs stigmatising people living in poverty",
        "additional_details": "In the UK 15 million people live in poverty, their numbers rising fast under Covid. Most of their MPs have never experienced serious financial hardship. In 2003, Michael Portillo swapped Westminster for life as a single working parent for TV series 'My week in the real world'. He showed how much MPs can learn about life on the breadline while becoming better people. We call on Government to make all MPs complete 1 week of #Stopstigmatisingpoverty training to help make the UK a kinder nation.",
        "background": "Government should introduce mandatory training for MPs to help them understand what it\u2019s like to be hard up and stop stigmatising people on low incomes. #Stopstigmatisingpoverty will see MPs spending 1 week living on a council estate in their constituency and having to get by on universal credit.",
