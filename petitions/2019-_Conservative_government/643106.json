        "additional_details": "The Government\u2019s target of 300,000 new homes a year can be more easily met if local authorities built similar numbers to post-war Britain up to 1980, which stood between 100,000-200,000, but instead of building just social housing the Government should support local authorities to build mixed housing, so that social homes are neighbours with people from different social and economic backgrounds. This should help reduce the chances of social homes becoming deprived neighbourhoods.",
        "background": "Private enterprises haven\u2019t kept up with the shortage of housing in the UK, Instead we need local authorities to be supported to build new mixed housing to meet the needs of their communities. This can be achieved by providing central Government loans, and making it easier to redevelop land.",
