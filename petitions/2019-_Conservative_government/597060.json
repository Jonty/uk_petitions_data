        "additional_details": "In order to massively reduce carbon footprint and take a huge step towards helping our environment manufacturers need to use recyclable packaging. Every packet of biscuits and crisps found on supermarket shelves are not recyclable. Over 6 billion packets of biscuits are consumed in the UK alone every year. All of which end up in landfill. This is unacceptable and it must change ASAP",
        "background": "The packaging used by food companies for everyday household items such as biscuits and crisps are not recyclable, nor is made from recycled material. There needs to be a law to force food manufacturers to use recyclable packaging to package their foods to massively reduce waste to landfill.",
