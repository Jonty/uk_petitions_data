        "additional_details": "I believe that due to the current situation students due to sit the next set of exams have missed enough school to the point where a regular set of gcse and a level exams will find it impossible to meet their predicted grades. We should be tested on a fair set of knowledge that we have learnt over a realistic period of time rather than stressing and further damaging mental health by trying to learn such a wide range of content in a reduced and limited time frame.",
        "background": "I think the education secretary should alter the exams meant to be sat in 2022 with a reduced curriculum so that students are able to meet an actually achieveable target grade and get exam results they can actually go forward in life being happy with",
