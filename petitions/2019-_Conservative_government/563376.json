        "additional_details": "The Amazon rain forest is home to an incredible array of flora and fauna and also to many indigenous tribes of South America. It is also a vital carbon sink for the planet. Life on Earth cannot afford to lose the protection from global heating that this rain forest gives us. Follow the example of France and end the import of Brazilian soy to make the Brazilian government protect this vital part of our biosphere, for the sake of all life on Earth.",
        "background": "Deforestation in the Amazon rain forest is at a 12 year high. Much of this deforestation is because of clearance for soy farming. It is therefore vital to send a message out that we do not tolerate the destruction of one of the most precious wildlife sanctuaries on Earth.",
