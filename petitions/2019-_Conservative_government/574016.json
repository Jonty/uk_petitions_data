        "additional_details": "These boards are made from a block of standard unrecyclable block of expanded polystyrene wrapped in brightly printed plastic cloth, are sourced from abroad and transported thousands of miles only to often snap within minutes of use. They create an unnecessary carbon footprint and nature threatening waste. Once in the ocean, polystyrene attracts algae adding enough weight to cause the nuggets to sink and present itself as food to fish which could enter the human food chain.",
        "background": "According to the Keep Britain Tidy report, over 16,000 cheap polystyrene bodyboards are discarded on UK beaches annually. These boards often snap and become unusable within minutes of use. When discarded, polystyrene crumbles into small white polystyrene balls, threatening our natural environment.",
