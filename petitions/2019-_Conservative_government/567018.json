        "additional_details": "Students shouldn't have to pay in full for accommodation that they can't return to after the holidays due to lockdown restrictions prohibiting travel. They also shouldn't have to pay the full university fees which normally include on campus teaching, which isn't able to go ahead during certain restrictions, and the online teaching quality is extremely poor, considering it is supposed to be for building the students future. Uni students have gotten no help, when all is focused on A level and GCSE",
        "background": "Students need financial help for accommodation payments that they have signed an agreement for, and can't cancel. The universities also need to be made to partially refund the fees, as the teaching is limited, and is no-where near the standard that is should be.",
