        "additional_details": "Despite enthusiasm towards further education and desired career paths, young people with learning disabilities can find themselves with limited options that aren't recognised by many employed. Segregation occurs due to what we see as unjust requirements. Education should be inclusive to all. Give our children the opportunity to succeed and reach their full potential. The Government should work with education providers and sectoral bodies to ensure that the courses it funds are recognised by relevant employers, and include work experience in the chosen vocation.",
        "background": "Make access to vocational educational courses available to all young people, regardless of limitations. I was disheartened to find that the criteria for many vocational educational courses effectively exclude people with learning difficulties.",
