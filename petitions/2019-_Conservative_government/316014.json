        "action": "Make it illegal for people to Smoke/Vape in a queue during the Covid19 outbreak.",
        "additional_details": "I don't know if the virus can be transmitted through smoke or vapour but the fact that someone who could be infected could be breathing in the smoke/vapour  and then blowing it out into a line of other people who then have no choice to breathe it in is both irresponsible and dangerous. I think it should be made illegal to prevent the possible effects and to help those queueing not be unnecessarily scared by it.",
        "background": "During this difficult time when people are so worried about the spread of Covid-19 it should be illegal for people to smoke or Vape whilst in or around queues for shops as having to breathe in 2nd hand smoke / vapor that has been in someone else's lungs is both disgusting and worrying",
