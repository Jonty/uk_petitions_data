        "action": "Update the Coronavirus Act to allow parents to use non-registered childcare",
        "additional_details": "In the last lockdown, childcare was only permitted if it was given by a\u201cregistered childcare provider\u201d - according to the Coronavirus Act this means a person who provides childcare and is registered under Part 2 of the Children and Families (Wales) Measure 2010, but does not include a childminder who is registered to provide childcare on domestic premises.\r\n\r\nWe ask for this to be changed. Working families should be entitled to nominate a non-vulnerable person to help them and their children.",
        "background": "Another lockdown would hinder working parents who are struggling to uphold their careers and committments to their children. We propose an amendment to the legislation which permits working families to nominate a non-vulnerable person to legitimately act as a childcare provider during any lockdown",
