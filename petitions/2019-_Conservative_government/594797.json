        "additional_details": "The Earth is already witnessing the effects of the climate crisis with extreme floods, droughts and wildfires, which, according to the 2021 IPCC report, can only be abated by swift and decisive action. In June 2021, the International Energy Agency recommended that a ban on new oil and gas projects was needed to avoid even worse climate disasters and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. We want the Government and Parliament to take responsibility by putting this recommendation into legislation.",
        "background": "We would like the UK government to end the exploration and development of new oil and gas fields in the UK and its territories, including the Cambo oil field. The development of new oil and gas fields undermines the UK Government\u2019s commitment to Net-Zero by 2050 and its position as COP26 host.",
