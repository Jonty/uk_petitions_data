If you want me to get out the way or you want to make me aware that you are there or coming, have a bell on your bike. So many delivery bike people have no bell on their bikes.I do not think it is a big expense to put a bell on your bike so that you can announce your arrival. If it is there then people will use them. If they do not have to get one they will not.",
