        "additional_details": "MPs have charged taxpayers \u00a3420,000 for energy bills on their second homes over 3 years (according to an Open Democracy report). Energy bills are expected to rise in September/October and again in January, with bills reaching \u00a35,000 by next April. The government have still not updated its support package to meet the cost of living crisis.",
        "background": "MPs are on up to \u00a380,000 a year. MPs should NOT be able to claim their energy bills on expenses for second homes amid the cost of living crisis. Many families are struggling now and will continue to struggle as the crisis worsens and the energy price-caps continue to rise.",
