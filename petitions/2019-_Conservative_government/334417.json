        "additional_details": "During the summer months of the year, a lot of us are faced with working in extremely hot uncomfortable conditions. The Health and Safety Executive has advised that indoor workplaces should not be cooler than 13/16degrees, depending on the type of work. However, there is no guidance or legislation setting a maximum limit.\r\n\r\nAll we are asking is for our workplace to be an acceptable temperature whilst we try to make a living.\r\n \r\nImagine on a hot day, having to work in a kitchen for 12 hours + with no air con or windows. Many employers see this as reasonable, because there isn\u2019t a law against it, but it should not be allowed.",
        "background": "Many workplaces, and particularly kitchens, do not have air conditioning. Kitchens can reach temperatures of up to 55 degrees in normal weather, so when the temperature outside hits 30+ degrees the kitchen can be above 55 degrees. Working in these temperatures is not acceptable.",
