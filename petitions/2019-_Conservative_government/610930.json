        "action": "Reduce time to get settled status for Ukrainians holding long-term and ICT visas",
        "additional_details": "UK is a home for a few thousand skilled Ukrainian professionals who came on corporate assignments and paid taxes to the UK for years. Despite being UK residents for many years, they are often holders of ICT visas, which do not count for naturalization purposes. Waiving this restriction and reducing the time required for settled status would allow them to apply for a Family scheme for their families to access the job market and NHS help for the wounded and elderly relatives.",
        "background": "The government has already announced two new types of visas for Ukrainian refugees: \r\n1) Family scheme for settled UK residents (ILR/passport holders)\r\n2) Local sponsorship scheme, with limited stay and no access to NHS\r\nThe proposal is to allow ICT visa holders to apply to the first scheme.",

Your petition refers to making it easier for Ukrainians on certain visas to gain settled status, but then says your petition is about giving Ukrainians on certain visas the right to access the Ukraine Family Scheme. We're therefore not sure what you want to happen.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
