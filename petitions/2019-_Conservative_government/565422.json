With countries reopening their borders to allow business or tourism, with the vaccin being roll out and with the mesures taken by airlines, people are more and more willing to fly and planes are filling up.

Anyone can be negative when leaving the country but positive on the return. This would also help airlines to gain confidence from customers.",
