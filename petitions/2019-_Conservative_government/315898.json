        "additional_details": "Prisoners are suffering and their right to life is being endangered.They\u2019re living in high-risk conditions with little medical support. By releasing low-risk prisoners who have 6 months or less to serve, more prisoners can be safely accommodated and less prisoners will be exposed to the dangerous virus.The justice system has a responsibility to protect prisoners from Covid-19 and its potential lethality. Urgent reform is required before more and more prisoners die unavoidable deaths behind bars.",
        "background": "Given the current Coronavirus crisis, people behind bars are living in inhumane conditions. Their human rights are being violated absolutely: they\u2019re being forced to share space with inmates who have tested positive for Covid-19; they can only have one shower a week; there is a severe lack of staff.",
