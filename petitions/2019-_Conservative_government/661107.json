        "action": "Reform the Sexual Offences Act so women can be charged with rape against others.",
        "additional_details": "Currently, under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, women can only be charged with sexual assault, meaning they receive less severe imprisonment, only for up to ten years. The act recognises men can be the victims of sexual activity without consent in section four but does not classify such acts as rape in section one. Furthermore, in most sections, the perpetrator is referred to as 'he', further perpetuating this idea that men are the only perpetrators of rape or assault.",
        "background": "We want the government to redefine and degender rape under the Sexual Offences Act to encompass acts of rape outside of penetration and the insinuation that men are the sole perpetrators, meaning women can also be charged with rape against others.",
