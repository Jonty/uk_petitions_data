        "additional_details": "I believe that the government should extend advanced information for Year 12 students as they have been disadvantaged since their GCSEs and this is shown throughout A-levels. Also Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are giving advanced information to students of 2023 so England should do the same. I believe in equal opportunity and if the other nations in our great United Kingdom all agree that students of 2023 should have advanced information so should Englands students of 2023.",
        "background": "I want the government to extend the advanced information that was given to the students of 2022 for 1 more year for the students of 2023.",
