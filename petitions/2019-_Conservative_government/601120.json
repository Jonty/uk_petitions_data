        "action": "Ban use of treatment for companion animals that contain Fipronil & Imidacloprid",
        "additional_details": "If we do not ban these chemicals, it will continue to have a significant impact on our aquatic life and birds. After COP 26 and knowing how wildlife is being decimated, we must do all we can to stop this trend. Much more stringent tests must be put in place, to ensure over the counter and prescription treatments will not end up in the wider environment causing death and pollution.",
        "background": "There are about 10 million dogs and 11 millions cats in the UK, 80% of which are treated for fleas, often unnecessarily. These chemicals end up in our water courses - sometimes 30% above the safe limit. Fipronil and Imidacloprid have already been banned in farming. This must stop.",
