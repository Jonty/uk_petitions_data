        "action": "Make racial sensitivity training mandatory for all teachers in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "It has become clear in the current climate that BAME students, especially Black students have been harassed and bullied by both their peers and teachers with little or no interference. The use of racial slurs by peers has been unchallenged, and BAME students often have no where to turn for support as teachers turn a blind eye. There have also been many cases of teachers bullying students due to their race. This should be unacceptable.",
        "background": "The government owes it to BAME students to put protections in place for their mental and academic well being. These should include mandatory racial sensitivity training for teachers as part of their training, and stricter punishments for students and teachers who bully BAME students for their race.",
