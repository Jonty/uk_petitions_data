        "background": "If a prime minister resigns midterm, it is not democratic for their replacement to be chosen by a handful of paid up ideologues.\r\nIt can also be embarrassing on the international stage, as the contestants compete to appeal to their party members.\r\n\r\nA replacement PM should be chosen by Parliament.",
