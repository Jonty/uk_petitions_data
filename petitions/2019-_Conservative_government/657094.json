        "additional_details": "Current laws on rape and sexual assault allow \"implied consent\" and considers the perpetrator's \"reasonable beliefs\". An affirmative consent model addresses these points by requiring explicit agreement at every stage of the interaction, preventing misunderstandings. The Sexual Offences Act is 20 years old. We believe the consent model should be re-evaluated in light of international change and to better protect survivors in court, shifting focus from an absence of 'no' to the presence of 'yes'.",
        "background": "Implement affirmative consent: a clear, voluntary, explicit agreement to engage in specific sexual activity, requiring ongoing communication and mutual understanding. This would emphasise active consent rather than an absence of objections. We ask that legislation be updated to this model.",
