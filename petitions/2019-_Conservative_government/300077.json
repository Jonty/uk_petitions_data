        "additional_details": "UK wildlife is depleting fast with destruction of habitats & climate crisis. It is more important now than ever to give a helping hand before it disappears completely. The State of Nature Report says that hedgehogs have declined more than 50%, 25% of UK mammals & 50% of birds are at risk of extinction. We need help to get wildlife food regulated. The general public are willing to help but need to be able to provide good quality food to actually improve outcomes for our UK wildlife.",
        "background": "Wildlife food isn\u2019t regulated. Anything can be in the food & sold to the public as suitable. But it could be harmful, of poor quality, even fatal or not nutritionally correct. We request a team be set up to agree on safe, nutritious food, specially designed for all our UK hedgehogs, mammals & birds.",
