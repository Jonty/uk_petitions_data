        "action": "Make it compulsory that retailers must accept cash as well as cashless payments.",
        "additional_details": "Parliament must adopt a cash and cashless retail community as not everyone uses their cards as religiously as what society thinks. Cash is still as important as are cards, mobile paying or watch payments. Retailers should not be able to force customers to pay cashless only and it should be the customers' right to be able to pay by cash if that's the way they pay. If a customer only has cash then it should be the retailer that accepts this and therefore accepts the cash payment. End of.",
        "background": "Over the last few years, many retailers have adopted cashless only ways of customers being able to pay. Parliament must address this as not everyone pays directly with their debit or credit cards. Some people budget using cash only and these methods should be accepted across all retailers.",
