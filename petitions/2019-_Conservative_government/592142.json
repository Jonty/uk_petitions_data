        "action": "To legislate so that cycling on a footpath is legal and no longer an offence",
        "additional_details": "In 1999, then Home Office minister Paul Boateng called for sensitivity and careful use of police discretion when fining cyclists, recognising that vulnerable cyclists feel obliged to use the pavement out of fear of traffic. \r\n\r\nThis petition calls for wider protection of cyclists, ensuring they are not penalised for cycling on a footpath. It is hoped this will save lives, protect children in particular, as well as having potential positive environmental impacts by encouraging more to cycle.",
        "background": "This petition calls for cycling to be permitted on all footpaths. Safeguards can be included in legislation to give pedestrians right of way and impose a duty to cycle with due care and attention, as well as providing for offences for breach of such a duty or reckless or dangerous cycling.",
