        "additional_details": "Parents who have faced the strain of children being out of school, and the businesses they may work for, would be able to rebuild over the summer months. \r\n\r\nChildren can catch up on missed education in preparation for moving into a new school year group. \r\n\r\nTeachers would have to work through this, however with the lack of classes being taught currently, hopefully the desire to educate would move teaching unions to support this.",
        "background": "With the term-time missed by children of all ages through 2020 and now 2021, the cancellation or reduction of the proposed 2021 summer break would help to those children who've missed out on education to catch up. \r\n\r\nThis would also assist companies, employers and employees to recover.",
