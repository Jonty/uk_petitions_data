It is simply not fair or decent to let any businesses profiteer on the back of making ordinary people suffer financial hardships when it is not necessary.\r\nA government-run utility company could offer mass employment and honest prices whilst making a modest profit to cover costs. This would also negate the constant tax incentives or payments to help people cope and force honest competition.",
