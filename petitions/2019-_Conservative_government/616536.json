It doesn't matter if is a language act or a protocol, this cannot be the way to achieve any objective in a democracy.\r\n\r\nIt remains the case that more people voted for parties or independents who are willing to get on with the job.\r\n\r\nPeople are suffering.",

In 2019, nearly \u00a315 MILLION was spent on salaries while NI had no government. Should any party refuse to nominate ministers, their MLAs should have their pay and expenses completely removed.",
