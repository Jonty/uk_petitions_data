        "additional_details": "Ingesting balloons can cause death by blocking the digestive and/or respiratory tracts. This has been witnessed and documented in marine and farm animals. Balloons don't decompose quickly, and their strings usually aren't made of biodegradable material, either. All released balloons, including those falsely marketed as \u201cbiodegradable latex,\u201d return to Earth. They kill animals and cause power outages. Balloons can travel miles and pollute remote and pristine places.",
