It is an offence punishable by an FPN to obstruct or to fail to comply with a HETO's directions yet the actual Traffic Officer has no ability to enforce this law and by the time the police would have arrived, there would have been no point in calling them. Also, HETOs need blue lights in order to respond to RTCs etc more efficiently.",
