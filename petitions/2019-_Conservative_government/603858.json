Your petition says people shouldn't be recalled until they are charged, or found guilty, but these happen at different times, and it's therefore not clear when you want people to be able to recalled. Your petition also refers to support for people on probation, and their families, but it's not clear what additional support you want to be provided.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
