Many patients maybe missing vital appointments for diagnostic tests amd cancer screening as well as treatment Appointments. With a waiting list of 7 million every single appointment booked is important and every patient has the right to get notified of that appointment effectively and not have the added stress and worry of waiting for that letter. Everyone has email.",
