The waiting list for social housing can be up to 10 years which is not good enough. There are many empty high rise apartment blocks that could be filled with families who need somewhere to live. But instead are reserved for wealthier people who have a spare \u00a3650,000 to rent a studio. This has to change.

Many \u2018affordable housing\u2019 options still require an income of at least \u00a360,000 to rent. The cost of living is more than the average person\u2019s income.
