        "additional_details": "There has not been adequate consultation about possible changes to ITT at a time of significant disruption in education due to Covid. Providers are currently adapting to the new Core Content Framework (implemented 2020) and the new Early Career Framework (begins 2021). The re-accreditation process adds to ITT provider workload in an unrealistic timeframe.\r\n\r\nCentralised, large-scale teacher training will de-personalise, de-value and dilute the quality of provision for prospective teachers.",
        "background": "We believe the changes proposed by the DfE's Market Review of Initial Teacher Training, if implemented, will have a hugely detrimental impact on teacher recruitment and reduce the number of bespoke teacher training providers catering for local needs. These proposals should be reviewed.",
