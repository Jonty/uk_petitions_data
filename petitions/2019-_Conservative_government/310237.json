Many businesses have continued to operate online, with warehouse employees not being able to adhere to social distancing rules. \r\n\r\nThis is putting the warehouse employees and their families at risk of infection. Many businesses will not assign employees as furloughed while trading online, meaning their employees will not benefit from the job retention scheme set up by the government.",
