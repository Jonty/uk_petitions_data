        "additional_details": "Many NHS workers have posted on social media about the hardships they are facing every day at work. COVID-19 is a terrible disease and is, arguably, the hardest thing the NHS has ever had to face.\r\nWe have already lost NHS workers to COVID-19, and many of their colleagues will need bereavement counselling. As well as this, many NHS workers have admitted that they are not coping on the frontline. I believe that it is our duty to ensure these people have the care they need after this is done.",
        "background": "I ask that, after this pandemic, we ensure NHS workers have the right to access counselling or therapy sessions if they need it. It should be free, easy to access and ALL NHS workers must be seen as a priority.",
