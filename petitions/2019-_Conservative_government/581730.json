        "additional_details": "I served a very short time in prison (28 days) but encountered many women whilst there. One common denominator was that all women had experienced some form of trauma, yet those employed to be custodians of inmates had little to no mental health training. This resulted in many issues being overlooked and ill mental health being ignored and disregarded. It is known that hurt people, hurt people yet mental health support is lacking and those affected are expected to reintegrate on release.",
        "background": "Government should ensure female inmates have access to adequate mental health support prior to release, including providing extra funding. As a former MP & female inmate, this does not appear to be a consideration when tendering and granting contracts to businesses charged with running HMPs. ",
