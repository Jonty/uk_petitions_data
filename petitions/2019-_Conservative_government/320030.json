        "additional_details": "During this time of crisis with covid 19 it just shows that without us care and support workers the world would struggle, we do the jobs most people turn their noses up at, yes we wipe bums and clean up bodily fluids but yet we get the lowest pay, if it weren\u2019t for those that care about who we support and prevent any illnesses or neglect and abuse then the world would be a lot worse off I myself have been a care and support worker for many of years from elderly to severely disabled on a low wage",
        "background": "We want the government to re think about how much the government pay us frontline workers, minimum wage is barely enough to live on without working ridiculous hours just to cover bills",
