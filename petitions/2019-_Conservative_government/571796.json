        "additional_details": "The current refusal to grant the EU Ambassador the same full diplomatic status threatens future relationships between the UK and the EU, and could have negative impacts on the UK's international status. EU ambassadors are accepted by 142 other countries globally. The UK's refusal could undermine our credibility with these countries. \r\n\r\nThe EU represents a nation state in the same way that the UK does - it is comprised of a number of member states with their own national status.",
        "background": "Although the EU Ambassador has been granted rights specific to an international organisation, full diplomatic status has been refused on the basis that the EU is not a nation state. However, the UK itself does not represent a nation state under the same definition.",
