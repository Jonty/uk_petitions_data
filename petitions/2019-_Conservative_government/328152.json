(Campaign Against Arms Trade, 2019) It has stopped releasing new licenses for arm sales with Saudi Arabia until the Supreme Courts rule. However, it still transfers arms with Saudi Arabia to attack Yemen under the old License.(Open democracy.net,2020) The UK goverment should stop all arms sales including under old license with Saudia Arabia until the court rule has been overturned. This is because civilan lives in Yemen are still being lost by western weapons while waiting for the rule.",
