Not only this but these Zoom sessions we have to do are limited to 40 mins per meeting & I am not getting the full lesson time I am entitled to.",
        "background": "I would like you to remove the idea of exams \r\n& do assessments or coursework simply for the year 12s who have to teach themselves. I will not be able to be supported to the extent I need to be during this time to ensure that I have a deep understanding & developed knowledge.",
