        "additional_details": "The use of glue traps is inhumane, barbaric and quite frankly, unnecessary. It can take anywhere from 3 to 24 hours for a mouse to die using this method. This is HORRIBLE. It's not only rodents who can get caught in these traps, as seen lately by the RSPCA. \r\nRodents can be a nuisance and it's not nice to have them in your house (I'm talking from first hand experience), but it doesn't mean they should suffer and be tortured as they slowly die, ripping their own fur and even sometimes skin off.",
        "background": "I believe a discussion should at least be opened. Animals don't have voices to speak for themselves and I hope that the government would consider banning these cruel devices.",
