        "additional_details": "Before Covid-19, children with Speech & Communication Disorders often waited several years for therapy. During lockdown, it was removed, and despite returning to school, children are still been denied face to face sessions. Many are being told they may be discharged and have to re-apply, and are being denied receiving a formal diagnosis. Communication between SLT and schools is inadequate. Children deserve a proper level of support, in the same way we would expect for other medical conditions.",
