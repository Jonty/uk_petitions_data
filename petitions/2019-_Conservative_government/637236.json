        "additional_details": "We want Government to debate repealing the GRA 2004, and removing section 7 of the EA 2010, because initial justification for implementing gender laws is no longer extant. \r\n\r\nEqual marriage and pensions became law in 2010, quashing the rationale for recognising men as women, and vice-versa. \r\n\r\nHeterosexual people who believe they are, or must be treated as, the opposite sex, are protected under disability law, and freedom of belief.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, official sex secrecy vitiates safeguarding laws.",
        "background": "We call upon Parliament to debate repealing the GRA 2004, and amending the Equality Act 2010 accordingly, on the basis that\r\n\r\n(a) it is obsolete now that equal marriage and pensions are law, and\r\n\r\n(b) official falsification of sex on identity documents is in tension with safeguarding legislation",
