It needs to be 2003 or newer for a petrol car. 2015 onwards for a diesel car and 2016 onwards for a diesel van. \r\n\r\nSo just 4 months after the first ulez has been put in. Sadiq Khan plans to extend this Zone even further to include ALL GREATER LONDON BOROUGHS by 2023 ! This is just a money accumulator for TFL ! Small businesses will go out of business. This is a stealth tax on people who can't afford it ! London will become a ghost town.....",
