        "additional_details": "Too many constabularies have been rightly criticised for 'over-reach', in other words, too many police have, probably through legislative ignorance, been ordering people about in ways that their special CV19 powers were not designed for. The impulse it seems, has been to go straight to overkill. I believe, for example, telling someone sitting in the sun in an isolated place that he/she has to go home, is ridiculous, and a tyrannical act on the part of the authorities.",
