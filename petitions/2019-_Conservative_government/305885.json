        "additional_details": "We believe that due to the current climate and uncertainty we feel that students who will sit their GCSE's in 2021 will be at a disadvantage. This is because (lets go with the assumption that schools remain closed till the Autumn Term) these students will have lost 5 months of education, aswell as the work they will have to do in Yr11 which will only allow them to have 2 weeks of a revision period before the exams when the previous years had much longer. We feel that this is unjust.",
        "background": "We would like parliament to ensure that students sitting GCSE's in 2021 are going to have lower grade boundaries, which will take into consideration the time lost OR that the date of the examination will be changed so that the students can make up for all the time lost whilst the schools were closed",
