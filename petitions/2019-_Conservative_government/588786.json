        "additional_details": "This can help change people\u2019s mindset on disability and help prevent disabled people from being challenged when accessing disabled facilities and services to which they are entitled. The International Wheelchair Symbol has been widely used since 1974, during which time the UK has welcomed many progressive changes around disability, at present supporting over 14 million people with a range of disabilities. As around 80% of these disabilities are not visible & over 90% of disabled people don't use a wheelchair, we need to update the disability symbol to represent ALL disabilities. This will prevent disabled people from being challenged and fight the discrimination they regularly face.",
        "background": "The Government should commission a new, truly inclusive disability symbol and require this to be displayed on all public facilities for disabled people. This will help ensure that ALL disabled people are represented.",
