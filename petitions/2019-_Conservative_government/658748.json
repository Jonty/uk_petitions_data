If the receiving parent isn\u2019t working we believe every penny they receive isn\u2019t earned and should be considered in the same way it would be considered in benefit calculation as if it was a wage. We believe the current system is completely unfair towards the paying parent, whilst the other parent receives hundreds on top of benefits.",
