        "action": "A level and GCSE exams to take place along with predicted grades",
        "additional_details": "It's unfair for some of the students. Many students put extra effort for their final examinations and not sitting them could affect their final grade. Some students save their effort for the final exam but lack evidence i.e showing they can get As/A*s. On the other hand, many students missed school and haven't learned much so it would be easier if teachers predict their grades. The point is everyone has to have a fair and equal chance so either way they get the future they deserve.",
        "background": "Instead of scrapping GCSE and A level exams, allow them to take place and also allow teachers to predict the grades beforehand so 2 sets of results are produced in the end, predicted and final  exam results. For each student, the better result set shall be used for university applications",
