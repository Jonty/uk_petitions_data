        "additional_details": "Many dogs have strangled themselves when left chained up outside. Its also very cruel for their wellbeing and very anti social and lonely for the dog. Dogs need company, stimulation and exercise and its not natural for them to be left chained up outside. Especially in very cold weather as dogs have been known to freeze to death when left long enough, chained up outside  in freezing cold weather. Also very hot weather is dangerous and risky for dogs who are left chained up outside. Many dogs used in this way are used as guard dogs which is not a good reason to own a dog. They are sentient beings and suffer emotionally when not cared for properly.",
