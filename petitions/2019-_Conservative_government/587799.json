Unfortunately this is the current practice across much of the UK. There have been some movements to change this, however I believe that the national Government should take action to provide support to local authorities, so that children do not have to suffer more humiliation after already having experienced abuse/ neglect leading them to go into foster care.",
        "background": "I want the Government to consider providing funding to Local Authority (LA) social services departments so that social workers can provide suitcases or holdalls to children going into foster care. This would prevent children having to transport their clothes and possessions in black bin bags.",
