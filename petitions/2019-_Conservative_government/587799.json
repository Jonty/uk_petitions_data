Unfortunately this is the current practice across much of the UK. There have been some movements to change this, however I believe that the national Government should take action to provide support to local authorities, so that children do not have to suffer more humiliation after already having experienced abuse/ neglect leading them to go into foster care.",

This would prevent children having to transport their clothes and possessions in black bin bags.",
