        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to give those who passed their theory test in 2019/2020 an extension! Perhaps the extension of time we were in lockdown for. We have not been able to continue our driving lessons and have a huge gap/disruption (several months) in our learning therefore I believe we deserve an extension before it expires as it is not fair because we physically have not been able to take our tests or even learn DUE to the pandemic.",
        "background": "Due to the coronavirus pandemic having a severe impact on the UK, it has meant that many learner drivers have not been able to take as many desired driving lessons and tests as possible, due to lockdowns, restrictions and tight measures.",
