        "action": "Require shop workers wearing face masks to wear clear ones to help deaf people",
        "additional_details": "There is an estimated 11 million deaf and hard of hearing people in the UK alone, and many rely on lip reading to communicate. The inability to lip read risks isolating deaf people, and reduces their independence. Clear face masks allow deaf people to lip read, without reducing safety. I think it should be compulsory for those working in shops to wear clear masks, so deaf people can shop independently without the difficulty and anxiety of being unable to understand the people around you.",
        "background": "I am a deaf teenager who wears two hearing aids, and I rely heavily on lip reading to understand speech. Opaque face masks and face coverings take away the ability to lip read and read facial expressions, as well as muffling speech, which are essential parts of communication for deaf/HOH people.",
