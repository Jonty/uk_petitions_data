It is great for those who have got jobs but it does miss out a pretty important sector of the economy - namely the self-employed - and he (Mr Sunak) is going to have to find a way of replicating this for the self-employed as well.\"",

Under such conditions it is crucial that EVERYONE is entitled to and receives same help and nobody is left out.",
