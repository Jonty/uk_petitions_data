        "action": "Care Homes should keep privately funded clients when their money runs out.",
        "additional_details": "Because privately funded clients use up all their savings and sell their homes to live in a Care Home at great cost & if after living there for years all their money has been used and they require council funding, the homes often don\u2019t accept council rates and the person has to be moved to another home. It is not fair! There should be legislation that prevents this from happening. Elderly people suffer and become disoriented when moved. They should remain in an environment they are settled in.",
        "background": "I want  legislation to enforce that Care Homes that have privately funded clients that have lived in there for more than (eg 1 year) to commit to keep them when their private funds run out at council rates.",
