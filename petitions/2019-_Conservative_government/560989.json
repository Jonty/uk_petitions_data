I am really concerned about the video/picture I have seen from a friend which has been published on Facebook where the children are hurded like cattle in a corridor with other children are not wearing facemasks and there is no social distancing in place. I am really worried that this situation could increase the number of covid cases and as a result hospitalisation or god forbidden death. It is an issue that needs to be raised quickly as as a parent I am worried so much and so are thousands of other parents who think the same, greater actions need to be taken into consideration or the closure of schools/colleges needs to be implemented. Keep safe and kind regards Kenneth Parkin.",
