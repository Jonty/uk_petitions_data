        "additional_details": "It is not right that government officials are allowed to break the law and stay in their positions. It suggests that there are no consequences to their actions and sets a bad example and precedent. If government officials break the law, this reveals that they can not be trusted to do the right thing, are not a law abiding citizen, and therefore should not be trusted to represent the public.",
        "background": "If it is found that a government official breaks the law but refuses to resign voluntarily, they should be forced to do so. They should not be able to keep their positions if they are not a law abiding citizen. It sets a bad example and diminishes trust in government.",
