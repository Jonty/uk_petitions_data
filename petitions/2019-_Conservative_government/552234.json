Appointments and early labour can be traumatic, mothers need support.\r\nPartners carry minimal additional risk, they are from the same household. People are allowed in non-essential shops, pubs, restaurants but not maternity. This is essential for mothers' mental health and baby wellbeing.\r\nThanks to Holly Avis for the petition on change.org.",
