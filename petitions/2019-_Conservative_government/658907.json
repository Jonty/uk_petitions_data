        "additional_details": "We want the Government to stop wasting time and stop holding on to our money while checking small businesses to make sure they have given a big enough cut of their hard earned money. The Government is withholding our money, until we prove we earned what we earned and we are given no compensation for this. The Government fines us for late submissions and charges penalties up to \u00a31,300 a year for this, it should provide refunds owed within 10 working days.",
