        "additional_details": "First time buyers who have not had the credit will pay for a loan that they did not have a credit for. \r\nIt will impact on working class who have a mortgage to pay being pushed further towards the bread line. \r\nIt will increase the long term cost of living and put more pressure on families.",
        "background": "In October every household will have \u00a3200 credit on their energy bill, this has to be paid back \u00a340 a year for 5 years. I want this to be considered as a loan you can opt into not a loan for ever household. This stops homes who can afford to pay energy bills having a debt they do not need or want.",
