        "additional_details": "The puppies are sick when they are sold, suffering from contagious and deadly diseases such as Parvovirus and Giardia. The puppies are sold to unsuspecting families who then soon learn the puppies are critically ill and have to be put down. Online sites such as Gumtree make it easy for puppy farmers to sell puppies to the public and then not be traced back by deactivating accounts and changing their numbers. With the governments help Puppy farming can be prohibited by banning these online sales.",
        "background": "I want the government to make it illegal and a criminal offence to sell animals online. Over the lockdown period there has been an overall increase in the amount of puppies sold online. These puppies are imported from different countries and then kept in inhumane conditions until they are sold.",
