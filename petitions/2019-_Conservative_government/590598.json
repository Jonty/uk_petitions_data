        "additional_details": "In September I joined a university and became a student and to my horror discovered I am no longer entitled to free dental care on the NHS. I don't see this as fair because students who are living on a budget within the university may not be able to afford dental treatment including treatment, yet they are able to go to the doctors and hospital free of charge. I would like to see students be treated equally with younger students and not have to pay for essential health services.",
        "background": "The Government have the power to protect the health of university students by funding free dental care and treatment. Many university students live on a budget and some won't be able to afford the dental treatment, which isn't fair.",
