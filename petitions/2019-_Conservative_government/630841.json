This group alone is 0.1 % of the population. In court the victim is often an emotional wreck who in many cases is at risk of further abuse or is in danger. They are then ordered to share the further assets they have left with their abuser. This is not right and does not support the Care Act Section 42 (3)\"put under pressure in relation to money\"",

I want the law to change as the victim of narcissistic financial abuse although supported by the Care Act 2014,  is being further abused by this law. The court process needs aligning with section 42(3).",
