        "additional_details": "In the UK, we have the twin luxuries of time and wealth. We can afford to be patient, knowing that our current chance of infection is comparatively very low. The vast majority of people in India have neither time nor money. We can make a massive difference to the mortality rate in India simply by choosing not to be greedy, and put the lives of fellow humans ahead of our own, because no one is safe until we all are.",
        "background": "Given the immediacy of humanitarian crisis in India, and the low rates of infection in the UK, we should allow people in low risk groups who are waiting to be vaccinated to donate their vaccine from the supply currently earmarked for the UK to be used now in India, as their need is greater.",
