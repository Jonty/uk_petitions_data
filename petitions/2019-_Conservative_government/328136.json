        "additional_details": "Global Climate Change is proof that carbon-type emissions \u201care harmful to humans or the environment\u201d.\r\n\r\nWhen proposing new business premises, plans for safe disposal of Hazardous Waste are essential for approval. This should now be a requirement for all emissions (including Nitrous Oxide, Methane) that any new infrastructure will produce. This will help stop further increases in the national emissions at a point where we have recognised the urgent need to drastically lower them. It also encourages embedded corporate responsibility.",

You have responsibilities known as your \u2018duty of care\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nEmissions are currently not part of planning permissions.",
