The government should look at negotiating a relationship with EASA similar too Switzerland ensuring an even field between UK engineers and European Engineers applies.",

A European licence holders can still obtain a UK CAA licence for a fee but we can\u2019t obtain an EASA! UK engineers have been de valued in their profession.",
