        "additional_details": "We believe that employment tribunals too often find in favour of employers, in part because they can more easily afford legal counsel. It is essential that all employees facing tribunals have legal aid for support. Vulnerable people in the workplace often have little help when it comes to employment issues so all employees facing tribunals should have access to legal aid to ensure they can get the correct support.",
