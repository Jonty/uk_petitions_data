All violent offenders should automatically be subject to restrictions that protect victims.\r\n \r\nIn 2016 I was assaulted, which has had a big impact on my mental health. Now my attacker lives in the same block of flats. We tried to get injunction but the costs were too high. I want to prevent further victims of being in fear.",
