I think we are relying too heavily on technology over troop numbers, but technology alone cannot win wars.\r\n \r\nFor the sake of our country and our children's futures, we believe we must have a true mass reserve of combat-ready civilian troops that can be scaled up at a moment's notice to fight for King and Country.\r\n",
