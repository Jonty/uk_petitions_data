        "additional_details": "More people are getting into debt and poverty for many reasons including low pay, unable to get a job and their benefits do not pay enough. That's why MP's should not get a pay rise until everyone else in this country has enough to live on.\r\nPay rises are normally for people that have done well in their job. As MPs have not done a good enough job to end poverty in the country they do no deserve any pay rise.",
        "background": "It is unfair for tax payers to pay MP's more money when there are people that need the money more. As tax payers we say the money should go towards ending homelessness and getting people out of poverty.",
