        "additional_details": "I want the government/parliament to address this issue as in the past ten days I have found that in order to prove ownership of an animal, one has to go to great lengths.\r\n\r\nI feel (like many) it would make more sense and be beneficial to a large proportion of the population to make it law that an animals microchip prove legal ownership.\r\n\r\nToo many people are left devastated by the theft of a beloved pet. I feel that if the microchip is proof of ownership these sorts of situations could be solved.",
        "background": "As a result of the situation I find myself in, I have come to the very harsh realisation that it is very difficult to solidly prove ownership of a much loved family pet.\r\nWhat I am petitioning to achieve is that the registered owner on a microchip makes that person legally responsible for the animal",
