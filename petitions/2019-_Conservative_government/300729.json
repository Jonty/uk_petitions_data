        "additional_details": "Buses in Greater Manchester are one of the main modes of transport that the public use. It is especially vital for people in Bury and Oldham who do not have local railway stations. We should not have to constantly suffer from delayed and cancelled buses, unfriendly drivers, filthy buses and routes being withdrawn. The people of Greater Manchester are fed up with the bus service that Diamond Bus run within our county.",
        "background": "Since Rotala purchased the First Manchester routes, the public of Greater Manchester have suffered from a appalling bus service with unreliable buses and unfriendly staff. This petition aims for a review of the company and their ability to run a reliable service.",
