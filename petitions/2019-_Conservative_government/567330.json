        "additional_details": "It is not enough to simply check the placenta is complete after birth, as it is so easy to miss something and a doctor couldn\u2019t possibly know/see if any tiny fragments were left. It can be very dangerous for placenta to be left inside the uterus and therefore it should be mandatory that all women are offered an ultrasound scan soon after giving birth to check for retained pregnancy products or placenta and then be offered to have them removed.",
        "background": "So many women give birth and end up with extreme heavy bleeding straight after needing urgent surgery due to retained placenta. However  a lot of women are sent home with their new baby none the wiser that they have retained products or placenta until weeks later when the bleeding starts.",
