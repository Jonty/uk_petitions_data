Some charities refusing to help if a person is struggling with addiction. This leads to many homeless people turning to the NHS, including A&E services, for support. Around half of homeless people suffer from mental health issues, depression and anxiety being the most common. Our proposal could reduce demand on A&E wait times and, in the long run, help reduce the number of people affected by homelessness.\r\n",
