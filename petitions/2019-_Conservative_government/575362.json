        "additional_details": "If we send children back on the 8th March this runs the risk of cases having a sudden spike again which ultimately means more lockdowns, no summer fun and more stress. Waiting until September gives the government time to sort any underlying issues and makes it truly safe for students whilst also helping their mental health too. No student is feeling safe by going back and there will definitely be a rapid decrease in attendance. Think about students, not just the economy.",
        "background": "Wait until September to send all children back to school. We have seen from previous cases how quickly the virus can spread in schools and children are the main carriers. It isn\u2019t safe nor morally right to expect students to feel safe in this sort of environment.",
