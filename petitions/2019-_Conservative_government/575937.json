        "additional_details": "EU students who have lived in the UK for 3+ years will now have to pay up to \u00a330k/year to study in the country. Considering that UK universities pride themselves in being inclusive and open to all, the Government should make sure that pre-settled EU students have access to Home fees: equality of opportunity and diversity of student background cannot be achieved unless education is affordable for all. Asking \u00a330k/year for online courses is untenable and will drive EU (and not only) students away.",
        "background": "1) EU students with pre-settled status should be guaranteed access to Home fees\r\n2) Detailed information about how tuition fees will change following Brexit should be published on every UK university website\r\n3) Universities should be pressured into creating more scholarships to support EU students",
