        "additional_details": "The gap of \u00a32,500 between old and new state pensions is an absolute scandal. I missed the new pension by just 14 days and it's cost me \u00a32,500 a year. This change has led to pauper pensioners. How can we live on \u00a32,500 a year less just because we were born before 6 April 1951/53 than someone born after this date? Does the Government think we have less outgoings? My rent, council tax, cost of food etc is no different to my neighbour so why on earth is my pension over \u00a3200 a month less? In fact it's more than that as I'm married to someone born before 6 April 1953 so we are hit with a double whammy. The cost of living is the same for all - not because of when you were born.",
