Not only have they been made to pay full tuition fees for remote learning, but they are now forced to sit exams through these unfair circumstances. Many students have been impacted first hand by this virus and very little support has been provided by universities let alone the government. Cancelling exams will take unnecessary pressure off students in these difficult times.",
