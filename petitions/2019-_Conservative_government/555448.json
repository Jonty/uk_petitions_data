So he had arranged to be buried at sea to stop his body from being dug up and put on display.\r\n\r\nHis body never made to to sea, as it was intercepted on the way and  has been on display at The Hunterian Museum for over 200 years.\r\n\r\nNo one should have this done to any of their body parts against their wishes.",
