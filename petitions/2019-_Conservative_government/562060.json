        "additional_details": "Living in a fragmented, rural community, a pub plays so many different roles. It is often the only place some people can actually relax and interact with other humans. They actually help with mental health for some people, it's a safe place away from 4 walls of home. \r\nThen there is the efforts these pubs have gone through to keep going, trust staff and patrons to abide by the rules. The police will be running their usual seasonal push on drink driving, so people outside of the village beware!",
        "background": "These places are just as important as hair salons or gyms.\r\nVital for people living alone, with little or no family locally to have human interaction. Trust landlords and patrons to be ADULTS. These pubs are not just serving alcohol, they do SOME MUCH MORE! Help, support, counseling, advice etc.!",
