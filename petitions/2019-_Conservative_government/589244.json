I find this unacceptable since you can limited numbers of people can now enter a theatre, football stadium, soft play, the cinema etc. We ensure our children stay to their class bubbles by dropping them off and collecting them from the same school around the same people twice daily. Sports days take place outside in the fresh air where COVID is much less transmittable.",
