The struggle they go through is sometimes worse than a cold . Not just off work but also off school too.\r\nI think it\u2019s just fair that they get to have the day off so they won\u2019t need to be in more pain as they already are. \r\nAs some of us go through a lot of pain and suffering during our period times .",
