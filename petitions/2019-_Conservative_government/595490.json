        "additional_details": "Football is a sport and the success of any given club in the Premier Leagues should be driven by sporting ability and not by the depth of the Board's pockets or the ability of the club to borrow money in order to buy players.\r\nLimiting players salaries via the T&Cs of the Premier League would give the best players the option to play for the club they have the most affinity with rather than the club that simply pays them most. This in turn would enable smaller clubs in the league still to win it.",
