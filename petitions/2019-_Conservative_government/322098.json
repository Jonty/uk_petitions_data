This narrow definition means that cases of rape with evidence cannot be prosecuted for what they actually are, because they are not included in the legal definition.",
        "background": "Alter the current legal definition of rape to include women who force sexual intercourse another person: this would include women who force a man to engage in penetration, and women who force sexual inter course on other women.",
