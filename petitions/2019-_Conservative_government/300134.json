        "additional_details": "Currently too many people endure suffering in their last few weeks or months of living and go with little dignity. Instead both they and their loved ones must ride out weeks of distress and pain. \r\n\r\nAllowing terminally ill individuals to choose to cut life short by a matter of days or weeks will mean they have the final say on how they should pass away and avoid unnecessary suffering.\r\n\r\nEuthanasia gives those who are terminally ill comfort in knowing the end is something not to be feared.",
        "background": "Allow terminally ill individuals the choice of when they end their suffering. \r\n\r\nOf course, Euthanasia needs to be regulated, but allow the people to choose how or when they pass away. \r\n\r\nIf an individual has a condition that will lead to a painful drawn out death give them the choice.",
