        "additional_details": "Thousands of people in the UK education system suffer memory problems. Epilepsy, brain injury, anxiety, some medications (to name just a few) can impact a person\u2019s ability to retain information. Children with needs can be assessed and offered extra help to improve their marks in exams e.g extra time, more tuition. Memory can\u2019t miraculously reappear, so these don\u2019t necessarily help! Instead, by offering alternatives to end of course exams, such as continual assessment, course work, smaller yet frequent tests, will provide 'real' help. Exams can hinder a person and damage their health. People suffering memory loss shouldn\u2019t be discriminated against during their education.",
        "background": "Exams for Primary & Secondary should no longer be compulsory to those suffering memory loss and instead other options of assessment given. Examples of this is by offering continual assessment, course work and smaller tests more often instead of one or more, huge exam at the end of their course.",
