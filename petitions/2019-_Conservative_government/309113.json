        "additional_details": "These parents and partners have been instructed that they do not need to shield a with them. But they have prolonged contact with these people and pose a risk to them if they are out working in the public still. This risk places a heavy burden on the whole family. Many are having to give up work or accept unpaid leave to protect their loved ones. We're asking the government to instruct employers to pay for this leave where it is to care for a social shielding individual in the household.",
        "background": "In the recent measures taken by the Government to address the threat of Covid+19, the people most vulnerable are instructed to Social Shield for 12 weeks. Especially in the case of children, they cannot do this alone. Partners and parents can get emergency leave from work but it's often unpaid.",
