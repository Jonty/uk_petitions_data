        "action": "Abolish switching between British Summer Time and Daylight Saving Time",
        "additional_details": "There is no sound scientific basis for continuing with this practice. During the period immediately after the clocks are changed, there is a spike in accidents on the roads, in workplaces and at home, as people report feeling more distracted and tired. There can be a negative impact on both mental and physical health, such as increased blood pressure and feelings of stress and anxiety. Also, the change leads to appointments being missed, which costs money for the NHS and other public services.",
        "background": "The clocks go forward by one hour on the last Sunday in March each year and go back by an hour on the last Sunday in October. This was introduced by the Summer Time Act of 1916 because politicians at the time believed that more sunlight in the evenings would save energy and benefit agriculture.",
