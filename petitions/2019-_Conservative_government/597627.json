        "additional_details": "Donkeys are forced to \"work\" from early age till old age (retire), transported to/from beaches and other places of hire, used as \"live\" fairground rides due to their docile nature. Donkeys are not slaves and should not be exploited for public entertainment and profits. Used as \"working donkeys\" most months of the year as much as six days a week, full day, often tied up. They work so hard, it can put strain on their backs that can require a vet or a chiropractor's attention. It is cruel and unnatural.",
        "background": "Stop the cruel practice of using donkeys for entertainment. They are very docile by nature and are often unable to vocalise about their traumatic experience. Other animals will try to defend themselves, donkeys often just freeze, this makes them very easy to exploit all for human profit.",
