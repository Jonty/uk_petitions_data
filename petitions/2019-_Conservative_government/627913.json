        "additional_details": "Trans people make up a tiny % of the UK population, yet they have been used as propaganda and as a scapegoat to whip up fear and hate for political gain. The Independent reports that Transphobic hate crimes have increased by 56% in a year because of negative governmental and social discourse. Excluding them from The Equality Act will see these hate crimes soar as Trans folks are denied access to \u2018single sex spaces\u2019 & are denied legal standing in their gender - in direct contradiction of the GRA.",
        "background": "To commit to not making the reported changes to The Equality Act, changing \u2018sex\u2019 to \u2018sex assigned at birth\u2019/\u2018biological sex\u2019 rather than being inclusive of \u2018gender\u2019 and \u2018gender identity\u2019. To make these changes further marginalises Trans people and opens them up to physical violence.",
