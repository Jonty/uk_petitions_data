Racism of any form has no place in today\u2019s society and should not be tolerated. As well as the racism there were extreme acts of violence, which is also totally unacceptable.\r\n \r\nThe intention of this petition is to ban for life from attending football matches, any person or persons positively identified as to being the culprit or culprits of any form of racism or violence towards anyone directly or indirectly involved with any game whether it be local, national or international.",
