        "additional_details": "I have often noticed how under represented BAME figures are in the curriculum. Only 11% of GCSE students study modules that refer to black people\u2019s contribution to Britain. Of the 59 GCSE history modules available from the three biggest exam boards, Edexcel, AQA and OCR, 12 explicitly mention black history. Only five mention the history of black people in Britain.",
        "background": "This would involve teaching children at an early age about unconscious bias and racism as well as teaching them about lesser known BAME figures. Students of all backgrounds should feel represented and have a wider view when studying, which is not achieved by the current \u2018whitewashed\u2019 curriculum.",
