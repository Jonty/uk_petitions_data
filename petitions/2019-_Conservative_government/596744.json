        "additional_details": "Around 274,000 flats are estimated to have dangerous cladding \u2013 this may affect over 650,000 people who are prevented from moving to more suitable accommodation, thus blighting their lives as well as their properties. Those affected have to pay a 3% surcharge on top of normal Stamp Duty Land Tax if they are in a position to buy an alternative residence. The Government should recognise this and act to provide relief so payment of this surcharge can be deferred until former properties can be sold.",

The Government should defer payment of this surcharge until 3 years after rectification work has been completed and the property can be sold.",
