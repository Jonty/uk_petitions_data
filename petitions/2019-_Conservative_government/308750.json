        "additional_details": "Students across the country are calling out for support and legislations to be brought in to help in this difficult time, as our studies are heavily impacted by COVID-19. We've lost face-to-face teaching and all buildings and libraries have been closed leaving us with nowhere to write out long dissertations, carry out research and limited feedback. Whilst we of course support these measures, as health and safety is paramount right now, we are suffering and recieving no help from the governement.",

Many of us can't go home as it would put our families at risk, but so many of us have lost our zero-hour contract jobs and are struggling to pay rent whilst keep on top of our studies. Where is our support?",
