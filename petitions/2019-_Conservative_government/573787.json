        "additional_details": "As an undergraduate from a low-income background, the tuition and maintenance loan has given me the opportunity to undertake an undergraduate degree. However, the current postgraduate loan is insufficient to cover tuition and maintenance costs, which places myself and many others at a major disadvantage to students who may have a financial advantage. As employers are now expecting both degrees for an entry level job, it is only fair that all students are offered equal opportunity via improving the loans.",
        "background": "Consider offering postgraduate student loans with components to cover all tuition and maintenance costs akin to an undergraduate student loan, so as to reduce socio-economic inequality. Nowadays, some employers request both degrees as standard for entry level jobs so the funding should meet this.",
