(Many settings are charities and non profit based).\r\nIn the first lockdown they were provided with this funding.\r\nYes they are allowed to open this lockdown but many parents are scared to send their children. Parents are put in a position where they could be asked to compromise the safety of their children or risk loosing their EY setting. \r\nPlease can the decision about funding be reviewed?",
