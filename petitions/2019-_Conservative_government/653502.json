        "additional_details": "Estonia has recently pledged to give 0.25% of its GDP to Ukraine, in military aid, for the next four years. We should do the same.\r\n \r\nAccording to some calculations, the UK has given more than 0.25% of GDP to Ukraine, in 2022 and 2023. By promising at least this amount for the next four years, as Estonia has done, we can greatly help Ukraine in the long-term planning necessary to achieve victory - however Ukraine wishes for that to be.\r\n \r\nWe believe it is a small price to pay.",
        "background": "Russia's invasion of Ukraine must fail. Ukraine must win this war, in whichever way it decides to.\r\n \r\nThere are reports that Putin is trying to outlast Ukraine, and waiting for \"war fatigue\" in The West.\r\n \r\nThe UK has said it is with Ukraine \"for as long as it takes\". Let's prove it.",
