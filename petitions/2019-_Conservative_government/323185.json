The police officers are not accountable for the guidance they are given, that responsibility lies firmly with politicians. All fines issued during lockdown should be reviewed and cancelled if it is possible the recipient was interpreting the law and guidelines the same way the government do.",

Our purpose is to persue equal application of the law.\r\n14,000 fines have been issued and police were given guidance that contravened the government's own interpretation of lockdown laws and guidelines. The fines should be reviewed.",
