        "additional_details": "Reverse the decision on making Covid 19 vaccines mandatory for NHS staff. To stand alone as a country and make a decision to respect NHS staff wishes and human rights. The government once respected what NHS staff risked to care for covid patients and helped initiate the gratitude English clap for NHS services even when the government was slow to secure and initiate PPE. It\u2019s a shame that now instead of instigating gratitude to NHS staff it has turned into an instigation of institutional sacking",
        "background": "Reverse the decision to mandate covid 19 vaccines for nhs staff. Please take into account staffing pressures, treatment back-logs, nhs services and emergency services that would be disadvantaged causing huge risk to service and life. Loosing staff will in end result in the privatisation of the NHS",
