        "additional_details": "Tapering personal allowance means that for every \u00a3100 of income between \u00a3100,000 and \u00a3125,140, you only get to take \u00a340 home \u2013 \u00a340 is deducted on earnings over \u00a3100,000, while another \u00a320 is lost by the tapering of the personal allowance. This amounts to a 60% tax rate on earnings within this range.\r\n \r\nAs a result, the Government receives more in tax revenue than the worker who does the actual work to earn a living, which we believe is unfair and should be stopped.\r\n",
        "background": "Due to personal allowance tapering, those earning between \u00a3100,000 and \u00a3125,140 end up effectively paying a marginal income tax rate of 60%. We believe paying more tax on earnings than what one takes home is unfair and this taper should be eliminated",
