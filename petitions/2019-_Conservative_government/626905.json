        "additional_details": "This formula means Havering Council Tax payers are having to pay more to fund the increasing costs of helping vulnerable people than in parts of London like Westminster and parts of Essex. We want the Government to agree a new funding formula which recognises the needs of Havering\u2019s changing population. This will allow the Council to avoid making damaging cuts and will help us to better deliver services for our fast changing communities. \r\n\r\nHelp Havering Council fight for its fair share.",
        "background": "Our funding from Government has been slashed to just \u00a31.5m today from \u00a370m back in 2010. This is due to an outdated and no longer fit for purpose Government funding formula. \r\n\r\nAnd this is not fair.",
