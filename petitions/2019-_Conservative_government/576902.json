        "action": "Make the 'mini tests' optional for GCSE & A level students to sit",
        "additional_details": "The COVID-19 pandemic has made it increasingly challenging to sufficiently learn the exam syllabus' to a high level due to the extended absence of face-to-face learning and spending months trying to learn online. This has left many students at grave disadvantages so I welcome the Government's decision to cancel GCSE & A-Level exams, but these should not be replaced with more exams that schools are able to force upon students. Instead, students should be allowed to choose.",
        "background": "I want the government to reverse their decision to give schools the power to decide if they want GCSE & A-Level students to sit the 'mini-tests' the DoE have set out. Students should have the choice to sit the mini-tests at their own digression, not at their teachers or schools.",
