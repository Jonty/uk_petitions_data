        "additional_details": "The UK has committed to being Carbon Neutral by 2050, to achieve this we will need to rapidly reduce CO2 emissions with 33% coming from transport. Bringing in the ban of new petrol and diesel vehicles will accelerate the transition to low carbon transport which itself will improve air quality.",
        "background": "Both Norway and the Netherlands have voted to ban the sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2025 and 2030 respectively. It will be impossible to hit global carbon reduction targets without radical actions, such as this. The UK should be leading the way on reducing the impact of Climate Change.",
