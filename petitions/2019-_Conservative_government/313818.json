        "additional_details": "The World Health Organization and public health experts agree that testing is crucial to stop the Covid-19 pandemic. Yet the British government, following the dubious \u2018nudge\u2019 approach, has sidestepped responsibility for extensive testing, placing all the burden on the British public to self-isolate. We need to test, test, test.",
        "background": "The British government must massively increase effective testing of all health care professionals and of UK citizens and residents. This is perfectly realistic: if the Germans can do it, so can the British. Britain must aim to reach German testing levels.",
