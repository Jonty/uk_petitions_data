I was never warned about how much sugar is in soft drinks, and think this should be clearly labelled on soft drinks.\r\n \r\nTo help protect public health, lower the burden on the NHS and save taxpayers' cash, as soft drinks lead to tooth decay and increase risk of a range of health conditions, requiring health warnings on all soft drinks sold in the UK could help to lower the risk of people suffering from tooth decay and other health conditions in the future.\r\n",

Warning consumers of sugar content to could help improve people's health and reduce pressure on the NHS.",
