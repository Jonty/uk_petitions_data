He asked the person to leave because he was becoming belligerent, he refused, went downstairs in my kitchen and took my meat knife and stabbed my son once in his side and caught his lung, liver and main aorta of his heart. Ty'relle was rushed to hospital where he died 5 hours later that Friday evening. The effect is on both sides.",
