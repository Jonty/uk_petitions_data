Those with good mental health are already feeling the impacts and those who struggle - may I point to those with anxiety and BPD - are now isolated from their \"favourite person\" who helps them cope with every day needs. Therefore, as I'm sure many can agree, this simply doesn't make sense. How is it that I can sit in a classroom with people from up to 31 different households yet I cannot see one of my friends for a cup of tea in my kitchen.",

Over the November lockdown, schools remained open with up to 32 students per class despite indoor mixing between households being prohibited.\r\n\r\n",
