        "additional_details": "1. Like a referee, an independent regulator would safeguard our beautiful game impartially. This doesn\u2019t currently exist.\r\n2. An Independent Regulator could protect the game against another attempt at a super league or other efforts to put money ahead of fans.\r\n3. Water companies, energy providers and the media all have an independent regulator. Football matters to millions and should also have a regulator of its own.",
        "background": "The Government should use the recently established fan led review of football to introduce an Independent Football Regulator in England to put fans back at the heart of our national game. This should happen by December 2021.",
