According to a scientific paper published in the US, Philadelphia did not place any restrictions on social gatherings. 4,500 citizens died. In Boston, schools, playgrounds, libraries, courtrooms and churches were shut down.  Work shifts were staggered and public transport limited.  Gatherings of more than 20 people were banned. The result?  A reduction of more than 50% fatality rate. Aggressive social distancing works.",
