Now 2 years on and basically told they\u2019re not needed anymore if they don\u2019t do what they\u2019re saying and take the jab! This shouldn\u2019t be forced upon people and risk them losing their jobs. More so waiting until \u201cafter\u201d the winter pressures. If it was needed so badly why not try and make then have it before? The health care service is already on its knees and losing that many staff would have crippled the NHS. I think it\u2019s only fair if we have to follow the no jab no job policy the so should the ones who have implamented it!!",
