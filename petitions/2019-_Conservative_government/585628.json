        "action": "Call for the UK government to formally recognise the State of Palestine",
        "additional_details": "Considering the UK's historical role in the situation in Israel-Palestine today, through the Balfour Declaration and Sykes-Picot Agreement, the UK government needs to take responsibility and take an active role in restoring peace in the region for the benefit of Israelis and Palestinians alike. Dialogue between parties should be rooted in the recognition of the human rights, equality and dignity of all Palestinians and Israelis, as well as maintaining a firm foundation in international law.",
        "background": "The UK government should formally recognise the State of Palestine based on 1967 lines with Jerusalem as a shared capital. To enable this, the UK government should act robustly to prevent annexation of territory by the State of Israel as well as facilitating peace, justice and dignity for all.",
