        "additional_details": "We believe implementing tax exemption on overtime is crucial for economic fairness. It can help empower the working class, recognizing their dedication and helping to foster financial stability. By encouraging increased workforce participation and boosting take-home pay, this policy could also help stimulate economic growth through increased consumer spending. The Government's action on this proposal could demonstrate a commitment to equitable policies, addressing the concerns of the working class and helping to promote a balanced and prosperous society.",
        "background": "Exempting overtime from taxation acknowledges the extra effort and dedication of workers, and we believe would be fairer.
