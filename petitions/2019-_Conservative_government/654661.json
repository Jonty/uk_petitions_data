        "action": "Extend the English National Concessionary Travel Scheme to cover local trains",
        "additional_details": "We believe free concessionary local train travel for the elderly can provide many benefits - improved mobility, social engagement, access to essential services, alleviation of loneliness and isolation, cost savings and health benefits. Some research has found that loneliness and isolation can have comparable impacts on health to smoking 15 cigarettes a day. The England\u2019s Chief Medical Officer recent annual report, which looked at the quality of life for older citizens, highlighted the importance of transport to deliver that quality. This change would enable elderly individuals to move around more easily and independently, and could help address levelling up and better enable millions to take more responsibility for their health.",
        "background": "Amend the Transport Act 2000 and Railways Act 1993 to automatically include free local train travel as part of the English National Concessionary Travel Scheme, and require train operating companies to recognise this concession.",
