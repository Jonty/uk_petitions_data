        "additional_details": "\u201cRacism doesn\u2019t exist\u201d is a fallacious comment. An individual\u2019s interpretation of racism is predicated on their understanding of what it constitutes. Current curriculum teaches little colonial history. That which is taught is purported positive. It follows that racial biases, injustices and maltreatment the British enacted upon others is not commonly known. By such logic, racism is misunderstood; it is thus not identified in its many forms. To help solve racial injustice, people must learn more.",

If a debate is required, so be it: there is little to justify furthering ignorance.",
