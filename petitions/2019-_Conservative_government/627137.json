Public health is at risk and will only continue to get worse. \r\nMembers of our staff have all had to be tested to check they haven\u2019t contracted Brucella, which was recently diagnosed in one of our patients. Brucella causes many nasty symptoms, of which can include infertility.  Many people are rehoming dogs from abroad with no knowledge on the risk they are taking.",

We have just seen a positive case of rabies in France and also positive Brucella Canis at our veterinary surgery.",

You could also call for vaccinations against other diseases, but you would need to specify which diseases.\r\n\r\n"
