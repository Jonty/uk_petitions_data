        "action": "Legalise, regulate and tax marijuana both medicinally and recreationally",
        "additional_details": "Alcohol & tobacco combined kill over 100,000 people in Britain each year, yet the government some how justify their legalisation. Cannabis is used to effectively treat chronic pain, a study has shown that up to 43% of the UK experience chronic pain showing the legalisation would benefit millions. In my lifetime USA and Canada have moved cannabis from an illegal substance to an essential service during the epidemic, its time for the government to accept the science & allow the freedom of choice",
        "background": "Legalise cannabis medicinally and recreationally, millions of British people would benefit from the use of cannabis. I propose legalisation both recreationally and medicinally, as well as allowing households to grow 2 plants for personal use. The economy would benefit exponentially from the taxation",
