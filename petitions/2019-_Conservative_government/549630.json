        "additional_details": "The theatre industry is benefiting from the culture bail-out but that sum cannot do more than help some venues and organisations survive the current closure. The decision not to review social distancing until November is adversely affecting recovery chances and jeopardising thousands of jobs and many venues. The rationale for keeping theatres closed for months longer must be properly debated and speedier consideration needs to be given to the possibility of lifting social distancing in theatres.",
        "background": "Given the dire situation the theatre industry is in we call on the Government to review the continued imposition of social distancing in indoor theatres as soon as possible (and on a regular basis thereafter should it need to remain in force) and well before the currently stated timeline of November",
