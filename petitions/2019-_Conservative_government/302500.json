        "additional_details": "Government aims for 60% of the population to be infected with Covid19, 40 million people, so as to achieve herd immunity, with up to  8 million hospitalised and 600,000 deaths. \r\nScientific evidence for this policy is weak. It is assumed  Covid19 will recur every year. \r\nIt is unproven a person infected with Covid19 acquires sufficient or lasting immunity.\r\nWorld experts dispute this theory and policy.",
        "background": "Aiming for 'herd immunity' is based on weak theory and conjecture and very questionable scientific evidence for  covid19.\r\n Limiting social contact successfully reduced the number of cases and deaths and the prevalence of the virus in China.",
