        "background": "It would be good if there was more days between Friday and Monday. Or extra weekend days. This could be done in alternating weeks, such as every other week we have a longer weekend. \r\nOn bank holiday weekends it is noticeable how much happier and less stressed people are, also at work people tend to",
