        "action": "Encourage individual schools to remove uniform policies",
        "additional_details": "School uniforms create an unnecessary gender divide. They don't allow students to have a say in how they present. They are also harmful to transgender children. Even if a school lets a child socially transition by letting them wear the correct uniform, they will practically be carrying a sign around their neck telling their peers that they are transgender. This leads to large risk of bullying and invasive questions. Or, the child will have to stay in a uniform that doesnt suit them.",
        "background": "Encourage schools not to enforce a uniform policy. Instead, create a dress code, decided by each individual school with input from teachers, parents and, most importantly, children. This will only take an email to every school and person of power in a school pressuring change, and surveys.",
