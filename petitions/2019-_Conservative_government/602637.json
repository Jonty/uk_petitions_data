The suffering and deaths resulting from mental health issues could be prevented if these people are given the correct care. Without an in depth review, and subsequent reforms, families risk losing yet another loved one.",
        "background": "It is imperative that the Government review mental health services, which we believe is failing to meet the needs of the public. The inquiry should review and report on each area of the mental health system, such as staffing, funding, the crisis system and staff training.",
