        "additional_details": "The Prime Minister has the authority to ask the King to dissolve Parliament whenever he sees fit, including after the clocks are set to go back 1 hour on Sunday 27 October 2024. If this date is not changed, voters will have an hour less daylight in the evening.  An extra hour of darkness in the evening could put off many elderly people, disabled people, women, and other vulnerable groups from voting towards the end of the day. The government should delay the end of BST until after the election.",
