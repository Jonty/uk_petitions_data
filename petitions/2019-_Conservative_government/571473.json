        "action": "Include NHS protection in the UK trade deal.",
        "additional_details": "The NHS is just but one of the reasons that this country is so great. Since its birth in 1948 it has saved countless lives through work of tireless, brave and heroic people. It has survived a world war, stood resolute when other sections were privatised and has touched every household in this country. If the government mean what they say with regards to never selling it- include these amendments in our trade deal to protect it for years to come.",
        "background": "On the 20/01/2021 the government rejected the amendment that would have protected the NHS being sold off and to ensure that health services are not on the table in future trade deals. This amendment would also protect \"the sale of patient data\" & allow the control of drug prices.",
