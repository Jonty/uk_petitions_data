        "additional_details": "96% of UK teenagers worry about money daily and 52% of teenagers have been in debt before they turned 18 (2012 OECD study). Adults who learn about money management in their childhood are more likely to have savings compared to those who do not recall having such education. Money habits and behaviours that tend to stick with children for life are formed at the age of 7 but only 1 in 3 children receive financial education in primary schools.(APPG Financial Education for Young People report)",
        "background": "There is currently no statutory requirement or nation wide strategy on financial education in primary schools in England. Compulsory financial education should be included in the national curriculum of primary schools and the Government should provide teachers with training and support in the field.",
