        "additional_details": "The Windrush generation have been severely neglected by the Government, and there is little that can be done to alleviate the pain of those deported from this country. The Windrush Compensation Scheme was started 2 years ago, yet only 5% of those who have made claims have received any compensation. The victims of the Windrush scandal deserve justice and proper compensation for the discrimination and anguish which they have faced, so that they can finally progress on with their lives.",
