Radical action is needed to avert a major crisis that could culminate in social unrest or even riots.\r\n \r\nBy taking this action now the Government can help reduce inflation by tackling one of the sources of inflation. Rising energy and fuel costs create inflation that can spiral out of control because businesses have to increase prices to stay in business. Avert this by absorbing the increase. This could also help avert an economic crisis caused by inflation.",
        "background": "We want the Government to subsidise the cost of energy and fuel so this costs no more for consumers than 50% over 2020 prices. The cost of this should be recouped by medium-term cost increases, and contributions from energy companies.",
