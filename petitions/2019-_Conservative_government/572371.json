        "additional_details": "There is growing food poverty in the UK. There are reports produced by the Trussell Trust and the Guardian, and a Research Briefing has been lodged in the House of Commons Library. It is disgraceful and that there should be citizens of the UK who need to use food banks when the UK has the 6th largest economy in the world. I am ashamed that the Government has let this situation develop.",
        "background": "The government should create an integrated policy that removes food poverty in the UK by implementing changes to: employment law, minimum wage legislation, tax law and the social security payments system. The measure of success will be the removal of the need for food banks.",
