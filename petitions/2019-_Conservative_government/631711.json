        "additional_details": "As a parent of a 5-year old diagnosed autistic child I have experienced first hand the effect that lack of funding has on children awaiting EHCP. During this process I have met numerous professionals, other parents and children who are not receiving the support they need while an EHCP assessment is underway. Children are being put on reduced timetables for long periods of time or having to be educated in empty classrooms and losing education time with peers. It\u2019s not good enough.",
        "background": "There is no difference in a child\u2019s needs before and after an EHCP has been collated, so there should be no difference in the support provided. The Government should therefore provide additional funding to schools so that they are able to support children during this lengthy process. ",
