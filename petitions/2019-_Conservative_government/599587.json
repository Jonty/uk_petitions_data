It can rip up anything and everything from the bottom of ocean turning it into a barren wasteland, while unnecessary finds are discarded back into the ocean. When nets (which can fit whole cathedrals in) are left in the sea as waste, they can kill and strangle millions of sea mammals. I want the UK to ban bottom trawling. There are other methods to fish!",

The investigation by the Committee will cover marine mammals in UK waters and worldwide.\nFind out more about the Committee's inquiry: https://committees.parliament.uk/work/6670/marine-mammals/news/166148/mps-examine-protecting-whales-and-other-marine-mammals/\nThe Committee will be considering the following questions:\nWhat is the status of marine mammal populations?\nHow, and for what purpose, are marine mammals being killed?; \nBeyond whaling, what human behaviours are affecting whale populations and how?;\nHow effective are the global protections of marine mammals?; \nHow can the UK better protect marine mammals?; and \nWhat role can the UK Government play to protect and promote the conservation of marine mammals internationally?\nWhy has the Committee launched this inquiry?\nWhales, dolphins and porpoises are a group of marine mammals collectively known as cetaceans. During the 19th and 20th centuries many cetacean populations collapsed due to over-hunting. \nA moratorium on the commercial hunting of whales was introduced in 1986 by the International Whaling Commission. The recovery from near extinction of some whale populations, such as humpback whales, is considered a major conservation success story. However, some other populations, such as North Atlantic Right Whales remain critically endangered. \nDespite the moratorium some counties continue to hunt whales. There are also several human-made hazards, beyond whaling, that threaten marine mammal populations. These include ocean noise, bycatch (where mammals are inadvertently caught by fishers), ship collision, pollution and climate change. There have also been reports that the number of \u2018strandings\u2019 (on land) is on the rise. Other marine mammal populations such as seals, manatees and dugongs are also thought to be affected by these human-made hazards. \nThe aim of the Committee's inquiry is to better to understand the role that Britain can play in protecting marine mammals in UK waters and worldwide.\nKeep up to date on the Committee's inquiry\nUpdates on the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee's inquiry into marine mammals, including upcoming evidence sessions, will be published here: https://committees.parliament.uk/work/6670/\nYou can also follow the committee on Twitter for updates on its work: https://twitter.com/CommonsEFRA\nWhat is the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee?\nThe Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee is a cross-party group of MPs that look into the work of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.\nFind out more about the committee on its website: https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/52/environment-food-and-rural-affairs-committee\nThe Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee is a select committee.
