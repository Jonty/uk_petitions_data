        "additional_details": "The UK public deserve a much better, far more effective set of measures to help combat Covid 19. The current Secretary of State is widely regarded as being out of his depth, lacking public confidence and failing to make promises come to fruition.\r\n\r\nWe desperately need to get the Country's economy on the road to recovery; this can only go hand in hand with a much improved Test and Trace regime, underpinned by a demonstrable change of leadership at the Department of Health & Social Care.",
        "background": "A  far more robust approach needs to be taken as regards management of the UK's Health and Social Care. The Government were too slow to react to Covid 19. We were promised a \"world leading\" Test and Trace system. We clearly do not have one. Do something about it before it becomes too late.",
