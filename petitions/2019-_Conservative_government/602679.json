        "additional_details": "Unlike other nations, such as the USA, the UK Government lacks a cohesive plan for regional crisis and emergency, which is evident from previous events such as flooding; despite always being told lessons are learnt, it seems evident they are not. An inquiry should help ensure that, in future, the Government formulates and issues a solid practical plan that is enacted to prepare areas when a warning is given, for example from the Met Office, plus can be relied upon throughout, with practical support in the weeks afterwards.",
        "background": "A public inquiry should be launched into the Government\u2019s preparedness and response to Storm Arwen in Northern England. The reasons why this crisis was not prepared for, nor dealt with properly by Government, plus why no COBRA meeting was held, need to be investigated.",
