        "additional_details": "The long-delayed Russia report published by the ISC in July shows that no serious effort was made to ascertain the extent of Russian influence in our democratic processes. Successive cabinets have turned a blind eye to the issue, thus an inquiry must finally be held, as recommended by the ISC and the Commons cultural committee.\r\n\r\nThere is much notional evidence of Russian interference such as news campaigns and bots, and the Government recently admitted Russia\u2019s involvement in the 2019 election.",
        "background": "The Government must hold an inquiry into Russian interference in the EU referendum and democratic processes beyond, as recommended by the ISC, as well as the 2018 Commons culture committee.",
