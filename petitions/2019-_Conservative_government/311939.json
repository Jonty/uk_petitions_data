        "additional_details": "We are advised by accountants and work well within the law set out by government when paying ourselves via this method. You have taken a stance that will put thousands of small companies up and down the country at unnecessary risk when people all around us get the help they need. Self employed are able to continue working despite claiming their support yet a director must furlough and seize all work putting the sevens and the company at risk. This is reckless and a huge oversight by the Chancellor.",
        "background": "The government recently announced that small company directors will only receive 80% of their PAYE if they furlough themselves and dividends are not included. All directors are advised to take minimum allowance through PAYE then take dividends. You must take action and include dividends.",
