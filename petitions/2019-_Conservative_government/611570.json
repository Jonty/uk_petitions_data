We as the people can't change the law and that's why I have had to turn to the government for help. If you really want to sit by and watch animals get hurt for a sentence of only six months, so be it.",
        "background": "In magistrates courts, animal cruelty cases are considered summary offences. Magistrates' courts only permitted to sentence people to a maximum of six months jail time for animal cruelty. I want this raised to 5 years, which in my opinion is still too short.",
