        "additional_details": "Many NHS hospital staff have to pay to park or work, or face having to park significant walks away. It can costs around \u00a32,000 a year to park at work, but parking elsewhere can mean an unpleasant and potentially unsafe walk.\r\n \r\nAs well as reducing the financial burden on NHS hospital staff, and giving them extra time to prepare or unwind before and after shifts, we believe enabling all NHS hospital staff to park at work for free could help reduce the likelihood of assault on journeys to and from work.\r\n",
        "background": "We want the Government to prevent NHS Trusts and private companies operating parking services at NHS hospitals to charge NHS staff to use these parking facilities while they are working.",
