        "additional_details": "Children with an abusive and/or behaviourally disordered parent, or parents, can find it difficult to tell social workers what their thoughts, feelings and emotions really are. Children in dysfunctional homes can be subjected to manipulation, coercive control, poisonous drip feeding about one or both of their parents, etc. In many dysfunctional family cases what lies beyond the surface of what a child says can be much more complex.",
        "background": "We want the Government to review training requirements for child social workers, and implement reforms to better ensure that children are not being left with an abuser or abusers, because of inadequate training. We believe many child social workers do not have the training needed to identify abuse.",
