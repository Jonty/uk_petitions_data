For example, you could start a new petition calling for climbing or 'planking' on memorials to be a criminal offence, if that's something that you'd like to see. \r\n\r\nJustice and policing are devolved to the Scottish Parliament. If you'd like to see action on this issue in Scotland, you could send your petition to the Scottish Parliament, you can find out more here: https://petitions.parliament.scot/"
