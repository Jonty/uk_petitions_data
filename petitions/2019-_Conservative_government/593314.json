Many elderly people are especially reliant on tv and radio to lessen the effects of loneliness, it is only right that this should be continued in hospital. For elderly patients, the anxiety that surrounds the cost of essential care upon their discharge is sadly discouraging them from purchasing this basic amenity.",
