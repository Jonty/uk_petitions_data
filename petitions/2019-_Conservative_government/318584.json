        "action": "Change the rape law to recognise female perpetrators.",
        "additional_details": "Male victims of non-consensual sex by female perpetrators are under protected by the law due to the condition of penile penetration by the perpetrator. Females can coerce/force men into non-consensual sex. If the gender roles were reversed, this would be rape yet this serious sexual violation is not recognised as such, simply due to the nature of the victim. Further, as the wrong is in the violation of sexual autonomy or the deception under the s76 presumptions, then gender should be irrelevant.",
        "background": "I want the current definition of rape to be changed so that female perpetrators can be legally recognised. Female-on-male non-consensual sex should be recognised as rape and not sexual assault or a s4 offence. The gendered definition is unjust and the justifications given previously, unsatisfactory.",
