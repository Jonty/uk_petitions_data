        "additional_details": "Wet belt engines have been used by a number of car manufacturers but we believe they have a key design flaw which causes premature engine failure. This is because the belt itself can start to break apart and fracture allowing small bits of rubber to drop and gather in the oil sump. It then can clog the oil pump and starve the engine of oil causing it to fail and need replaced. This may happen out of warranty but well before expected.",
