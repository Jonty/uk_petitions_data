When bank notes get replaced you can spend the old ones, or exchange them at a bank. After a certain date these old stamps will be worthless! As I bought my stamps at a post office, it would seem logical to exchange them there. I hear in some cases the mail requesting the exchange worth \u00a3100s has been lost.",

I wouldn't send bank notes through the post so why should I send stamps?",
