Boris Johnson has said he wants to recruit 50,000 but is dependent on 12,000 of these coming from over seas. \r\n\r\nWith the effect the pandemic has had on unemployment, especially in younger generations shouldn't we be encouraging them to go into nursing by making it free to train at university or on the job? Please scrap their student loans to encourage more nurses to train.",
