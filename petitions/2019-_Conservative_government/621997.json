        "additional_details": "We are all in the climate crisis together and we all need to feel like we are in it together. One of the most disillusioning thing is to see the rich and privileged live by separate rules to the rest of us. Seeing your individual efforts made redundant by just one flight by someone using a private jet can be a huge disincentive to act on a personal level. We cannot allow a handful of individuals to damage our fight for our planet just so they can skip airport queues and avoid sitting next to the rest of us on a plane.",
