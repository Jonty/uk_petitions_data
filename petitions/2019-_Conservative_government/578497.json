        "additional_details": "Based from the UK Parliament website, an MP's base salary for 2020 was \u00a381,932. The average full time salary according to the NOS for April 2020 was just over \u00a331,000. With a 10% cut by all 650 MPs off the base salary mentioned above, this would equal \u00a35,325,580 that could be contributed to support such as pay increases in the public sector. As minimalistic this value would increase such as an NHS workers salary, it is more about showing support and closing the gap between various groups.",
        "background": "With a Freeze on public sector pay rises and a proposed 1% increase for select NHS staff, a similar example of New Zealand should be done by sacrificing a bit from themselves for the Country they supposedly care about and help develop trust to those who believe the Government supports only itself.",
