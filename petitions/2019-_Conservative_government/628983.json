        "additional_details": "According to Flexible Storage Solutions, the average primary school student in produces about 45kg of waste per year, and the average secondary school student is responsible for 22kg. The Department of Education's Sustainability and Climate Change strategy outlines that by 2025, it will eradicate single-use plastics, and encourage the use of reusable and recyclable materials in schools, but if schools don't have access to free recycling services, we believe this target will not be met.",
        "background": "It should be compulsory for all local authorities in England to provide schools with free plastic, metal, and paper recycling services. Too many schools are sending their recyclable waste to landfill along with their general waste, because they do not have access to free recycling services.",
