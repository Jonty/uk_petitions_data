        "additional_details": "In 2005, the 52 victims of the 7/7 suicide bombers were rightly honoured with a day of mourning. The corona pandemic is killing many times more people *every single day* and is showing no signs of letting up. All across the country, there are devastated families grieving for their loved ones in the most difficult circumstances. A day for the country to mourn together would help us all come to terms with what we've endured, as well as celebrating the lives of those we've tragically lost.",
        "background": "More than 75,000 British people have already died from coronavirus and soon we're likely to pass 100,000. Each one is somebody's child, somebody's mother, grandfather, sister or friend. We should honour and remember them, together, in a National Day of Mourning.",
