Lectures have transferred to online learning, absolutely no consideration has been given to the grades we are expected to still achieve despite the level of education not being the same. Students need to be talked about in the news, mental health services need to be made aware of, support needs to be more obvious. We have been neglected",
        "background": "Consideration of university students has failed to have been shown throughout almost the entire pandemic. Students are still expected to pay for rent and tuition even though we are not being given full access to either accommodation or a proper degree level education.",
