        "additional_details": "Dogs are not just animals, they are members of our family. We spend each and every day caring for them... and now spend each and every day worrying that they are going to be taken away from us. The psychological distress on both the pets and the owners is unthinkable, and at this moment in time nothing is being done to put a stop to it. I am a young female, and afraid to leave the house with my dog. I am terrified each day that she will be taken from me, and many others feel the same.",
        "background": "Police need to investigate dog thefts more seriously, and put an end to the fear of walking our pets. Criminals are currently getting away with stealing our dogs, and are therefore not afraid to carry on with this vile act. More severe punishments should also be given out to those who get caught.",
