        "additional_details": "The policy of waiting 8 weeks for a second vaccine delays pregnant women being fully vaccinated. This policy is not fair to pregnant women who are at higher risk of COVID-19 at 28 weeks. While I appreciate the optimum time period may be 8 weeks, I believe the benefit of being fully vaccinated more quickly will outweigh any risk that the vaccine may not provide as much protection if a second dose is received at 3 weeks.",
        "background": "The JCVI has recommended vaccination be offered to pregnant women, who are at greater risk from COVID-19 after 28 weeks. I believe the interval between doses should be reduced to 3 weeks for pregnant women to get more people vaccinated sooner to protect women, their babies and the NHS.",
