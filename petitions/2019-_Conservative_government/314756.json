Still, at the same time, all UK airports must take extra steps such as mandatory Covid19 tests for all passengers on arrival and quarantine for 14 days, if found positive. Otherwise, it will be challenging to win over this virus. Even after the lockdown phase, these measures should be continued till a proper vaccination is found.",
