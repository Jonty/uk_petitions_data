        "action": "Admit that changing our paper bank notes to plastic was a bad idea and revert.",
        "additional_details": "Plastic bank notes were a bad idea and should be changed back to paper immediately, especially after what we have learnt during the covid 19 outbreak regarding the virus living longer on plastic surfaces. Not only this but the new plastic notes are harder to count, stick together when they come into contact with even the slightest bit of moisture, the ink rubs off them over time, they unfold themselves when folded and pop out of pockets and crevices. We are supposed to be reducing plastic usage.",
        "background": "We expect the government to acknowledge and accept that converting banknotes to plastic from paper was a bad idea for a large number of reasons, one being that we know that covid 19 virus lives much longer on plastic surfaces than paper. The government should force the reversal of this immediately.",
