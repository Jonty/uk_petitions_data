        "action": "Automatically grant equal access rights following separation",
        "additional_details": "This change should ensure parents have the legal right to access even if their ex-partner tries to refuse access. Family breakdown costs the taxpayer an estimated \u00a347 billion per year and the process could be more effectively managed. It is too easy for mothers to withhold their children from their fathers. This is a widespread problem as there are an estimated 2.9 million households in the UK with a lone parent, the vast majority of which are mothers. It can cost tens of thousands of pounds and several years to get access. The cost and time is needless abuse on fathers and children.",
        "background": "The Government should change the law so both parents are granted equal (50-50) access rights to their child when they legally separate or divorce. They should also be required to agree a contact agreement based on a 50-50 split as a condition of being granted legal separation or divorce.",
