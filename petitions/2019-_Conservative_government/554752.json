Since going back to school, two of my children have already needed to self isolate and have covid tests due to having coughs. No timescales for when you get the results, it's a waiting game. Children are missing crucial school time and parents are not able to work. As this is likely to be the 'norm' for many months, can children not receive their results within 12 hours, so households can return to school/work?",
        "background": "Currently, Primary schools are not allowing children at school who have symptoms of Covid, until the parents can evidence a negative test result.  This means that until that result is back, the whole household has to self isolate meaning siblings are also missing school and parents, their work.",
