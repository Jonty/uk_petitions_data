The fairest strategy, under the circumstances we are in, is to give teachers the responsibility and install trust and faith in them to grade students, fairly. Don't let politcans decide YOUR future. We all must act now!",

There is high possibility that The Department For Education will impose \u2018mini-exams\u2019 once students return back to school and this is what our final grades may be decided on.",
