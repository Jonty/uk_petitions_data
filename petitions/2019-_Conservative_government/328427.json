You will help us remember that we can all be different, together and proud! It will be a day for society to join and celebrate together in brotherhood and solidarity. It will help promote justice, highlight marginalization and modern inequalities and modern politicianry and to heal the cracks in our society, right now, and for our children's tomorrow.",

A day to understand the history of politicianry, and its legacy in society, the triumph of the abolitionists over this evil. I want you to fund community groups to celebrate diversity and its education.",
