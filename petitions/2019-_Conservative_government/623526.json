The whole nation should be allowed to vote on their favourite design.\r\n\r\nThat design should then live in perpetuity on the \"4th plinth\" in Trafalgar Square.\r\nThere should be other memorials in other towns, villages and cities too.\r\n\r\nThis would ensure that the memory of our late Queen will never be forgotten. The impact she had on all areas of society over such a long reign is unsurpassed.",
