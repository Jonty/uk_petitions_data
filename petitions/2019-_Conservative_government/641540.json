        "additional_details": "I currently work as mental health therapist (NHS) and on a daily basis see ex service personnel struggling after leaving the military. I have asked hundreds of ex military personnel if their units have made a follow up welfare contact to see if they need help and advice. I think the findings are disturbing.\r\n \r\nIf the Government really cares about the military then a call to their ex comrades should become routine. Careers Managers/Welfare Officers could make a difference in their proactive approach.",
        "background": "After serving 27 years in the British Army and numerous leadership roles I have witnessed and experienced a failure in the military system. If the MoD made it policy to contact ex service personnel after 6 months of leaving, it would reduce mental health issues within the ex service community.",
