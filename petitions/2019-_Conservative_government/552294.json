With the Government's proposed Operation Moonshot aiming to achieve a mass testing capability of 10 million daily tests by early 2021, it isn't morally just, nor should it be countenanced, that lives/livelihoods can be severely adversely affected via potential false test results. If the RT-PCR test is intended to be the foundation of a health passport regime, with 'curbs and sanctions' involved, then its efficacy must be second to none.",
