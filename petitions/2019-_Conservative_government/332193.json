        "additional_details": "In my town, some children's playgrounds have signage which states that dogs need to be on leads, while other playgrounds do not. Given the fact that local councils have signage requiring dog owners to keep their pets on leads in some playgrounds demonstrates the acceptance that there is a risk to children posed by dogs - it is now time to extend the rule to ALL playgrounds, in order to protect ALL children, nationwide. Every child has the right to relax and play, as stipulated in the UNCRC.",

We ask our national government to require local councils to erect signage in all children's playgrounds, requiring dogs to be kept on short leads.",
