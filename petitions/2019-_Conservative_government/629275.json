Getting an appointment with registered GP is like winning a lottery these days. \r\nSince patients are unable to use these facilities they either end up going to A&E or waiting for paramedics to be seen which puts unnecessary strain on already stretched A&E and ambulance services.",
        "background": "Alexandra Avenue Health & Social Care Centre, Pinn Medical Centre and similar NHS walk in centres were a major part of the community pre covid and really helped a lot of patients - who were unable to get on the day appointments with their own GPs - to be seen quickly by another doctor or Nurses.",
