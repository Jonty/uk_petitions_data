        "additional_details": "Familiarisation videos would allow people to view the venue before visiting, allowing them to plan their visit & arrange for reasonable adjustments if required. They should help reduce anxiety & barriers with access to public spaces & services, especially for individuals with physical/mental impairments (i.e. Autism, Dementia, MS, anxiety) & their carers. It would help visitors ensure a venue is suitable to their needs before attending, alleviating possible anxiety, embarrassment, distress, & disappointment.",
        "background": "Amend the Equality Act 2010 to require all public spaces and venues provide a detailed familiarisation video, to improve accessibility for all. This should reduce barriers, improve accessibility, allow for forward planning, and assess what requirements may be needed to overcome barriers.",
