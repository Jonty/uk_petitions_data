        "additional_details": "Vapes were originally devised to help people quit smoking and therefore should only be available on prescription. There is plenty of information on the web about the dangers of vapes and their inappropriate use by children. \r\n\r\nThere are reports from schools about problems in classrooms, due to vaping: eg. reduced concentration and poor behaviour. Serious side effects may include: Severe lung injury, Seizures, Bronchiolitis obliterans, organizing pneumonia, Popcorn lung, Strokes, Heart attacks",
        "background": "Vaping has become a huge issue in schools and families as children are becoming hooked on nicotine. Children and young people are attracted by their designs and fruity flavours, potentially causing serious mental and physical health issues in children. It may cause lifelong addiction.",
