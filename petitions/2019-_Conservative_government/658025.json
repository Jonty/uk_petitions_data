        "additional_details": "Currently it is a defence for failing to comply with the duty in regulation 13 to maintain pipelines where, for example, the pipe was included within an approved programme which was not then due for completion. We think this is unfair, and can prevent people who are affected by poorly maintained pipelines from seeking recourse. We want this defence to be removed from The Pipelines Safety Regulations 1996.",
        "background": "I would like The Pipelines Safety Regulations 1996 to be amended to remove the defence set out in Section 13(A)(6) for failing to ensure that a pipeline is maintained in an efficient state, in efficient working order and in good repair.",
