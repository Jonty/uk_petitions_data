Though they may or may not plan to return one day, they are still UK citizens with rights conferred by, and obligations to, the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, vitally important matters of state, eg. referenda for EU membership, Scottish independence, etc, are so far-reaching that the right to vote should be permanently established for all UK citizens, wherever they may live.",

Allow these citizens to vote for a UK Overseas Citizens MP who will ultimately represent their interests on various issues, such as: taxation, travel, pensions, healthcare, etc.",
