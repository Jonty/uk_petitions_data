        "additional_details": "Engaged couples getting married in July, August and September have already had many of their plans shattered because of the virus. It is very unfair to allow retailers, cinemas and other outlets to set their own numbers in line with Government guidance, but then to limit wedding venues to a certain number.",
        "background": "Allow venues to set their own social distancing numbers. Due to the very differing size of venues, this is a more sensible idea and would allow wedding venues to maximise their revenue in these difficult times. Pubs and restaurants are allowed to do this, so why not wedding venues",
