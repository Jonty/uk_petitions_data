Instead of British Nationals having to pay extortionate amounts to reschedule flights, some clarity around what criteria (e.g. R rate) should be set for when a country might be taken out of the list, with a proposed timeline for review.",

While the need for doing so is understandable, we need the government to provide clarity around what criteria or timeline would result in a country being removed from the red list in the near future.",
