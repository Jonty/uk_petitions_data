        "additional_details": "The climate crisis is something which affects all of us. Amending competition legislation to ensure the Government can intervene to prevent mergers that would be to the detriment of the environment is important. We believe COP26 will not result in sufficient action to protect the environment, and the Government must take more robust strives towards mitigating the environment through frameworks such as competition law.",
        "background": "The Government must show a willingness and have the legal capability to intervene in mergers which would damage the environment. Competition legislation is a proven vehicle to drive social change and influence corporate decision making. Section 58 of the Enterprise Act should be amended to do this.",
