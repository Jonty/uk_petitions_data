        "additional_details": "Men are offered screening when they turn 65, but women are not. I want the Government to fund screening for women, to help detect AAA early.\r\n\r\nMy wife died unnecessarily and she and many other women would still be alive if a routine quick and cheap ultrasound scan was offered to all women, in the same way it is offered to me.\r\n\r\nBreast screening is routine so why not for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms. Please make AAA screening routinely available to all women.\r\n\r\nNHS web site states: \"screening for AAA is not routinely offered to women because the risk of getting an AAA is much smaller\". Therefore it seems women are expendable for the sake of a cheap ultrasound scan.\r\n\r\nFor information on AAAs see: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/",
