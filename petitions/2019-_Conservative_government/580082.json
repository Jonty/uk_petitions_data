        "additional_details": "The wide-ranging bill increases the power of police to act in ways which are likely to affect minorities, the vulnerable, workers. They risk stifling dissent and making it harder to hold the powerful, and corporations, employers to account. We already have an enormous range of laws to restrict these things. People could face a jail sentence of up to 10 years. The Bill prevents seeking Justice & Freedom for the voiceless both at home and overseas. It is an attempt to Silence the British Public.",
        "background": "The Home secretary`s Police,Crime,Courts & Sentencing Bill is an assault on our rights to peaceful protest, and access the countryside. We want the right to Protest which is enshrined in the Human Rights Act to remain protected without imposing draconian measures. We demand an end to this bill.",
