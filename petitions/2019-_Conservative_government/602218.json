        "additional_details": "Social services can take almost a year in some cases to assess the needs of vulnerable adults who need social services including social care. There are many vulnerable adults who have applied for assessment for social services. Currently there is no legal timescale in which the social services have to assess people, which can lead to mental and physical health problems.  This could be avoided by much earlier intervention.",
        "background": "The Government should impose a legal timescale on local authorities to deliver social care assessments. Increased funding to local authorities should help them meet this timescale and reduce waiting times to no more than three months from application to assessment.",
