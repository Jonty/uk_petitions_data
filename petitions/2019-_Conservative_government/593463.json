        "additional_details": "We don\u2019t want to swap one evil for another. Puppy farming is abhorrent wherever it takes place. Puppy farming continues in the U.K. because puppies can be bred at one site and then transported for sale without their mother. Puppies should only be sold from the premises they were born. This will safeguard animal welfare and ensure buyers make informed choices when buying a puppy. The Government needs to open a public consultation on the size of dog breeding establishments. ",
        "background": "Estimated annual puppy sales in the U.K. are 400,000 to 700,000. We welcome the puppy import ban but failing to plan now means the welfare benefits of the ban will be limited. There is a risk the ban on puppy imports could lead to an increase in puppy farming within the UK itself.",
