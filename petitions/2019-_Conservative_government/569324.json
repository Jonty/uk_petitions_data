        "additional_details": "Without CCTV this becomes an adults' word against a child who may struggle with communication. Parents put their children in the care of school bus companies and their escorts and we expect them to be looked after. Making it a legal requirement to have CCTV will ensure the adults in charge are carrying out their duties correctly which would leave no room for misunderstandings. Should an incident occur the use of CCTV will enable investigations to be carried out fairly and efficiently",
