        "action": "Tighter restrictions on companies marketing vape kits at children & young people",
        "additional_details": "Companies should not be able to target people under the legal smoking age. Some vape pens have nicotine salts, and vaping seems to be increasing among school children. Tough laws are needed.\r\n\r\nVaping is now seen as only marginally safer than smoking by the medical profession. Vaping amongst children needs to be stopped not only to prevent quick addiction to nicotine which is bad for the cardiovascular system but also because it can start a ladder to further addiction in some who then go on to use other more dangerous drugs. Preventing children and young people from vaping should save money for the NHS by preventing the respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular diseases that can result from this habit.",
        "background": "The Government should impose tighter restrictions on the production and marketing of vape kits to ensure they do not appeal to children and young people. These kits come at affordable prices, in pretty colours loaded with sweeteners in flavours like Cola, Candy Floss, and Lemonade.\r\n",
