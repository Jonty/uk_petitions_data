        "background": "This petition is to release low-level inmates who are at high risk of contracting COVID-19 and dying. \r\n\r\nMy sister has a sentence of 2.5years. With positive cases in the prison the inmates are being isolated and visiting will soon be stopped. \r\n\r\nPLEASE RELEASE THE NON-VIOLENT PRISONERS ON CURFEW",
