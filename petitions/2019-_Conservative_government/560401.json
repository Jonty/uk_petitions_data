        "additional_details": "Eg. Parent 1: 4 nights per week parent 2: 3 nights per week, means pay for 1 night only.\r\nAt the moment child maintenance is calculated by way of a percentage of the non-resident parent\u2019s gross monthly wage. This means that more child maintenance is paid by non-resident parents who have higher earnings. This is also unaffected by the number of nights a non-resident parent has their child for. This is unfair to non-resident parents, and should be reformed.",
