        "additional_details": "I refer to the \"cherry bombs\" or \"firecrackers\" that emanate a very loud bang or boom.  I believe there is a need to investigate/reseach into, the importation/purchase of already-illegal fireworks that end up in communities, scaring pets, wildlife and damaging property. Furthermore, the setting off of fireworks continues WELL past the 5th November. This is an archaic tradition.  Firework vendors also pop up, and disappear soon after, without consequence, setting up shop in local village centres.",

I also speak on behalf of our pets, local wildlife, our elderly and PTSD sufferers (who remember the REAL bombs!) and couples with babies.",
