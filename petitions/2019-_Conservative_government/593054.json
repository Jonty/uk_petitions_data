        "additional_details": "The small pay rise offered to NHS Staff does not reflect the long hours, mental strains and sheer hard work put in by the NHS staff. Do this in this way coupled with the 3% payrise on offer by the government will reflect improvement in pay and the UK residence appreciation for the work they have done during teh pandemic. Under the current we are at risk of large numbers of staff leaving the NHS, this change will not only reverse that trend but could increase the numbers of people wanting to work in the NHS.",
        "background": "Pay the NHS staff an additional Personal Allowance of \u00a35,000 backdated to April 2020 to show the UK residence support for both the work they have done in responding to the Pandemic and ongoing support for the work they are doing support us and our families",
