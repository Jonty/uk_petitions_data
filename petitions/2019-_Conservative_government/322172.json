        "additional_details": "We need to assist Hong Kongers in their survival under the the legitimately signed international agreement between the UK and China, to survive and prosper as a separate country, even if under Chinese background rule. \r\nIt is unacceptable that China tries to insert its own communist legislation in to Hong Kong under the agreement of the \"One Country, Two Systems\" principle, behind closed doors. The UK is obliged to support it's previous territory and inhabitants ensuring safety and security for all!!",
        "background": "Support Hong Kong by ceasing China's attempt at undermining the \"One Country, Two Systems\" principle in place since the transfer on 1st July 1997, by their attempt at enforcing the national security Laws of China in to this wonderful City!",
