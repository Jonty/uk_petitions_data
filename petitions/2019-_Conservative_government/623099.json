        "additional_details": "About half a million pensioners who have worked hard and contributed to Great Britain are unfairly penalised and disadvantaged just because they choose to live overseas. Globally cost of living keeps rising so why should pensioners from Britain be unfairly and shamefully disadvantaged.  Can you imagine a pensioner living on frozen pension from 10 years ago, and still drawing that same amount?  Please be humane.",
        "background": "Pensioners who live overseas should not be unfairly treated by having their pensions frozen with no yearly increase. Globally,  cost of living will keep rising, so poor pensioners who have worked hard and contributed to the economy in the UK  should not be disadvantaged or penalised.",
