If someone parks on your privately owned drive, the police class it as trespassing and a civil matter and won\u2019t help you. Your local council won\u2019t remove the vehicle unless it has been classed as abandoned for one month. You can\u2019t remove the vehicle yourself as you could be liable to court action if the vehicle gets damaged whilst being removed. Make it illegal and enforceable. Give homeowners rights.",

The council won\u2019t remove the vehicle unless it has been abandoned for a month. If you remove, you could get in trouble.",
