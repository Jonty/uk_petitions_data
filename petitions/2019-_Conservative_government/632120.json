        "additional_details": "With the short period of school holidays most of the parents and children are paying 3 times excessive amounts on summer holidays on flights and others because everyone wants to go at the same time becuse holidays are not enough during the summer. I don't see any sence of giving a week holiday for every six weeks shcool. Please consider to increase the summer holidays by decreasing other term holidays by at least 2 weeks.",
        "background": "School holidays are too many during the term, mid term, Christmas and Easter during School period. My request is reduce some of these holidays and increase the number of summer holidays. Summer holidays are very few when we compared with other western countries.",
