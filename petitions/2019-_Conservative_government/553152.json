        "additional_details": "I am a University Student in Wales. When I graduate I am expected to pay back a total of 27k for Tuition Fees which I find to be unjust, especially when we are in the midst of a deadly Pandemic. Face-Timing 5 days a week, not having the proper access to reading materials in the University Library and being sent recordings of a lecture once a week is not what I/we are paying for. This is affecting all students across the 4 nations. I would like for Parliament to enforce fair changes for students.",
        "background": "Due to COVID-19 cases rising and universities opting to offer an off-campus learning system this year, students are now not going to be receiving the full university experience that they are paying for. They/We should be entitled to compensation or discounted fees reflecting the experience on offer.",
