Luckily, his cancer was caught early because my Mum forced him to go to the doctors when he had blood in his urine.  Some men are reluctant to go to the doctors if they present with symptoms.  The reason they need to get tested annually is because some men don\u2019t have symptoms and if we can catch it early, treatment will be more successful.  A simple PSA blood test is all that is needed.",
