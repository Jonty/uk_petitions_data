Much of this old equipment, when replaced, ends up in incorrect recycle centres that are not equipped correctly to deal with them.\r\n \r\nManufacturers should be made responsible for providing a service to recycle the old equipment that their products are replacing. This would require them to contract recyclers to handle the old electronics appropriately.",
