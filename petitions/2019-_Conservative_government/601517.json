        "additional_details": "Measures that could help prevent reoffending including more robust psychological assessments of offenders approaching a release date, to ensure that they are only released when it is safe for this to happen, and monitoring of released offenders to protect the public. Stricter monitoring or law should be imposed to ensure offenders comply with mental health services. More detailed records need to be kept and communicated more efficiently to reduce risk of reoffending and to protect the public.",
        "background": "There are too many cases of offenders with mental health issues being released, only to go on to reoffend, sometimes resulting in the loss of life. The Government should review arrangements for the release of offenders with mental health issues, to ensure that they do not go on to reoffend.",
