        "additional_details": "People in high-risk categories are being isolated for 12 weeks and may not have help readily available to access essentials and food. \r\n\r\nAll supermarkets across the country are fully booked with deliveries and collection slots meaning vulnerable people are having no choice but to venture out of their homes and safe spaces into areas where many people are interacting and passing through. This is counterproductive to the social distancing and self-isolating policies in place.",
        "background": "Encourage and effectively support supermarkets to distribute food and essentials by introducing additional delivery and collections capacity for people in this category. Additional staff, vehicles and temporary 3rd party contracts are in need to help those vulnerable to access vital supplies.",
