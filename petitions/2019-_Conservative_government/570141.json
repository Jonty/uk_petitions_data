        "additional_details": "It is a tough time for all. Why place added pressure on very young children and their parents by enforcing online teaching? Year 4 and below have no impending exams. Continuing schooling only adds stress to parents and their children. We could be creating unnecessary hardship for  a generation of children, and creating gaps in learning that will make it harder for teachers later. We believe children are not ready for formal education before 7 years anyway. Let's focus in mental health in times like these.",
        "background": "The Government should think of the emotional impact for children & parents who have primary school children, and stop requiring home schooling for children in year 4 and below. They can catch up through extra hours in holidays.",
