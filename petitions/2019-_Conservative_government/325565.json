In fact, our colonial history is still celebrated in the form of statues and monuments dedicated to slave owners up and down our country. It is disgusting and shameful that such things still exist. People are tired of simply having discussions, as if there were any grounds to support their existence, and as a result the statue of Edward Colston was rightfully pulled down in Bristol. Now for the rest!",
