        "additional_details": "We currently learn about racism through a historic lens leading many adolescents to the impression that racism is an issue of the past rather than something we face daily. This leaves our generation misinformed and ignorant to white privilege and systemic racism. Responding to events happening globally and nationally, it's clear we need to tackle and discuss these issues through a structured, mandatory curriculum instead of relying on generational change to drift vaguely towards racial equity.",
        "background": "Education on white privilege and systemic racism in our schools across the uk must be implemented as a compulsory part of the school curriculum in order to lift the curtain of 'white blindness'. We must educate young adolescents how they can actively be involved in standing up against racism.",
