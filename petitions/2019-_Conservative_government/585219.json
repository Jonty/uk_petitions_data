Even degradable plastic uses petroleum products and degrades to form CO2. \r\n\r\nThere's a clear strategy by the vendors of the degradable bags to make them seem environmentally friendly as people don't appreciate they help cause global warming. \r\n\r\nPlant-based bags (e.g. corn starch) are sustainable and non-polluting. We already use them as food waste bags.",
