        "additional_details": "This would minimise the anxiety and stress of school leaders, teachers and pupils, during the upcoming months, when school closures and relocations (of pupils and staff) may become inevitable. \r\n\r\nIt would free up school resources: Year 2/6 TAs could be relocated as needed around the school; Year 6 pupils could be taught alongside Year 5/4 pupils, in the event of staff illness; and school halls could be used to accommodate larger classes, rather than mock exams (or SATs intervention groups).",
        "background": "Some schools may close due to coronavirus, making any primary school performance tables this summer an exercise in unfairness. Why should we compare the results of a school that closed for 4 weeks, against one that didn't? Why judge the performance of a class with 60 pupils, against one with 30?",
