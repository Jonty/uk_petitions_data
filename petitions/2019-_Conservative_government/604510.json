However this isn't the same for females who generally remain as 'Miss' until married. Therefore age defines male titles, yet marriage defines female titles.\r\n\r\n2.There are no options to indicate marriage for men or non-binary. \r\n\r\n3.Females shouldn't have to choose to hide their marital status whilst men do not have to consider this. It's outdated.\r\n\r\nThis is one step in the direction of equality.",
        "background": "Remove titles 'Miss\u2019, 'Mrs' and \u2018Master\u2019 to make options equal across all genders, with the remaining titles to be 'Ms' for female, 'Mr' for male and 'Mx' for non-binary people.\r\n\r\nAbolishing these will help eliminate the subconscious pressure of marriage and the current associated stigma of \u2019Ms'.",
