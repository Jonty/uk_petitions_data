The best defence we have is to try and halt the spread by isolating pupils who have been in close contact with individuals who have tested positive for Covid-19.\r\n \r\nWhile children are at relatively low risk from serious covid illness, many unfortunately going on to suffer with long covid for many months, and the long-term effects of infection are not known.",
