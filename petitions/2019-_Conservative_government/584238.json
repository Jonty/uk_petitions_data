        "action": "Provide as much oxygen as possible from our excess to Indian hospitals.",
        "additional_details": "As India is a fellow democratic nation we have economic and geopolitical interest in we should provide aid as we do with any other national disaster that occurs. We have a duty to assure that democracy prevails and to do so the best way is to aid other democratic nations in their time of crisis. India played a crucial role in producing AZ vaccines for both our own and global supplies. We cannot leave their people or nation in dismay for both our global ideals and interests. Help end suffering.",
        "background": "With the oxygen crisis that many Indian hospitals are facing we must aid them. I propose that we analyse the amount our own hopsitals have in excess, if any, and decide what would be feasible to donate without putting our NHS at risk. Financial aid should be bare minimum if nothing else.",
