        "additional_details": "In my opinion, I believe that it would make feel safer. It is very important to understand that especially women are at high risk of getting attacked as they don\u2019t have the same strength as a man would have. Not everyone is able to defend themselves with their own hands snd therefore extra help \u2013in this case non lethal weapons\u2013 is required. It would be a great move from the Government as it would also demonstrate how much interest it has for its citizens and to make UK a better place.",
        "background": "The government should let people carry non lethal weapons with them in order to protect themselves. The individuals that will be carrying the weapons on them should beforehand undergo tests that show they\u2019re capable of having a non lethal weapon (e.g pepper spray) so that they can defend themselves.",
