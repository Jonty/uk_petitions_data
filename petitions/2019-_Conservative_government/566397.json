        "action": "Restrict sale of all rodenticide \"poison\" products to licensed users",
        "additional_details": "DIY stores and garden centres should promote non-lethal deterrents and mechanical traps which kill the victim instantaneously, not cruel and dangerous poisons. According to the charity Humane Society International, anticoagulant poisons make up 93% of all rodenticide authorised in the UK for sale to non-professionals. Animals inc non-target species like dogs and cats can suffer severe abdominal and muscle pain, weakness, lameness and breathing difficulties for up to 28 hours prior to death.",
        "background": "We want the Government to restrict the sale of all rodenticide poisons to licensed pest control technicians. We feel this would lead to a reduction in secondary poisoning that inevitably goes on to kill their natural predators such as foxes, otters, stoats, owls, red kites, kestrels and peregrines.",
