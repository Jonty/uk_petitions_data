        "additional_details": "We urge FCDO to work with partners, INGOs and communities in Las Anod to provide humanitarian assistance, for example via Garowe or Ethiopia\r\n \r\nAround 200,000 people have been reportedly displaced, and hundreds injured, including medical personnel. Houses and hospitals have been damaged, jeopardising access to essential care for the wounded. As a result, many injured have died being re-routed for treatment.\r\n \r\nHumanitarian assistance is urgently needed to reach those in need. We kindly call on the UK Government provide humanitarian assistance, through safe routes, rather than territories under Somaliland control.\r\n",
