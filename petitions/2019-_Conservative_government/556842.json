        "action": "Scrap the proposed ban on new petrol and diesel cars",
        "additional_details": "If there is a ban on diesel and petrol cars and only electric cars sold in the UK then some people may struggle to buy and run their electric cars and if electric cars aren't popular then there may not be many people who will buy new cars. This could mean people drive older diesel and petrol cars for longer which could be worse for the environment. Also jobs in some industries may face losses which could have an adverse effect on the economy and people\u2019s well-being.",
        "background": "The Government plan to ban the sale of diesel and petrol cars by 2040 or even 2030. This is because of the goal of UK being carbon neutral by 2050. We believe this is not realistic and that electric cars are nowhere near as economic as diesel and petrol cars.",
