        "additional_details": "The government were able to support the nation by reducing financial obligations (i.e. mortgage holidays) and providing income support at 80% of salaries during the pandemic. The cost of living is much higher with a new born yet the financial support provided \u00a3151.20 per week equates to only \u00a34ph (based on 37.5hr week). This is far below the National Minimum Wage as determined and set by Government. The current rates see family income more than halve for new parents. They need more support.",

Consider increasing SMP & SPP to 80% of salary from weeks 1 to 39 (SSP for 2 weeks only).",
