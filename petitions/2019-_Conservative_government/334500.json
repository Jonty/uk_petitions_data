        "background": "Every year, seals are rescued with discarded or lost plastic flying rings embedded into their necks. These are the ones which are found and have a chance of being nursed back to health, unfortunately,  many aren't so lucky and go on to suffer agonising deaths. \r\nSign and share to help save the seals",
