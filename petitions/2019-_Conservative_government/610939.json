        "additional_details": "This is a non-violent way of helping bring the war to an end. It also recognises the grave dangers those surrendering may face and their bravery in refusing to fight. Rewards could be commensurate with rank and role, e.g. pilots and those in command could receive more. Those choosing to stay in Ukraine to help re build, or even fight could also be paid more.",
        "background": "Urgently create a scheme to reward Russian soldiers for actively refusing to fight in Ukraine. The scheme could offer cash rewards and relocation to safe countries until the war ends. Would not apply to those captured against their will. The Government could use seized Russian assets to fund this.",
