        "additional_details": "The way in which the NHS has dealt with the Covid-19 outbreak is nothing short of heroic. For the government to not acknowledge this action appropriately would be a monumental slap in the face to all who work there. \r\n\r\nThe government must put their money where their mouth is and give all NHS members of staff the pay rise which they so obviously deserve. Additionally to this, I want them to commit to a structure moving forward linking the NHS pay rise to inflation and their own pay rise.",
        "background": "An annual pay-rise each year equal to or greater than the one MP's award themselves. This increase, after consultation with a non biased entity, must put the person in a better financial state than the previous year. Meaning the member will be better off given a rise in the average cost of living.",
