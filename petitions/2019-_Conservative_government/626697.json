        "additional_details": "Despite excellent work educating vets and other professionals to the problems associated with extreme breeding, there continues to be a rise in the sales of these breeds. The general public (and social media influencers) make decisions to purchase these animals before seeing a vet. We cannot easily inform or influence this decision to buy, and are therefore left to manage their congenital problems after purchase. Similar to banning tobacco advertising, banning these images will undermine the market which fuels extreme breeding.",
        "background": "Ban extreme breeding and mutilation of animals in advertising, with particular attention to brachycephalic breeds, on all merchandise and all forms of media including social media and information society services.",

For example, we could accept a petition banning the advertisement of particular breeds of dogs, if that's what you want to happen."
