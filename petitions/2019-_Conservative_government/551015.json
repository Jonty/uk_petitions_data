        "action": "Request banks to grant 100% mortgages for renters in order to own a property.",
        "additional_details": "Renters are stuck in a rental loop, they pay rent often higher than a mortgage payment of the same property, however are unable to save enough for a deposit to actually buy the same property, if banks gave these loyal renters a mortgage to cover all costs, this would certainly allow more average people to get on the property ladder. Example a person pays \u00a3900pm without fault in 4 years, surely the banks could offer them a mortgage up to the \u00a3900pm repayment cost.",
        "background": "Government to request banks offer 100% mortgages to renters who have rented for longer than 4 years without faulting on rent payment, renters are stuck as they can't save enough for a deposit, but can easily manage the mortgage payments based on their rental history.",
