        "additional_details": "No school is going to set a child up for something they cannot achieve. \r\nUni and college places already hang in the balance. Genuine A* students with top university offers face not getting their firmed place. This is the life they have worked hard for and deserve. \r\n\r\nAll students with conditional offers have their futures at risk, this is wrong. Bright kids, deserving kids, hard-working kids having their futures ripped away.",
        "background": "A-level and GCSE results will be handed out in August with results based on many factors. Each school has someone to sign this off. The Government Dept responsible for this has decided in their wisdom to reduce those grades by up to 33%. We call on Boris Johnson to intervene now and stop this.",
