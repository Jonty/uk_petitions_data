        "additional_details": "No one could expect CEOs to have foreseen the outbreak of a pandemic, but they should understand that we operate on an economic cycle made of busts as well as booms.  These companies take all the profits on the upside then sheepishly look to government to step in, with society bearing the cost, in the case of downturns for which they should have prepared.\r\n\r\nThe government should choose very carefully which companies it bails out, prioritising livelihoods over corporate affiliations.",
        "background": "With monetary policy in the United Kingdom lacking in scope, an unprecedented fiscal response to Covid-19 is required, but this money needs to go to the hardworking people and families in the UK who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, not to CEOs who took on too much debt.",
