        "additional_details": "We believe the current method of examining students discriminates against autistic students. The current approach does not always meet the needs of Autistic and Neurodiverse students, who may do poorly at exams because they do not understand the questions.\r\n \r\nHaving a reader, scribe and extra time is not always enough. This addresses only one part of the issue. Reasonable adjustments need to be made where the questions can be simplified or explained. A review could establish what adjustments would be most effective, and inform guidance for schools on implementing these.\r\n",
        "background": "I would like the Government to review the way in which Autistic students are assessed. Questions can be complex in writing style and confusing for students with communication difficulties/disabilities. Reasonable adjustments need to be made where the questions can be simplified or explained.",
