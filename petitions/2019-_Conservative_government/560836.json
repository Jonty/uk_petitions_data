        "additional_details": "Riding schools have been required to closed under lockdown, leading to a total loss of income derived from one-to-one and group coaching. Schools remain responsible for the welfare of their horses. The need for continued horse care means that staff cannot be furloughed and feed/bedding must be purchased. Current grants do not remotely cover the on-going costs of horse care. Riding provides excellent outdoor exercise for clients in COVID-secure settings; coaching should be permitted.",
        "background": "The Government should provide a grants and rate relief to all licensed riding schools to mitigate the collapse in income arising from national and local lockdowns. Schools could also be allowed to provide one-to-one coaching so they can generate some income, while also exercising horses.",
