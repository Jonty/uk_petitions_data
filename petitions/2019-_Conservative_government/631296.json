What's more, the Government did actually make financial pay-outs to the slave owners at the time, and only just recently finished paying off those debts. Yet the liberated people themselves received not even a penny.\r\n\r\nVictims of the World War and Holocaust received compensation by Germany, a fund co-ordinated by the US and UK governments.",

Other countries have received compensation for similar wrong doings, victims of the Holocaust is one clear example.",
