        "additional_details": "1/4 people suffer from a mental illness each year. Suicide is also the biggest killer of men under 45 and with mental health system only receiving 5.5% of the health budget, thousands of people are left to suffer alone. By providing mental health training in the school curriculum & jobs such as the police force, together we can help reduce these increasing statistics with our own knowledge & expertise on what to do in a crisis, whether it\u2019s  for themselves or someone else.",
        "background": "Mental health is & should be as important as physical health, yet there\u2019s still a lack of understanding. All secondary schools & jobs should make it compulsory to educate everyone  about mental health & the different mental illnesses, also highlighting how to help those struggling & getting support.",
