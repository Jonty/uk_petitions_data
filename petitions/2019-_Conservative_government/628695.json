We understand that you are concerned about Local Housing Allowance rates, but these are set by Valuation Office Agency Rent Officers, who are operationally independent.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for the Government to change the rules governing Local Housing Allowance rates, so that these are set in a way that better reflects local rental prices, but you'd need to be clear how you wanted these rules to be changed.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about how Local Housing Allowance rates are set here: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-housing-allowance"
