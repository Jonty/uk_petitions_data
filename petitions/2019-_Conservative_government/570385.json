        "action": "Prevent the cut to Universal Credit during Covid-19",
        "additional_details": "Almost 6,000,000 people rely on Universal Credit. These are the most vulnerable members of society and support some of the lowest income families. \r\n\r\nThis cut would slash Universal Credit by 20%, driving vulnerable households into poverty. In these desperate times, many people are struggling to provide for their families, shown by the disgraceful free school meal package and increase in unemployment. \r\nWe cannot further lower Universal Credit if we are to build a society which works for all.",
        "background": "In order to support the most vulnerable during the Covid-19 pandemic, Universal Credit, was increased by \u00a320 per week. I'm calling on the government to not reverse this increase whilst coronavirus is still rampant and the most vulnerable in society are at risk of poverty.",
