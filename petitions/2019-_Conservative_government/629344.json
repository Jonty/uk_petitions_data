        "additional_details": "Thousands of housing association tenants were given hope of home ownership in 2016. Now these people are losing hope in this government. Several governments have promised to make this happen and still nothing has been done. It is not fair that some tenants who were in the same waiting list as everybody else, were given a council house with The Right To Buy and then some others were unluckily given housing association accommodation with the right to acquire. I think everyone should be treated fair",
        "background": "Over 6 years ago the government announced that the right to buy scheme would be extended to housing association tenants. It started with the original pilot scheme in 2016 and another pilot scheme was launched in 2018. Now it has been over 6 years and it is still unknown. Please roll out this scheme.",
