Additionally, it aligns with the urgent need to address the mental health crisis, given the significant impact these services can have on mental well-being.\r\n \r\nRemoving VAT should support businesses, benefit the economy, and we believe will improve overall mental health outcomes for citizens, ultimately fostering a healthier and more prosperous society.\r\n",
