        "additional_details": "We have been looking at how we can ensure the safety of our staff. Currently, HMRC views taxis home pre-9pm as a taxable expense, which will cost employees. In the UK, where it gets dark at 5pm for a third of the year, this is unjustifiable.\r\n\r\nAccording to a 2020 White Paper by the Global Business Travel Association, safety is the top priority for 60% of people when choosing how to travel for business.\r\n \r\nBut currently, only taxis employees take home from work after 9pm are viewed as a legitimate business expense: taxis taken home from work before 9pm, however, regardless of context, are viewed as a taxable benefit.\r\n \r\nWe are asking that HMRC changes its rules around taxis to make it easier for businesses to make sure staff get home safe.",
