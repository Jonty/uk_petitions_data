The Government should scrap the CITB and the levy it imposes so construction companies only have to pay directly for training, and not also pay a levy which may not benefit them.\r\n \r\nAlthough the levy is meant to apply to all employers engaged wholly or mainly in construction industry activities, some companies avoid paying it, putting those that do at a disadvantage.",
