The message to stay at home or, if not, to remain 2m apart is clearly not getting through. The campaign should include regular SMS messages to all users, unskipable adverts on TV, Youtube, Netflix and others and signs at all park entrances. The message should not have to be sought out but rammed down people's throats.",

We need a massive public information campaign including adverts on all video streaming services and a regular SMS sent by mobile providers to all users.",
