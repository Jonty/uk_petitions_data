        "additional_details": "After returning in September, education remained disturbed as staff and students were isolating for 2 weeks. Practicals weren\u2019t allowed and study places also remained closed. Many students were hoping to return in January but yet once again we have been placed in a lockdown for 6 weeks, which may be extended. The series of events have stripped students of motivation and have increased stress levels therefore teacher assessment will be much better suited in place of external examination in 2022.",
        "background": "Remote learning has taken a toll on students mental health as we were never trained to study online through virtual lessons. Since March 2020 there was no formal education for a staggering period of 6 months. In midst of all this some students were directly affected through loss of family members.",
