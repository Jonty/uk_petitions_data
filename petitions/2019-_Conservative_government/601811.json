These incidences have occurred often at night and even with all the \u2018precautions\u2019 we are told to take as women, these events are still happening and close to home for many now.\r\n\r\nCovid and brexit have seen huge shortages in taxi drivers and this increases the risk to people travelling at night especially women.",
