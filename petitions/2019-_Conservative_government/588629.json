        "additional_details": "Majority of Telugus came here as highly skilled professionals and have settled based on their jobs across the UK. Unlike other heritage language speakers in the UK, Telugu community does not exist as a clustered geographic settlement but they have settled across the country. Due to this 2nd gen Telugu children don\u2019t get to hear or read telugu script apart from their parents. Regular telugu classes & an opportunity to sit for exams like GCSEs/A Levels can help  survival of Telugu in the UK.",
        "background": "Telugu is the 3rd most spoken language in India and ranks 15th in the world.\u00a0Currently there are over 50,000 Telugu people spread across the UK.\u00a0In spite of this Telugu is lost to the second generation due to lack of opportunities and lack of governments support to the heritage language speakers.",
