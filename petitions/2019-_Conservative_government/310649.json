        "additional_details": "The income people were relying on is no longer there. The RYA has over 2,500 affiliated sailing centres which require individuals who have spent years training and paying for qualifications to teach and deliver safe and engaging sessions. Many of which to young people. Sport is shown to improve both physical and mental well being. People should not be penalised for their choice of career path. Especially when it promotes young people to become more confident and resourceful individuals.",
        "background": "Due to Covid, seasonal workers are jobless. Many save during summer to live off in winter as work isn't available or whilst studying at uni. Having no evidence of work from zero hour contracts for winter or not a sufficient number of hours, they therefore aren't eligible for compensation offered.",
