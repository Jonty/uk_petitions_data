Many nationalities are currently unable to enter the UK without a business visa for example, with those who are in long distance relationships or who do not live together, not knowing when they will be able to see their partner again. This ongoing uncertainty is detrimental to their mental health.",

Many other countries in Europe are currently permitting such visas with conditions attached.",
