A senior fox hunter was recently found guilty of encouraging and assisting people to evade the ban on fox hunting, prompting the National Trust to take action and ban hunts on their land. The Government should act on this and help 'muzzle' this barbaric, sadistic and outdated blood sport.\r\n\r\nAdditionally,  a muzzling policy would be far easier for the police to enforce  than the current legislation.",
