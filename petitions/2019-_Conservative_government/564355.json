        "action": "Keep the COVID Christmas bubble rules as they were before 19 December",
        "additional_details": "1. The proposed changes to the rules are disproportionate to the risks and the goal of containing coronavirus. Vulnerable people could be protected by taking lesser measures.\r\n2. The proposed rule changes fail to take into account the mental well-being of people, and focus on the physical welll-being of a small number of vulnerable people.\r\n3. Statements were made by the Government that the rules would not be changed. Reliance was placed on those statements and people incurred costs based on this.",
        "background": "Do not amend regulation 4 of the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (All Tiers) (England) Regulations 2020 as proposed. Continue to allow up to three households (irrespective of Tiers) to form a Christmas bubble between 23 and 27 December.",
