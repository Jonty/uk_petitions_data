        "additional_details": "With continuous rising costs, Sandwell residents are really feeling the pinch. To introduce another charge now only adds to the many problems that we are seeing. Going forward we will see more fly tipping and people having more garden fires. We live in the UK, weather is not great! When the sun comes out, residents spend their time in their gardens (helping their mental health) hanging out their washing and opening their windows only to be spoilt from the smell of smoke from garden fires.",
        "background": "A \u00a335 (per bin) annual charge came into effect in 2023 for Sandwell residents to pay for their green bins to be emptied once fortnightly.\r\nOther councils do not charge for this service and Sandwell residents would like this charge abolished.",
