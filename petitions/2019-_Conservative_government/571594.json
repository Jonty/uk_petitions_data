        "action": "Reduce the gap between COVID-19 vaccinations to 4-6 weeks from 12 weeks.",
        "additional_details": "The argument to support the current stance is based on balance of population benefit versus risk in covering more people with a first dose. Evidence is lacking to support either decision at a population level. Emerging evidence suggests protection is less than expected in the intervening period between doses if the second dose is delayed. This might result in increased risk even at population level compared to shortening the interval. Providing no choice regarding second dose timing is unethical",
        "background": "The current position of NHS England is to enforce a position of no second doses of COVID-19 vaccine until 12 weeks have passed from the first dose. There is no room for clinical discretion. The existing evidence supports a much shorter interval to give good efficacy at person level.",
