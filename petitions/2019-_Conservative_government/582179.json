        "action": "Process child arrangement applications quicker and reduce times between hearings",
        "additional_details": "When a parent makes a family court application they are often left waiting for considerable amounts of time for a first court hearing and in between hearings. These lengthy court processes have an adverse effect on the child/ren's welfare and development. This in turn has a detrimental effect on the mental health of the child/ren and the parent. Being without a parent for such a substantial amount of time causes significant damage to the relationship between them and the parent.",
        "background": "Process child arrangement applications and arrange first hearings to within 28 days of submission. Also reduce waiting times between court hearings to shorten the time children are kept from having contact with one or both parents.",
