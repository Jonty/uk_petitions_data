        "additional_details": "The reason I want the cervical screening age to be reduced to 21 is due to my own personal experience. I am 24 years old and have recently been diagnosed with cervical cancer. I was only one year off meeting the screening age but due to this I was not able to get a smear test. I want to fight for women\u2019s rights and help save lives. My cancer was ignored and it has now spread \u2013 I feel that had I been able to have a smear my cancer would have been detected earlier.",
