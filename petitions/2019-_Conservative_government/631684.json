        "additional_details": "There are serious issues with the availability of mental health services for children and adolescents, with some children waiting up to two years to receive support. Referrals are being made by GPs and schools but unfortunately children are having to wait too long to get support needed. We believe a Government review could help identify ways of improving the delivery of these services, so that young people receive the support they need, when they need it.",
        "background": "We want the Government to review Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), and consider ways of improving how these are delivered. This could include the operation of a triage service, where young people with complex needs are quickly referred to specialist services.",
