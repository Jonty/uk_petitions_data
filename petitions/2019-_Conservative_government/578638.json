        "additional_details": "We believe while the current curriculum contains content for cultivating resilience in character, and that, the inclusion of RE will make a profound difference towards respecting the LGBT communities and inclusion in line with Equality Act 2010, it is not broad enough to tackle the issues of racism, Islamophobia and various other discriminations, as well as the challenging gun/knife crime violence. We believe a method of wholesome character education is the necessity and right of every child.",
        "background": "We would like the government to commission the DfE to introduce character education under PSHE which introduces children from a young age to the universal virtues of respect, fairness, forgiveness, forbearance, kindness and truthfulness as a specific methodology to help them internalise such virtues",
