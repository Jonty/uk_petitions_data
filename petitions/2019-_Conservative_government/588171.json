        "action": "Review access to IVF funding for couples with high BMI.",
        "additional_details": "The NHS themselves recently admitted to BMI being an inaccurate and outdated method of measuring someone's health. A woman may have a BMI that technically makes her obese but could be someone who has built a lot of muscle at the gym. Yet, under the current guidelines she would not be allowed to start a family unless she funded it herself. There is more focus on the woman's weight too for IVF and this therefore makes it a discriminatory issue affecting women more than men. This needs to change.",
        "background": "Currently CCGs use the outdated method of BMI to measure the weight and therefore health of couples struggling to conceive and wanting to apply for NHS funded IVF treatment. We want this to change. Please review access to IVF funding for couples with high BMI.",
