        "additional_details": "At present drivers over the age of 70 must renew their licence very 3 years, but there is no verification of whether they are medically fit to drive. Too many innocent lives are lost at the hands of elderly drivers. Require GPs to sign off on licence renewal for drivers over 70 could help prevent these.\r\n \r\nI lost my brother to an elderly driver with dementia driving the wrong way down a motorway. We believe current arrangements for renewal of driving licences for people over the age of 70 are inadequate, and action is need to improve road safety.",
        "background": "The Government should require that GPs sign off on the renewal of driving licences for over 70s, so that the DVLA can be made aware of any medical conditions an elderly driver has which may affect their ability to drive safely, rather than relying on declarations by the driver.",
