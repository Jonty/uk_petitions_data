        "additional_details": "Gas prices and the cost of living are very high. I live with disabilities and the colder the weather the worse my joints are. I can't afford to put my heating on for more than half an hour a day and when the weather drops below 0\u00b0C it's very hard.\r\n \r\nI believe with the cost of heating Cold Weather Payments should be issued after 3 consecutive days of 0\u00b0C weather, rather than 7.\r\n",
        "background": "Please issue Cold Weather Payments when there are 3 consecutive days where weather is recorded as, or forecast to be, 0\u00b0C or below, rather than after 7 days. The price of gas is through the roof and it's getting more expensive for people to put their heating on.",
