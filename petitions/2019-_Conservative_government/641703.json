        "additional_details": "The Government should introduce a scheme to provide compensation to people whose convictions are overturned automatically, immediately after their release.\r\n \r\nSuch compensation should be set at a level comparable to double their potential income had they not been jailed.\r\n \r\nThe practice of reducing compensation to reflect reduced living costs whilst in jail should end, and people whose compensation was reduced on this basis should receive additional compensation to make up for this.\r\n",
        "background": "Currently people imprisoned for crimes they did not commit have to make a claim for compensation when their conviction is overturned. Compensation is also capped, and can be reduced to reflect savings on living costs while imprisoned. We want compensation to be automatic, and more generous.\r\n.",
