        "additional_details": "Most asylum seekers don\u2019t know anything about immigration laws until they arrive: this policy will not prevent people from crossing. It will cost \u00a3120 million to the taxpayer at a time when the cost of living is rising.\r\nThese people have been through hell to escape war, famine and persecution. Have we truly given up on the values that make us British? No matter your political stance on migrants and refugees, this cannot be the way we deal with it. We must, as a country, say that this is too far.",
        "background": "Government plans to send those arriving in the UK by boat are immoral and violate our international agreements, including the UN Refugee Convention, of which the UK was a founding signatory. A similar policy in Australia has led to conditions so horrific that one third of children attempt suicide.",
