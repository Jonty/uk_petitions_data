        "action": "Suspend non-essential university teaching until 21 September 2020",
        "additional_details": "With students traveling all over the world to UK universities, there is a heightened risk that students from potential hotspots for Covid-19 could return to studying asymptomatic and spread the disease rapidly amongst the university population.\r\n\r\nMost students will only have a couple of weeks teaching after Easter, therefore suspending until 21 September will not have a massively detrimental impact for non-final year students, with most resources being available online.",
        "background": "With the Easter coming up, students will return home to potentially Covid-19 hotspots, both in the UK and worldwide, and may unknowingly bring the virus back to spread amongst students. Teaching for non-final year students should be suspended to limit Covid-19 spread until the next academic year.",
