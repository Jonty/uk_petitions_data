So many innocent dogs will be seized and possibly destroyed based on just how they look. Instead of banning breeds make backyard breeding illegal! Impose harsh prison sentences! Instead of banning breeds make it illegal to own certain breeds without a license. These things could be used instead of destroying innocent dogs and putting them and their owners under unnecessary stress!",
