They are also some of the lowest paid workers yet they provide the most valuable service to the country. They work tirelessly to provide for the country while putting their own lives, and those of their families, at risk for very little reward. It is about time this changed and some form of thank you given back to them. It isn't much but them not paying national insurance would greatly help them.",
