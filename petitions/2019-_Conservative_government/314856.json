        "additional_details": "Although it is becoming far more recognised in court, it is not specifically against the law to subject a child to this. If the other parent is on the birth certificate, legally they can withold the child from the other parent with no criminal repercussions. Parents who have lost some or all contact with their children for months or years following separation or divorce may lead to mental health problems. It can also lead to the children believing the other parent no longer loves them.",
        "background": "I am petitioning to change the law so that parent alienation becomes a chargeable offence. Manipulation of a child by one parent against the other has become so common in family breakdowns that it should be dealt with like other forms of neglect or child abuse.",
