        "additional_details": "During these difficult times, we can see how heroic our NHS staff are and they are struggling because of lack of funds.  We could have saved so many more lives with more testing, more ventilators and intensive care provisions.\r\n\r\nAlso as discussed the old TV licensing model is no longer fit for purpose in this modern age.  \r\n\r\nIf every household pays to the NHS instead of TV licensing this would provide \u00a34.35 billion for extra beds, nurses and essential services we all need",
        "background": "Every household is obliged to pay a certain amount of money for TV licensing, so the proposal is very simple.  We will be paying the same amount of money as we do for TV licensing, but instead of going to the BBC it will go for vital NHS provisions.",
