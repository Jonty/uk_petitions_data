        "additional_details": "Working in hospitality/retail for over 10 years, overtime is regularly required by employers and isn\u2019t always paid as it\u2019s not a legal requirement.\r\n \r\nMany staff are required by employers to do additional work, outside contracted hours, for no extra pay. This means that the employer can avoid taking on extra staff required to do the work. It also means the effective hourly rate of the worker is reduced.\r\n \r\nI believe requiring employers to pay for overtime they require workers to do will make environments such as hospitality better places to work and will encourage leaders of businesses to increase productivity and reduce workload pressures.\r\n",
