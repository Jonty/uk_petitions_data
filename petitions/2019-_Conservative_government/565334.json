        "additional_details": "Many students including myself have suffered tremendously last year when we went into lockdown and have fallen behind on content. Even after returning to school, many students have to self-isolate on several occasions causing them to fall further behind. It has affected many student's mental health. It is unfair for students to sit exams under these difficult circumstances. Scotland and Wales have already cancelled exams so it is only right for England to do the same.",
        "background": "All GCSEs and A-levels should be cancelled and there should be teacher assessed grades instead. Teachers should use any previous assessments and coursework to calculate grades.",
