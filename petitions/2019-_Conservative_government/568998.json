The hospitality sector is obviously not essential. \r\n\r\nHow can the Government tell people to stay home to save lives, but also allow the same people to go out for coffee? \r\n\r\nIf essential workers want to buy drinks or food, they can do so in the essential shops still open. \r\n\r\nAsking people to work in hospitality during a pandemic, when they are not key workers, is dangerous and irresponsible. \r\nLet them stay home, save more lives.",
