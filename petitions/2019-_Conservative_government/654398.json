        "action": "Create Sharia-compliant student finance for Muslim university students",
        "additional_details": "An alternative Sharia-complicit student finance option was proposed in 2013 and still there has been no progress on making it a reality. Many Muslim students refuse to go to university due to no alternative student finance option being available in order to fund their university tuition fees. Student loans are considered haram by the majority of Muslim scholars due to the involvement of interest, a major sin in Islam. This effectively restricts access to post 18 education to Muslims.",
        "background": "We would like the government to hurry up with making a Sharia-complicit student finance option accessible to thousands of Muslim students who are deterred from going to university due to interest based student loans which are not permissible in the religion of Islam.",
