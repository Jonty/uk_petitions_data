        "additional_details": "Roughly 151,000 people in the Uk currently know sign language. That\u2019s not even 1/3 or 1/5 of the population! Roughly 87,000 of those people feel lonely and isolated due to not being able to communicate, being bullied, not being able to express a need or want! It\u2019s so shocking, annoying and completely preventable by teaching sign language in mainstream education. \r\n\r\nThe UK is not supposed to be discriminatory and yet so many deaf or disabled people are being left out of basic social interaction.",
        "background": "Not even 1/5 of the current UK population know or use sign language. I would like it to become a priority to teach sign language in mainstream education.",
