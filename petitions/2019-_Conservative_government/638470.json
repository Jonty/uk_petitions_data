        "additional_details": "C-Sections are major surgery, and as a result the healing time for them is estimated to be around 6 weeks. When healing from a C-Section it is recommended that you do not do any heavy lifting, sudden movements, driving, and that you take time to heal at home. Therefore, you are likely to need help and support at home during this time, from your partner, especially with taking care and looking after your newborn baby. Extended paternity leave would support with this.",
        "background": "Paternity leave for partners of people giving birth is currently 2 weeks of paid leave from work. Having recently undergone an emergency C-Section myself, I believe that this should be extended from 2 weeks to 6 weeks, as this is the recommended healing time for people who have had C-Sections.",
