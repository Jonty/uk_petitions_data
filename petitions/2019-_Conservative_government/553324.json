        "additional_details": "The UK Government need to allow fans back into PL and EFL games (even at a reduced capacity initally) as clubs are currently on the brink due to lack of income that a matchday brings which could casue a community to lose its club.  On top of this, other events venues have been allowed to open (incl. indoors) where safety would be far more of a concern that an amout of people sitting in an outdoor arena watching football.  A football ground is far easier to socially distance than say a pub.",
        "background": "Football clubs that are often the centre of the community they are based in have had their doors closed since March.  Attending football matches is a release to many people and needs to reopen again just like Step 3 down.  Social distancing can be achieved safely in a Covid Secure football ground.",
