        "additional_details": "Instead of banning disposable vapes outright, we think the Government should introduce tougher regulation and restrictions, such as a ban on corner shops and off-licences from selling them, and requiring a 'challenge 25' policy.\r\n \r\nI use disposable vapes myself, as when you haven't got the liquids and coils for the rechargeable ones you may need rely on disposables. A ban could mean some people revert back to smoking.",
        "background": "I am an adult smoker who is trying to quit using vapes and am appalled by the possibility of disposable vapes being banned. I understand that there is a growing problem with under 18s gaining access to vapes but the danger is that adults will suffer as a consequence of any ban.",
