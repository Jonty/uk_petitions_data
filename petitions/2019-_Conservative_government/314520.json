It is questioned we can now afford HS2; \r\n4.\tCovid-19 has left a society shocked and emotionally shaken. The nation needs to heal; this project could lead to more division.",
        "background": "A review of HS2 due to enormous changes in the last month, which significantly alter the basis on which the original decision was made.  \r\n \r\nThe review should consider data on anticipated journeys, demands on public expenditure, increased national debt and the potential impact of Covid 19.",
