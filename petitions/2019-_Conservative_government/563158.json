        "additional_details": "At the moment there is wide spread publicity on the harm Climate Change/CO2 is damaging our planet, there is no publicity to counter this claim whatsoever. This is the most important issue the public will be made to endure, more than the Covid-19 as it will create an economic and social Armageddon which will, if ever, take decades to\r\nrecover from. Democracy must prevail by informing the public in a series of live debates by leading scientists from around the world who can present all their facts, records that will leave no one in any doubt as to the truth and falsehood of individual claims.",
        "background": "Want the government to invite leading scientists to present facts, records in a public/media live debate to prove/disprove whether impact of Climate Change/ CO2 is harmful or good for the planet.",
