        "action": "Call for a No Confidence Motion in the government if it breaks international law",
        "additional_details": "Britain for many years has been well respected for upholding its international obligations and the rule of law. If Britain breaks international law, our reputation will be permanently damaged. This will make it harder for other countries to trust our government in future trade negotiations, which could further damage the UK economy post-Covid. It will also facilitate the break-up of the Union. A no confidence motion is essential to protecting Britain's national interest.",
        "background": "The Internal Markets Bill breaks international law. If the motion to pass this law succeeds, this petition would like parliament to pass a no confidence motion in the government. Britain must meet its international obligations and breaking international law would damage the UK's reputation.",
