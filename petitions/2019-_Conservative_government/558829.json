        "additional_details": "Currently there are no serious plans to safely house rough sleepers during the WINTER lockdown..! Despite the well documented success the previous scheme had in helping people to get back their feet and stay off the street, the government has no plans to extend the same help to those remaining on the street or made homeless since then. Instead they will either be left out in the cold or crammed into shelters where proper social distancing is impossible. This is not at all logical or fair.",
        "background": "Reinstate the \"Everyone In\" Scheme for the second, and any further, lockdowns. Ensure that rough sleepers and other homeless people are not left to die on the winter streets without people around to support them, or forced into overcrowded shelters where proper social distancing is impossible.",
