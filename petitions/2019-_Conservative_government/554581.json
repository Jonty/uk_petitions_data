        "additional_details": "There have been many black innovators, poets, writers, scientists and  martyrs that have never been talked about in school despite the impact that they have had on today's world and society. As an individual that has been through the governments national and GCSE curriculum, I find it very preposterous that there has been no scope for teachers to do so and so I feel like this should be changed.",
        "background": "Instead of only having one month of the year dedicated to our black history, I want the Government to change our national and GCSE curriculum to teach students around the country about our black history which has been segregated from the rest.",
