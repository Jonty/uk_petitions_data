        "additional_details": "This petition is being put forward to make sure that everyone working in the hospitality industry is being taken care of in the same way as everyone else in other industries. It isn\u2019t right that we should lose out on a huge part of our salary, sometimes up to 40-60%, if according to the scheme we should be getting 80% of our total earnings; these earnings include service charge.",
        "background": "In the hospitality industry, a large portion of our salary is made up of service charge/tronc. As a result of the government not including this in the \u2018CJRS\u2019, we are receiving significantly less than 80% of our total salary. Service charge is taxable income, and so it should be included in furlough.",
