        "action": "Grant an amnesty for undocumented migrants living in the UK for 7+ years.",
        "additional_details": "Granting an amnesty for undocumented migrants is a human rights issue and has been considered and/or implemented by several other countries. Ireland is a recent example, where an amnesty was granted for those who were living in the country for 4+ years. The United Kingdom should also take a similar humanitarian approach to improve the lives of many people across the country and be able to contribute to the society, it\u2019s culture and play their part in improving the economy.",
        "background": "Undocumented migrants in the UK are living in inhumane conditions, unable to find proper housing, healthcare and jobs. Regularising undocumented migrants with no criminal history in the country can help with the mental health of the individual and provide the country with more tax-paying residents.",
