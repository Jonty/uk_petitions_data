        "additional_details": "By promoting it into Group A of the Crown Jewels list, it will ensure the exposure of the international game, and ensure that the game in general does not require a paywall to watch whatsoever. For example if you want to watch Premiership Rugby? TNT Sports, for Autumn Internationals? Amazon Prime and for summer and Lions Tours? Sky Sports. Nearly every opportunity to watch Rugby is LOCKED behind a subscription, except for the Six Nations. It should be preserved by our laws to help the game grow",
        "background": "The 6 Nations is the oldest rugby tournament in the world, as such it should be made accessible to everyone interested or potentially interested in the sport because it\u2019s the only annual time of the year international rugby is free to air.",
