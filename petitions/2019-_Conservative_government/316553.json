        "action": "Ensure only the wealthiest companies and individuals pay for COVID-19 bailouts",
        "additional_details": "It is wrong for taxpayer bailouts to pay for shareholder dividends, or for companies owned by tax exiles or with offshore tax avoidance schemes to profit from taxpayer support. We cannot rely on 'Trickle-down' economics to repay the additional debt from COVID-19. Measures such as temporarily increasing the income tax top rate, temporary use of the 'Robin Hood' tax, and the taxpayer taking shares in bailed-out companies until fully repaid, would restore our economy without hurting the majority.",
        "background": "Taxpayer losses from COVID-19 will be considerable, leading to unprecedented national debt or severe public spending cuts. A cross-party and stakeholder panel (inc TUC & CBI) should decide how those with the most resources pay these costs, prioritising the real economy over supporting share prices.",
