        "additional_details": "It is ridiculous that students pay between \u00a39,250-\u00a317,000 a year and especially for this year where we\u2019ve had to endure 2 teachers strikes and now the corona virus that has meant students would of course rather stay at home. There is now computer learning but this does not make up for the lack of teaching we have had. This is not meant to be a complaint, but with the lack of information we are receiving and various other factors and questions students have, it seems only fair to do this",
        "background": "We would like to see all students studying in the 2019/20 year have all student fees and maintenance fees reimbursed due to the combination of teacher strikes and COVID-19 outbreak that has caused students to lose learning and in turn could mean they get lower marks.",
