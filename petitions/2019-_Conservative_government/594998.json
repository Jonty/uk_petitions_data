Do you know how hard it is to work in the nhs? I\u2019m not even asking to rise the wages because obviously it\u2019s like trying to get blood out of stone from you lot. Just asking to exempt us from taxation, or lower it to 1% at least.",
        "background": "Either don\u2019t tax nhs workers or tax them little as possible, because it\u2019s ridiculous how we get paid by government but still have to give that money back, it\u2019s funny how mp\u2019s get a pay rise, nhs workers get so little pay rise and get taxed.",
