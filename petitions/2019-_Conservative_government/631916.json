        "additional_details": "It\u2019s an unfair, unpredictable and unnecessary charge. Consumers are paying for a meter that  benefits the electricity supplier more than the consumer. Electricity is never cheap and adding this unreasonable charge is simply a way of making more guaranteed money for the supplier, especially if the consumer tries to cut down on consumption",
        "background": "Electricity companies should not be able to add an additional charge for a meter once it\u2019s installed. Not only do consumers pay for the meter over and over again ; the cost is at the whim of the supplier. Oil tanks and internet routers, once paid for, aren\u2019t subject to further charges",
