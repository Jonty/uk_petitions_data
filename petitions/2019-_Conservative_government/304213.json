        "additional_details": "During the spread of Covid-19 people are being advised to avoid public places such as bars, transport and cinemas. This means staff in the service industry don't have employment and probably have little money. Forcing financial institutions to freeze mortgages and loans means people temporarily out of work don't have that added stress of eviction or bankruptcy.",
        "background": "Legislate to freeze mortgages and loans for 6 months so people don't have financial concerns during the Covid-19 crisis. Financial institutions won't lose out in the long term but it gives people respite during this emergency.",
