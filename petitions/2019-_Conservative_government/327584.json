        "additional_details": "My girlfriend is an international student finishing her studies in 2020 and isn\u2019t given the same opportunity to pursue professional development. Her parents have also poured huge amounts of money into her being able to go to university in the UK, however, these tough restrictions make it difficult to pursue these goals. Additionally, with the introduction of extended post-study visas for new students, I feel it\u2019s highly unfair for her to be limited to just 5 months instead of 2 years.",
        "background": "Extend post-study visas for current international students to the same 2 year post-study visa new international students are receiving. Thousands of current international students aren\u2019t able to get the same opportunity to chase careers goals even though they\u2019ve poured time and money into the UK.",
