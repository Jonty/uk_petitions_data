        "additional_details": "As health and social care workers our job puts our mental and physical health at risk as shown during COVID 19.  \r\nMost of us in the sector are underpaid in regards to the cost of living for the past decade. We who work in hospitals/care homes are at constant risk of picking up an infection and other illnesses, which inevitably results in having to pay for our medicines. The fact we are paying for the medicine is unfair as it is an occupational hazard, in which most scenarios are unavoidable.",
        "background": "We appreciate all the gratitude we are getting,however this simply does not solve day to day issues we come across.On behalf of all the health, social and allied health care professionals I request our Prime Minister to abolish the prescription charge we have to pay currently for our medicines.",
