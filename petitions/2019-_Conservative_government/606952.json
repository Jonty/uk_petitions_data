        "additional_details": "Abolish new laws allowing bicycles to ride side by side and only allowing overtaking for a bicycle if 1.5 meters between bicycle and vehicle. If two bicycles are riding side by side on a single lane road it makes overtaking them impossible as you can\u2019t be 1.5 meters away from the second bicycle if they ride side by side in a single carriageway road\r\nIt\u2019s an insult to drivers that pay insurance, road tax and have insurance to allow a mode of transport that has none of the above and no number plate",
        "background": "Stopnew Highway Code laws allowing bicycles to ride side by side on single lane roads including the law stating no overtaking unless you give the bicycle 1.5 meters distance between the vehicle and the bicycle which if two bikes are taking up a single lane makes it impossible to overtake !",
