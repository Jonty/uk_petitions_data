        "additional_details": "The voting turnout in the UK has been decreasing over the years. People have lost faith in politicians, some people wreck their ballot paper so that it becomes void, others just don't go to vote.\r\n\r\nI believe that everyone who is eligible should vote, however I have found myself looking at Ballot Papers and thinking is there anyone worth voting for?\r\n\r\nIf an Abstain Option was added then voters could use this if they were not happy with the candidates on the Ballot paper, these should also be counted as if they were for candidates. Hopefully this would then allow politicians to work out what needs doing to get people interested in candidates and policies for future elections.",
