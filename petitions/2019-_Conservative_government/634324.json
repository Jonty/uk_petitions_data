        "action": "Reduce VAT rates for replacement components for consumer electronics",
        "additional_details": "This should help to reduce landfill and e-waste and assist the emerging independent industry. It could also encourage legitimisation in the industry by making safe and well-sourced components more affordable, as well as mitigating the extortionate cost of existing OEM \u201cSelf Repair Programmes\u201d. It could also encourage a generation of self-repair to make technology more sustainable and also reduce the attraction of the 'black market' of electrical components, where illegal sales avoid tax entirely.",
        "background": "We are requesting a reduction of VAT rates for replacement components for consumer electronics such as mobile phones, tablets and game consoles \u2013 with a view to reducing the cost of these components by up to 20%, and making repair a more viable alternative to \"replacement\", to reduce e-waste.",
