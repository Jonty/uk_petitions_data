        "additional_details": "This is animal abuse on a massive scale, and a stain on their \r\ninternational reputations. It is estimated millions of dogs & cats are slaughtered each year for their meat. Many are stolen pets or strays who are typically beaten to death, skinned, boiled or burnt alive. There can be no excuse for the intolerable suffering and cruelty these animals are facing as a result of this trade. Let\u2019s make the UK the worldwide leader in getting this dreadful & inhumane slaughter ended NOW.",
        "background": "We respectfully request that the UK Government use its political strength and global reach to put pressure on China & Korea to completely eradicate the torture & slaughter of cats & dogs for human consumption. This could be done by imposing trade sanctions on their respective countries.",
