        "additional_details": "Students are living in fear - I think we can all agree on that. Covid-19 is ramped through universities, lots of students are isolating & the ones who aren't, are worrying about catching this killer virus. In the meantime they are paying \u00a39250 a year for the privilege of telling lectures how to use Microsoft teams, begging the university internet doesn't drop out for the second team this seminar and waiting for the live stream to unfreeze and work out how much they've missed. BUT it's our fault?",
        "background": "We want the government to partially refund students' tuition fees, this is because all learning is done on-line which not the same experience as the one we're paying for.",
