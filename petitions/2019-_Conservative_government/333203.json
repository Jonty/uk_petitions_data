        "additional_details": "In an election there may be no candidate that an individual can support.   This may be due to religion or ideology. \r\nA Jew or Muslim or Vegetarian may not want to be forced to pay for the factory farming and slaughter of pork.   \r\nA Christian may not want to be complicit in the funding of abortion. \r\nCurrently there is no option for people of other religions or ideologies than the majority to withhold consent and remove their moral complicity. \r\nVoting has to include the chance to say no.",
        "background": "Consent is the basis of a free society.   The right to say no to anything is a fundamental principle of liberty.   As the UK has drifted from being a secular, common law society to a collectivist, civil law society, coercive complicity has become normal.",
