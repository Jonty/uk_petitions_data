Increased funding could address this.\r\n \r\nOne school in my area only has 1 SENCo to 130 children and following the pandemic SEN needs have risen dramatically, and I don't believe this is sufficient to support every child to their full potential. More money needs to be given to mainstream schools for SEN children to ensure adequate support is provided\r\n",

Too many SEN children are just getting by, which is not good enough. They deserve a full education like everyone else",
