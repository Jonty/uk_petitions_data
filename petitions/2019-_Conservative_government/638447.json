        "additional_details": "The rate of knife crime is ever increasing, its an everyday thing. Our laws in knife crime does not phase the majority. It seems like an every day accessory. To many good people are either losing their loved ones to street knife robberies, or being held at knife point losing belongings and then being affected mentally. This is vast growing. If we put something like this in place a few will fall but many will not follow. It's got out of hand and needs to be clamped down to reassure the normal.",
        "background": "Put fear into those that carry knives. I feel the law should be if you are caught carrying any form of sharp object, it should be 1 to 5 years in prison dependant of any previous convictions. I if you attack anyone with a sharp object and cause bodily harm you get life regardless of the outcome.",
