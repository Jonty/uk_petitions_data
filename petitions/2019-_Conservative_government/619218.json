        "additional_details": "Because this is no longer an age where women stay at home to raise the family. Women now work and only get the standard 22 days holiday a year, which is impossible to cover the 13 weeks children get in the UK and puts immense pressure on families, to pay a fortune in alternative child care costs, which most families can not afford.",
        "background": "Reduce the amount of school holidays and inset days children in the UK have. Id like the Government to scrap the February and October half term and also reduce the 6 weeks holiday to 2 weeks or at the most 3 weeks.",
