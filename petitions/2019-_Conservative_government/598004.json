        "additional_details": "In 2020 where LGBT partnerships and marriages are accepted under the law as per the Marriage Act 2013, the law should also provide for LGBT extra-marital affairs. Currently, married couples are unable to sue for divorce on the grounds of adultery if their partner has engaged in sexual conduct with a member of the same sex. This does not provide LGBT equality in the eyes of the law.\r\n\r\nIt can also be very harming and traumatic for the person who wants to get divorced but doesn\u2019t legally have the grounds.",
        "background": "I want Section 1(6) of MCA 1973 to be updated to reflect LGBT lifestyles, so that conduct between the respondent and a person of the same sex may constitute adultery. Currently in divorce law, only conduct between the respondent and a person of the opposite sex qualifies.",
