        "additional_details": "We are being told to practice social distancing, yet are unable to do this whilst still using public transport to work, or by serving the public with non-essential items. A large number of high street retailers have taken the sensible decision to close their shops in order to protect their staff and their customers. Small independent retailers may not have the financial backing to do the same, so are remaining open during this crisis, putting their employees at risk of infection.",
        "background": "Please mandate closure of non-essential retail outlets to protect workers and their families. The government has promised 80% of wages to be covered if closure is due to the current corona virus but this only applies to businesses mandated to close, so employers are still forcing workers to attend.",
