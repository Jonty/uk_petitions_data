Why is it that our public services don\u2019t seem to keep up? \r\n\r\nHaving had insight working in a hospital, I can say that there doesn\u2019t seem to be much innovation and where there is, it is typically only for a small portion of the country. We don\u2019t seem to innovate. Why not use drones in the police force or in the coastguard? Or even go as far to introduce an Estonian style e-police system? Why not send emergency messages via text?",

Make it easier and more efficient to report incidents to police, and innovate in creative uses of technology in the frontline services.",
