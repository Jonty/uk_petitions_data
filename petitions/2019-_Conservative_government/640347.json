Children who breathe in secondhand smoke have an increased risk of:\r\n \r\n- cot death (sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS) \r\n- developing asthma (smoking can also trigger asthma attacks in children who already have the condition), \r\n- serious respiratory (breathing) conditions such as bronchitis and pneumonia \r\n- meningitis \r\n- more susceptible to coughs and colds\r\n \r\nChildren seeing adults smoking also normalises it.",
