        "action": "Make provision for 2022's level 2 and 3 qualifications to be fairer to students",
        "additional_details": "Given that the last year has seen unprecedented disruption to education  and the insane levels of dependence on exams in GCSEs and A levels, this petition demands that the Department for Education reduces the dependence on exams for the 2022 exam season, and to establish a robust system of teacher assessment and coursework to comprise at least 50% of any given student's grade. This would allow for students to get a more representative grade, while also incorporating some elements of exams.",
        "background": "This petition calls on Government, specifically the DfE to make all GCSEs and A levels to be sat in 2022 be based at least 50% on coursework and teacher assessment, and to reduce the role of exams, given the disruption that those who will take them in 2022 suffered over the last 12 months.",
