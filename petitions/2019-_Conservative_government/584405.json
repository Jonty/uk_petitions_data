National Statistics show that for the last 10 years teachers have been effectively stuck on the same wage since they first started. For what they do for the UK they deserve a much more higher wage.",

They are securing futures for children and are getting payed pennies. Unlike the NHS, teachers have received no recognition for their work during COVID.",
