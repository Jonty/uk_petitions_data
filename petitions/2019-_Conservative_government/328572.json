        "additional_details": "Teenagers have to move from CAMHS to AMHS when they reach the age of 18. Just because they are legally an adult does not mean they are mentally an adult. Waiting times for AMHS are averaging at 200 days. That\u2019s 200 days for a vulnerable 18-year-old could be alone and without help, feeling stranded. Eighteen is a difficult age. Is it really the time for such a tremendous change, moving them from CAMHS to an over-stretched adult mental health service?",
        "background": "CAMHS should offer their services to young adults up to the age of 21 rather than 18. Or at least until that young person has a secured appointment with AMHS. Only 6.7% of Mental Health spending goes to CAMHS, but raising the age can mean funding can be more fairly shared out.",
