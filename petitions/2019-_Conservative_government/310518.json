I feel strongly that we should support all our NHS workers by giving them something back after doing such an amazing job in these unprecedented times.",

I believe that an increase of 5 pence in national insurance should be made to create funds to increase NHS salaries. This should increase ALL workers and not for the maintenance of hospitals.",
