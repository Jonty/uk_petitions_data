They are really useful and serve a good purpose. As the mother of an autistic child I would endorse them. However, they are widely available and can be bought by anyone for a couple of pounds. This has left them open to misuse which is detrimental to their purpose. I would like the Government to establish an official scheme where documentation is issued to those diagnosed with a hidden disability.",
