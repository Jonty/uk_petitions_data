        "additional_details": "We believe current DfE guidance puts both the well being of pupils and the economic stability of the outdoor education sector into peril. There is already current government guidance on accommodation, travel and activities that would allow overnight educational visits to happen in a Covid secure and professionally managed environment. Children have missed enough of their education and this change would be invaluable in re-engaging pupils back into education whilst nurturing their well being and mental health.",

To allow pupils to attend in the same groups they already have contact with in school.",
