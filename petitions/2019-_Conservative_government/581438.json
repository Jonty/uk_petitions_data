        "additional_details": "Improve mental health services for young people and adults. The NHS desperately require better funding, they need more staff and better training. Shorter waiting lists and longer appointment times for many people. Yes anti depressents can help, but I belive it's not getting to the core of the illness. \r\n\r\nMental health services are currently struggling to accommodate appropriate early intervention and treatment plans due to being understaffed and underfunded. Mental health is just as important as physical health and many young people and  adults suffer alone. We need to change this. \r\n\r\nWaiting lists are ridiculous, and mental health can't be fixed in matter of 6/8 weeks. \r\n\r\nBring mental health awareness into the schools. \r\n\r\nBetter funding could literally save lives.",
        "background": "Mental health is still a taboo subject. Since covid 19, more and more people now are in need of support. Mental health services funding needs looking at more then ever now.",
