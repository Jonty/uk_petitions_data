        "action": "Do not introduce Vehicle Excise Duty for zero emission cars",
        "additional_details": "We believe this change will not make this fairer as zero emission vehicle owners are helping the government achieve its zero emissions goal by paying a premium on these electric cars. Now the Government wants owners of zero emission vehicle to pay VED when their vehicles don't emit CO2? VED is based on CO2 emissions and we believe that cars that don't emit CO2 shouldn't have to pay VED. We think this will lead to more people using cars that burn fossil fuels for longer, and so cause greater harm to the environment. We also believe this could push people to leave the country to go to places with different tax regimes.",
        "background": "I would like plans to introduce Vehicle Excise Duty for zero emission cars to be withdrawn, as this may steer people away from getting an electric car and stop the government from reaching its zero emissions goal.",
