        "additional_details": "One of the major uses of it is as an antifreeze agent in cars. It is an odourless, colourless, sweet-tasting, vicious liquid\r\n \r\nAn all-out ban within the UK is not a feasible, due to the need of it in the products we use daily.\r\n \r\nHowever, the need to limit the malicious use of ethylene glycol for anything other than it's intended purpose is clear, humans not just using it to accidentally or deliberately poison animals but as a form of inebriation.",
        "background": "This petition is calling on Her Majesty's Government to take swift and decisive action making it law from the 1st January 2022 that all products that are sold with ethylene glycol to have denatonium benzoate added to it to stop it from being accidentally or deliberately consumed.",
