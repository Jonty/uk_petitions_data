        "additional_details": "As the Royal family are an important institution to the UK & the Commonwealth and as Queen Elizabeth II & her husband Prince Philip are in the highest risk category for COVID-19, they should be given priority to receive the first doses of the first available vaccine. Furthermore, the Royal family as a whole and all MP's of the UK & Ireland are just as important and should also be amongst the first in line. Without them there would be no continuity of Government in the event the pandemic worsens.",

As these institutions are fundamental to the running of the country, it is extremely important that they be protected from COVID-19 as urgently as possible.",
