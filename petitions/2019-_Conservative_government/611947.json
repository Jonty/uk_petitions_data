        "additional_details": "There is a Childrens playground inside this park. Lots of children play inside this park on a daily basis. Despite the gate being fixed several times, people still leave it open.\r\nCars come speeding down this road and often in the wrong direction (despite it being one way). There are slow and 20 MPH signs but these are often ignored. \r\nCars park all the way up to the entrance of the park and the road is very narrow so there is no way for cars to see families coming out of the park.",
        "background": "Could the Government help us in talking to Westminster Council or Highways services to put a zebra crossing outside of the entrance of Porchester Square Gardens, W2, Bayswater, London. \r\nMy 2 year old ran out onto the road, despite the gated entrance, and was inches away from being hit by a minibus.",
