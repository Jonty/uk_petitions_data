        "additional_details": "According to the pollster, the most popular reason people want an early election (46%) is because the country is in \u201ccrisis\u201d and needs to decide a way forward.  Our PM was voted in by a members only vote, and it should not be allowed to happen.  If a PM is ousted by their party, then it should be an immediate General Election allowing ALL to vote",
        "background": "Hold a General Election immediately to give the voting public an opportunity to vote for a party than can do better than the Conservatives.  Boris Johnson was voted in and NOT Liz Truss and we think this rule needs to change to allow PM's forced out to have a GE not a party only vote",
