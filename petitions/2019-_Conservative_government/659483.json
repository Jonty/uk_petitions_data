        "additional_details": "The ONS 23-24 forecast \u00a3950.5 billion Tax Rev (TR) and \u00a32,573 Billion (GDP). UK figures are approaching 37.7 % TR/GDP in 26/27 but little account is taken of the number of, say, pay rolled employees going up and comparison with other countries which still shows the UK at 16th (cf current 28th) and still  below EU14 average.  An increase of 1p for employees in say income bracket (\u00a350-100K) would realise  approximately \u00a32.7 billion.   This is just one of many potential tax revenue sources.",
        "background": "I would like Parliament to acknowledge, contrary to the general narrative, that tax rises are not always bad.  In an economy (2021 ONS) with \u00a311.4 trillion of assets and a balance of payments deficit and with public services generally under pressure tax rises should be seen as a common sense option.",
