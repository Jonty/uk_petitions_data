        "action": "Legalise Piper Methysticum (Kava) in the United Kingdom",
        "additional_details": "Kava is a natural medicinal herb from the islands of the South Pacific, it has been used for hundreds of years by local cultures. There has been no real study of the damaging effects that Kava has on individuals. Since the UK followed EU countries in banning Kava in 2003, EU countries have since over turned their decision to ban. They have based this decision on the fact that people who have suffered liver damage, Kava was not been the sole underlying cause.",
        "background": "I'm asking the government to look at carrying out a proper study to address the concerns and make Kava legal within the UK. This is a very important part of my culture along with lots of other South Pacific Islanders that live within the UK. It's a traditional drink used for different ceremonies.",
