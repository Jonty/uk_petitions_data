If a family is unaware of this fund, and a funeral director does not claim for their fees from the fund the family can be left out of pocket.\r\n \r\nWe believe that only family members should be able to claim fees from the Children\u2019s Funeral Fund, to ensure that families do not miss out on this support.\r\n",
