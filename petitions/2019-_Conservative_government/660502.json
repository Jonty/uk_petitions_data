        "additional_details": "However, airfields are often mostly grass land. Reclassifying them as green belt could help protect our green countryside, protect local employment and protect general aviation.\r\n\r\nGeneral Aviation airfields are home to wild flowers, plants and grasses as well as many small animals and birds such as Skylarks which are on the red list. Many future commercial pilots start their training at these airfields\r\n \r\nWe can protect GA airfields from being so vulnerable to closure by designating them as greenfield sites. This could help to achieve the government\u2019s strategy to achieve JetZero and NetZero- as well as help to cement the UK as a world leader in general aviation.\r\n",
