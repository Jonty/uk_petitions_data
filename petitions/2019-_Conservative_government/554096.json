Being separated from family is incredibly damaging and this simply cannot keep going on. We have no end goal here, we are going around in circles and this is incredibly damaging. I feel the government has forgotten the toll this is taking. This action is not right anymore we cannot go backwards. We need to move forward and accept this isn't right. My comments are also backed by experts urging an end to restrictions",

The solution is now becoming worse than the problem. This cannot keep going on like this. I urge the government to end restrictions but protect the vulnerable.",
