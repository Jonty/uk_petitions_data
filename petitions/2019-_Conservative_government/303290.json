        "additional_details": "On 4th of March, India had 29 cases and UK had 85 cases. On 15th March, India had 110 cases (2 deaths) and the UK had 1372 cases (35 deaths). \r\n\r\nThe only difference India has done is conduct screening at the borders. The difference in data is stark\r\n\r\nTo support and succeed in its approach the UK needs to start screening. This is the reason for the petition. Please support the immediate need to screen at our borders.",
        "background": "The UK govt has taken a conservative and pragmatic approach with the delay initiative and lack of lock downs. We must trust our leaders to make the right decisions.  However, it\u2019s important to screen people at borders (which remain open) v depending only on people reporting their travel movements",
