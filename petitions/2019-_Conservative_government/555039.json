Luckily, there is no evidence that dogs or cats are being eaten in the UK to date, but there are no current laws against this.\r\n \r\nWe know that there has been no documented cases of this in the UK, but it is important to set an example so we can encourage other countries to make animal welfare laws. With this ban, we can help make changes worldwide and join other countries and cities (US, Taiwan, Hong Kong etc) that have already made this illegal.",
