        "action": "Allow non-lethal self defense items for UK citizens.",
        "additional_details": "Recent terror attacks, acid attacks, rapes and stabbings against innocent unarmed civilians is becoming commonplace. Pepper spray, perfectly legal in other EU countries with no issues is classed as a section 5 firearm- the same as a machine gun. A young woman carrying pepper spray to defend against a rapist would be looking at 5 years jail- yes, you read that right. It's a terrible injustice that vital PPE isn't available to the law abiding. We cannot have more defenseless victims.",
        "background": "Repeal the ban on non-lethal self defense items like pepper spray for UK citizens personal protection. As violent sexual crimes against young women and stabbings and terror attacks increase, the average law abiding citizen is completely defenseless and has zero legal rights of self defense.",
