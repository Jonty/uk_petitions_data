        "additional_details": "The country is facing a mental health crisis. A distinct number operating 24 hours a day every day sends out a powerful message that we take mental health emergencies as seriously as other medical emergencies. This will help reduce the stigma surrounding suicide and mental illness.\r\n \r\nThe helpline will relieve pressure on 999 services, particularly the police, and hospital A&E services, so freeing up already stretched resources to deal with other emergencies.",
        "background": "As the equivalent of 999, an easily remembered number will make it simpler for people in crisis to access the help they desperately need. The helpline would be provided by the NHS and answered by trained mental health professionals. Callers would be assessed and routed to the appropriate service.",
