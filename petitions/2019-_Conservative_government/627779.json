As of 30 June 2022, 122,213 cases were pending initial decisions.\r\n \r\nThe inefficiency of the processing of asylum applications is contributing the ongoing costs of housing asylum seekers, with over \u00a36.5 million a day spent on housing asylum seekers in hotels. Meanwhile, the time of asylum seekers has been wasted waiting for their decisions in often overcrowded temporary accommodation.\r\n",
