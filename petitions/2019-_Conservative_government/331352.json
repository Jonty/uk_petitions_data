        "additional_details": "English citizens deserve to be protected from the virus. Committing to a strategy of zero COVID-19 will save lives and save individuals from living with ongoing heath issues caused by the disease. Zero COVID-19 will aid the country in its economic recovery. People will feel more confident to go back to their normal lives and their old spending habits if the risk from the virus is minimised. England will be at an economic disadvantage if other countries eliminate the disease and we do not",
        "background": "COVID-19 is containable as other countries have proved. The Government should publicly commit to and pursue a strategy that aims to eliminate COVID-19 in England. This strategy is being pursued in other parts of the UK",
