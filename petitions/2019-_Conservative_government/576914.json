Furthermore, at present Stealing or Kidnapping a Pet (Primarily Dogs) does not offer any sort of Justifiable Sentence which would give Justice to a Pet Owner.  Animals feel Pain, Stress and this is also felt by their Owners - Pets are part of the Family not an Inanimate Possession.",

In that Arena Pets are Treated in the same way as Damage to a Car.  The Law currently does not take into Account the Support, Love and Health Benefits that Animals Give.",

Anyone who is cruel to an animal, or does not provide for its welfare needs, may be banned from owning animals, fined up to \u00a320,000 and/or sent to prison. It is up to the police, Crown Prosecution Service and courts to investigate alleged offences and prosecute these.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petitions, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nImplement an Animal Bill of Rights protecting all species of animals: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/561124\r\n\r\nCreate a public register of people banned from keeping animals in the UK: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/573147\r\n\r\nIncrease sentences for all animal cruelty offences: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/565404\r\n\r\nIf you would like the Government to make a specific change to the law different to the above petition you could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
