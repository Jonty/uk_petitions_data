        "additional_details": "The Department for Education (DfE) has confirmed that in view of the disruption caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, during 2024 GCSE exams it is not necessary for students to memorise formulae for GCSE mathematics and equations for GCSE physics and combined science, as they must in a normal year. The students sitting these exams in 2025 have been affected in exactly the same way (missing secondary school time etc), and this support should be extended into 2025 to reflect this.",
        "background": "Ensure students sitting GCSEs in 2025 have support materials, in the form of formulae and revised equation sheets, in the exams for GCSE mathematics, physics and combined science. This has been provided in previous years, and is planned for 2024 GCSEs, due to the effects of the pandemic.",
