As a loyal customer of Tesco, I have noticed that the current price of the meal deal is quite expensive and it is putting a strain on the budget of many consumers.\r\n\r\nThe current price of the meal deal is simply too expensive for many consumers, particularly those on a tight budget. Many people rely on the meal deal as a quick and affordable lunch option, and the current price is making it difficult for them to access nutritious and filling meals.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I urge the government to take action and force Tesco to reduce the price of their meal deal to \u00a33. This would be a significant step towards ensuring that all consumers have access to affordable and nutritious food options.",
