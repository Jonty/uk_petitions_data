        "additional_details": "Fraud costs the UK economy billions of pounds per year. It has also been reported that fraud helps fund serious organised crime. Requiring insurance companies to carry out a simple identity check prior granting insurance will help combat this, and help the UK economy. It will also help protect many individual members of the public from the hassle and anxiety of falling victim to identity theft and insurance fraud.",
        "background": "It is too easy to commit insurance fraud in the UK. Many UK insurance companies do not ask for ID from the policyholder prior to granting insurance. Please make it a legal requirement that an insurance company asks for and checks a policyholder's ID prior to a new policy being allowed to start.",
