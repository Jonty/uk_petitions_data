        "additional_details": "Our industry is one of the most hygienic places a member of the general public can visit - even more so now with the long list of measures brought in to keep the public safe during their haircut. We are an industry of small business owners and self employed who cater not only to the physical appearance of our clients but also act as a stand in counsellor/someone to talk to. We have spend thousands on PPE and account for almost none of the cases YET education which accounts for over 40% is open.",
        "background": "I would like the government to allow the barbering and hair industry to re-open. The advice from sage to the hair and beauty council was that our already crippled industry and non-essential retail only account for 0.5 percent of cases which means there is zero science backing our need to close.",
