        "additional_details": "Football is the one of the foundations of modern UK culture. Over recent years it has grown increasingly expensive for fans to follow their teams as media giants such as Sky and BT monopolise the tv rights and move games behind a pay-wall. Access to these games often comes at a significant cost to households many of which are struggling in light of the recent pandemic. Rather than giving back to customers during a difficult time these media giants have seen an opportunity to monetise further.",
        "background": "We want the government to protect our national sport (Football) from the monopoly of BT and Sky Sports who are using the pandemic and lack of event attendance to cash in by moving scheduled match broadcasts to PPV.",
