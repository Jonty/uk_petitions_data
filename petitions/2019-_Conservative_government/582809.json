Regulation will motivate them to improve their services.\r\n\r\nLost parcels are a common problem, with some victims of the loss finding their items on sale online and other people reporting buying lots at auction to find that many still have address labels on or the sender can be identified once the parcel is opened. Incremental fines should be imposed according to the number and the value of parcels they fail to deliver. Repeated high failures to result in closure of business as untenable.",
