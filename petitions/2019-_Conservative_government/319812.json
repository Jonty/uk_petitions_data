        "additional_details": "On 7th May 2020, Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England said 'all go and get your flu jabs this year' during the UK government daily Coronavirus briefing. We are calling for the government to make this a national universal rollout of a free vaccine, expanding from the 25 million people that were offered a free flu vaccine in 2019. We believe that vaccinating more people against the flu in 2020 will help free up hospital beds which is critical in our battle against coronavirus.",
        "background": "In order to help our NHS cope with the Coronavirus outbreak, we call on the government to ensure every person gets a free flu vaccine. This should free up beds in hospitals and ensure that even age groups not usually vaccinated do not act as spreaders of what can be a very serious illness.",
