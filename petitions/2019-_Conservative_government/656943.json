        "additional_details": "The UK government should consider an additional programme whereby girls age 15-16 (year 11), are taught about the symptoms of menopause. What changes to expect, a realistic age range, how to ask for confirmation from their GP, and discuss how this can be managed and the function of HRT. Specifically discuss the mental health factors, given a rise in menopausal women leaning towards alcohol because of the related depression.",
        "background": "In the UK, girls aged 9-11 are taught what to expect when they\u2019re going through puberty. Although there will naturally be instances where a girl has already started, for the most part this prepares young girls for what to expect, yet the same isn\u2019t true of the menopause.",
