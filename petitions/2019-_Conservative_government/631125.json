        "additional_details": "Giving birth and having a newborn is extremely difficult for mothers. They need support to recover physically, emotionally and also raising a new baby. Having fathers at home for longer than the current 2 weeks would be a great help. Mothers who have Caesarean sections are bedbound for first few weeks as well and mothers need help and support. Post natal support is very lacking for new mothers. Shared parental leave does not allow for both parents to be off at the same time.",
