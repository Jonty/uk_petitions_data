        "additional_details": "Currently couples must make a joint claim and are assessed on total household income. This stops the right to be financially independent. In many cases one partner is unwilling or unable to support the other. Jointly many do not receive any benefits at all which can put one half of the couple at risk. The benefit is placed into one or both bank accounts but bank details can only be changed with the partners permission. The system can leave people vulnerable & can create a risk of abuse.",
