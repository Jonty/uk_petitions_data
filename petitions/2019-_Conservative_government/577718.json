        "action": "Require local authorities to fund specific domestic abuse services for women",
        "additional_details": "We're very concerned that a number of local authorities are commissioning services with a \u2018gender neutral\u2019 approach, which in practice is defunding women\u2019s refuges and lifesaving violence against women services. Evidence shows that women experiencing domestic abuse need access to women-only support. We need action now, as government plans to separate domestic abuse from the Violence Against Women and Girls strategy could only serve to encourage more \u2018gender neutral\u2019 responses to domestic abuse.",
        "background": "The Government should recognise that domestic abuse is a gendered crime and women are the majority of victims and the vast majority of severe injury and domestic homicide victims, and require local authorities to fund specific domestic abuse services for women.",
