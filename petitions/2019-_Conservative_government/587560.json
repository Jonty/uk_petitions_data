        "additional_details": "Leaving an abusive relationship is not only extremely difficult both mentally and physically but also when the victim is most at risk. The process of divorce adds extra strain onto the victim leaving them feeling still under the control of the abuser, especially if the abuser contests the divorce or fails to respond. This lengthens the process considerably, which can have a major impact on the mental health of the victim and can impact their recovery.",
        "background": "The divorce process is very lengthy and complex. It should be simplified for victims of documented domestic abuse to obtain a divorce without the consent of their partner. Examples of documentation are police, solicitor, medical reports, proof of court order, or social care involvement.",

Deciding whether to grant a divorce is a matter for the courts, not the Government or House of Commons.\r\n\r\nIf there are specific changes you would like the Government to make to rules for divorce, you could start a new petition stating clearly what changes you want to be implemented."
