        "additional_details": "It was precedented in early 2020 that ethical veganism is now a protected characteristic under the Equality Act 2010, but this is entirely at odds with the fact that the UK government forces us to support and subsidise the slowly failing meat, dairy and egg industries with our taxes. In the interest of the environment, the animals, and the future of the planet I propose these subsidies be redirected towards plant based alternatives, or at the very least give the taxpayer the option to do this",
        "background": "Allow the individual taxpayer the option to opt out of supporting outdated, unnecessary, cruel and environmentally damaging industries like meat, dairy and eggs, and to instead support/subsidise sustainable plant based alternatives",
