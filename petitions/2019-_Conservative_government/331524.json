        "action": "For carbon neutrality end the use of gas for heat by domestic properties by 2050",
        "additional_details": "It is critical to reduce the carbon emissions in the UK, quickly, to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Burning of any fossil fuel needs to be reduced to ideally zero. Domestic gas burning, even if mixed with hydrogen, still leaves a significant carbon footprint. Gas heating for water, space and cooking can be replaced with efficient electric systems such as heat pumps, solar panels and electric storage heating. At present gas networks have false hope they can continue to operate.",
        "background": "The government should confirm by policy that all domestic properties in the UK should be heated, water and space, by an electric method. Domestic burning of any gas through distribution networks should be stopped, no new domestic gas networks built, and existing gas networks phased out by 2050.",
