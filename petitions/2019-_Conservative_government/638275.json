So the government need to act as this is effecting companies and businesses throughout Leeds with staff being late with the \u201cservice\u201d being unreliable.  They are destroying what used to be a fantastic service and adding major daily stress to commuters in Leeds. They also cancelled weekend/bank holiday services",
        "background": "The government want to get people using public transport, but First Bus are destroying the Temple Green Park and Ride and making it impossible for people in the surrounding area to get to work on time or Leeds City Centre shopping. They are running every 20 mins (10 at others) and are ALWAYS late.",
