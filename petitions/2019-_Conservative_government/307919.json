Claiming universal credit is not a fair or realistic solution. This won\u2019t cover even a quarter of the loss of earnings for most self employed. In most cases, self employed won\u2019t be able to claim universal credit based on their partners income still being over the threshold for entitlement for universal credit. The loss of income for self employed will be significant.",
