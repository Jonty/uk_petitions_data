Public order offences cannot be committed where both parties are inside a dwelling, meaning people can't be charged for behaviour that would be an offence if it took place in another setting.\r\n \r\nThis should be an aggravated offence if the offender has demonstrated or been motivated by hostility based on race, religion, disability, sexual orientation or transgender identity.\r\n",
