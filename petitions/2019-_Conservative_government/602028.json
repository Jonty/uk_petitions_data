        "additional_details": "The UK Government has been touting vaccine efficacy to the degree that no restrictions still remain on home soil. When it comes to other countries, the UK has a grossly disproportionate treatment of vaccinated persons. Whilst the variant was discovered by South Africa, owing to class-leading epidemiologists, the likelihood is that it is already wide-spread and SA should not bear the brunt of restrictions. The travel ban is heavy-handed and alternative treatment should be considered.",
        "background": "If travellers have been fully vaccinated, they should not need to be placed into hotel quarantine. As a precaution, home-testing and self-isolation should be allowed.",
