        "additional_details": "We would like to stop climate change progressing further than it's currently estimated to rise to in order to save our planet. Fossil fuels are one of the biggest contributors to climate change. Not only that but we rely on fossil fuels to complete everyday tasks. However, fossil fuels will eventually run out so we need a suitable solution to fall back on. To save ourselves and our planet we must make more use of renewable energy sources such as hydro-electric, solar and wind energy.",
        "background": "We would like the Government to seek to reduce carbon emissions by considerable amounts by setting a target to increase the UK's renewable energy generation to account for 70% of all energy. By achieving this we hope to reduce pollution and the amount of carbon emissions from the UK.",
