Although this has been difficult, we've seen that students which struggle with their emotional health and wellbeing in school have been able to work from in their own comfortable environment wearing their own clothing. Polls of students that have been done in schools and on social media have shown that students would be more comfortable and productive in school wearing their own clothes. ",

This would allow students which struggle with uniform for reasons such as emotion, gender, and sensory issues to attend school.",
