        "additional_details": "I believe in fairness and equality. It is unfair to abolish bursaries from September of 2017 but then to grant annual payments of \u00a35,000 from September of 2020; excluding a section of the Nursing body who are have had to pay high tuition fees and must now repay maintenance loans. The \u00a35,000 per annum payment is a help that must be available to all nurses starting courses since 2017, so I am requesting for it to be backdated.",
        "background": "In 2017 the nursing student bursary was abolished, but a \u00a35,000 payment was reintroduced for student nurses on courses from September 2020. This means student nurses starting in 2017 got nothing, and 2018 starters only got a single payment. I feel this is unfair, and the payment should be backdated.",
