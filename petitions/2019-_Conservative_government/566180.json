        "additional_details": "As there is no law in place about cat owners responsibilities about their cats fouling in other people gardens, me and many fed up garden owners feel like something needs to be done about the problem. A lot of people would like to enjoy the tranquility of their private little green space, but can\u2019t do it surrounded by cats mess. And it\u2019s not their cat even, so why should they be made responsible and punished for it? Seems like there are double standards when it comes to cats and dogs in the UK.",
        "background": "To introduce the law that binds cat owners to tidy up after THEIR pets, just as dog owners are responsible for their pets droppings. It can\u2019t be justified to let your own cat make a mess in your neighbours garden and not clean after them. This is very disturbing and hugely rude behaviour.",
