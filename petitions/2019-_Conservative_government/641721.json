They are paying tax and National Insurance on these earning which means the CMS is calculating child maintenance using an amount that isn\u2019t actually received by the parent.",

Gross earnings are not what the parent takes home after all mandatory deductions are made. Calculations should therefore be based on net pay, and not gross annual earnings.\r\n ",
