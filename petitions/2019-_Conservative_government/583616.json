        "additional_details": "UN human rights experts have now also agreed that this is attempt to normalise white supremacy despite considerable research and evidence of institutional racism. That it is sidestepping the opportunity to acknowledge the atrocities of the past and the contributions of all in order to move forward. \r\nRecommendations in the report are necessary to that end, but we need an acknowledgement of this ongoing issue in the lives of Black and Brown British people in this country. Key research should include research on institutional racism amongst graduates and Black British people over 25yrs old to generate a more productive dialogue on solutions going forward.",
        "background": "UK Gov should reject tone deaf notions in the report into racial disparities. In March, a commission concluded that while racism and racial injustice still existed, geography, socioeconomic background etc had a greater impact on life chances. And it did not find evidence of institutional racism.",
