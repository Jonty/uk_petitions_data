        "additional_details": "The UK is helping the maintenance of the largest humanitarian crisis in the world. It must at once cease arms sales to members of the SLC and instead fund the humanitarian response to enable aid agencies and advocacy groups to provide necessities and end the war in Yemen. A Security Council resolution that extends the existing sanctions regime to include individuals engaged in violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, from all sides of the conflict, must also be supported.",
        "background": "The weapons being sold by multiple foreign states including the UK to the Saudi Arabian- led international coalition(SLC) are fuelling the deaths and suffering of innocent citizens and children living in Yemen, who are caught up in the conflict of ousting Houthi rebels.",
