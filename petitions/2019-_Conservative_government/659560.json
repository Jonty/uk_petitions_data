        "additional_details": "The Motability scheme allows a disabled person to lease a vehicle covering some or all of the costs. To benefit from the scheme you need to be claiming a qualifying benefit. Because of the upper age limit for new PIP (and in the past DLA) claims, people with health conditions or disabilities that occur after they have reached State Pension age cannot get help through the benefits system for their mobility needs. It also means that they do not qualify for help under the Motability or exemption from Vehicle Excise Duty. Pensioners can only get Attendance Allowance, but they cannot benefit from this scheme. The difference between the three disability benefits, DA, PIP and AA is the age only. That is why this scheme is discriminatory against pensioners",
