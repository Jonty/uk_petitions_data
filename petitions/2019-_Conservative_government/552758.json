        "additional_details": "The Government should review reform the rules for creating PSPOs, so the intention of an order has to be set out clearly in the consultation survey, consultations must have a minimum response within a certain time period, and evidence must be produced to support the PSPO. Members of the public should be able to appeal against a PSPO within the first three months of implementation without the need to bring a legal challenge. Any existing PSPOs that do not meet this standard should be rescinded.",
        "background": "We believe that local authorities are unfairly implementing Public Space Protections Orders that adversely impact dog owners, cyclists, bikers and others, without adequate consultation or consideration of the impact of these orders.",
