        "action": "Implement restrictions on how many items people can buy in supermarkets",
        "additional_details": "The reason i want parliament to impose restrictions is to ensure that everyone in this country has a fair share access to the food and products they need. Putting limitations in place will also ensure that suppliers to supermarkets will also have sufficient stock available, with out these limitations we will have another repeat of what happened in March which took both supermarkets and suppliers months to recover from. These restrictions need to be in place for the duration of the lock down.",
        "background": "Due to the nation being placed into lockdown (due to covid) the goverment needs to put into place emergency restrictions onto supermarkets to prevent customers from panic buying stock and causing a nationwide shortage of certain food products.",
