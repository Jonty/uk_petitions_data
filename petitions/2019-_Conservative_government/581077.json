It will change the way the entire NHS budget is given to providers and could open up the way to NHS provision by large private companies, and reduce involvement of elected councils.",
        "background": "I want the Government to press pause on implementation of this White Paper, which is being rushed through without adequate consultation with NHS frontline staff doing the work, local councils providing social care and the public using the services, when there are major concerns about proposals.",
