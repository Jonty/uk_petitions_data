I don't think there is an adequate safety net to protect patient care or prevent serious mistakes being made or perpetuated. If senior managers were regulated by a system analogous to the GMC, where they can be reported, investigated and struck off if needed, I believe this would provide an invaluable safety net for patient care.",
