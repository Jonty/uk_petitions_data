China has lower pollution rates and lakes are clear in Venice. \r\n\r\nPeople and the world need a break sometimes. 3 days off a year, planned and prepped, working from home where possible and closing what we can will allow our earth and our brains to breathe and take a moment to recharge ourselves.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to enforce a 3 day Co2 holiday in which all non essential travel (air, road and sea) is curtailed and any travel that does take place will attract an additional environmental levy that goes towards environmental initiatives. All emergency services will be exempt.",
