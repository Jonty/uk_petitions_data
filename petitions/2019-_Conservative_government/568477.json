        "additional_details": "I have wrote to my school and explained my points to why I believe it\u2019s unfair for our school to do these exams, but I would like to make it a Uk wide thing, at the moment all it has done is moved the stress of not doing exams to doing them in school, this is a joke as it\u2019s unfair on these kids stressing them out because they are at a disadvantage, if the students do badly in these exams schools will give them a poor grade when this may not have been the outcome if everything was normal.",
        "background": "I would like to cancel all mock examinations for year 13 and 11 students as this isn\u2019t in the spirit of what Boris Johnson was asking,it\u2019s unfair to judge students on a examination when we have been interrupted to many times throughout the years. This is why our a levels & GCSE have been cancelled.",
