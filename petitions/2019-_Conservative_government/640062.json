This is almost \u00a3300 less than someone earning the National Living Wage (age 23 or over) would be entitled to.\r\n \r\nMany unpaid carers have to give up work to provide care, and being a carer can also have a significant impact on carers wellbeing and lifestyle. Providing appropriate financial support is the least the Government can do.\r\n",
