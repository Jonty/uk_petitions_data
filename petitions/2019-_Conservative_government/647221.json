        "additional_details": "In 2020, the 'Everyone In' scheme substantially reduced rough sleeping. In 2022 numbers increased for the first time in 2017. Government figures show a 26% increase from 2021 to 3,069 people sleeping rough. The largest increase was in London.\r\n \r\nPeople experiencing homelessness have to prove they are in 'priority need' to be eligible for emergency housing, but everyone should be. The government committed to ending rough sleeping by 2024, and they must deliver now. No more deaths on our streets this winter.",
        "background": "The Government should legally require councils to offer housing to anyone sleeping rough. They should abolish the requirement to prove priority need and the term 'intentionally homeless' and conduct an urgent review into their rough sleeping strategy.",
