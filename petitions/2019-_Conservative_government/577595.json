We want our children to live their lives without having to experience racial slurs being thrown at them, and we want to be treated fairly and with respect. We want the world to recognise the unfair treatment that the Asian community is getting and we want the world to take action. Help end Asian racism.",

But since the start of the pandemic Asian hate crimes has gone up and it is time for the government to take action and help tackle Asian hate crimes in the UK.",
