In practice, this is usually the leader of the political party that wins the most seats in a general election. You can find out more about this here:\r\nhttps://www.royal.uk/queen-and-government\r\n\r\nIf you're concerned about a particular policy or decision that's the responsibility of Government or Parliament, you could start a petition about that.\r\n"
