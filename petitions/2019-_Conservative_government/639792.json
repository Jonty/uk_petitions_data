        "additional_details": "Local Authorities (LAs) should be required to provide home school transport for eligible children who reside at more than one home formally as a result of parents who co-parent but do not live together. The definition of home being one residence is no longer the norm. Many eligible children can often only access education when at the residence recognised by the LA as the home. When the child is at their \u2018other home\u2019 they don\u2019t receive transport, preventing access to education.",
