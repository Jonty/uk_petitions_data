        "additional_details": "There are many accidental landlords due to relocation for work, or an inherited property, but it is ther only asset. These families then also rent where they live. The money they earn in rental income may not pay down their mortgage (if it is interest only), and then they pay their personal rate tax on it. It is incredibly punitive to someone who only owns 1 house. \r\n\r\nI am petitioning the government to reverse this treatment for those accidental landlords who only have 1 property.",
        "background": "BTL tax relief has been reduced from 100% to 20% of the mortgage interest as a recognised expense. For a 1-property landlord, this is an enormous tax burden. These are not 'dinner party landlords'. These are renters themselves, and owning 1 house is hurting, not helping their financial future",
