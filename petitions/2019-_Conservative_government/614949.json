        "additional_details": "Despite being described as a plan to 'save countless lives' from human trafficking, this plan puts vulnerable asylum seekers at risk once more, with ill treatment and torture described in Rwandan detention facilities. \r\n\r\nThe UNHCR have also expressed concerns over offshoring, describing it as a shifting of the responsibilities to protect vulnerable asylum seekers and undermine their rights.",
        "background": "Stop the implementation of plans to offshore asylum seekers arriving in the UK to Rwanda. \r\n\r\nThe cost of offshoring asylum seekers in Australia is \u00a32 million per person. This scheme could therefore represent significant cost to the UK taxpayer, as well as putting vulnerable people at risk.",
