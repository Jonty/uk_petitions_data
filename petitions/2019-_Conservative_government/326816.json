        "action": "Stop the UK\u2019s supplement of arms to Saudi Arabia",
        "additional_details": "People are outright suffering. This has been a long overdue notion that must be debated, looked into and passed; many petitions have been rejected and change must come! The Yemeni people are suffering greatly, deepened by the impacts of the coronavirus, but the UK have the power to considerably reduce this by stopping the exports of arms and missiles. This is no longer an economic driving force, this is about human rights and saving lives. People have suffered enough.",
        "background": "The UK has contributed more than \u00a36.9 billion worth of arms to Saudi Arabia, willingly turning a blind eye to the fact that they are being used to sustain forms of terrorism and wars, most notably in Yemen. Make the sale of arms to Saudi Arabia illegal and save lives.",
