        "action": "Stop the compulsory introduction of calorie counts on restaurant menus",
        "additional_details": "Calorie counting is a symptom of many eating disorders, and part of recovery is often to move away from seeing food as nothing but calories. By requiring eateries to display calorie counts, the government is completely undermining this message, and adding an inescapable trigger for those who are trying to recover. It would be far more useful to make calorie counts available on request, but not force them into the lives of those who are desperately trying to live a life without them.",
        "background": "As part of the government's plan to reduce obesity, a new legislation will be introduced to require restaurants with more than 250 employees to display calorie counts on their menus, which will be damaging to the recovery of the 1.25 million people in the UK who struggle with an eating disorder.",
