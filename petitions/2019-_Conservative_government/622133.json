        "additional_details": "The UK government is giving substantial funding to support Ukraine against the invasion by Russia, imposing significant economic hardship on the British people. Although we do not have troops on the ground in Ukraine this is a fight for the right to democratic self-determination and the UK government should treat it as such. We believe granting tourist and business visas to Russian citizens is as abhorrent as the thought of granting them to citizens of Nazi Germany in 1942.",
        "background": "We want the Government to stop granting tourist or business visas to any Russian citizen until Russia fully withdraws its forces from the sovereign Ukrainian occupied territories of the Donbas and Crimea.",
