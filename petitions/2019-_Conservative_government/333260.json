        "action": "Abolish police use of Tasers",
        "additional_details": "In England & Wales, police Taser use has increased by more than 500% over the last decade. Since 2003, at least 18 people have died after Tasers were used against them, and many more have sustained serious trauma/injury. Home Office data also reveals that Tasers are used in racially disproportionate ways, and too often used against children and vulnerable adults, particularly those experiencing mental health issues.",
        "background": "Police use of Tasers is increasing at a worrying rate. We call for the Government to put an immediate end to police use of Conducted Energy Devices (i.e. Tasers), given their capacity to inflict (sometimes fatal and life-changing) injury.",
