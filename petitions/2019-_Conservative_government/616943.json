        "additional_details": "The Government should legally recognise other genders as valid. It is unfair to restrict UK citizens' freedoms like this. For example, people should be able to have their chosen gender listed in documents such as passports and driving licenses, rather than have to choose between male and female.\r\n \r\nAlongside this, schools should be required to teach children about different genders. Do this for the new generation of young, impressionable minds, so they can be more accepting and understanding of themselves and others.",
        "background": "Not everyone fits into the bracket of male or female, and our laws are outdated and prevent acceptance of diversity. I know people who have had to go out into the world and be confronted with the fact that their gender is not legally accepted. I cannot describe how offensive and damaging that is.",
