        "additional_details": "Retaining Daylight Saving Time year-round would have a positive impact on people\u2019s mental health, it creates an opportunity to spend time outdoors after work, with a reasonable amount of light. Many people who suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder, are known to suffer from deficiencies in Vitamin D. \r\n\r\nAt the end of October, you can still enjoy a reasonable amount of daylight as late as 6pm!\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, the EU are looking to scrap clock changes. This would create a UK-IRL time border.",
        "background": "Daylight Saving Time should be retained year-round, with British Summer Time being the British Standard Time. This is because daylight can still be enjoyed in the early evening, which benefits everyone; particularly those who go to work. Winter hours mean leaving home and returning home in the dark.",
