        "additional_details": "Insurers wiggle out of paying in times of crisis, leaving the brunt (if not all) of the financial aid to come from local authorities, Government etc. We feel that Market operators & traders represent a special source of community entrepreneurship which if not supported, the economic landscape of thousands of Town Centres and small independent businesses will be tragically devastated. We therefore urge our Government make sure insurers pay out to businesses suffering as a result of Covid-19.",

There are thousands upon thousands of affected businesses which insurers are refusing to accept any source of responsibility and/or duty of care.",
