        "additional_details": "My baby was born with tongue-tie. It caused emotional distress & physically harmed my baby who became dehydrated and lost weight. Despite regular breastfeeding support, nothing changed until the tongue-tie division. Waiting weeks for this procedure can cause mums to suffer from sore or cracked nipples, low milk supply & mastitis. This may result in the mother giving up breastfeeding, at the detriment to baby's health and mum's emotional wellbeing. Hospitals should be able to offer division ASAP post-birth.",
        "background": "Tongue-tie affects ~10% of babies and can prevent babies from feeding effectively. Tongue-tie division takes seconds however babies often wait weeks before being treated. Hospitals should be resourced to expedite tongue-tie division, reducing harm and costs associated with breastfeeding support.",
