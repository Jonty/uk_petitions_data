        "additional_details": "The UK has no contractual or legal obligation to intervene in the war between Ukraine and Russia. We believe the supplying of military equipment by the UK to Ukraine in this war is putting the UK and the lives its citizens at risk of warfare.\r\n \r\nRussia has clearly expressed that countries who interfere will face 'consequences you have never seen'.\r\n \r\nThe UK Government has committed to supporting Ukraine and holding Russia to account for its illegal invasion. The UK can continue to provide support, but this should exclude the provision of military equipment to Ukraine, and focus on promoting peace talks.",
        "background": "We are calling for the Government to cease providing Ukraine with military equipment to fight the war between itself and Russia. We are calling for the Government to instead promote peace deals between Ukraine and Russia.",
