        "additional_details": "There have been thousands of reported cases of adverse reactions and even fatalities following this vaccination. The majority of dogs that contract Leptospirosis are recently vaccinated dogs. The Leptospirosis vaccine only covers 4 strains of Leptospirosis when there are currently 250 known strains. The requirement of this vaccine is mainly to protect people as it is a zoonotic disease. It is also very treatable in both dogs and humans if caught early",
        "background": "Remove Leptospirosis vaccine from the required list of vaccinations for dogs attending daycare and boarding facilities. The vaccine is dangerous and not in the best interests of the dog's welfare.",
