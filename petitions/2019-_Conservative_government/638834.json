In setting price controls Ofwat's aim is to allow for a return on capital that is no more than necessary for an efficiently run company to get the funding they need from capital markets.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about Ofwat's price controls here: https://www.ofwat.gov.uk/households/your-water-company/profits/\r\n\r\nWe've accepted the following petition which you may wish to sign:\r\n\r\nRequire water companies to pay a rebate when untreated sewage is discharged: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/636517"
