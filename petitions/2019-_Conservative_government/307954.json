        "additional_details": "Some online sellers are profiting from the misfortune of others who can\u2019t get what they need during a time of crisis. There is already financial strain on those who are most vulnerable, and in the cases of those who can\u2019t get to the shops to buy what they need, online shopping provides a much needed service for food & cleaning products. There should be a cap on the mark-up percentage that any personal care or food items can be resold for during the Covid-19 outbreak to safeguard the vulnerable.",
        "background": "Encourage online marketplaces such as EBay, Amazon and Facebook to suspend or ban sellers who are reselling sought-after items in the Covid-19 emergency - such as hand sanitizer, pasta etc - at excessive prices.",
