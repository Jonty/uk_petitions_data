        "additional_details": "Some children have underlying health conditions, being back at school too early puts their health at risk. \r\nAn average class has 30 pupils therefore no social distancing Measures can be followed. Government states data this week proves social distancing is just working so why are we changing methods so soon? Social gatherings are banned, so why put hundreds of children together.\r\nOur children shouldn\u2019t be used to get the economy started again. Children have died therefore makes them all a risk.",

Children shouldn\u2019t be put at risk because of an economy slump. The government needs to put our children's health first. No school will be able to abide by the social distancing measures.",
