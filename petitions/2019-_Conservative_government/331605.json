        "additional_details": "There is a massive increase in the demand for scrubs but not in the supply.\r\n\r\nVolunteers have stepped into this gap but can\u2019t meet the high demand and can\u2019t go on for ever. It cannot be, as with food banks, that volunteers provide a critical resource. \r\n\r\nA government program to organise UK manufacture of scrubs in all sizes is needed. There are textile workers without work and factories that could be repurposed for this.",
        "background": "There is a huge shortfall in the availability of scrubs and other PPE for our NHS workers. Throughout the pandemic volunteer scrub hub initiatives have filled the gap, but this is not a sustainable solution. We need a government initiative to setup a proper UK supply chain.",
