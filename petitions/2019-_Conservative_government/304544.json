I went to three supermarkets today and there was no soap or hand wash no painkillers no nappies. No hand sanitizer no pasta or sauces. This is ridiculous, if you look on selling sites then they have plenty",

Paracetamol which are 50p in local shops are selling for over \u00a320 on eBay and other sites hand wash \u00a31 is selling for over \u00a315. How we meant to protect are families,",
