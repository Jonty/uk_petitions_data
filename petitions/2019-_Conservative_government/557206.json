For many children, school is not the only important part of their lives. The routine of after school clubs are equally important, whether it\u2019s for the routine, or the sense of achievement they get from taking part in these extracurricular activities and even the sense of belonging they get from the hours they spend outside of school in a team.",

Many children need these activities in order to keep their mental health and well-being positive. Many children do not thrive in a school setting and these clubs outside of this are their sanctuaries.",
