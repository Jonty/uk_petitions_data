        "additional_details": "Hair dressing does not implement usual cross contamination control whereas tattooing does. Both can use extra measures for covid securing. \r\nHair that is being removed floats around the air getting into skin, eyes and airways and could be contaminated by hands and fluids. A tattoo studio already implements proper cross contamination as well as preparing the area for working on. Neither are necessary and purely aesthetic. Tattooing has a lower footfall too aiding in prevention of spread.",
