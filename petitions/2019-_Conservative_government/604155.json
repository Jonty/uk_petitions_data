        "additional_details": "Not everyone can use a shared mobility scheme. Many people live out in rural areas plus leave for work in the morning at different times and return home at different times. Also a safety aspect as you DO NOT know the Pearson you are sharing the car with. Also a maintenance safety issue as you will NOT know what state the vehicle will be in. And not everyone is insured to drive other vehicles plus they may not be licensed for that specific vehicle. This is one step too far to ban car ownership.",
        "background": "Scrap the ban on private car ownership as many people who live in rural areas need there cars 24/7 and don\u2019t have reliable/regular public transport to use plus not everyone can use a smart phone especially the elderly. Not all people live in the city. Plus there is a major safety aspect also.",
