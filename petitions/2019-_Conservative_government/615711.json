        "additional_details": "There are currently huge delays for many people who have paid substantial sums of money to apply for visas. Some applicants have been waiting for several months but have been told that applications have been delayed due to the situation in Ukraine. We believe this is not fair when we are paying for a service and have every right to a visa. Yes the Ukraine crisis is important, but they need to hire more staff to ensure other applicants are not adversely affected.",
