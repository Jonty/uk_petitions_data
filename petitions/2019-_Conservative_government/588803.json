        "additional_details": "Small high street retailers need support, they have been in lockdown, have redundant stock to remove/replace and during lockdown there has been an even bigger shift towards online shopping. We need an initiative to get the consumer back to local shops. Similar schemes have been announced in Jersey and Northern Ireland. The Government have also been discussing Business Rates Reform, this proposal is an activity based rebate as opposed to a blanket rates reduction.",
