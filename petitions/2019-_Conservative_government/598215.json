        "additional_details": "I believe that 40 weeks is far too late, bordering on infanticide of the disabled. I believe that the decision can be made in a far more ethical timeframe and that if people understood the process of late term abortion they would feel the same. The disabilities that can lead to termination include cleft palate and Down\u2019s syndrome both of which are not contrary to having a meaningful existence. People with even significant disability can work and enjoy life and should be allowed to be born.",
        "background": "I want an open and frank session in parliament to discuss the law, recently upheld by the high court that allows for foetuses to be terminated up to the day of birth if they have significant disabilities. I would like parliament to reconsider the ethical and scientific basis of the current law.",
