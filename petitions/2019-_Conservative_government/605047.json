For the sake of fairness, this payment should also be retrospective.\r\n\r\nThis would cause a bit of inflation and cost billions. But most of the money would stay in the UK and these costs would be dwarfed by the other costs associated with our Covid response. It would also speed up our economic recovery.\r\n\r\nSo the main question is determining the optimum price point.",
