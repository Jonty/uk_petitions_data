Non-paying parents owe millions of pounds.\r\n \r\nIf a receiving parent can't afford to provide for their child they could face charges of neglect. Non-paying parents should face criminal penalties for failing to support their child, as this is also neglecting the child.\r\n \r\nBy making non-payment a criminal offence the police could take action against non-paying parents, hopefully helping ensure child maintenance is paid.\r\n",
