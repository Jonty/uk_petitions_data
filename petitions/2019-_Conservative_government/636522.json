Little research has been done on this disorder although it affects millions of people worldwide. Research in Britain and the US has found that DPD could affect around 2% of the population \u2013 that is, around 1.3 million people in the UK, and 6.4 million in the US. Given the scale of the problem, more research on the disorder is needed. It can be a crippling condition.",
