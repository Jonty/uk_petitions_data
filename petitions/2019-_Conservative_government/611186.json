        "additional_details": "As other bills increase without the correct rise of statuary pay, let the cost of fuel remain. With the change of Low emission zones (LEZ) coming into play this also effects people getting to and from work/education which would then back log public transport making this harder for those who travel everyday. It would also have an increase on the amount of people on benefits as people would have no way to get to work and to earn a liveable wage to pay for this fuel on top of other bills.",
