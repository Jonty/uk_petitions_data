Just 16 days later we were told they had found 3 brain lesions which were cancerous, with a life expectancy of weeks to a short few months, and placed in a care home. November 2022 an MRI scan showed she had brain damage in both frontal lobes and not cancer. Sadly mum passed away 3 days later. 2 years of steroids she shouldn\u2019t have been on caused muscle weakness and she became bed bound, causing pressure on her heart until it stopped.",

Some patients are diagnosed too late or are mis-diagnosed and we believe that hospitals and care settings would be able to limit these errors with more funding and resources. ",
