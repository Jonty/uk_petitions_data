        "additional_details": "Section 9 of the NI Act represents an attempt to further weaken legal protections of unborn children, estimated to have saved 100,000 lives in NI, and is therefore unconscionable to all who believe that the right to life underpins all other rights. The UK is not legally bound to follow the recommendations of the CEDAW report, which are ideologically driven, and which were rejected by 79% of the respondents to the government's own public consultation. This must be stopped before lives are lost.",
        "background": "I would like the government to repeal Section 9 of the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Act 2019, carrying an abortion framework far more broad than that of the rest of the country. Such a move challenges NI's long-standing defense of unborn children.",
