Often prices are not displayed, and can even change over the course of a night, meaning people do not know what they will pay for a drink.",

Many nightclubs and bars adjust their prices throughout the night making it impossible to tell how much people are paying for drinks, meaning people pay for drinks which are often too expensive.",
