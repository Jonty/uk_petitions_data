Many have underlying health issues. \r\nSt Marys Hospital only has 8 intensive care beds. Clearly if the spreading of the virus to the Island isn't restricted NOW, we can expect a high level of fatalities. This CAN BE PREVENTED. Limit cross solent transport to Food,Fuel and Health Requirements. No holiday makers or second home owners. Screening and validity checks need to be in place to prevent abuse.",
        "background": "Restriction of travel is key to easing the spread of Covid 19.By stopping non essential travel to and from the Isle of Wight, the Islands over 65s and NHS staff have a real chance of being able to save lives, and prevent future deaths. Do nothing, people die. Government have a Duty of Care, act now.",
