The Minister for Women and Equalities has responsibility for developing an equalities policy that it is based on individual autonomy and dignity, and promoting equality of opportunity for everyone. The Minister does not have a particular role in relation to policy issues affecting women.\r\n\r\nYou could start a petition calling for the Government to take action to address specific policy issues that affect men, such as those you outline in your petition."
