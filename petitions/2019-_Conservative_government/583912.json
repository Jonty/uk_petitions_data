        "additional_details": "In 2020, the UK Youth Parliament conducted its annual Make Your Mark consultation with young people across the country. A desire for free university emerged as the top issue facing young people today, receiving 44,246 votes.\r\n\r\nThere has been a clear expression amongst young people in this country that they want tuition fees abolished. In order to command the respect of future generations, the UK Government should take young people's views seriously and take action on them.",
        "background": "We propose that the Government abolish tuition fees and instead fund further education with public money. This is because having an educated workforce is in the public interest, as universities produce our doctors and lawyers.",
