        "additional_details": "The \"mini budget\", as it is being called, introduced major policy changes. The public needs to be able to read the OBR's independent analysis of it, to assess how responsibly the government is making big decisions which affect us. Being able to make informed judgements about how we are being governed is a fundamental requirement for any democracy. Additionally, the OBR is supposed to be independent from the government, so the government should not have the power to suppress its findings anyway.",
        "background": "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has produced a report on the impact of the recent \"mini budget\". The government is choosing to hold back this report, and is also refusing to allow the OBR to publish it themselves. The OBR should be allowed to publish their report immediately, in full.",
