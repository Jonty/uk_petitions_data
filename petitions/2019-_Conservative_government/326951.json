        "additional_details": "Since schools were shut down on 20 March, the government's response to re-opening has been a disaster. They have failed to come up with a workable plan because they have not listened to those who work in education about the logistical and social obstacles. They have ignored parents' legitimate concerns regarding the safety of their children returning to school which has further hampered their ability to get students back to school.",
        "background": "The government must put together a panel of union leaders, headteachers, teachers and support staff who can decide on the best course of action to re-opening schools. It should be free from any political interference and have a mandate to make decisions about the country's plan to reopen schools .",
