        "additional_details": "There are many bodies who would like to see this official ban in place, nature centres, marine conservationists and the RSPCA to name a few.\r\n\r\nThere is a growing online campaign by many to raise awareness of the dangers and stop the use of sky lanterns. \r\n\r\nThe simplest solution is a Government level ban.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
        "background": "We would like a complete ban on sky lanterns being released in the United Kingdom. They are a danger to wildlife, livestock, marine life and property. Part of the remains are often non-biodegradable leaving further danger to land and sea animals from ingestion or entanglement.",
