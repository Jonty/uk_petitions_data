        "additional_details": "Because zoos help with education and conservation; they are also a safe haven for many adults and children who have missed out on so much over the last year. Allowing zoos to open in a safe way will provide a much needed outlet for families and individuals alike, and help the zoos survive. The cost to them for not being open over the Easter holidays is devastating.",
        "background": "Allow zoos to open before the 12th April so they dont lose their Easter revenue. I'm local to Whipsnade & throughout the pandemic they've had strict social distancing procedures in place & visitors have only been able to use outdoor facilities. With these measures in place, they are safe places.",
