Part of the UN's Sustainable Development Goal for education is that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development.\r\n \r\nWe are making progress by introducing a Natural History GCSE, however providing a solid grounding in environmental awareness from age 4-18 is essential to educate and empower young people to take effective action. We must invest in further climate education to help meet the UKs net zero goals.",
