Although they have every right to be there, it can be a frightening experience for walkers, young and old, and even the best behaved dog on a lead can attract unwanted attention.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019d just like to see warning signs (similar to those used at National Trust in Lytes Cary) warning walkers that the field is currently in use, so they can make an informed decision before entering.",
