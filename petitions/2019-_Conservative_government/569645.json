        "additional_details": "Parents of preschool children will be unable to work and care for their children if nurseries close, particularly those with babies. In contrast, it is more manageable, although not easy, to care for older children. Nurseries, unlike schools, can more easily implement social bubbles.  There is also less of a risk of transmission of COVID in preschool children. In the event of closure, more parents will rely on grandparents for care increasing the risk of transmission to a more vulnerable group.",
