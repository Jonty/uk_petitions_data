        "additional_details": "The UK Government must not forget that there is another epidemic that must be cured. HIV/AIDS has infected more than 75 million people worldwide and, despite significant progress in treatments, has killed over 32 million people. Whilst international research into a cure for Covid-19 has been a focus point over the past year, HIV research has been in the most part placed on pause. It is time to restart the engines, cure HIV/AIDS, and save lives.",
        "background": "With 690,000 deaths in 2019, we are calling for urgent funding to treat HIV/AIDS. UNAIDS estimates that the Covid-19 pandemic may set back progress on HIV by 10 years or more. The UK Government has a duty to turn the tide in research and save lives.",
