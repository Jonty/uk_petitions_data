        "additional_details": "Create a campaign that lets these groups know how humiliating and demeaning it is to reduce women to bodily functions, and how this is the opposite of inclusion, especially as there's no male counterpart. This needs to be part of a wider discussion by MPs on how gender identity politics hurts women and removes them from public life in a number of ways (language, sports, public spaces, female shortlists), but not men.",
        "background": "Discuss the rise of so-called 'inclusive' language used extensively by charities, commercial brands, schools that replace the words women and woman with 'chest feeder', 'menstruator', 'birther' and other demeaning terms. Men are always referred to as men in similar campaigns and public materials.",
