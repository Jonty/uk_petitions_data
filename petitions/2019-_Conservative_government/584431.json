        "additional_details": "Disposable BBQs are being heavily promoted in supermarkets, petrol stations and local shops. Anyone can pick one up for \u00a35 and take it into open countryside. Wildfires, as a result of this irresponsible behaviour, are now occurring all too often destroying wildlife, habitats and putting our firefighters lives at risk. Local communities have had enough and want to see a final ban on disposable BBQs in order to reduce the fire risk which is devastating our countryside.",
        "background": "Ban the sale of disposable BBQs to avoid devastating wildfires. People are increasingly taking these cheap and accessible BBQs into open countryside and setting off wildfires. These are devastating for our wildlife and putting firefighters lives at risk",
