        "additional_details": "There is a severe shortage of Social Care staff in the UK today. For this to change you need to pay higher wages to these highly skilled individuals that dedicate their life to serving the most vulnerable in society.

If you recognise the true values and responsibility of the people that work in this sector you will start to reform social care in the right direction.",
