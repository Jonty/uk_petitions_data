This should be a one-off payment.\r\n \r\nIt\u2019s important the Parliament to take sensitively look into this as these costs put undue pressure on many immigrants (particularly BAME groups), which can lead to mental health issues.\r\n \r\nA lot of immigrants have found themselves having to work round the clock, picking up every available unsociable hours to offset these costs! I think it\u2019s unfair to continue to ask people who are already contributing to the UK economy and tax revenue to pay NHS surcharge at each renewal.",
