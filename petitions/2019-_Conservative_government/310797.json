I am requesting to change the insurance system where we insure individual people to a car, to where we insure the car only. This would enable many people drive a motor vehicle without paying a surcharge. People especially under the age of 25 pays over \u00a32000 for a car worth \u00a34000 and has a cylinder capacity of 1000cc and a total output of 50 horsepower.",

The terms of any particular insurance policy are a matter for individual insurers, and not the Government or Parliament.\r\n\r\nYou could start a petition calling on the Government to change the current requirements for car insurance, so that insurance providers can offer policies that cover cars, not named individuals, but decisions about offering these policies, and their price, would be a matter for individual insurers."
