        "additional_details": "The UK is described as one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world, yet people continue to destroy living gardens to replace them with plastic. Life on earth depends on rich biodiversity, and the use of artificial grass is irresponsible. This, aside from the issue of huge volumes of plastics should be enough to determine that the '25 Year Environment Plan' is not ambitious enough. \r\nThis is a simple step towards the commitment to COP26. \r\nIncentives are not enough.",
        "background": "The UK Government has previously responded to calls for the banning of artificial grass by stating that they 'prefer to help people and companies make the right choice, rather than banning items outright'. This response needs reviewing, as the use of artificial grass in UK gardens continues to grow.",
