They should not have to pay tens of thousands of pounds to serve our country in the amazing and dedicated way that they do. My brother is currently attending St George\u2019s University to get his Medical degree and we as a family are having to pay for all of his fees due to him already having a degree funded although he is going to be a doctor.",
