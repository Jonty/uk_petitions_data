Childcare staff are already some of the lowest paid in the country. The Government need to inject funds in to the childcare system if they want us to survive.",
        "background": "The Government are constantly reviewing and increasing National Living Wage, with the next increase proposed as a 50p hike!\r\nEarly Years childcare settings rely heavily, some solely, on the Government funding. Review your financial support for Early Years childcare and increase the funding.",
