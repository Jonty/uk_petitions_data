We think there are nowhere near enough indoor spaces specifically for neurodiverse children to enjoy that are accessible.\r\n\r\nNeurodiverse children deserve to have a place to go each weekend and in school holidays that is tranquil, sensory and helps their social skills and mental wellbeing.\r\n",
        "background": "We would like the government to fund specialised facilities for children with neurodiverse conditions to be able to enjoy sensory play together on weekends and school holidays. We believe there is currently very little for children with Autism Spectrum Disorders or ADHD to enjoy safely anywhere.",
