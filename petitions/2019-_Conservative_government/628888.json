        "additional_details": "The recent Supreme Court ruling on a second Scottish Independence Referendum makes it clear that Scotland and Wales cannot move toward independence without Westminster's approval. Since Westminster is dominated by English MPs, England is the only country that has a legal path to organizing an independence referendum. Since Scottish people are repeatedly told they are a drain on England, English people should be offered the chance to liberate themselves from the UK.",
        "background": "Since England regards Scotland and Wales a drain on its resources, England should formally declare its independence from them, thus ending centuries of uncomfortable cohabitation. Scotland and Wales could then make their own arrangements for their post-UK existence.",
