The price difference between term time and half term is ridiculous so people are taking their children away and just expecting a fine but recently me, my husband and my ex partner received a fine for one person going away. This is just not acceptable.",
        "background": "The fines for taking your children out of school needs to change. I understand it is to keep parents from taking the kids away during term time but the price to take your child away in the half term is shocking. Fining parents for taking them away is one thing but fining other family members isn't.",
