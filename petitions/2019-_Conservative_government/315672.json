        "additional_details": "It this would help suffers of ocd,anxiety, msm,atritis, joint pains,back problems all for there own consumption for medical use only to use as medicine and they would not buy from criminals and would legally grow them self and pay to the government for a licence yearly for the sum of 100 pounds I think this would free up court cost for people he need medicine with no criminal elements thanks.",
        "background": "No one can get a prescription for cannabis on nhs private prescription cost 700 to 900 for medical use so alternative is,to grow yourself and government should charge a yearly licence and grower pay for inspection  from a electrician for safety.",
