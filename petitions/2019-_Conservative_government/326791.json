        "background": "In 1835 the British gov took out a huge loan for 'slave compensation'. Instead of going to freed slaves, the money went to slave owners, as compensation for loss of \"property\". UK taxpayers were paying this loan back until 2015. That means descendants of those enslaved also helped pay it back.",
