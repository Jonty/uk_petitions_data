        "additional_details": "Currently if your child does not attend school parents gave fines of \u00a360 a day per child. In cases were parents are seperated both parents are charged the fines.If they remain unpaid they can take you to court and you can even serve prison time. \r\nDuring the pandemic this is OUTRAGEOUS! \r\nParents are forced to choose between the safety of their children and potential legal action. I call for parents to have the choice. For the fines to be suspended and remote learning to be provided during covid19",
        "background": "Suspend the fines for those parents who choose to not send their children in to protect them and their family from covid19.\r\nHave all schools provide remote learning for those who won't be attending during the pandemic. \r\nOr\r\nLockdown schools as before . Only open to key workers and special needs.",
