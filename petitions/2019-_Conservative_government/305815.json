It\u2019s so contagious and devastating that the UK government are closing schools, banning large gatherings and advising against any prolonged close contact with others however still expect front line staff to put themselves in danger of infection with no additional remuneration.",
        "background": "Introduce hazard pay for police, ambulance, fire and NHS staff. They\u2019re being put in danger whilst everyone else is being told to self isolate for their safety. If the government can find \u00a3330bn to support business surely they can help the frontline continue to support and protect the public.",
