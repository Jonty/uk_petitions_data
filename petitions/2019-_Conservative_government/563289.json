Self harm amongst these ipp is much higher than that of the general population. Roughly 65 ipp are being transferred to mental hospitals every year because the ipp sentence has driven them insane. Some ipp prisoners have taken their own lives. The Ipp sentence is cruel, inhumane and torture to both ipp inmate and the families .",
