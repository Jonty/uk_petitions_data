The BBC is not giving support to British values & culture and is willing to platform those who want to put Britain down, allowing many artists etc to attack our culture & values with impunity.",
        "background": "The term British Broadcasting Corporation is no longer appropriate as the broadcaster\u2019s output appears not to promote British public life and values in a positive way. It should be more supportive of our heritage and culture. Government should have strict rules against the BBC\u2019s anti-British output.",
