        "action": "Close 'non-essential' stores on Sunday, to improve our quality of life.",
        "additional_details": "Since the UK government went into lockdown it has become apparent that many aspects of our lives are improving. The air quality has improved and we have been able to rebuild connections with our families. The closure of 'Non-essential' companies, for one day a week will result in 52 days a year where we directly tackle our CO2 emissions and improve our standard of living. As the 5th largest economy in the world, surely this means we can afford to improve the lives of its hard working citizens.",
        "background": "For many of us in society, we only have two guaranteed days off a year, Christmas Day and Easter Sunday. I want legislation to ensure that all 'non-essential' workers are given Sundays off. This will not extend to small independent companies and those that offer leisure activities.",
