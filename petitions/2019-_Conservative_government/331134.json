        "additional_details": "Educating children about the subtle nature of discrimination at the institutional level (and how this can develop personal prejudices that lead to more overt disadvantages, bullying and harassment), is vital for developing life-long positive attitudes towards equality & inclusivity. Training teaching staff - and particularly those in management positions - in this area would also help prevent BAME staff being disproportionately relied upon to address discrimination issues in individual schools.",
        "background": "Pupils should be educated about the differences between personal/cultural/structural discrimination and the impact of unconscious bias. The current curriculum appears to promote respect for diversity, but fails to address the structural apparatus that continues to encourage and enable prejudice.",
