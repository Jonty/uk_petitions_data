        "additional_details": "Students with high levels of practical work in their courses (e.g., science, engineering) are disproportionately impacted by the lockdown arrangements and should be allowed to retake the 2020/21 academic year without incurring additional tuition fees.  Unless they can get the full content of the course for which they signed up, they could be disadvantaged in their future career prospects as their course may not meet the requirements of professional or accreditation bodies.",
        "background": "Make provisions for Universities to allow students to repeat an academic year, or missed elements of their course, without incurring additional tuition fees or tuition fee loan debt if they are otherwise going to be unable to undertake the practical work needed to qualify.",
