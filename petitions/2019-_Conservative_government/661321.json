        "additional_details": "Because it\u2019s the right & moral thing to do. Fining the working class for having valuable bonding time together will only make everyday life harder. And it\u2019s just a tax on the less wealthy that cannot afford to go on holiday during peak(school holiday)times. The wealthy can afford to take their children during these times, the working class cannot. So let\u2019s stop punishing those that cannot afford the luxuries & allow them to support their children & make decisions on their given rights as parents",
        "background": "Take into consideration the value of family holidays and realise they\u2019re just as valuable as time in school. Consider the value of time away from home/school and the positive impact it can actually have on children\u2019s learning and all round emotional, mental and physical development.",
