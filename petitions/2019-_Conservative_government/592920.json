British citizens deserve to know the truth of the events of the past 18 months, and have the right to scrutinise our public leaders and their decisions. To treat journalists and whistleblowers as spies and threaten them with 14 years in prison for essentially not glorifying the government is immoral and damaging to freedom of speech and the press.",

An independent inquiry must be fully carried out upon the government\u2019s activity throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The reformation of the Official Secrets Act would prevent such an inquiry, leaving vital information undisclosed.",
