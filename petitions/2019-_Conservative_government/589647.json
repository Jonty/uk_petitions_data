        "additional_details": "\u00a396.35 is simply not enough,  and fails to provide a safety net for when someone falls ill. Considering this is \u00a3230 less per week than what a person earning the so-called 'living wage' would earn, it is clear that this is punishing someone for being ill.\r\n\r\nSSP must reflect the current cost of living, and not be so low that it causes financial stress and worry for those who are unlucky enough to fall ill.\r\n\r\nEither increase the weekly rate, or make it mandatory for employers to match the \u00a396.35 SSP",
        "background": "The current weekly rate of SSP is far too low, and employers are not legally required to supplement SSP. This places the working public in a dilemma -  survive on less than \u00a3100 a week and get better, or go to work and potentially increase the risk of spreading bugs and worsening your health.",
