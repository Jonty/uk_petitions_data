        "additional_details": "It is apparent in todays society that women do not feel safe in their surroundings.\r\n94% of women have been sexually harassed whether they are going/returning from work, walking home alone, walking past a crowd of people. These are everyday normal activities and for them not to feel safe doing them is a disgrace. By no means is this a solution, but if we can help women feel safer & more confident carrying out these everyday tasks then surely it is worth it.",
