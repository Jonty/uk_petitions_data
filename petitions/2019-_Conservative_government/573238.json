        "action": "Cancel any externally set papers or 'mock exams' for Year 11s and Year 13s",
        "additional_details": "Lockdown alone is damaging students' mental health, the prospect of further exams is worsening it. Due to this, students may be less capable of performing at their best. These year groups have also missed almost half of their exam courses, or more, as a result of the pandemic. Mock papers or externally set exams have not taken this into account sufficiently. Inequalities can't be catered for effectively. The Government's consultation(which was inaccessible to many) and response was very limited.",
        "background": "Instead of having any further exams or formal assessment for these year groups, we think it would be more constructive to concentrate on continuing their education and ensuring teachers set appropriate and regular work which can then provide a more accurate and holistic assessment of pupil progress.",
