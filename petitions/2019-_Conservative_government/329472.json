        "additional_details": "Asexuality is a sexual orientation where an individual has little to no sexual attraction. They can feel romantic attraction and may wish to get married without ever having sex. This group of people who make up 1% of the British population (as well as anyone else who prefers not to have sex for whatever reason) should have the right to marry whomever they choose without having to worry that not consummating their marriage could mean it can be declared void.",
        "background": "Section 12 of the Matrimonial Causes Act says marriage between two persons of the opposite sex can be voided if it is not consummated. This legislation should be repealed, in line with same-sex marriage as it provides for the outdated idea that a marriage should have a sexual component to it.",
