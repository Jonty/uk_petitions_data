To drop legislation ensuring masks during a third wave (when these numbers reflect those during the second lockdown) and further open up is morally wrong - it will lead to a more rapid spread of the illness, and cause unnecessary loss of lives. The government must prioritise the health & safety of the nation rather than their political reputation.",
