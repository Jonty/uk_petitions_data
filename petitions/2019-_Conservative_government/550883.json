        "additional_details": "Introducing a 6-person limit on social gatherings means that any families with 3, 4, or more children can now effectively not socialise as a family group at all outside their household. Children in these families cannot meet with their grandparents, wider families, or socialise outside of school, and if they are home-educated it will be difficult to socialise at all. In Scotland, under-12s are exempt from the restrictions on social gatherings, and the same should apply in England.",
