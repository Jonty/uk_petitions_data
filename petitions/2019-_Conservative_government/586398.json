        "additional_details": "The past 18 months have been difficult for all, but especially those who have been stuck outside the UK since the beginning of the lockdown in 2020.  We all would like to get home and visit our families and loved ones, those who are still with us and those who are unfortunately not.  Although we trust the government is doing its best to ensure another breakout does not happen but asking us to stay in a hotel room for 10 days especially with kids of unwell elderly is unfair and near impossible.",
        "background": "We would like Government to exempt UK nationals who are living abroad, to return home without Hotel quarantine.  The request is for vaccinated people and possibly restricted to people that have been away for 12 or more months.  This should be for all countries regardless of traffic light status",
