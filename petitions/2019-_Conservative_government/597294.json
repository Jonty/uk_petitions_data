        "action": "NO! To the reintroduction of the Imperial System",
        "additional_details": "Reintroduction of the Imperial System in the 21st century is preposterous! Only 3 other countries in the world use the Imperial System, most likely due to the fact that it is a nonsensical and outdated method for measurements. Nobody under the age of 70 will be able to understand the System which will lead to confusion for decades to come. If our young do manage to escape this sinking-ship of a country, how would being at another disadvantage be helpful! Ridiculous, second only to the obvious.",
        "background": "I would like Parliment to reconsider the extra confusion they are looking to impose on anyone under the age of 70 in the UK. The UK has had enough turmoil to deal with in the past four years, from Brexit to a global pandemic, the people don't need any more confusion.",
