        "additional_details": "Fixed-odds-betting-terminals (slot machines) have been accurately dubbed; the crack cocaine of the high street. They are accessible via betting shops, arcades, pubs, nightclubs, casinos, service stations, and bingo halls, all which operate their own individual safeguarding systems, however, some offer no safeguards at all. This makes it overwhelming complex, and time consuming for problem-gamblers to be able to place adaquate levels of protection in front of themselves in the event of relaspe.",
        "background": "A 'Gamstop System' should be implemented into ALL venues that operate fixed-odds-betting-terminals, meaning those people who're addicted can simply ban themselves from being able to register for a MEMBERSHIP' for 1, 2, or 5 years, from ALL venues, and ALL machines, in ONE easy phone call to Gamstop.",
