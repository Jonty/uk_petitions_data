        "additional_details": "The way the people of Yemen are suffering is unbelievably agonising, with 80% of the population requiring some form of humanitarian aid. Two-thirds of the population doesn't have access to clean water and sanitation. What's left and functional of Yemen's services and facilities is not even close to being able to meet demands. The impact of the bombings and resource deprivation is a slow massacre of the entire population. The people of Yemen are simply running out of everything.",
        "background": "Push for aid. The UK is too silent on the death of the civilians, we should: stop, or only export weapons to Saudi coalition with the condition of ending the bombings on the people. Urge the end of any blockades which cut off the vital resources for the country to run and for people to stay alive",
