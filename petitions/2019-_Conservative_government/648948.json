        "additional_details": "Currently manslaughter is a common law offence. At present it does not appear to be common practice for a domestic abuser to be prosecuted for manslaughter when their victim takes their own life as a result of coercive or controlling behaviour; with many commentators arguing that this is due to evidential difficulties. \r\n \r\nCreating a specific statutory offence of manslaughter by coercive or controlling behaviour would give the Government and Parliament an opportunity to clearly define this specific offence in statute, and we would hope this would lead to more people being prosecuted for manslaughter in appropriate cases.\r\n",
        "background": "We want the Government to create a specific statutory offence of manslaughter by coercive or controlling behaviour. The legislation creating this offence should make it clear that it applies in cases where coercive or controlling behaviour cause someone to take their own life.",
