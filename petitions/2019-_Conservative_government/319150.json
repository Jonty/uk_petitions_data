        "additional_details": "It became very clear in the early days of the covid -19 outbreak that there was not going to be enough PPE to protect all health care workers. Schools in particular took up the challenge of making face shields with the equipment they had whether it was laser cutters or 3D printers. Now these machines will need to be serviced and with school budgets being so tight there is little funding available to get these machines up to the standard they were prior to the outbreak.",
        "background": "We would like the government to set aside funds to compensate schools that have been making Face Shields for NHS workers. The 3D printers and Laser Cutters used to make the shields have expensive parts that will need to be replaced or serviced.",
