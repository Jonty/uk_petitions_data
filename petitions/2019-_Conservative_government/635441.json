This disregards children's needs and penalises lone parents.\r\n\r\nThis is short-sighted, inhumane and signals a change in how the welfare state values parenting despite saving on the cost of state-funded childcare; regarding unpaid care work as less valuable to society. Parents will also need to meet with a job coach every month with no childcare provided to attend. Nurseries don't have space or staff to deal with extra children. This could devalue parent-child bonding, drive families into debt and exacerbate a mental health crisis.",
