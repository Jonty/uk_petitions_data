        "additional_details": "In the eyes of the UK law , rape is only the penetration of the mouth , anus or vagina with a penis. I believe that women who have used things like sex toys, or any other object that resembles a penis or forces sex upon a man should be charged with rape. If a woman was to drug a man and have sex with his unconscious body, she would only be charged with sexual assult, whereas if it was a man in that situation he would be charged with rape.",
