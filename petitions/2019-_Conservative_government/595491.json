        "additional_details": "Football is a sport and the success of any given club in the Premier League should be driven by sporting ability and not by the depth of the Board's pockets or the ability to borrow money in order to buy players. Limiting player transfer fees via the T&Cs of the Premier League would give the best players the option to play for the club they have the most affinity with rather than the club that simply pays most for them. This in turn would enable smaller clubs more chance to win the league.",
