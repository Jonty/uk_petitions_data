This means that governments can break promises or make decisions that are destructive to the country, and the electorate can do nothing until the next election.\r\n \r\nWe, as citizens of the UK have had enough of not being able to hold the Government to account if we believe they are not acting in our interest.",

The law needs to be changed so that a petition of 'no confidence' to Parliament, containing the signatures of at least 51% of the population means a General Election is immediately called.",
