        "action": "Reinstate climate policies to achieve net zero and boost the economy.",
        "additional_details": "On 20 Sept, the PM announced changes to the UK\u2019s net zero plans, including delaying the phase out of petrol and diesel vehicles and gas boilers, and removing energy efficiency targets. This will make it close to impossible to hit the UK\u2019s legally binding net zero emissions goal by 2050, which all the major parties committed to at the last election. This is the Government abandoning its own targets, undermining global climate cooperation and investor confidence and putting British jobs at risk.",
        "background": "To address the climate crisis, we are calling for the reinstatement of policies to achieve net zero emissions, specifically improvements in household energy efficiency and the timely roll out of clean heat and electric vehicles. These policies are essential for a secure, fair and green future.",
