        "additional_details": "1. Hong Kong students are intelligent, hardworking and speak English. \r\n2. The task force could be led by an MP who is concerned about Hong Kong. \r\n3. The Five Eyes are UK, US, Australia, NZ and Canada but EU countries can be included. \r\n4. If free places can be secured, Hong Kong people can establish a trust fund to subsidize the travelling and living expenses for these students. The potential students are subject to the qualification and means tests. The trust fund will be managed by a law firm.",
        "background": "For the past year, the Extradition Bill has  caused severe protests and immense suffering of our young people  but China now  pushed  the National Security Bill which blatantly violates the Joint Declaration. The  package for BNO holders does not benefit youths under the age 23 so relief is required",
