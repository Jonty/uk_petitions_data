        "additional_details": "Those born mid-June to end of Aug, approx 20% of the year, will be unable to receive both vaccinations in time. This especially affects those born in August who must wait months at university before their second vaccination. In 2019/2020, UCAS admitted 570,475 people, so approx 120,000 won't be fully jabbed. This will be 5% of the 2.5 mil. higher ed. population. Freshers' week may mean social activity without regard for safety, and those living in Halls have no control of whom they live with.",
        "background": "Students who will be starting higher education (undergraduate or equivalent) must be offered both vaccine jabs by the start of the 2021/2022 academic year to ensure protection for all, i.e. those born in July and August will not have full protection and have had the opportunity to receive both.",
