They are human beings who have basic needs and need funds for basic survival. \r\nThis includes many families with young children as well who are left mercilessly without any financial support and without permission to work.\r\nThis situation may force them to be either criminals or beggars.\r\nSince asylum seekers are mostly vulnerable and afraid, their voices / sufferings remain unheard.\r\nPlease voice it for them by signing this petition.",
        "background": "Parliament should legislate and direct Home Office to give asylum seekers permission to work if their asylum applications remain undecided by Home Office beyond 6 months.\r\nGovernment also need to provide sufficient financial support to asylum seekers until they are granted permission to work.",
