The wait time for transition related healthcare is already too long, imposing these limits will only increase it. Stonewall, Mermaids and many other charities and people have spoken out about this, and so they must be taken into consideration before these reforms are put into place.",
        "background": "Liz Truss has proposed reforms to the GRA, targeting under 18s and single-sex spaces. These claims are not based in fact, and are generally used as transphobic rhetoric. The suicide attempt rate is at 48% for trans youth already, and puberty blockers have been described as \"life saving\" by many.",
