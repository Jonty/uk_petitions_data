        "additional_details": "If the religion was introduced earlier explaining what is now referred to as 'top knot' & why Sikhs have long hair, wear a kara(religious bangle),maybe other kids would be kinder/more accepting, because they recognise it, as they do say a burka from Islam or kippah from Judaism. This may prevent Sikhs being confused with Hindus or Muslims (2 faiths that are perhaps taught about more). It would educate children about Sikh Festivals, which are often confused with Hindu ones. Teaching kids young, help them respect all!",

Many Sikhs in the UK have either grown up/seen their children/grandkids being bullied, just for following their religion & wearing a patka/turban & often continues into their adult life.",
