This may prevent Sikhs being confused with Hindus or Muslims (2 faiths that are perhaps taught about more). It would educate children about Sikh Festivals, which are often confused with Hindu ones. Teaching kids young, help them respect all!",

Many Sikhs in the UK have either grown up/seen their children/grandkids being bullied, just for following their religion & wearing a patka/turban & often continues into their adult life.",
