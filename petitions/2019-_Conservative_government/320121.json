        "additional_details": "Just to be fair. A huge proportion of the working public were left out of any type of rescue package that has had most of us go through true hardship. To burden us with further hardship due to others being eligible to be furloughed is like being stung twice.",
        "background": "When the furlough scheme ends, only those that were put on furlough should have tax increased to recoup monies to save the economy. I understand that people needed help, but It\u2019s not fair that people who never took one penny let alone Universal Credit should have their tax increased.",
