        "additional_details": "By lowering the Student loan repayment threshold, the lower earning population will once again be the people hardest hit. This coupled with the rising cost of living, and National Insurance increase as of April 2022 will result in a substantial reduction in take home wages. \r\nCurrent rates are 9% over threshold. \r\nFor example, repayment on \u00a330,000 would increase to \u00a3630 per year from \u00a3243.45 per year. \r\nThose previously below the threshold could see hundreds per year now taken from their pay.",
        "background": "The Student loan repayment threshold is currently set at \u00a327,295 for students having borrowed from 2012 to pay University fees and living costs.\r\nIt has been proposed to reduce the repayment threshold to \u00a323,000, and repayment increased to 40 years meaning lower earners repaying sooner and longer.",
