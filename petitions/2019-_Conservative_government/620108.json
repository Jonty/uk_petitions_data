        "additional_details": "I voted for Boris Johnson, before the Conservative party; I believe Mr Johnson has all the qualities of a good leader. I like his ideas and respect his courage to implement the visions he has for this country. Even when faced with controversy he has the guts to put his neck on the line and commit, sticking to his core principals. I am very disappointed that MPs have 'herded' against him; removing the powers to 'force a ballot' will allow PM's to complete the task which they were elected.",
        "background": "MPs should not be allowed to put a PM in a position where he/she feels pressured into having to resign; the PM was elected to fulfil a task, a pledge that got them elected in the first place. The PM should be judged on his/her performance once the task has been completed.",
