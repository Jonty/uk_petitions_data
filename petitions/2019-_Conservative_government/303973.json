It is this age demographic that is at most risk from COVID19, and who require vital access to food and other essential materials the most during this crisis. \r\n\r\nA large majority of the population have been panic buying, preventing this age demographic from obtaining said resources. It is thus essential to implement measures to ensure their basic rights are protected, and they are at lower threat.",
        "background": "The government should implement a new and temporary 8am-9am time slot where all convenience stores will prioritise people aged 55+. \r\nDuring this period, convince stores should provide disinfected trolleys and baskets, as well as full access to food and other essentials to ensure 55+ are protected.",
