        "additional_details": "I'm noticing more and more that our cash is being taken over by the use of cards. For instance I heard on the news a while back that there's talk about a digital pound coin.  Cash is needed as technology fails and quite frequently, a whole street in my local area lost their technology for 2 days.  How do you pay for something in a store if the card machines fail? Also it's much safer using cash as your details are not shared. The elderly struggle using cards, I've seen them struggling.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to ensure that our cash is never removed permanently and that the public are able to use cash anywhere.",
