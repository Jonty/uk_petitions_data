        "additional_details": "82% of transgender individuals consider suicide, and 40% have attempted (A. Austen et al, 2020). We believe that easier access to healthcare, such as HRT, would greatly increase the quality of life of such individuals, and an important stepping stone to this would be education for current and trainee doctors. Despite the Government's evident transphobic attitudes, this training should be mandatory to prevent, first, unnecessary stress to trans people, and second, mistaken prescription. Thank you",
