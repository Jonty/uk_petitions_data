Posts, articles, images, videos and other forms of content can now be created using AI and are often used in social media posts, advertising, and articles. It can be impossible to identify which posts, articles or pictures are created by AI, and we are concerned this can make it more difficult to tell if content may be inaccurate, incorrect and misleading. We should be able to choose if we want to consume AI generated media.",
