        "additional_details": "Mandatory calorie labelling on menus has been branded 'dangerous' and 'disappointing' by eating disorder campaigners. This will be a disastrous change that will affect the 1.25 million people in the UK who are affected by eating disorders. Anorexia Nervosa has the highest mortality rate of any mental illness (10 percent), and this new legislation needs to be backtracked before the number gets any higher.",
        "background": "Stop the government from going ahead with their new plan that will introduce legislation forcing restaurants and cafes with over 250 employees to put calorie counts on their menus.",
