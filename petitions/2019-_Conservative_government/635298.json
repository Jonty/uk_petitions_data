        "additional_details": "As a young female attending the Margarete Centre, I have seen the desperation, sadness of both service users, staff, doctors. In the Margarete Centre, everyone is treated equally. There is pattern of charities bidding for contracts and then failing to be able to run them at the cost quoted  - being taken over by the private sector. If service-users drop out of their treatment with a new provider they may incur all risks such as relapse, crime, prison and accidental overdose.\u201d Please, help us.",
        "background": "The long-running service at the Margarete Centre in Hampstead Road will be shut down from April 1 as part of a deal struck between the council, Change Grow Live (CGL) and the Single Homelessness Project (SHP). With uttermost respect we ask for immediate action to preserve this service (est. 1967).",
