Not everyone has computers and/or wifi but the vast majority of young people have internet-enabled mobile phones. The government can take swift action to address the inequality of access that young people face by funding unlimited mobile phone data during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
        "background": "The Government should provide a grant for anyone under the age of 21 to cover the cost of mobile data, so that students undertaking remote learning can access the teaching, resources and research that they need online.",
