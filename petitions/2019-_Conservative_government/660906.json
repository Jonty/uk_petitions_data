        "additional_details": "We believe laws need to be stricter in protecting young people. People under 18 are children. \r\n \r\nCurrently adults of any age can legally have sexual relationships with 16 year old children. I believe this leaves children very vulnerable. A 40 year old can legally have a sexual relationship with a child that can\u2019t even vote and might not be able to sign for a house. 16 is a child, we have a duty to protect children. In order to do this new age restrictions on sexual activity must apply.\r\n",
        "background": "We believe the law needs to change. Although 16 is the age of consent, we believe it should be illegal for anyone aged 18 or over to engage in sexual activity with anyone aged 16 or 17, and that it should be illegal for anyone over 25 to engage in sexual activity with anyone under 21.
