        "additional_details": "This would cause major hardship for many transgender people across the UK. This act also protects transgender people from discrimination, harassment and bullying based on gender identity, undoing it would be a regression in our country's development towards a place where everyone is free and equal. Sunak cannot reasonably claim that this has had any substantial negative impact on anyone's life",
        "background": "Reportedly, Rishi Sunak is planning to \u201cReview the Equality Act to make it clear that sex means biological sex rather than gender\u201d. I propose that we make sure that there is no way that Sunak, or any other government official, can undo the great things that this act has done for many people.",
