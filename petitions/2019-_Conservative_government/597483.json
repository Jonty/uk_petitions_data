        "additional_details": "Plastic companies are intent on producing more and more polymers which will never biodegrade and will remain in our environment for ever as nano plastics. Since the '70s, they have refused to take responsibility for their products once sold. They tell us that the consumer is responsible for litter collection. Only government legislation can improve this situation: it will make such companies responsible and at the end of their lifespan, single-use products will in any event be safe.",

Consequently, government will use its persuasive skills to encourage plastic companies to make these environmentally harmless products.",
