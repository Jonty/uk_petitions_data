        "action": "Create a nationwide network of pollinator passages, to form The Bee Superhighway",
        "additional_details": "A third of British wild bees and pollinators are in decline. If current trends continue, some species will be lost from Britain indefinitely.\r\nPollination is mutually beneficial to plants and pollinators. Pollinators are an essential component of the habitats and ecosystem that we and many animals rely on for food, shelter and well-being. This network, The Bee Superhighway, will foster that and help the long term sustainability of food production and wildlife livelihood and we must encourage it.",
        "background": "We want the government to highlight, promote and support the importance of creating pollinator networks nationwide. A super highway for pollinators that connects landscapes ward by ward, borough by borough, county by county and region by region, thus building a network of habitats for pollinators.",
