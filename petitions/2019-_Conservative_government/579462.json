        "additional_details": "The government has a duty to protect its citizens but they are failing women when it comes to safety on our streets. In a recent survey from \u2018UN Women UK\u2019, 97% of women aged 18-24 had experienced sexual harassment. The fact that the government has allowed this to happen is disgusting. Public sexual harassment is degrading, dehumanising and objectifying. It is a clear form of sexism but it has become normalised in society. In other countries it\u2019s a crime.  Why is it acceptable in the UK?",
        "background": "Girls have to learn the same lessons that women had to learn decades ago - walk in a well-lit area, carry keys between your fingers, don\u2019t get in a taxi alone.  Too long has this been going on.  Too long has the government done nothing.  We will no longer tolerate feeling unsafe on our streets.",
