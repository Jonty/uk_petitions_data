        "additional_details": "The electorate need to have faith in its politicians. There is anecdotal evidence of some MP\u2019s purposely telling mistruths in parliament. There have also been cases where some MP\u2019s have called out these mistruths only to be reprimanded by the speaker. We need truth. We need honesty. We do not need blatant lies recorded in Hansard. In the 21st century it should be possible to fact check debate and make a comment in the records that a lie has been told.",

They can lie with impunity, the only challenges to the truth can come from the opposition, or interventions from the speaker. I want Hansard to include fact checking in its records within 24hr of a debate",
