        "additional_details": "Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock  has produced a timely document entitled \"Prevention is Better than Cure\".  The current coronavirus crisis is a good opportunity to bring this vision into a reality.  The government can ensure that all public places have hand washing facilities, in addition to what is already available in toilets.  The government can provide financial support for installation of hand washing facilities in public places.",
        "background": "Unfortunately,  hand washing facilities in public places are often restricted to toilets only.  Having greater access to hand washing facilities in public places will help increase the practice of hand washing.  This will improve personal hygiene and reduce the spread of infections and disease.",
