Our Aim: To get the attention of our local MP and have this taken to the Houses of Parliament. Where we can adopt new legislation and create equality for all those willing to contribute back to our society.\u202fOur mission:\u202f Enforce fundamental human rights and show those who need our support that we are willing to give them what they deserve and what we as British citizens have always been entitled too.\u202fIt is important to remember that for many fleeing, it is not a choice, but a necessity and the lengthy process does not reflect the true desperation of the situation migrants find themselves in.",

Asylum seeking children have the same rights to access school as other UK residents.\r\n\r\nAccess to education for adults will depend on the stage of an asylum seekers claim, and we could accept a petition calling for these arrangements to be changed, but you would need to clearly explain what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
