        "additional_details": "We are living in a time where the government needs to save the money for causes that need them, and necessary measures not for something that is created due to parents being selfish and childish\r\nFathers that pay a pittance for their child are driving around and living a lavish life\r\nSave the trauma children have to face! \r\nThis is not fair on thousands of children who then grow up to have daddy issues, trauma, ptsd, anxiety and depression to name a few. And again the government fund the treatment",
        "background": "I want the government to make it a law for both mum and dad to have equal responsibilities of their child, it is unfair on the child's wellbeing and the mother to be carrying all the responsibilities and the absent father to just cruise around without facing repercussions for his absence",
