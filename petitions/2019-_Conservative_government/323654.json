Age 6 I was called a baboon and told I must have a red bum by other students whose ignorance was not corrected by the teachers. I want and need better for the future generations. I want to see black children in schools see representation of themselves in the curriculum and for them to take pride in the history and the strength of their people while also educating all other races on the struggles and obstacles.",

Make teaching black history and black British history a part of the curriculum and help reduce racism in the UK through the critical learning stages.",
