        "additional_details": "The UK has licensed the sale of arms worth over \u00a35.3bn to Saudi Arabia since the Yemen campaign began. These sales of arms have caused an estimated 8000 civilian deaths in Yemen, since 2015, but the number could easily be higher. Yemen is now facing the largest humanitarian crisis in the world with millions of civilians suffering. \r\n\r\nIt is unlawful for the UK government to sell arms to countries who are accused of violating human rights.",
        "background": "A year ago, a court of appeal ruled that it was unlawful for the government to allow sales of arms to Saudi Arabia. However, these sales are still going on and the government must be held accountable. The government must stop selling weapons to Saudi Arabia.",
