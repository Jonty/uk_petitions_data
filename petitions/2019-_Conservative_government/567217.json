        "additional_details": "I understand closing malls or big brand names, but charity shops rely on people donating and buying donated goods. I beg to differ that charity shops are more essential than non-essential. Several charities count on donations made from people visiting and buying charity shops. So many people are lonely at home and missing that simple interaction between humans that we all need in order to stay positive and quick stop at a charity shop can make anyone\u2019s day brighter.",
        "background": "It would be great for the Government to allow charity shops to remain open during the 6 week lockdown. The charity shops already follow COVID-19 safety regulations rigorously so it wouldn\u2019t be a major change to keep them open.",
