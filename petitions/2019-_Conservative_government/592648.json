So that for example Chinese/EU parent companies are not hidden by registering a shell company in the UK.\r\n\r\nThis would help people who want to by British to support home grown manufacturing, or at the very least enable them to make a conscious choice of not purchasing goods from hostile regimes or those who abuse human rights.",

In a shop it is possible to check the label, online you have to search for the company and its country of origin, which can sometimes be very time consuming.",
