        "action": "End of life care should allow doctors to hasten death after food & drink removed",
        "additional_details": "If someone starved their dog to death and withheld water, they would be prosecuted, so why is it right to do this to our loved ones? The government should allow doctors to administer drugs to hasten death once food and water is removed. This will allow the person to die quickly and peacefully while allowing their loved ones the option to be with them while they slip away without having to have a 24/7 vigil for weeks at their bedside.",
        "background": "Currently with end-of-life care, if a person has no chance of recovery and is being provided with food and water, the only option the doctor has to allow them to die is to remove food and water. This causes starvation & dehydration, causing multiple organ failure. A slow and long death.",
