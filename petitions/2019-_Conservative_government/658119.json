        "additional_details": "There is a cost of living crisis throughout the UK and hard pressed families and old aged pensioners are having to pay huge energy bills whilst the energy companies make vast profits, removing the daily standing charge would ease the cost  of energy to families and old aged pensioners.",
        "background": "The standing daily charges are expensive and unfair, these  should be abolished, the  daily standing charge is charged  even if you use no energy at all. We feel this is not fair considering the vast profits energy companies are currently making during a cost of living crisis.",
