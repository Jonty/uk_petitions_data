        "additional_details": "Exploitation of new laws sees some individuals accumulating evidence to prevent partners from leaving, then using it against them. We advocate for holistic investigations that consider both perspectives, ensuring justice without prejudice. Our objective with this petition is not to diminish the severity of domestic violence or undermine the experiences of victims but rather to ensure that justice is served equitably. Let's break the cycle of abuse and create safer communities for all.",
        "background": "We petition for a fair and balanced approach to domestic violence cases in the UK. This is to ensure individuals can\u2019t use the system to punish partners for leaving abusive relationships.",
