No human being let alone children and babies should have to go through what the people of Yemen are facing. 1 child died every 10 minutes in Yemen, so many futures have been destroyed, and it\u2019s none of these peoples fault. They deserve help!",

I think the government should try and provide resources to Yemen, perhaps food, bottled water or medication for those facing starvation.",
