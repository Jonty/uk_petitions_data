        "action": "Extend maternity leave by 4 months on full pay due to COVID restrictions.",
        "additional_details": "My child has not been exposed to family members or childminders due to lockdown.We have been denied all of the usual classes and prenatal care usually provided. We have been denied all of these rights to protect the wider population. Many people have been furloughed receiving 80% of their wages for staying home where new mothers were having to follow the same guidelines but only receiving SMP. We feel parliament should address this and grant an extension and suitable remuneration.",
        "background": "New mothers have been locked down since April 2020, preventing our children experiencing the outside world. Maternity leave should be extended by 4 months with full pay and full job security. We have been denied our right to fulfil experiences and had to stay inside with our babies.",
