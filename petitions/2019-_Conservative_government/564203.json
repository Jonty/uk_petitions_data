After seeing how Boris Johnson is handling the current situation, it\u2019s clear that he isn\u2019t set for that role. Other countries, such as New Zealand, managed to have the coronavirus under control a long time ago. Here our country is, struggling to keep the numbers down. It\u2019s not the public\u2019s fault that the numbers are going up, it\u2019s his. Thousands of people agree. The petition will be physical proof of that.",
        "background": "I would like you to release a petition for people to sign because the last time one was held for this cause was a long time ago. If the petition reaches 10,000 signatures there must be a discussion about this happening and the government should take action because clearly it means many others agree.",
