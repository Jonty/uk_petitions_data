This government are awful and we should definitely take a more Nordic approach where children don\u2019t go to school until 7, four day work weeks so people can actually spend time with their children. Supporting families to stay home with children.\r\n\r\nChildren are the future tax payers! Yet no regard for them at all. Make this all a legal requirement!!!!",

We are expected to leave our children at such young ages in order to contribute to the economy and pay taxes yet no protection is",
