        "additional_details": "In the same way that NATO forces cannot enter Russia or fire upon Russian troops without that constituting an act of war - Russia cannot fire upon NATO troops without declaring war on all member countries. \r\nAs such British troops don\u2019t even need to engage with Russian forces in order to help. Their presence alone would prevent Russia being able to take further action without incurring the wrath of all NATO members.",
        "background": "Leaving Ukraine to fight alone simply because they aren\u2019t a member of NATO is shameful and undermines the very fabric of humanity.",
