        "additional_details": "I would like it to be reduced to 21 due so many women at the age of 25 on their first smear finding abnormal cells that have already turned into cancerous cells or just starting to. If women could have smears at the age of 21 closer to when they first became sexually active, this could reduce cases of women being ill or even passing away from cervical cancer and not getting smears early enough!",
        "background": "Make it available for women the age of 21 have a smear test. It is so important, many women are sexually active from a young age and regular smears can reduce cases of cervical cancer as this will catch it quicker. Being refused smears myself due to age has been very frustrating.",
