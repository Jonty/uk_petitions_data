        "additional_details": "The WHO advises masks continuing to be mandatory on public transport, in shops, bars and restaurants, and in crowded places. Keeping this provision after July 19th will suppress the spread of the virus, particularly the new variant, at a time when we're opening up and allowing people to mix more freely. It's a small price to pay for keeping case numbers down going into winter. It will also help to stop the spread of winter flu viruses at a time when immunity to these will be low due to lockdowns",
