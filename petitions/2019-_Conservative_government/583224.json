        "additional_details": "For too long government has chosen to ignore the plight of our wildlife on our upland areas, due to the lobbying of wealthy land owners and shooting organisations.\r\n\r\nWe want the Government to finally introduce a total ban on the driven shooting of Red Grouse. For too long the industry has ignored the pleas from conservationists to bring their house in order and stop these rogue gamekeepers from slaughtering our wildlife. Our raptors such as Golden Eagles and Hen Harriers deserve better protection.",
        "background": "Upland wildlife is being poisoned, burned, trapped and shot by rogue gamekeepers attempting to keep Red Grouse numbers artificially high so that a few wealthy individuals can blast them out of the sky in the name of sport!\r\n\r\nShooting is economically insignificant when compared to wildlife tourism.",
