        "additional_details": "The UK Government and the EU are currently allocating a lot of time and resources to negotiate a trade deal for the end of this year. Similarly Industry and Commerce will be allocating a lot of resources on planning how to deal with the implications of any new trade deal.\r\nBy extending the transition period and immediately postponing current trade talks, both Government and Commerce in both the UK and the EU can reallocate resources and concentrate on dealing with the threat of Coronavirus.",
        "background": "I want Government to extend the transition period for leaving the EU for another year, and to immediately stop all negotiations regarding a future trade deal between the EU and the UK, until the threat of Coronavirus has been dealt with.",
