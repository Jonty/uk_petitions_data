        "additional_details": "Government already have all the info they need. They can identify who are the key workers through the tax report system. Just pass a bill exempting those considered key workers from council tax or any other government taxes for the year 2020 or 2021, depending on what is most feasible.",
        "background": "Key workers deserve proper recognition and reward for their work during the covid 19 pandemic. Clapping hands and calling them heroes is nice, however it doesn't puts food on the table or pays the mortgage. Tax relief would be feasible and with almost no impact for government income.",
