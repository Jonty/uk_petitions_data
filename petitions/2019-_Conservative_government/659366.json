        "action": "Ban smoking in public outdoor green spaces and outdoor communal areas\r\n",
        "additional_details": "Some countries, like Singapore, have smoke-free legislation for outdoor communal areas - with designated smoking zones provided to non-smokers.\r\n \r\nNon-smokers (in particular children and pregnant women) should not have to encounter secondary smoke when out for a walk/playing in the park/having a picnic. Passive smoking can be detrimental, and yet there is almost no protection from it in outdoor spaces. Making smoking more inconvenient could also help people decide to quit.",
        "background": "We propose that the Government make it illegal for people to smoke in outdoor green spaces, and all outdoor communal areas like bus stops. We want to prevent non-smokers being subject to passive smoking whilst trying to enjoy fresh air in public parks and other communal spaces.",
