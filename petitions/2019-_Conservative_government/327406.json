        "additional_details": "2020 exams were cancelled due to coronavirus despite having majority of our school year done exams were still cancelled. 2021 exam year will be split up for students to learn half from home,in scotland this has shown to be unsuccessful so far. Students living in poverty will struggle most with lack of access to electronics such as computers to do the work on. Some students will also be left to look after younger siblings whilst their parents go to work due to school being split.",
        "background": "Exams for 2021 should be cancelled. Then government needs to listen to the youths voices and hear us when we say that we will not be able to pass our exams. Half our year will be spent at home and based on the last few months learning from home isn\u2019t good enough. Listen to us, we can\u2019t pass.",
