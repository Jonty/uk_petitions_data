        "additional_details": "The are 20 million people renting in Britain. \r\nIt\u2019s good news that the government has announced a ban on evictions. But the government hasn\u2019t taken any action to suspend rent payments. While landlords are being given a mortgage holiday, huge numbers of renters who are losing their incomes will soon be clocking up huge amounts of debt in rent arrears. \r\n\r\nOnce the crisis is over, there can be no doubt that renters will be evicted because of rent arrears accrued due to COVID-19 crisis. There will be an arrears and eviction boom at the end of the emergency period and this is because Section 21 is still in place.",
        "background": "In order to protect tenants from eviction and debt during the COVID-19 outbreak we call on the government for: \r\n-An immediate and permanent end to Section 21\r\n-A rent waiver for the duration of the crisis via an amendment to Section 8\r\n-Extend tenancy contracts due to COVID-19 crisis.",
