        "additional_details": "My fear is that people will not be able to open the white envelopes routinely as they are not used to them and may well feel that they are something equally as fearful to people with anxieties such as bills.  Important letters will not be opened and the very most vulnerable of our society may end up with sanctions or losing their benefits through fear of opening mail.  Also, this must be bad for the environment in terms of using white paper rather than brown paper which doe not need bleaching.",
        "background": "DWP announced that they were about to start sending out letters to benefit claimants in white envelopes rather than the familiar brown (manilla envelopes) this will cause a great deal of anxiety and confusion to claimants who are used to looking for 'brown' envelopes for benefit enquiries.",
