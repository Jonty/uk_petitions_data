The people should not be made to take extra money out of their pockets just to travel to further lengths just to get good furniture. I believe this is a robbery of our community, and should stay open to also prevent overflow in other locations",
        "background": "I would like them to either remodel the IKEA in the Upper Edmonton area or keep the IKEA as some local people cannot go to areas with an IKEA which are further away due to gas prices rising. I believe we should keep this local IKEA to help the locals and to make sure they can get suitable furniture.",
