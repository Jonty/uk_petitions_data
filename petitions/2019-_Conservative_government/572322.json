        "additional_details": "Students were told schools would reopen on the 18th of January, then the government quickly changed this to after the February half-term, now Johnson 'hopes' they will reopen on March 8th. Students' mental health and motivation is suffering thanks to the government's indecisiveness. \r\nStudents are being forgotten about during this time. Online schooling is destined to be a failure, many don't even have the means to access such forms of education. I can only hope they rethink this decision.",
        "background": "I would like the government to stick to their word and open schools after the February half term, instead of consistently going back on their decisions and extending the period of remote learning further. They don't know the detrimental effect this is having on students all over England.",
