        "additional_details": "It is down to schools discretion if they do the 2 hours recommend PE a week. Many schools do not do this recommendation and PE has become less valued in a school\u2019s curriculum and been cut to just 1 hour a week. This is despite the impact Covid lockdowns has had on children\u2019s physical, mental and emotional wellbeing. By making Pe and physical activity compulsory for at least 2 hours a week, all students will be more physically active improving their well being, health and fitness .",
