        "additional_details": "The government failed to purchase adequate stockpiles of PPE despite WHO and European advice in January and February allowing plenty of time to prepare. In order to ensure that health workers were adequately protected charities and companies manufactured PPE which was then donated to the NHS.\r\nHMRC should refund all VAT spent on the raw materials for PPE that was made for the NHS and not just for companies that made a profit. The government should not financially profit from being incompetent.",
        "background": "HMRC is refusing VAT rebates for material costs to manufacture PPE but ONLY if those providing those supplies to the NHS supplied them for free. This should be changed to allow entities that bailed the government out to claim their full rebate and not just companies profiting from selling PPE.",
