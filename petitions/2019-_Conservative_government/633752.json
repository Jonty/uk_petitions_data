        "additional_details": "Fining these oil companies for ALL of their excess profits sends a message that this behaviour is unacceptable. It has led to every person in the UK having increased costs, higher electric bills and Government interventions that whilst better than nothing have done little to stop runaway inflation or reduce bills to a reasonable level. If the oil companies told the truth, there would be lower food costs, lower inflation rates, lower electric bills and less need for food banks. It\u2019s disgusting!",
        "background": "Oil companies have made huge profits during 2022 after claiming they were struggling to make money due to the war in Ukraine. This was a lie as they have continued to make more and more money every single Quarter. This has led to increases in costs for everyone. This cannot be allowed.",
