        "additional_details": "I feel it's about time customs charges were reformed at as it seems out of date & old fashioned now. It is completely & utterly unfair that my relatives in other countries or odd friend can only spend \u00a339 on me for a present at special times of year or I get charged on my own gifts, yet my relative in the USA can receive more valuable gifts & they won't get charged! It's disgusting. Also getting charged customs on postage costs is outrageous and unfair, especially as postage costs are high from abroad we have to pay them to get out item/s.",
        "background": "I would like to see customs charges on items sent as gifts/presents from relatives/friends abolished AND, also stop customs charges on postage costs for items as it's unfair as we have to pay customs charges on postage costs to get the item to us!",
