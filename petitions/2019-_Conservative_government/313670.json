        "additional_details": "Our instinct may be to stockpile equipment for fear of future outbreaks but in such challenging times it's important to remember those also in need, particularly as a country of high socio-economic status. Dialysis machines for example are not stockpiled yet the chance of a virus developing that induces kidney problems is the same as the development of another respiratory affecting virus. It will be our opportunity to create stronger international relations without negotiation or compromise.",
        "background": "We ourselves have requested help and felt the fatal impacts of a lack of medical equipment so it is only fair that we donate the supplies of ventilators/testing equipment that will be amassed after the virus has been tackled in the UK to in need countries that already suffer from equipment shortage.",
