        "additional_details": "Setting external exams is extremely unfair as our education has already been disrupted by the pandemic and sitting external exam board assessment will be very disadvantageous and will not represent a true reflection of each student's academic level. We will have already sat several different forms of assessments including mocks, end of unit assessments and other forms of internal assessments in school. This should be sufficient for judging our grades. PLEASE TRUST TEACHERS NOT EXTERNAL EXAMS!",
        "background": "We believe you should not be setting any external examination papers for us as students to do. Our grades should only be awarded based on our mock examination results, end of unit assessments and any other internal assessments set by schools or teachers and our performance in the classroom.",
