        "additional_details": "The arts, and theatres in particular are on the brink of collapse and the government has been slow to act. Already three regional theatres are at risk of making redundancies, and many theatres are at risk of closing forever. The numerous jobs that will be lost will be devastating, and the detriment to our cultural wellbeing will be felt for decades. We must follow our European neighbours in creating a fund woth billions of pounds to save the arts in the UK.",
        "background": "Other governments around the world have created packages worth billions to help theatres and everyone involved with them during this crisis. If the UK doesn't follow suit we risk losing the cultural heritage for which we are famous and having a massive detrimental effect on the economy.",
