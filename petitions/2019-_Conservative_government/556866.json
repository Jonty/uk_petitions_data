        "additional_details": "Many people watched loved ones die from terminal illnesses such as Cancer. There comes a point where the patient has no quality of life, when they are in constant pain, and no longer wish to be alive. Alongside this, friends and family members also suffer with having to see their loved ones degrade and lose any dignity they had, which makes the healing process of losing a loved one many times harder than it already is.",
        "background": "I want people to be given the legal right to end their lives with dignity when faced with a potentially long and painful death. I want people who have been told their time is limited to be able to chose when their life ends, so that they and their families don't have to suffer.",
