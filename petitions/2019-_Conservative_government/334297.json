        "additional_details": "There is a growing element of the population who have no respect for the environment, the law, other people or clearly, themselves. UK courts can issue fines of up to \u00a32500 for littering but is this ever done? Fixed penalties of \u00a350-\u00a380 clearly are no deterrent. In Singapore the fine for a first littering offence is S$2000. Second offence S$4000. All subsequent offences S$10,000. Plus a CWO (community work order).",
        "background": "The only way to tackle the litter problem is with very heavy fines backed up by a hard hitting TV campaign and mandatory environmental education in schools. The income from the fines could be used to deploy more enforcement officers and create a dedicated reporting website for video evidence.",
