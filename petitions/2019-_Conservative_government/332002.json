        "additional_details": "We believe the IOPC is under-performing, partial, fails victims of police misconduct and is unfit for purpose. It also lacks the punitive powers necessary to exact justice.\r\n\r\nFailure to effectively oversee police complaints and address injustice fails communities and aggravates social tensions. The Government should review and replace the IOPC to address these concerns, and ensure police complaints are overseen independently, by experts who have been transparently recruited to hold police to account.",
        "background": "The Government should conduct an emergency review of the IOPC to assess concerns about how it fulfills its role, with a view to disbanding the body and replacing it with a new, independent body with punitive powers, panelled by human rights experts recruited to hold police to account.",
