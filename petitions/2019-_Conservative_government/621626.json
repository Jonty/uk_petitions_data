Banning wooden pallets treated with toxic chemicals should benefit the environment, public health and NHS.\r\n\r\nMore for information see the links below:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.blf.org.uk/sites/default/files/Ambient%20air%20pollution_levelling%20up%20lung%20health.pdf\r\n\r\nhttps://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/pm2.5_in_london_october19.pdf",

There are other eco-friendly pallets available, and there is no justification why any industry should still be using these wooden pallets for logistical transport and distribution.",
