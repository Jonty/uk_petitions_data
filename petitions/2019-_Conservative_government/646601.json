        "additional_details": "Withholding child maintenance from the parent who ensures all the child/children's needs are met should be made a criminal offence akin to child neglect /abuse. Pursuing non-payment of child maintenance through the Child Maintenance Service and courts can take months of even years for payment to be enforced. We believe that this is not acceptable, and that making non-payment of child maintenance a criminal offence could help prevent non-payment.",
        "background": "We want the Government to make non-payment of child maintenance a criminal offence, so that parents who withhold child maintenance when they have the means and capacity to pay can be pursued through the criminal justice system. We believe this would help prevent non-payment.",
