        "additional_details": "Schools are funded 39 weeks, including 5 days teacher days they can use during the year. Early years are funded 38 weeks and have to close for any training days.\r\n \r\nIn September 2021 the new Early Years statutory Framework comes into effect, this will be a significant change and early Years staff deserve paid time to process, plan and Implement these changes. Early years is already critically underfunded and cannot afford the burden of a new framework without additional funding for training.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to acknowledge that Early Years staff training is just as important as staff training in all other schools and subsequently to increase the Early Years funding from 38 to 39 weeks, with the extra 5 days being available for training days so they don't have to close.",
