        "additional_details": "Currently, there is a financial strain on most households who have a number of people paying back their student loans. Cancelling the student loan repayment for at least 3 months would free up cash that could help support anyone who has a family member that has lost their job, or seen their income reduce significantly.",
        "background": "We would like the government to stop student finance repayments for at least 3 months during the COVID-19 pandemic. The elimination of this salary deduction and a 3 month interest holiday would reduce financial worries and free up more cash to help other dependants.",
