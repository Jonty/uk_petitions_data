        "additional_details": "We want this because we are not being heard or listened to, despite these issues affecting us directly. We have been given no time to talk, speak about our issues and have been given no chances of input. This has led to us suffering, while the rich profiteer off this. We believe cost of living directly impacts the working class, and so we deserve to have a choice, and a word in what happens next. For our future, our loved ones, our hard workers and our community; this is our only chance at life.",
        "background": "We believe that the Government, during this cost of living crisis, has undoubtedly ignored it's citizens pleas. Plummeting millions into debt, death and hopelessness. \r\nHaving an inside election without the publics interest concidered is selfish and wrong.\r\nWe need change immediately.",
