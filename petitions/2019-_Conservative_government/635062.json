Courts are failing victims!\r\n \r\nThe Government should review handling of legal proceedings involving victims of domestic abuse, and implement changes to ensure that victims of domestic abuse are supported or protected through legal proceedings, and can escape and gain independence from abusive ex partners. This could include clear time limits on proceedings involving victims of domestic abuse, and creating a process for financial matters and child arrangements to be dealt with together.\r\n",

This can mean that victims are unable to fully escape and gain independence from abusive ex partners. We want a review to ensure that the needs of victims are met.",
