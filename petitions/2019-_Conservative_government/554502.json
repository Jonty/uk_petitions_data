        "additional_details": "If owners of dogs looked after them properly no dog would be \"Dangerous\". As a new law if a dog is \"Dangerous\" or isn't been looked after correctly then the dog should be taken to a specialist centre  where they train the dog to behave correctly. The original owner of the dog who didn't look after it correctly or made it dangerous should be prosecuted for this. Why should the dog be punished for its owners wrong doings? When a dog is seized and destroyed it affects lots of people in many ways. Because one owner did a bad job that is it for the dog. It shouldn't be like this which is why we all need to take action to make a change that will benefit everyone.",
        "background": "The Dangerous Dogs Act gives the police the power to seize and destroy a dog if it is listed as \"Dangerous\". It is down to a dog owner to raise their dog correctly yet it's the dog that gets punished as a result of something that it had no control over.",
