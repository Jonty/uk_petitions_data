        "additional_details": "UK lockdown over Covid-19 is causing more harm than good. The UN predicts that the global economic collapse caused by lockdowns in countries like the UK has reversed the past two to three years of progress in reducing infant mortality, leading to an extra 600,000 child deaths worldwide. This alone is almost double the current Covid-19 death toll. Our reaction to Covid-19 has also led to an extra 49 million thrown into extreme poverty (World Bank) and 130 million facing acute hunger (UN WFP).",
        "background": "Officially end the lockdown in the UK. Encourage everyone without serious underlying health conditions to return to work and businesses to restart. Reopen schools for pupils of all ages. Provide targeted government support to people in at risk groups so they can continue to isolate if they see fit.",
