In addition, we believe the current system is particularly unsuitable for neurodiverse children, many of whom will struggle with anxiety around exams and be limited in being able to fulfil their potential. We need to move to a fairer system for all.",

I believe the Government need to overhaul the A level grading process and introduce a greater focus on coursework and gradual assessments and reduce focus on final exams.",
