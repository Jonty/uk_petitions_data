        "additional_details": "We believe it is unfair that local authorities can impose planning restrictions on those who wish to erect an antenna on their own land or property. People should not need planning permission for radio antennae on domestic property. It can be an important hobby for a lot of people and we believe it is unfair that hobbyists have to abide by these rules. I think planning rules need to be reformed, so that you don't need planning permission to install a radio antenna on domestic property.",
        "background": "Stop local authorities from preventing individuals erecting antennae on their property. It is a hobby for many people and also a way for people with social difficulties to overcome their social anxiety. This hobby can be important for many people.",
