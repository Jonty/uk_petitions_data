        "action": "Stop the ban on vapes",
        "additional_details": "We urge the government to reconsider the vape ban, favouring stricter industry regulations instead. Restrict sales to licensed vape shops, not corner stores, for better control. Implement harsher fines for vendors and parents who provide vaping products to minors. This approach aims to ensure public health safety, particularly for youth, while maintaining responsible access for adults. It's a balanced strategy addressing both health concerns and adult vaping needs.",
        "background": "Advocate stopping vape ban, suggest stricter regulations. Only licensed vape shops should sell, with severe fines for illegal sales to minors. Parents purchasing for kids must face strict consequences. This ensures health safety and responsible adult usage.",
