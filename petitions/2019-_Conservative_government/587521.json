        "additional_details": "Because dads do not get equal rights, we just get messed around and hung out to dry. Its unfair that you work out, our child maintenance from our wages before we are taxed and national insurance, this is not a realistic situation, also leaves us short to live, the maintenance should be worked out after we have paid our taxes and national insurance as thats from our liveable wage, taking it before is unfair and also not logical.",
        "background": "To change the fact that when our child maintenance is calculated, for it to be calculated from our wages, after we have been taxed and paid national insurance, not before hand, as before tax and national insurance this is not our liveable wage, after we paid our taxes, this is our liveable wage.",
