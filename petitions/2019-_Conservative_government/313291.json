        "additional_details": "Covid19 can cause significant respiratory problems for people who contract the virus and as they are trying to manage symptoms at home by opening windows as much as possible, smoke from neighbouring properties can cause breathing difficulties to become critically worse.\r\n\r\nTherefore, councils and the government must do all they can to protect the health of the people during this difficult time.",
        "background": "The councils and government of England should ban and impose fines for people who are lighting bonfires and burning waste. It has a significant negative impact on the community, especially at a time where we are all forced to stay at home and the health of our lungs is paramount.",
