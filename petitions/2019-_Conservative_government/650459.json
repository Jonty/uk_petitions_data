        "additional_details": "This is because many children living in rural areas live too far from a school to be entitled to free school transport, and the local authority deems there to be a safe walking route, but we believe this is unfair and does not reflect the hazards of many walking routes for children living in rural areas - such as high speed roads, poor street lighting, flood risks, and more.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to reduce the number of miles a child has to live away from school to be entitled to free school transport, and also implement stricter rules regarding whether there is a \"safe walking route\" between their home and school, for children living in rural areas.",
