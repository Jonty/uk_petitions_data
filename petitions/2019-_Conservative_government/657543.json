We think should be able to stay at home with their child for a minimum of 5 years until their child starts school without the worries of not being able pay their bills or worries of the cost of living crisis. We think this benefit should allow parents to live comfortably and enjoy life without stressing about finances whilst their children are under 5 years old.",

This should not affect other benefits and help parents enjoy raising their children free from financial worries.",
