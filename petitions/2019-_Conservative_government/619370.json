        "action": "Help all consumers to access, and benefit from, remotely harvested solar energy.",
        "additional_details": "Everything to enable this, quickly, exists except a national strategy or framework that makes this easy and accessible to all. The benefits are many; cost, self-sufficiency, savings to the public purse, and can lead to carbon zero, with greater use of electric heat management and electric cars.  This will remove the current haphazard, individual approach taken by householders, organisations and other bodies.  This is not a call for any form of nationalisation.",
        "background": "By creating a, legislated and regulated as necessary, framework within which, using the remotely sited \u2018solar farm\u2019 model, all domestic and commercial consumers can easily invest in sufficient panel space to meet their own needs. So for low investment, everyone can provide their own energy supply.",
