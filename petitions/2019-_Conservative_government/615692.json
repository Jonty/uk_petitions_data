        "additional_details": "We believe the use for mandated calories is far more damaging for those who struggle with eating disorders.\r\n Between 1.25 and 3.4 million people in the UK are estimated to be directly affected by eating disorders.\r\nIf there was a choice for such information to be available it could change peoples lives for the better. \r\nPerhaps adding all the ingredients on the menu instead is a better way to start allowing for healthier meal choices, or creating education and helpful sources for mental health.",
        "background": "We believe the law that requires all businesses to put calorie information on menus to be incredibly harmful. With those we care about in recovery or in the midst of a very difficult eating disorder being forced to take these calories into consideration at their work, university or daily routine.",
