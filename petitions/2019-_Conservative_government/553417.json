        "background": "Don\u2019t you think that care assistants deserve a pay rise, Boris Johnson has given doctors pay rises what about care assistants! They are doing incredible jobs putting lives at risks working with covid patients and working sometimes 7 days a week, sometimes more that doctors do.",
