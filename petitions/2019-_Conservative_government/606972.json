        "additional_details": "UK used to be one of the cleanest countries, but now when we go out we see littering everywhere. Specially in the roadside hedges and that goes for miles. I remember when police and council were so strict on littering and gave fines to those who litter on the roads or even dump rubbish at their own front yard. But this is no longer the case. We see people litter and nobody takes any action, neither to stop them nor cleaning the littering that lies in hedges for years. Please take serious action.",
        "background": "Visit the UK roads and highways to see the littering. Make a cleaning plan to clean the roadsides and hedges on all over the UK roads. Educate public about littering and introduce heavy fines and punishments to those who litter. Hire more employees for cleaning as well as for enforcement to stop it.",
