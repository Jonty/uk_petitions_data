Pharmacies have a proven record with flu jabs, have highly trained staff and all systems in place to safely and efficiently administer Covid jabs. This is a less risky more cost-effective strategy. It will also visibly increase NHS capacity for the long term leveraging skills of highly trained pharmacists to reduce pressure on GPs, A&E and the NHS. Easy access means less spread",

The central booking systems should be reviewed and amended to ensure that people can receive vaccinations from Pharmacies. Pharmaceutical wholesalers should deliver vaccines twice a day as normal.",
