Some universities are offering hardship funds but the entitlement amount and eligibility is unclear. Can the government clarify if the Coronavirus pandemic is an event that can be used to justify force majeure on tenancy agreements?",
        "background": "Students in private rental accommodation and some in student halls are still being required to pay for properties they are no longer staying in, due to Coronavirus. Additionally many have lost their jobs or have 0 hour contracts so may struggle to utilise the governments current wage packages.",
