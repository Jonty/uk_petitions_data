        "additional_details": "Recent events show the DFE and Ofqual have badly managed examination awards at all levels. They had 5 months to create a robust plan. They failed. Current year 10 & 12 pupils sitting their exams next year have missed approximately 4 months of teaching. They'll be at a greater disadvantage academically, the stress and anxiety they currently face must be recognised by the DFE. A decision needs to be made early on, that teacher assessment will be the only measurement used to award grades next year.",
        "background": "Due to the recent confusion, misery and distress created by the DFE, the government must commit to ensure that all examinations results awarded in summer 2021 are based on teacher assessment only. Year 10 and 12 students must not be disadvantaged by ineffective algorithms or time missed at school.",
