People who are local and and contributed a lot to area( council tax etc.) I think deserve to have the choice living here. It is unfair that people who are from outside the area who can offer prices can force others out. Also, buildings that could be used for it are sitting there without doing anything. Why not take advantage of this. This means no green field will be destroyed.",
        "background": "In the high peak, people are having to move away because prices are getting too expensive. Jobs are limited because of the location and wages aren\u2019t the highest. There are many disused buildings that could be turned into affordable apartments and green field site would not be destroyed.",
