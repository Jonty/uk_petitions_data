        "additional_details": "With tool and van theft as high as it is at present and police forces stretched it's only logical to make the penalty for this crime to the point where it isn't worth considering doing anymore.\r\n \r\nThe Government should be stepping up to protect its own tradesmen and their livelihoods. With a few minutes, a mindless self-centred individual can ruin many families and put individuals under severe mental and financial pressure to provide for their family. More needs to be done.",

It\u2019s time the Government stepped up and made this a specific offence, with tougher penalties.",
