        "additional_details": "The UK has no legal routes for Ukrainians fleeing the war to seek refuge here. They are unable to legally travel without a visa, effectively cutting off legal migration routes and forcing them into the hands of people traffickers.\r\n\r\nThe immigration minister suggested that displaced Ukrainians can apply for 6 month work visas to come and pick fruit. This is an embarrassing and shameful response. We must stand side-by-side with the people of Ukraine, welcoming displaced refugees with open arms.",
