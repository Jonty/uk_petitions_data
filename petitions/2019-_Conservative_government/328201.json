        "additional_details": "Three issues need resolving:\r\n1) Lenders should not be able to require an EWS1 form for buildings that were never intended to need one. \r\n\r\n2) Building surveyors, rather than fire engineers, need to be insured to carry out surveys on low risk buildings, to help reduce the two-year backlog which is trapping residents. \r\n\r\n3) Requiring invasive surveys to establish new building safety is a Pandora\u2019s box. Engineers, architects and builders must be compelled to produce evidence of safe construction.",
        "background": "Fire safety is a natural concern within the building sector after the Grenfell tragedy.\r\n\r\nThe EWS1 form is designed to identify tall buildings where lives are at risk, but leaseholders in safe, modern, and even <18m buildings are left unable to sell or remortgage as lenders demand invasive surveys.",
