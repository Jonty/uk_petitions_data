Some employers are therefore refusing to put employees back onto furlough, particularly affecting those on zero hours, who are some of the most vulnerable and precarious workers in our society.\r\n\r\nThe onus should not be on employers to make these contributions, giving them the option to opt out, leaving many without support.

Under the current CJRS to March 2021, they are the employer's obligation, and many are refusing to cover these, leaving employees without support.",
