        "additional_details": "The medical and humanitarian crisis in Gaza is extreme. The bombardment is horrible, there is a shortage of medical staff and supplies. There are reports of children and vulnerable patients having burns treated and amputations without anaesthesia. It has been reported up to 900 children have had limbs amputated.  There is even a risk of diseases breaking out due to water and food shortages. We believe a UK scheme is needed for these innocent children and vulnerable civilians in honour of our humanity by providing medical aid, security and free treatment. The power of the govt should be used for good.",
        "background": "There's an emergency & medical crisis in Gaza. Many innocent and vulnerable civilians need surgery and other treatment. We believe bringing them to the UK for treatment and allowing them to stay for their recovery and safety for a few months is crucial.",
