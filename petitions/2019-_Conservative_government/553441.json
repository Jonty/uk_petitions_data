Concerns raised by the Majors (eg Andy Burnham in Grt Manchester) of the cities impacted by local lockdowns,  \r\n2. Condemnation of Govt performance on Testing (eg Dr Gabriel Scully)\r\n\r\nThe proposed 3 Pillars seek to provide the solution to create the environment in which to either vanquish the covid19 virus or diminish it to nominal insignificance ie near zero-covid, and with fewer deaths.",
