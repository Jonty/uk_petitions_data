        "additional_details": "Currently most people are at home with 80% pay whilst key workers have to keep going to work and potentially risk their lives by increasing their risk of exposure to covid-19. No hazard pay is given to key workers. In addition many key workers who do get sick from covid-19 in the line of duty end up on only \u00a395 per week SSP from their employer as a show of thanks whilst everyone else gets 80% of their wages. This is unfair and keyworkers who caught covid-19 deserve more.",
