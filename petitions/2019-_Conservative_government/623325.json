        "action": "Make Covid vaccines available privately to all ages",
        "additional_details": "Covid vaccine policies vary widely across the West.  For example in the US, vaccines are available from age 6m+, boosters from 5+ & a roll out of 2nd boosters to 12+ is anticipated this autumn. The JCVI has made very different population-level recommendations that may not always match individuals' unique circumstances. As 'personal responsibility' is the cornerstone of current policy for managing Covid-19, we believe this should be extended to vaccines, allowing them to be purchased privately.",
        "background": "We are told we should treat Covid \"like flu\", so why can't everyone buy a vaccine, as we can for flu? Current eligibility rules are arbitrary & centrally imposed, leaving many ineligible people feeling exposed. Therefore everyone, of all ages, who wants it, should be allowed to purchase privately.",
