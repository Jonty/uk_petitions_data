        "additional_details": "Covid-19 numbers are rising exponentially, hospitals are seeing an influx of cases. NHS staff are running on fumes already and we feel that we should have had a circuit breaker lockdown as soon as the R number got dangerously high again. We know viral infections get worse in winter (see cold and flu) and we need a lockdown ASAP, if we want the NHS to have any chance of coping, with the added burden of Covid-19.\r\nThe longer we wait, the worse it gets.\r\nIf we do this now, we save lives.",
        "background": "Initiate a national lockdown ASAP even if only for 2 weeks. We understand there are economic concerns that need to be dealt with but this can be done through virtual meetings AFTER we take action to save lives.",
