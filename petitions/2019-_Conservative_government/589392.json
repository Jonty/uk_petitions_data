        "additional_details": "Terminally ill people can be left to die in pain, without their dignity, and with their friends and family watching and having to carry those memories for the rest of their lives. Euthanasia should be made legal just due to these reasons, let alone when you consider how expensive end of life treatment can be. Give people the choice to end their own life, on the their own terms, so they and their loved ones can deal with an already terrible situation better.",
