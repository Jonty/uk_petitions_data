        "action": "Make A Level and GCSE exam resits and appeals, free!",
        "additional_details": "Not only were their results based on a terrible algorithm, in order for them to appeal their grades pupils will have to pay at least \u00a3100 per subject which is ridiculous. We are calling for the Government to waive these fees. Resits and appeals should always be free but especially this year given the circumstances and the impact of COVID-19. It is despicable that pupils whose families may not be able to afford to challenge their results, will have to keep these grades they do not deserve.",
        "background": "On 13th August 2020, thousands of young people across the country received their A Level results without having the opportunity to actually take exams due to Covid-19. Despite having decent mock results and predicted grades, many pupils from working-class backgrounds walked away with low grades.",
