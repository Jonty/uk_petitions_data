You can find out more about this legislation here: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/illegal-migration-bill\r\n\r\nThe Government has also agreed measures with France to tackle illegal migration. You can find out more about these here: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-agrees-unprecedented-measures-to-tackle-illegal-migration-alongside-france\r\n\r\nWe can accept petitions calling for changes to immigration policy, or support for veterans, but it would need to be clear what action you want the Government to take."
