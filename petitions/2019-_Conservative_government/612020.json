        "action": "Increase sentencing for sexual assault cases.",
        "additional_details": "The sentence for drug use is up to 7 years and the average sentence for sexual assault is also 7 years.\r\nThis is not a fair consequence as drug use only affects the person doing the drugs whereas sexual assault affects the victim for possibly their whole life and their family.\r\nAlso a sexual assault victim could be so affected by it that it could lead to  self harm.\r\nWith these signatures we will hopefully be able to make a change in the sentencing system.",
        "background": "The consequences of sexual assault aren't severe enough considering the crime affects other people a lot. The government and Parliament should discuss this issue and consider increasing the sentence for sexual assault.",
