These garments range from Lingerie and swimwear to Coats. \r\n\r\nThese products would easily be hung when they arrive in store (as some retailers already do) which would reduce our plastic waste dramatically. \r\n\r\nThis would be a small step to make our retailers more environmentally friendly and reduce plastic waste.",
