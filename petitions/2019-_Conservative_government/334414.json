        "additional_details": "On different nights throughout the year, fireworks are set off which are very loud and very frightening to many people who suffer with anxiety, young children and animals like dogs and cats.  \r\n\r\nAccording to figures from NHS Digital, there were almost 2000 occasions of people going to A&E linked to fireworks in 2018/2019.  \r\n\r\nOver the last 5 years, there have been almost 1000 hospital admissions relating to the discharge of a firework.  This is putting unnecessary pressure on the NHS.",
        "background": "I'd like the sale/use of fireworks banned all year except for bonfire night.\r\n\r\nFireworks can be enjoyed through safe organised displays on/around bonfire night & don't need to be used at new year, birthdays etc. \r\n\r\nThis unwarranted activity must stop for the sake of vulnerable individuals.",
