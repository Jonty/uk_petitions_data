        "additional_details": "I\u2019ve booked a new build house since November but despite this, I won't benefit from it. I think this won\u2019t encourage the building sector and many jobs related (tilers, joiners, plumbers, furniture shops, painters, etc).\r\n\r\nI would like to ask that the Government consider disadvantages faced by new build buyers (house not finished on time, COVID related delays) and enable them to access the SDH as long as there\u2019s a sale agreement/ binding contract by the 30th June.",
        "background": "New build house buyers (NBHB) have been following closely the latest news about the application of SDH with hope. \r\n\r\nLike other house buyers, we have to wait for the completion of our house to access this tax exemption but unlike to the rest, this is dependent on the property being completed.",
