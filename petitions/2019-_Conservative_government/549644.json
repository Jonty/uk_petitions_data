        "additional_details": "The growing backlog is mostly due to the DVSA reducing the capacity of many local test centres and posting examiners to other centres many miles from where candidates live and learned to drive. The booking system crashed on 21st Aug, and there was a queue of over 100,000 people when it reopened on 26th Aug. It is also putting strain on the customer service call centres who are dealing with daily queues of up to 3 hours long. Many people need their driving independence for work and some candidates have had their test on hold since March.",
        "background": "To tackle the ever-growing backlog of candidates waiting to take driving tests, it is vital that the DVSA immediately open all test centres to full capacity and post examiners back to the test centres that need them. Social distancing between examiners can be achieved by staggering the test times.",
