I am urging them to extend the scheme now; people\u2019s livelihoods and the economy are on the line; reassuring the Country's households, including the vulnerable, is fundamental, as well as supporting Small and Medium businesses. The Government needs to do it to prevent the Countries' economy and morale from sinking.",
