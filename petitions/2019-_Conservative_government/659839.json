        "additional_details": "There is no peace in Sri Lanka, it is unstable. We believe meaningful stability and reconciliation can only begin once any atrocities of war crimes and genocide are punished. The 2011 Sri Lanka's Killing Fields Documentary showcased the brutalities and yet no justice has resulted. The permanent people's tribunal in 2013 and at least one academic agreed there was indeed a genocide and war crimes.",
        "background": "15 years after the Mullivaikkal massacre of Tamil civilians and a finding of Sri Lankan genocide and war crimes by the Permanent People's Tribunal, the Tamils still lack justice. We urge the Government to seek for the situation to be referred to the ICC prosecutor for lasting reconciliation.",
