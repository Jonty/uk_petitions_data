To reduce period poverty and tackle the climate emergency, the Government must act to make this sustainable option more accessible\r\n\r\nWe call on Treasury to simply address this inequality and make Period Pants 0% VAT along with disposable menstrual products, for the planet and for people.",

The Government classifies them as a garment. \r\n\r\nThe tax code must be brought up to date in line with tampons, pads, cloth pads and menstrual cups (taxed at 0%)",
