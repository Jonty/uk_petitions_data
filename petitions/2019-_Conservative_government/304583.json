        "action": "Due to the pressures of COV-19 we should implement Universal Basic Income",
        "additional_details": "It would allow the economy to keep running and provide economic security for all. It would also replace universal credits which is an absolute failure.  With UBI there is no need to have hordes of people administering it (but could be expensive), however with NIT it would just be a tweak of the existing taxation system and be cheaper (possibly) to implement as the funds are targeted at the appropriate people.",
        "background": "With the impending economic collapse looming near, rather than spend billions on Quantitative Easing and/or bailing out big industries we should instead give the money to the people who will really need it.  We could either implement UBI or Negative Income Tax, either way it would provide support.",
