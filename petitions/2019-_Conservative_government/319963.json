        "action": "Legalise Electric Scooters for a greener economy post Covid-19",
        "additional_details": "E-scooters are classed as Personal Light Electric Vehicles. That means it's illegal to ride them on roads, cycle lanes and pavements. E-bikes on the other hand are legal and simply this is a baffling. \r\n\r\nCurrently, they are classed as illegal under the 1835 Highways act and the 1988 road traffic act. This seems redundant now, in consideration that our push to go carbon neutral is still allowing for cars within city limits. Maybe introducing E-Scooters can help limit the pollution in cities.",
        "background": "There was discussions that post Covid-19, we should re-open the economy as a greener, more environmentally friendly economy. It would be beneficial and a great starting point to legalise E-Scooters. Now is the time to do this and a good step forward is legalising the electric scooter.",
