        "additional_details": "School is already a stressful time for many children, we go to school for much of our waking hours. Many suffer through bad grades and pressure from teachers to do better. In Finland, Secondary pupils recieve little homework, however recieve higher average grades than students in the UK. Students also recieve more time to socialise with family, relieving alot of the stress caused by school itself.\r\nChildren are also pressured by sanctions to this, and so do the bare minimum to escape them.",
        "background": "We, children of the United Kingdom, want the Government to ban Homework and Coursework. Homework and Coursework have caused additional suffering to us in our precious free time, meant to relieve us from the stress of school.",
