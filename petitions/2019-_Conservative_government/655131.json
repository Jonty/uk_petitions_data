        "additional_details": "Most vocational training is exempt from VAT but pilot training is not. Nearly all students are self-funded and many find it very difficult to keep up with the rising costs of flying hours and studying. By removing the VAT it would make the cost of training for students much lower. The cost of training for a commercial licence usually range anywhere between \u00a350000 - \u00a3130000, making it unachievable for most due to lack of grants, scholarships and financial assistance like bursaries. We believe action must be taken to avoid a shortfall of pilots.",
        "background": "The current cost for pilot training in the UK has risen over the past years making it very difficult for most to achieve it. The cost of training for a commercial license in the UK has now risen up to as much as \u00a3130000 which, in most cases is far too expensive for many people including myself.",
