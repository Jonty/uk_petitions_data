This must be revised to reflect the dedication NHS and front line  key workers bring to their role, to show our appreciation as a nation and to help retain and attract more people to take up a career in the NHS and Key Public Services. The 1% increase and freeze insults  all those that have worked tirelessly over the past year.",
        "background": "Given the unprecedented pressure our NHS and key front line services have been under the past year due to the Covid -19 pandemic. All NHS and key workers have and continue to sacrificed so much, putting their own lives in danger on a daily basis. Their pay freeze and 1% offer must be reconsidered.",
