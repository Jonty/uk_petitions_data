Yet us, who want to go the gym, and get healthier, and fitter and strengthen our immune system, to fight covid 19 are being ignored. \r\n People in bars don't wear face masks, but we don't care, we are happy to wear face masks and sanitize everything we touch, just let us go and do what we love. THANKS",
