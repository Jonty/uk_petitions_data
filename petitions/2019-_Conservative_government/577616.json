        "additional_details": "The Northern Ireland executive has totally mishandled the coronavirus pandemic in Northern Ireland with party political infighting, illogical compromises and most recently publishing an exit from lockdown with no indicative dates. This means that business and jobs in NI, education in NI, health and mental well being continue to suffer under lockdown with no end in sight. The lack of indicative dates is the latest of many scandals during this pandemic which means this government must go.",
