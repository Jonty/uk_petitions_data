        "additional_details": "When the scheme was announced the 2019-2020 tax year had not concluded, so it necessary to exclude it. Extra help was given to those who were late in submitting their 2018-2019 tax return by extending the filing deadline. Given that it is now possible to submit a 2019-2020 tax return (albeit earlier than normal), it is possible to calculate the support that a significant number of newly trading individuals require, whilst avoiding the potential for fraudulent claims which was a genuine concern.",
        "background": "The COVID-19 Self-Employment Income Support Scheme is extremely helpful to many, but for businesses that did not trade in 2018-19 is out out of reach. Now that the 2019-2020 tax year has concluded, the scheme should be opened up to those that have submitted their 2019-2020 Self-Assessment tax return",
