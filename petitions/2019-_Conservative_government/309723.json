In this current climate of COVID-19, students have NO access to resources and technical support, and many cannot carry out their dissertations due to many schools and workplaces closing down. All classes have stopped and only PowerPoint presentations supplied for information on assessments and dissertations. It is not fair that we are expected to carry on as if we were still attending the university.",
