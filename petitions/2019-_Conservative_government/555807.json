However, in a time where millions are unemployed & businesses struggling to stay afloat, it's incredibly inappropriate & distasteful to issue MPs a pay rise.\r\n\r\nWe acknowledge it's the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority who forward these proposals. But as a proposal, MPs have a right to reject them.\r\n\r\nSome MPs have already publicly expressed their concerns with the proposals so let's allow them to debate the matter.",
