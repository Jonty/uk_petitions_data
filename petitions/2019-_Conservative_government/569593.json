        "additional_details": "There are thousands, if not tens of thousands of dogs that live in the uk in small back gardens in suburbia. These dogs live in small, uninsulated kennels and are often out of site to the vast majority and their suffering goes unnoticed. They are hidden away, never exercised, never socialised, never shown love, they have limited movement within their enclosures, they have zero quality of life. When the authorities are notified about such dogs they often can not do anything to help due to the current laws. This is a growing problem and these dogs need the law to help best protect them.",
