This would reflect well on the UK, giving us a better reputation than how we are perceived currently",
        "background": "I would appreciate it highly if the government or parliament could communicate with those who manage both Taylor Swift and Harry Styles in the hope of getting them together to write, produce and release at least one song together, as I feel it would be incredibly beneficial to society",
