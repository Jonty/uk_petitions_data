Firstly, we have had six whole weeks of strike and now cancellations to teaching due to Covid-19. We do not feel prepared. We are now expected to complete everything as normal without access to face to face teaching, without access to university libraries and whole the whole country is on lockdown. Not everyone has a the ability to work from home, whether that's due to lack of technology or care commitments.",
        "background": "Due to the stress of this years multiple strikes and now Covid-19 students have not been taught adequately to achieve the grades they would in other circumstances.
