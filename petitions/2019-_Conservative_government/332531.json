All staff have to sign up to NHS pensions and the same should be done for paid sick leave and same annual leave as doctors and nurses. Don\u2019t treat support staff and managers like 2nd class citizens. They contribute to the running of the surgeries in their own way and no less than a GP or nurse. Receptionist and managers deal with patients same as doctors and nurses. Sometimes they are abused by patients.",

They should adhere to all pasts of the agenda for change pay scales similar to signing all staff to the NHS pensions.  Not just parts they like e.g pensions and hours.",
