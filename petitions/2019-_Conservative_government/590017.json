Therefore it\u2019s left under the discretion of the hierarchy  whether the employees can have paid leave of absence/ time in lieu or have unpaid leave.   The UK Government says it recognises its multi-faith communities and encourages good employment practice.  Yet we are still faced with this discrimination year in year out and there is no equality and uniformity.",
