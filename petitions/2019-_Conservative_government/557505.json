        "additional_details": "I am wanting more companies to consider making a start in putting Braille labels on their products which will help blind and partially sighted people identify their\u00a0 toiletries\u00a0and food packaging, for example without a braille label how would we know whether we were using dog shampoo by mistake, this is why braille labels are so important and should be made law. I feel like as if blind and partially sighted people should have as much right to access this world as a fully sighted person so adding Braille labels to more products will be a big step up and will aid us to do so.",
        "background": "I would like them to make Braille become law on all supermarket items. And for blind people to be recognised more in the community we deserve to be treated more like people who haven't got a visual impairment so there should Braille on all shopping products",
