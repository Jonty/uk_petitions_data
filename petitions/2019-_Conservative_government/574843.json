        "additional_details": "The country is in need of a huge boost. The sheer impact of multiple lockdowns is grossly under appreciated, particularly with those juggling home schooling with work or worse, those not able to work at all. The economy will suffer even more when furlough ends so this small, albeit expensive gesture, will achieve benefits that outstrip the cost.\r\nIt will also help tourism and travel at a time when that industry faces horrible uncertainty. Everybody is in need of a much deserved boost",
        "background": "All UK adults, aged 18 and above, should receive \u00a3500 in holiday vouchers to be used domestically or to travel abroad within a 3 year period. Government can subsidise in partnership with private companies. The vouchers should be able to be used broadly (campsites, airlines, package hols etc)",
