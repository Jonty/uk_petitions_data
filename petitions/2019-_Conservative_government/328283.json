        "additional_details": "80% of Yemen\u2019s population are in need of humanitarian aid and protection. The civil war has already pushed Yemen and its health system to the brink of collapse. Millions lack access to clean water, sanitation facilities and food. \r\n\r\nThe UN says Yemen is on the brink of the world's worst famine in 100 years. The UN had verified the deaths of at least 7,500 civilians with most caused by Saudi-led coalition air strikes. \r\n\r\nCOVID-19 is making matters worse. The UK needs to help Yemen.",
        "background": "According to a Sky News analysis, The UK has sold at least \u00a35.7bn worth of arms to the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen since 2015. This has significantly contributed to the Yemen humanitarian crisis occurring right now. The government needs to stop contributing to and participating in the war.",
