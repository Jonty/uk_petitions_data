This undermines the person's identity and can be considered transphobic in malicious contexts. This is therefore discrimination and harmful to trans-peoples' well-being as it creates a hostile environment for them. This can affect their mental health and it therefore should be made a hate crime. Whenever this is done it should be prosecuted.",
