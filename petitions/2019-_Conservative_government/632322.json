        "action": "Adjust the MOT requirement for a manufacturer fitted airbag to be present.",
        "additional_details": "We would like a provision included in the MOT test to allow the removal of manufacturer fitted airbags in cars with bucket seats and harnesses (both legal modifications under MOT guidelines and usually the minimum requirement for motorsports events) as these types of safety systems are designed to be used without an airbag in place. This will allow those who are interested in using their car in a sporting capacity to make changes to their steering wheel while keeping the car road legal.",
        "background": "Under the current MOT regulations the removal of manufacturer fitted airbags is classed as a major defect. This makes it difficult to fit a racing type steering wheel to a vehicle and have it remain road-legal, this is restrictive to those who wish to use their car for both sport and leisure.",
