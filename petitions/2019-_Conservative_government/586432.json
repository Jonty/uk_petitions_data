        "additional_details": "The government must ensure healthy local democracies by providing more democratic and representative councils by doing one of the following.\r\n\r\n1. Changing electoral system to STV.\r\n2. Reserving 1/3 of council seats for the opposition, distributed proportional according to their share of the vote.\r\n3. Making wards multi-member, elected at the same cycle, but with less votes than seats.\r\n4. Making wards are multi-member, elected in a single cycle, but preventing parties for standing for all its seats.",
        "background": "The government should address the democratic deficit in local councils caused by first-past-the-post which has led to councils like Lewisham, where the ruling party holds all the seat despite just under 40% of people voting for a different party; and elsewhere has led to cases of alleged corruption.",
