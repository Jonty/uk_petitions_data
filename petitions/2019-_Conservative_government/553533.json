        "additional_details": "Many students all over England are suffering from the same problems students in Scotland are facing, yet we aren't given the same helping hand. Universities, landlords and Government advice may have painted a different reality to what students are currently experiences, cases are rampant and student accomodation are hot spots. To those that are vulnerable, there is no safety continuing to reside there especially as Universities all provide a remote learning option. It's unfair and causing grief.",
        "background": "In Scotland The Coronavirus Act 2020 has been put in place since the 27th May, it allows students affected by COVID-19 to leave their tenancy agreements for any related reasons, e.g financial hardship. We want the same legislation in England, we were never given that opportunity and are trapped.",
