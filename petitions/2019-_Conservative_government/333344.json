        "additional_details": "Putting emphasis on lowering calories will have detrimental effects on the mental health of the estimated 1.25 million Brits with eating disorders. This new obesity strategy is unnecessary and if customers want to know the calories they can ask a staff member. Furthermore, the amount of calories consumed and BMI number are not good health indicators. Instead the Government should help the public know some balanced meal combinations and make fruit and vegetables cheaper and more accessible.",
        "background": "The Government's new obesity strategy says it aims to \u201cempower adults and children to live healthier lives.\u201d This is very important of course and obesity is a growing issue but the action of putting calories on menus will be extremely damaging to those who have/are recovering from eating disorders.",
