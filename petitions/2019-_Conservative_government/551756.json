        "additional_details": "Locking down a country against a pandemic virus does not work. All locking down achieves is to slow the transition rate of the virus during the period of lock down. The transmission rate then accelerates the moment lock down is lifted. A herd immunity approach would be a far more successful approach to beating Covid 19, as several countries are now proving after adopting a herd immunity approach. We should  protect the people who are vulnerable to Covid 19 everyone else should go herd immunity.",
        "background": "For a lock down to have any chance of eliminating a pandemic virus the entire planet would be required to lock down simultaneously for a minimum of several weeks . This is not practicable and is never going to happen. To beat Covid 19 our government should revert to plan A. A herd immunity approach",
