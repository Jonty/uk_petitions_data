        "additional_details": "The 70mph speed limit was introduced in 1965 (almost 60 years ago), before the adoption of modern vehicle safety systems such as ABS, AEB, Airbags, Adaptive Cruise Control etc.\r\n \r\nConsidering the adoption of electric and fuel-efficient vehicles, we think the environmental impact would be minimal.\r\n \r\nFrom an economic perspective, increasing the motorway limit could lead to reduced travel times and increased productivity, stimulating commerce and contributing to economic growth.\r\n",
        "background": "We think the Government should increase the legal speed limit on all motorways from 70mph to 80mph. Consider that advancements in automotive technology have equipped modern vehicles with enhanced safety features, making them better suited to handle higher speeds safely.",
