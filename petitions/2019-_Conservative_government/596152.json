        "additional_details": "Unpaid work breaks is a particular issue for Keyworkers, who were some of those most at risk during the pandemic. For example, most supermarkets don't pay for the break times of their staff. It is not a legal requirement unless stated in their employee contract. Supermarkets have proven to be one of the most profitable and sustainable businesses during these times, yet they do not pay for breaks even though most have had record profits this year. It's time we start paying for these breaks.",
        "background": "Under employment law employees have a right to an uninterrupted rest break of at least 20 minutes if they work more than six hours a day. Most employers require staff to take this break, or even longer breaks, often without pay, which leaves many employees financially worse off.",
