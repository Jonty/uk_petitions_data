        "action": "Intervene and stop Network Rail from felling matures trees on their tracks",
        "additional_details": "Because this deforestation is a massive loss of nature that harbours masses of wildlife, provides a pollution & sound screen from the trains, and is our most important carbon sink, when the governments own leadership implored the world to do more on climate change only 2 years ago.  It is ecocide, a loss to future generations that can't be retrieved, and totally undermines our credibility on the issue.",
        "background": "The government & parliament needs to intervene immediately to stop Network Rail from felling up to 13million trees (estimates from their own internal documents) along 22,000 miles of track, review the programme in the light of our climate crisis & force them to replant all trees cut down, elsewhere.",
