        "additional_details": "Many people who keep companion animals are poor. Vet bills are an essential expense. Animals provide invaluable companionship for thousands of people. Research shows the benefits of the relationship for people's mental and physical health. If the animal is ill or injured a trip to the vet is essential. This is already expensive but the addition of VAT makes it painfully so for most people, many of whom are elderly or disabled and who depend on their animals for their well-being. Some people are being forced to give up their animals because of the expense. As a result, refuges and animal shelters are overfull. Anything which reduces the cost would be a godsend for so many people.",
