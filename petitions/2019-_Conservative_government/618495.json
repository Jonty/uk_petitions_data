        "additional_details": "As the age to receive your state pension has been increased significantly over the past several years, it is a fact that more people will die before they reach their state pension age.\r\n \r\nFor people who have worked hard and contributed, and unfortunately die before receiving their state pension, we believe it is fair that their estate or should be awarded an end-of-life payment, This could help cover any outstanding bills or funeral costs, or go to beneficiaries of the deceased's estate. Payments could be along the lines of: 20 yrs \u00a35000, 30 yrs \u00a37500, 40 yrs or more \u00a310,000.",
        "background": "If a person has paid National Insurance for years (eg. 20, 30, 40 years) and they die before receiving a state pension, the Government should make an end-of-life payment to the person's estate. This could help cover bills or funeral costs, or go to people in the deceased's will.",
