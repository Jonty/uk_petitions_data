        "additional_details": "Trans people have been presented as dangerous predators. This is simply not true. Self-ID has been implemented in several European countries with no reported rises in attacks. North Carolina, however, saw an increase in hate crimes in 2016 when ruled that people must use the bathroom corresponding with their birth certificate, with some hate directed at cisgender women.\r\nThe current process for obtaining a GRC is unjust and costly; preventing many trans people from getting legal status sooner.",
        "background": "Earlier this week, figures were published that showed an overwhelming support for improving the life of transgender people in the UK. It has been rumoured that the government intends to scrap these changes, instead setting out the provisions to protect gender segregated areas such as bathrooms.",
