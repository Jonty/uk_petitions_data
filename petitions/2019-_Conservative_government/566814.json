        "additional_details": "Please, it is extremely unfair to predict our grades through mock results from after September. Our current abilities do not align with the abilities we would have had if Covid-19 never took place. If education is so important to the Government and society, they should care about how inaccurate the current grading system is, and aim to improve it and be open to how students feel about it.",
        "background": "We are all begging you to predict our grades based on the amount of progress teachers would believe us to have made from March 2020 to our exam period in 2021 (if Covid-19 never existed). Do not use the data from after March as it would be unfair and unreliable. We don\u2019t deserve to be under-graded.",
