        "additional_details": "Many students perform better in final exams than internal assessments or coursework and not every student in the UK has received the same quality of teaching or has been able to cope mentally with schoolwork, particularly during lockdown. An extra 3 weeks' worth of revision is not adequate to make up for 6 months of missed education without further damaging our mental health.",
        "background": "Assuming that exams will take place - as Gavin Williamson stated today - content should be reduced instead of the futile 3 week postponement. In order to circumvent the issue of different colleges teaching content in a different order, teachers should be allowed to choose which topics they abandon.",
