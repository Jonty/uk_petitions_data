        "additional_details": "The UK is not on course to meet its climate budget for 2030, let alone 2050. Instead of subsidising the transition to technologies that are both cheaper and sustainable (thus helping families deal with the cost-of-living crisis), the Government is delaying the transition and thus increasing the chances that we will not reach global warming targets. This will have disastrous consequences for families in the UK and world-wide and will disproportionately affect the most vulnerable communities.",
        "background": "The UK government has pledged to reach net zero by 2050, in accordance with the 2015 Paris agreement. The Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has just announced measures that weaken these plans. We call on the Prime Minister\u2019s to immediately retract this U-turn.",
