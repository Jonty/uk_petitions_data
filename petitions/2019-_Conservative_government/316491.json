During this unprecedented time, Captian Tom has lifted the spirits of the entire country. On the lead up to his 100th birthday, I think he and his family deserve this Knighthood to go alongside his card from the Queen.",
        "background": "This is a simple one in my opinion - award Captain Tom Moore with a Knighthood, which he 100% deserves. At the time of writing this, he has raised over \u00a312,200,000. Having only started out to raise \u00a31000, that's an unbelievable achievement and one that should be remembered by us all.",
