        "additional_details": "The public was deceived when they initially voted for leaving the E.U. It is not fair that the people couldn't have a second referendum to leave where we, the public, are fully aware of all the consequences, potential downfalls and possible benefits for leaving. \r\nScotland and NI and a lot of people in England never wanted to leave.\r\nThe vote for Boris in December is not an excuse not to do a 2nd ref. because that was voting for a party who were for Brexit not specifically if we want to leave.",
        "background": "The government should allow the British public to have a vote before the end of the transition period. \r\nAfter COVID-19 especially, it is important that the public has a vote which is specifically FOR or AGAINST officially leaving the European Union in a clear and transparent way.",
