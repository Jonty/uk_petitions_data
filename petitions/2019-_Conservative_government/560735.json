        "additional_details": "Higher education students for 2020-21 were advised that universities would be open for business. Tuition was to involve varying degrees of face-to-face learning. Given that learning is now exclusively online and that students are often unable to access library areas in which to do self-study, universities are far from open. Social activity is nil. Students now have no need to remain in accommodation and should be free to return home without incurring financial (rent/bill) losses going forward.",
        "background": "Government needs to reimburse students who have paid for university or accommodation rented from private landlords they have not used during the Covid-19 outbreak. This is to include rent, utility bills and standing charges relating to the rented property. Students are least able to bear the losses.",
