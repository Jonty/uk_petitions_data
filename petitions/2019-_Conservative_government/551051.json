        "additional_details": "We need a cross-party, cross-discipline panel that includes social scientists and human rights and legal experts to scrutinise Covid-19 policies before they are implemented and consider whether the impact of proposals on availability of the NHS, non-Covid deaths, human rights and peoples mental health are proportionate.\r\n \r\nOur mum spent three weeks in hospital without family to comfort her in a state of high anxiety due to strict no visiting policy. She later died of cancer. Strict policies deprived people like our mum of their civil liberties and can cause poor health outcomes and excess deaths that could even outweigh risks from Covid 19.",
        "background": "We believe that the Government\u2019s response to Covid-19 has been disproportionate and not adequately balanced the risks posed by Covid against significant harm including deaths that are not Covid related.",
