CPS should consider both the well-being of overseas victims and the importance of carrying out justice.\r\n\r\nAsking victims to travel internationally, or stopping court cases because they are unable to do so, is an affront to justice. When international travel is impractical expats should be able to give evidence by video link or written statement.",
        "background": "We are asking the Crown Prosecution to allow all victims of crimes whose testimony is needed in court to give evidence regardless of where they live. A clear process should be created to assist and support expat victims who are often treated carelessly by a system that is not set up to help them.",
