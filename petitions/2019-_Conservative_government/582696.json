        "action": "Change the hague convention towards child abduction and custody act 1985.",
        "additional_details": "Around 85% of international child abduction cases are brought against mothers fleeing a domestically abusive situation.\r\nVictims must prove that they are in grave danger of physical or psychological harm. The bar is set so high that women cannot provide the evidence required to stop being returned to a dangerous situation.\r\nIn reality it is only physical violence where there is evidence that the survivor has been to the hospital or police many times that would result in a positive result.",
        "background": "Revoke the Hague Convention 1985, which is outdated and draconian, particularly the definition of \"grave danger\" as described in Article 13.\r\nThe Convention as it stands is diametrically opposed to the laws on violence against women and girls. Psychological abuse is as damaging as physical violence.",
