        "additional_details": "There should be more flexibility to our system whereby the individual child is put at the forefront. There needs to be a focus on creating innovative, creative and imaginative children for the 21st century. We need the whole system to be reviewed and to look at other countries where they have the highest academic success and wellbeing in children e.g. Scandinavian countries.\r\nParents should be given more flexible options (e.g. flexischooling) as a given in the best interest of their child.",
        "background": "Our current system is an outdated one whereby we follow a one size fits all approach. We know how children have various learning styles yet we teach them all the same. We know young children learn through play yet we sit them at desks for long periods. Children are being switched off to learning.",
