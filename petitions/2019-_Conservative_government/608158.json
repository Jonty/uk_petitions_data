        "additional_details": "I want the Government to take steps toward this agreement because it\u2019s an excellent idea for our global recognition. Canada,Australia and New Zealand are some of the UK\u2019s oldest and greatest allies. The CANZUK nations have been through so many things side by side, including WW1 & WWII. We cannot ignore the very nations that brought our country to where it is today. This agreement will improve our Economy, GDP per capita and much more. So sign this petition to make it a reality!",
        "background": "The Government promised that after we left the EU we would secure more trade/defence agreements with our allies. Will the Government consider CANZUK?",
