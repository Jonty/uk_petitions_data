        "additional_details": "We as Legal Guardians have struggled with the fact that when gaining custody of a child we were not entitled to any leave from work to adjust to becoming parents and to settle the child into our family. Given the circumstances we feel it is absolutely necessary that Legal Guardians are allowed bonding time to become established parental figures in the child\u2019s life. We should also have the same financial security as those entitled to maternity, paternity or adoption leave. We do everything just like a biological or adoptive parent.",
        "background": "We are asking the government to consider rights equivalent to paid parental leave for legal guardians who gain full custody of a child. We would like this to be in the form of paid leave, similar to maternity, paternity and adoption leave.",
