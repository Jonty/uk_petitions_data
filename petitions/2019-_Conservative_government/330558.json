        "additional_details": "The early years are a vulnerable time when children\u2019s experiences and environments can negatively influence their development. Growing up in poverty has a long lasting impact on children's development, school attainment and health. Children in more deprived areas are more likely to face a serious illness during childhood and to have a long-term disability. The current SMP puts an added strain on single mothers and families on low incomes and negatively affects the life of their children.",
        "background": "Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) is currently set at \u00a3151. 20 a week, which is not enough to meet the cost of life in the UK and the added costs of providing for a baby, especially for families on low incomes. Government should increase SMP to allow all children to have the best start in life.",
