            "details": "We recognise that some people are opposed to the Government\u2019s decision to add the \u2018XL Bully\u2019 to the list of types of dog prohibited under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. However, the Government has a responsibility to maintain public safety. \r\n\r\nXL Bully dogs are large, muscular animals which can be difficult to control due to their size and cause serious injury. We have seen an increase in dog attacks in recent years, including those causing injuries and fatalities, with the XL Bully being disproportionally involved in this rise. As a result, we have taken decisive action to add XL Bully breed types to the list of breeds prohibited by the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991.  We firmly believe that this approach is needed to reduce the risks to the public from this type.\r\n\r\nThe Government has acted quickly to develop a definition for the XL Bully so the breed type can be banned in law. We convened a group of experts to define the physical characteristics of the breed type. This included representatives from the police, local authorities, devolved administrations and animal welfare experts. We believe the definition correctly captures dogs of this breed type. We recognise that there are other established breeds such as those recognised by the UK Kennel Club that may meet some of the characteristics of the XL Bully breed type. These are not within scope of the ban. This definition and guidance can be found on the government's website, here: Official definition of an XL Bully dog: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/official-definition-of-an-xl-bully-dog/official-definition-of-an-xl-bully-dog\r\n\r\nFrom 31 December 2023 all owners of XL Bully breed types must comply with strict conditions. Breeding, selling, exchanging, gifting, abandoning or allowing these dogs to stray will be banned. Owners will also be required to keep their dog on a lead and muzzled in public. We are encouraging all owners to start training their dogs to wear a muzzle and walk on a lead now, ahead of the restrictions coming into force on 31 December 2023. \r\n\r\nFrom 1 February 2024 it will be a criminal offence to be in possession of an XL Bully in England and Wales, unless owners have a Certificate of Exemption. Further details on how to apply will be provided in due course. Owners will need to adhere to strict rules including holding public liability insurance and for the dog to be microchipped and neutered. Dogs that are less than one year old on 31 January 2024, will need to be neutered by 31 December 2024. Dogs that are older than one year old on 31 January 2024, must be neutered by 30 June 2024. We recommend that owners arrange for their dogs to be neutered as soon as possible to meet these deadlines.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, where owners do not wish to keep their dogs, they can choose to euthanise them. Government will pay a contribution of \u00a3200 towards the costs associated with euthanasia where this takes place before 1 February 2024.  Further details on how to apply for compensation will be provided soon. \r\n\r\nWhile the evidence of numerous attacks has meant that we have had to act to ban this particular breed type, we also recognise that responsible dog ownership is vital across all breeds of dog. Owners whose dogs are dangerously out of control are already breaking the law, and we already have a full range of powers to apply penalties to them. Under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, any dog that is dangerously out of control can be euthanised and their owners put in prison for up to 14 years and be banned from ever owning a dog.\r\n\r\nWe have been working hard with the police, local authorities and animal welfare groups to help prevent attacks by encouraging responsible dog ownership, to ensure dog control issues are addressed before they escalate and to make sure the full force of the law is applied.\r\n\r\nAs part of this work, we are also considering the role of education and training (for both dogs and their owners) in reducing the risk of dog attacks, as well as considering how we can improve data collection and recording and enforcement practices.  \r\n\r\nThese steps address all aspects of tackling irresponsible dog ownership effectively, from prevention to robust, consistent enforcement, focussing on owners as well as on their dogs. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs",

In the statement the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Dr Th\u00e9r\u00e9se Coffey MP, set out commitments to bring forward a ban on the XL Bully dog.\nRead the statement here (https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2023-09-18/hcws1040)\nThe Government stated that it intends to have the legislation in place to deliver the ban of XL Bully dogs by the end of the year and that it will convene experts to define the \u2018American XL bully\u2019 breed type. This group will include police, canine and veterinary experts, and animal welfare stakeholders.\nThe Government has also said that there is a need to safely manage the existing population of these dogs, and that there will therefore be a transition period, and further details on how this period will work will be provided ahead of legislation being introduced later this year. The Government has said that dog owners do not need to take any action at this stage.\nThe petition you have signed has received over 100,000 signatures, so will be considered for debate by the Petitions Committee.
