I\u2019ve heard a lot about mental health services not being very good and taking too long or telling someone else.",

I feel like there\u2019s not enough support for teenagers, and it\u2019s something that needs to be more prioritised because a lot of teenagers have bad mental health and don\u2019t have any support.",
