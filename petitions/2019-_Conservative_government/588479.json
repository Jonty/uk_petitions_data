        "additional_details": "The current emergency restrictions are causing untold suffering and misery for millions. The economy is being irreparably destroyed. Mental health is plummeting. The numbers unemployed are increasing and multiple small to medium sized businesses are failing. \r\n\r\nThe government's perpetual fear narrative risks turning our once free and democratic society, into an authoritarian state. Citizens should be allowed to take individual responsibility for their own health and safety. Bring back old normal.",
        "background": "We were promised it would be just \"three weeks to flatten the curve\". This was back in March 2020. We cannot cancel life in order to preserve life. Enough is enough. If we do not end all Covid-19 restrictions, we risk living under totalitarian rule permanently. All restrictions must end immediately.",
