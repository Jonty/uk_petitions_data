        "additional_details": "The Education Minister needs to look at this seriously, exams have been cancelled for 2021 when realistically year 11 and 13 pupils spend the majority of this academic year revising and doing practice papers.\r\nYear 10 and 12 pupils have missed so much time in school during 2020/2021 they have missed large parts of the curriculum. Children with additional needs have had little support during these times and struggle to learn remotely. There needs to be different ways to assess our children.",
        "background": "Cancel GCSE Exams for the current year 10/12 cohort as they have missed so much of the syllabus during Covid-19. There is a high possibility of questions on the exam papers that the pupils have not been taught let alone revised! This is particularly true for those that have found home learning hard.",
