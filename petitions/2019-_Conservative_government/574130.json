        "additional_details": "If private candidates are required to work with a centre, the Centre should be guaranteed & the centre should act merely as an invigilator & conduit.\r\nI want the Government to mandate this fair procedure in law because last years private candidates did not receive assessment or grades at all. This was not right as these grades are vital to the student\u2019s futures. As a Homeschooler studying independently to be assessed for my Maths IGCSE this year, I need to receive fair evidence-based grades.",
        "background": "Private candidates are students studying independently for GCSEs A-levels and other qualifications. I want guaranteed standardised assessment for all Private candidates by their exam boards. This is because they can\u2019t get Teacher Assessed Grades /access fair CAGs from Centres willing to assess them.",
