        "additional_details": "Self employed people pay tax same as unemployed. Yet receive less benefits. Plus less guidance as employed by themselves. Yet receive 0 support when faced with hard times. Even in an open market when work is rich a self employed person receives no government benefits if work slows. It is unreasonable to offer this support to employed but not self employed. Help self employed people too. Why should one person earning \u00a340k get help as employed yet another at \u00a340k get 0 in the current scenario?",
        "background": "The government have offered 80% rate of pay for employed people who are unable to work during Corina virus. Self employed people should be offered the same benefit whilst they cannot work due to Corina virus to put food on the table & pay rent/mortgage.  They pay the same tax & receive no benefit.",
