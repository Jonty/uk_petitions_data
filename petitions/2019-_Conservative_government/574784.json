        "additional_details": "FPTP allows grave misrepresentation errors to persist on the national and local level. Most seats are held by MPs who earned a minority of the vote; at its worst Belfast South was won in 2015 with only 24.5% of votes. STV would increase proportionality while keeping local representation, which itself would be improved through multi-member constituencies, and would bolster confidence and participation in our elections. No vote would be wasted, and tactical voting would no longer be a necessity.",
        "background": "Our first-past-the-post voting system (FPTP) ensures that minority rule is the norm, and that millions of voters are left dissatisfied and feeling as if their vote doesn't matter. We ask that electoral reform be undertaken, and that the FPTP system be replaced with Single Transferable Vote (STV).",
