        "additional_details": "I would like to see the government address this issue, as people like myself are often unable to travel to other cities and towns to shop or make visits to friends and relatives or simply for recreational visits. Public transport such as bus services need to be required to allow for this, or the Government should fund a service that can address the portability of mobility scooters for those of us who are unable to travel without them. We deserve our independence to travel.",
        "background": "As a disabled woman I am unable to walk long distances and rely on my rented Mobility scooter, however public transport is limited in assisting those of us who need to travel with our scooters, It is about time that those of us who rely on them can access and travel with them on public transport.",
