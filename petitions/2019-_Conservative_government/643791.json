There are too many instances of objects being thrown from motorway bridges or people falling to their deaths and putting others lives at risk whilst moving in high speed traffic on the motorway with little time to react or defend themselves. The risk could be reduced by requiring these bridges be enclosed.",

Require the enclosure of all bridges over motorways to prevent people and objects falling and causing injury and loss of life to others.",
