        "additional_details": "There are elderly people crying in supermarkets because they can't buy basic supplies, like loo roll and store cupboard essentials.  A lot of them are less mobile so may only have access to the shops closest to them, this could result in them going without important basics for long periods of time.  We need to make sure they have access to the things that they need.  Delivery might be best so that they have necessities if and when they have to self isolate.",
        "background": "We need temporary legislation to ensure people in high risk groups are getting vital supplies.  Open shops early exclusively to at risk groups, or ensure care packages of essentials are delivered regularly to keep them safe and well-stocked.",
