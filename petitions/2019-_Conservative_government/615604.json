        "additional_details": "I have worked in the Nursery sector for over 25 years and there remains a significant shortfall in Government funding to early years settings, calculated as \u00a32.60 per child according to the Early Years Alliance. There is an increase in pressure for Early Years to deliver more services and support families, with access to other professional services, such as SEN Auditors and Early years improvement teams, being cut or removed entirely.",
        "background": "The Government must surely recognise that cutting early years funding for children with SEN will have a detrimental effect on their learning. Research shows that there has been an increase in children with additional needs in speech, behaviour & learning needing support during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
