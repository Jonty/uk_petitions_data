        "additional_details": "Students have been significantly impacted due to COVID-19. Students have had a reduced teacher student time and due to this outcome it has consequently effected students learning and ability to gain a high success in their final exams. It would be injustice to enforce an exam when students have been highly impacted due to the current climate. Cancelling the exam would allow students to have work examined that\u2019s been learnt and taken place in a school environment.",
        "background": "We wish for the government to cancel exams for GCSE and A-level students. Due to the inability to cover the full school syllabus. It is unfair to expect students to perform as successfully due to the current climate of COVID-19",
