We have to act now.",
        "background": "We need the government to take action when it comes to commercial fishing and the destruction of planets oceans and seas. 90% of the world's largest fish have now been wiped out and 3.9 billion acres of the seafloor is deforested every year by trawling. It is killing our home, earth.",
