        "additional_details": "Housing developers have the upper say in everything. Even if a plan is rejected by the councils, they are usually won on appeal,  costing the taxpayers thousands each time. County councils need to see the bigger picture and assess road surfaces and traffic. \r\nRoads are awful and gridlocked. Schools are full to bursting. In my area it is a three week wait for a GP appointment. Figures show 430 houses needed building between 2016 and 2019 - nearly 1100 were completed. Act now!!",
        "background": "Housing Developers are building a colossal amount of homes all over the UK. They are destroying towns and villages, overburdening the local infrastructures and destroying vital green space. Local councils need more power opposing this, and stronger rules are needed to protect these areas",
