        "action": "Government must support the aviation industry to deliver testing at airports",
        "additional_details": "The aviation and travel industries have been heavily impacted by coronavirus. Thousands of jobs have been lost and global travel is at a virtual standstill due to the uncertainty of quarantine regulations. If Government is unwilling to provide a tailored package of financial support for the aviation and travel industries, then Government must deliver an effective system of testing at airports. This will help to restore confidence in aviation and enable global travel to restart.",
        "background": "The ever changing system of travel corridors has damaged confidence in air travel. Testing is the vital solution to save thousands of jobs across the travel & aviation sectors. Testing is being used in many countries to maintain public health & restore confidence in travel & to open economies.",
