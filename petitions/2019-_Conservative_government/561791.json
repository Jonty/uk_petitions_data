        "additional_details": "Having to balance a placement as well as a job to be able to afford necessities is near impossible. Work morale and motivation is reduced as it essentially \u2018free labour\u2019. The duties carried out by students are those equivalent to a \u2018Healthcare Assistant\u2019 and \u2018Qualified\u2019 staff member. A training grant has been put into place but this does still not reflect the work Students do whilst on placement.",
        "background": "Those on healthcare related courses are having to work full time hours on no pay other than a \u2018training grant\u2019 this makes it extremely difficult to live on a means tested student finance and a grant that is equivalent to a few months work.",
