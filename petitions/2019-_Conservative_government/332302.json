        "additional_details": "Many people have lost their livlihoods for the foresable future with very little income and in some cases, a shortage of income to cover outgoings every month. Being forced to wear face masks indefinitely will cause further loss in income. We cannot buy only one mask each as they need to be washed regularly and wear out or need to be thrown away for hygiene reasons. The price of face masks is already skyrocketing and in many cases the choice may be face masks or food.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to provide free face masks for people on benefits and low incomes, senior citizens, the vulnerable and disabled, students and children under 18 if still at school or unemployed for as long as it is mandatory to wear them.",
