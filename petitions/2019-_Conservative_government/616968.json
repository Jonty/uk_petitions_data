        "additional_details": "We want the Government to do this because we want younger people to be educated on how to stay safe with knives, learn to treat knives seriously, and to try and lower the amount of cases of knife crime as it has been rising in the recent years.\r\n \r\nWe believe that target audience best suited to educate about knife crime is 12-14, these are the years 8 and 9 in secondary school. We believe this is the age where they are mature enough to understand and take this subject seriously.",
        "background": "We want the Government to make it mandatory for all schools to teach students about knife crime in Year 8 and 9. This should cover the dangers of knives and offences involving knives, including carrying a knife in public without a good reason.",
