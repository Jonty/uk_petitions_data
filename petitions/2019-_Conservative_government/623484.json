        "additional_details": "Green Park is already a Royal park with a link to the monarchy. There is no clear or historical reason why it is named Green Park. During the period of national mourning it became the place closest to Buckingham Palace where her public could lay flowers, leave messages and reflect on her life. It was also central to her funeral. The late Queen herself loved to be in nature. I myself was moved by the carpet of floral tributes laid there.",
        "background": "I would like the Govt to seek the endorsements necessary and rename Green Park as Queen Elizabeth Park as a memorial to our late Queen,  which is at the heart of London. I would like this formally done on the anniversary of her death in 2023.",
