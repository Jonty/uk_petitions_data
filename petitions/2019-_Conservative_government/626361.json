        "additional_details": "The current chaos is a direct result of Johnson\u2019s inability to rule competently. The catastrophe of Truss was a direct result of his behaviour and his reappointment makes our democracy laughable. Johnson is not the answer unless the question is \u2018who created this mess\u2019. If the government wish to heap implausibility and tone deafness to the interests of their people, this is a great way to do it. Jokes aside people are suffering and an end to this incompetence is needed not another round.",
        "background": "Boris Johnson stood down due to gross incompetence and is now under investigation for illegal behaviour while in power. His actions directly precipitated the current crisis. Standing again is against the national interest and must not be entertained by our democratic leadership.",
