        "additional_details": "The right to buy scheme is unsustainable in current times, if the government has a true desire to see homelessness and unsuitable living conditions relieved by having social housing available.  Some authorities have seen their housing depleted at a minimum of a third of the housing available. These homes are often family homes converted once purchased, into flats/apartments/HMO's by private landlords only seeking to make a profit. Social housing should be for social tenants.",
        "background": "The Right to Buy scheme was introduced in 1980 and is designed to help council and housing association tenants in England buy their home at a discount. This scheme has led to a visible decimation of the council and social housing stock as so little stock is being constructed.",
