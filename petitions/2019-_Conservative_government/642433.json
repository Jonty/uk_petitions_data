        "action": "Change the maximum pedal assist speed of electric bicycles from 15.5mph to 20mph",
        "additional_details": "Electric Bikes (EAPC) are a way of getting people off cars and on bikes. They strike a perfect balance between keeping fit and getting from A to B. Cars are the leading cause of pedestrian deaths in the UK and it is vital we encourage people to get onto two wheels. Many people view cycling as a form of leisure and we think that electric bikes still promote fitness and leisure and also encourage people to switch from cars since they reduce the physical demands of cycling.",
        "background": "The maximum speed an electric bike can go is 15.5mph with pedal assist before it cuts out and this should be increased to 20mph like in the USA. When riding an electric bike I often get overtaken by cyclists on non pedal assist bikes and shows that the speed for pedal assist should change.",
