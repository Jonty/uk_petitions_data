All the information we have, we had to find out for ourselves with no help off any government led healthcare professional. \r\nWe have been made to jump through hoops to apply for an EHCP that many people do not know about. This is more than a 20 week process, within which time I have seen my child regress exponentially.  \r\nThe process does not put my child's needs at the forefront.\r\nEvery child has a right to education and support.",
        "background": "The government needs to make support more accessible for families with SEND. Educationally, financially, and care wise. Information is difficult to come by and it is a very hard, emotional and long process to get the child the support they have a right to.",
