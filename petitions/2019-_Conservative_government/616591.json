        "additional_details": "Without animals being able to be adopted, many of the rescue shelters will have to resort to euthanasing any animals that they cannot afford to keep. The rescues will also be forced to close as they rely on adoptions and sponsorships to keep running.  It is completely ludicrous for so many respectable charities to be put into this situation through no fault of their own. It should be the charities that have been caught breaking the law facing the consequences of their actions, not the animals.",
        "background": "Today DEFRA have extended the ban on importing rescue animals from Romania, Ukraine, Belarus and Poland for an additional 2 months.\r\n\r\nThis ban has already been in place for 1 month already and needs to be reversed for the rescue shelters that rely on the adoption of their animals to rescue more.",
