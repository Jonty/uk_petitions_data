        "additional_details": "Ear cropping is barbaric and un-necessary. It is purely cosmetic and has no place in caring dog ownership. Ear cropping is often  a preferred cosmetic procedure for people wanting 'designer' dogs and has no place in responsible dog ownership. Banning ownership of dogs with cropped ears should complement the existing ban on this procedure, and any ban on imports of dogs with cropped ears. Owners of dogs with cropped ears would be subject to investigation and prosecution.",
