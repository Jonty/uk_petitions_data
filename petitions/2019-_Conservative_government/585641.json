Not to do so is reckless & putting pupils & their families at risk. Currently Driving and Vehicles Standards Agency examiners are not required to be vaccinated against Covid-19. None of us know what the outcome of Covid-19 will be and these issues need to be addressed now not when it is too late. ",

The risk of contracting Covid-19 is higher in a car with a confined space of approx. 30cm between pupils & examiners, especially for those with underlying health conditions.",
