        "additional_details": "UK is one of worse hit countries from Covid19. Children are the first vehicle of infection and scientists suggest schools reopening in fase 2 would not be safe for children, family and staff. Looking at other countries, Italy will not reopen schools before September 2020. Due to relaxation measures in Germany, they are experiencing a second wave of Covid 19 infections. Government should help students to be able to attend lessons from home instead of putting them, staff and relatives at such risk",
        "background": "While education Secretary is thinking to reopen schools in different fases from 1st of June 2020, we think Government or Parliament should not consider to reopen schools at least before September 2020.",
