We were attempting to get out of the car to a place of safety. I was half out of the car when hit and my leg has been crushed between the door and the barrier. Had my partner also been getting out he would have been hit head on by the vehicle and this may have been fatal. \r\n\r\nWe are the lucky ones as too many preventable fatalities have happened in these circumstances.",

Having a live lane in replace of a hard shoulders is dangerous and many road traffic accidents could have been prevented if there was a hard shoulder rather than a live lane.",
