        "additional_details": "In a time when both equality and diversity are being accepted, it is unacceptable that transgender children are made to feel they are not accepted or supported in an education setting.\r\n\r\nRecent actions to support women and girls are a great start - but more needs to be done to ensure transgender pupils are not discriminated against by schools.\r\n \r\nCurrently the Equality Act 2010 provides an exception for single-sex schools, which allows them to admit pupils of only one sex. We believe schools should not be entitled to rely on this exception to discriminate against transgender pupils in admissions policies or the provision of education.",
        "background": "A school trust running several girls schools has said that it will no longer accept transgender pupils. This is unacceptable and should not be allowed. ",
