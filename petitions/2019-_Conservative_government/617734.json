Remote working opens up employment to numerous groups who are currently unable to access it, from parents with childcare issues to the disabled who may struggle in an in office environment. \r\n\r\nRemote working also has many potential advantages to both employers and employees, including but not only:\r\n\r\n- Better work/life balance\r\n- Financial benefits\r\n- Increased productivity\r\n- Improved staff health and wellbeing",
