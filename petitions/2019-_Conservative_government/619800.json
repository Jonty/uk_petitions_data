        "additional_details": "Since COVID the economy has taken a hit, which the taxpayers are paying for. I also appreciate we have a duty to be net zero by 2050. A year to replace 1000's of cars that are not compliant, the manufacturers already have waiting lists for new cars so they can't meet the demand. There is a shortage in second-hand cars. \u00a312.50 per day to drive is extortionate, the unemployment rate will rise as people can't afford to get to work. People don't have the finances to accommodate all these increases.",
        "background": "Government need to at a minimum delay the ULEZ coming to Greater London for a few years. The majority of these people cannot afford to replace their cars if they are not compliant. Having seen an increase in the cost of living, energy and fuel amongst other things, & our wages not reflecting this.",
