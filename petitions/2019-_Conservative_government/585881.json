The only conclusions to be drawn are that either the government acted reasonably; or that it did not lockdown soon enough. The fundamental question as to whether or not they should have locked down at all will remain unanswered.",

It is imperative that the inquiry also considers whether or not the collateral damage caused by the lockdown(s) was justified and that they were ethically and scientifically sound.",
