        "additional_details": "There is presently no way of getting a 2nd Covid jab for 12-17 year-olds in the UK, unless they are clinically vulnerable or live with such a person. This means that most of them cannot travel abroad without facing restrictions abroad. Other countries do not consider a single dose for this age group 'fully vaccinated'. Consequently, 12-17 year-olds are effectively excluded from short stay visits with family abroad, educational trips and exchange programmes with other countries.",
        "background": "I want a 2nd Covid vaccination dose made available to all 12-17 year-olds, so that this age group can travel abroad without having to face restrictions many countries are placing on travellers who are not fully vaccinated.",
