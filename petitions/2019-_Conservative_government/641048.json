        "additional_details": "The property sector is an integral part of the economy, this problem is not specific to landlords/ investors, for example builders, carpenters, plumbers, electricians, architects, planning consultants, builders merchants, estate agents, mortgage Brokers, Insurance Brokers. The increased costs with owning BTL property will ultimately be passed onto to the hard-working people that rent in the UK. In may also lead to a temporary shortage of available housing, something nobody wants to see happen. We need creative and decisive action to be taken immediately by the government and UK banking sector.",
        "background": "Landlords & investors are finding it almost impossible to refinance existing properties, or indeed purchase new BTL properties, which is stifling the investment sector and more importantly the surrounding industries related and reliant on the UK BTL market.",
