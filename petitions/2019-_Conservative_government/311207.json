As a young farmer, I feel like we are not being protected by the governments bail out package. And we will lose thousands of small business who keep the economy going producing healthy produce for our local communities. We need help in this time, a Grant to help us through. The British farmer is going to be needed more than ever once the pandemic has passed",

Many farms have high feed & running costs, & need a Grant to cover these costs during this pandemic. The smallest farms are not eligible for the Small Business Grant, & we risk losing thousands of them during this period",
