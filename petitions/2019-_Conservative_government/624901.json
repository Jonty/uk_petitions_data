        "additional_details": "It is the prerogative of Parliament, and the combined decision of Rt. Hon. Members and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his role as 'Master of the Mint' to authorise and approve coin designs tendered by the Royal Mint as a 100% government-owned limited company.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Mint has overseen the erroneous naming on His Majesty on his coinage, breaking 1,000 years of tradition. British law under the Act of Restoration 1660 is enshrined in Latin, and recognises the new King to be CAROLUS III REX.",
        "background": "The Chancellor of the Exchequer and Rt Hon. Members of the Privy Council in His Majesty's Government and Opposition have the power to sanction a review of the UK Coinage under their authority to approve  and suggest coin designs. The Royal Mint is erroneously referring to the King as CHARLES III REX",
