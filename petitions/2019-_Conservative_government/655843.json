However, gluten itself is not required to be listed on food labels, just the items that contain gluten, such as wheat. I would ask that the Government require  the specific addition of \u2018GLUTEN\u2019 in brackets after gluten containing ingredients - for example WHEAT (GLUTEN) to ensure food labels are more transparent for sufferers, and anyone selecting food to provide to a coeliac sufferer.",
        "background": "Currently food labelling has to include bold lettering for barley, wheat, rye and oats. These are gluten containing ingredients, but gluten itself does not have to be mentioned. This can be confusing for coeliac sufferers and those providing food or drinks to coeliac sufferers.",
