        "additional_details": "In the UK 80% of us choose cremation, with around 470,000 per year. For every one around 245 kg of carbon and many pollutants is released, totalling 115,000 tonnes yearly. Cremation is an important option, but Human Composting provides an environmentally friendly alternative. Fuel is saved and the carbon and nutrients of the body are kept. \r\n\r\nUK residents deserve the full spectrum of deathcare options, allowing everybody the chance to have their final wishes met. Therefore NOR should be legalised.",
        "background": "Natural Organic Reduction, legal in 4 US states, is the gentle transformation of the human body into soil. Many feel a symbolic and spiritual significance of returning to the soil, and loved ones have a sense of ceremony; they can scatter, plant trees with, or donate remains to ecological projects.",
