        "additional_details": "Companies need to be forced into this decision as they have not stopped testing on animals because there isn't a law telling them not to. If the law isn't going to pass to end testing on animals, then we need to make it harder for companies by deterring people from buying their products by labelling them with \"not cruelty free\" \r\n\r\nRather like when cigarette companies were forced to put images on their packaging showing the affects of smoking, this deterred people and less people now smoke.",
        "background": "We want companies that continue to test on animals or use ingredients that test on animals to label their products showing that they continue to use this method instead of cruelty free ways of testing like more ethical brands. This will create more awareness and ethical buying from consumers.",
