        "additional_details": "The Government should immediately implement the extended free childcare announced in the budget and not delay this much needed support any longer. The current proposal of 2 year olds being able to access free childcare from April 2024, 9 months+ being able to access it from September 2024 onwards and fives and under accessing it from September 2025 leaves many families who are struggling now without this much needed support. Why leave families struggling unnecessarily for at least another year.",
