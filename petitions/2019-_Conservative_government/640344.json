        "additional_details": "Fishing for the young in large quantities is still allowed (although it is controlled). Due to their rarity, the price of them has soared in recent years averaging \u00a3150 a kilo on the legal market. This price can dramatically increase into the thousands on the black market. If this doesn't end soon then there is a very real chance this species will go extinct from our waterways.",
        "background": "I would like a full ban on the fishing of elvers (young eels) in England. Since the 1980s the European eel population has decreased by 98% and is now listed as critically endangered. The Government must take action to protect this species.",
