        "additional_details": "If would be a devastation if such a virus went virulent in prisons. The already burdened NHS would be outstretched beyond its capabilities. A release of some 160,000 non-violent offenders would substantially ease the Health Service\u2019s capacity and more importantly, a prisoners life and well being. On release, prisoners would abide by a strict curfew, electronically tagged. Such arrangements are already in place for prisoners nearing the end of their sentences. Let prisoners self isolate at home.",
        "background": "The Government must seriously set about the release of those prisoners who are serving sentences under 4 years for non-violent crimes amidst the ongoing outbreak of the Corona-virus. The deadly virus has spread sporadically across the UK and has recently been detected in multiple HMP establishments.",
