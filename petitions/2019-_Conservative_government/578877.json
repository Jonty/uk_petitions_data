        "action": "Legalise the use of pepper spray as a form of self-defence",
        "additional_details": "Currently, the most effective form of self-defence for British women is to carry a rape alarm. There is nothing of any reasonable effect that women can carry, use or own for self-defence in the\u00a0UK that wouldn't be classified by police as an \u201coffensive\u201d weapon.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPepper spray causes immediate closing of the eyes, difficulty breathing, runny nose, and coughing. Using pepper spray against an attacker can drastically increase the victim's chance of getting to safety without causing severe harm.",
        "background": "Pepper spray is a widely recognised non-lethal deterrent that can be used for self-defence, therefore reducing the risks of assault. It is currently considered to be an offensive weapon. \r\n\r\nThis petition calls upon the British government to legalise the use of pepper spray for self-defence.\u00a0",
