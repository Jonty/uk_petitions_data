        "additional_details": "Students are struggling more than people realise, with student finance handouts rarely covering the costs of rising rents and soaring grocery and energy bills. A youth crisis package will allow those who are struggling the most to avail of additional support, instead of a blanket increase which could see young people disproportionately funded. Government support will ensure students aren't forced to make big decisions around their futures, due to current concerns around short-term finances",
        "background": "Young people are entitled to higher education, but the hard financial situations students face have negative effects on mental health and studies, says a Student Beans poll. 29% receive under \u00a35000 of student finance per year, two-thirds less than minimum wage earners, despite similar expenditures.",
