        "action": "Reform planning law and create a Planning Code",
        "additional_details": "We think the current planning system is unworkable and is highly complex. There are over 30 complicated laws which relate to planning. Planning applications are being challenged through the courts which slow down vital projects such as house building and infrastructure. We think we need this reform urgently. Wales is intending to create a Planning Code to simplify and modernise planning law and the UK Government should do the same.",
        "background": "We call upon the Government to create a Planning Code to reform highly complex planning law and make it easier for planning permission to be granted, with restrictions on legal challenges to improve infrastructure and other services.",
