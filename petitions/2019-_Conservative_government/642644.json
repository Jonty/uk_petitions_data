We carry epi-pens around with us where ever we go. There are so many people in the same situation. Peanut allergies can make holidays abroad, eating places, sleep overs, parties much more difficult for sufferers.\r\n \r\nPalforzia costs thousands of pounds through private healthcare. We want the Government to provide funding so it can be made more widely available through the NHS.\r\n",
