        "additional_details": "Work with wedding venues to reduce the risk of further businesses going in to administration. People need to be able to get together and celebrate after such a horrible year. Weddings have been planned for years and already postponed once or cancelled. The new guidelines do not amount to allowing what anyone would call a wedding. \r\nLet\u2019s get the system working.\r\nSchools, shops, restaurants, pubs are all open again so not being able to eat or drink following a wedding doesn\u2019t seem to make any sense",
        "background": "The current guidelines are extremely limiting and will cripple the wedding industry. I also believe that people have the right to make a choice and be able to celebrate what is for some a once in a lifetime event. Increase in allowed numbers and receptions to be allowed.",
