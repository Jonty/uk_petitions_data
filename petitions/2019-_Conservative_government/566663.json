This will mean students will have to take another year out: which will cause students to be stressed. This is an enormous injustice to these students as many have worked incredibly hard towards getting their grades and refusing them would have a significant impact on the quality of their education and it would be a massive inconvenience for them to be held back an extra year.",
        "background": "Ofqual needs to help students who are sitting their GCSE and A-levels externally. External candidates were not helped during last years(2020) fiasco, this caused many students to become depressed as they were not able to get into university or college.",
