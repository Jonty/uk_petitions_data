        "additional_details": "Fireworks have been a source of concern for some time now due to the harm they cause to both humans and animals. The loud noises and bright flashes of light produced by non-silent fireworks can cause severe distress in people, leading to anxiety, panic attacks, and even physical injuries. Animals, on the other hand, are particularly susceptible to the negative effects of fireworks. Pets, wildlife, and other animals can suffer from severe stress, injuries, and even death due to the loud noises and bright flashes of light emitted by these fireworks. Therefore, we must ban the use of non-silent fireworks to ensure the safety, well-being, and tranquillity of our communities and the environment.",
