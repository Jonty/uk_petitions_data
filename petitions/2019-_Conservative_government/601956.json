A person who has committed crimes and has met the mens rea and actus reus component of their crimes should be sentenced and serve the full sentences for what they have done. Running a concurrent sentence does not provide adequate justice to the victims involved in horrific trauma! I am saddened to see the poor quality of how the law is applied in such circumstances.",
