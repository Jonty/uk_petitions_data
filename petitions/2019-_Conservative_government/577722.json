        "additional_details": "Over the course of the last year the government has announced a total of five SEISS payments, each supposedly covering a three month period from March 2020 to September 2021. The only problem is that there are eighteen months in that period, but five payments covering three months apiece clearly only covers a total of fifteen months. The Chancellor has wilfully neglected to cover three months of earnings for the self employed. Many will struggle if this gap is not plugged immediately.",
        "background": "The government has offered employed workers on furlough consistent support for an eighteen month period, but only fifteen months worth of support for the self employed during that same period. We ask that The Chancellor addresses this issue immediately in order to restore parity with the employed.",
