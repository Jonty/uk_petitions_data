        "additional_details": "Current resuscitation statistics in the UK are staggeringly low, this could be changed by implementing the compulsory training of the chain of survival, which is proven to save lives. This teaching of children is proven to give patients the best chance when they suffer a cardiac arrest out of hospital. Norway has implemented this into the curriculum since 1961 and has the highest survival rate in the world of 25% in comparison to the UK of only 8-10%. This could save so many people worth saving.",
        "background": "I would like it to be compulsory for schools who teach children ages 8+ to teach them the chain of survival (including how to call for help, how to use an AED safely if one is available, how to administer cardiovascular resuscitation).",
