        "additional_details": "Nearly 5 million self-employed people in the UK not to mention countless numbers of people on zero hours contracts have been shown little consideration during the Coronavirus outbreak being offered virtually no assistance in helping them to make ends meet and support their families. Employed people and businesses have been given support from the start of the crisis including a guarantee of at least 80% of their wages. The same needs to be given to the self-employed immediately.",
        "background": "The Government needs to provide ALL self-employed people and those on zero hours contracts with a full and immediate living allowance at the same level as those who are employed. Failure to do so will cause terrible damage to people\u2019s lives and their ability to recover after this crisis ends.",
