        "additional_details": "Successive governments have not adequately increased NHS funding, and appear too focused on lowering taxes. We believe this is short-term populist low tax electioneering.\r\n\r\nI believe the public sentiment is misread. People care a lot about health and I believe people are willing to contribute more for better outcomes.\r\n\r\nNHS Funding is needed to fix public/private inequality, staff issues, backlogs and quality of care, fundamentally to help us to survive treatable illness.",
        "background": "We ask for a referendum to be held on increasing NHS funding by 25% through ringfenced taxes.\r\nModern medicine needs good funding. Cancer backlogs, A&E issues & wages are not fixed by \"efficiency\" talk. Significant monetary increases are needed & a public choice on NHS quality should be offered.",
