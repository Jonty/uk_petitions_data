        "additional_details": "Many elderly, vulnerable patients have been stuck in hospitals without visitors, some confused about where they are, becoming demoralised and deteriorating. Visitor bans don't ensure that patients do not catch Covid. Elderly and vulnerable patients can be too unwell to manage or make decisions on their own, and need family or friends\u2019 presence and support. Giving these patients legal rights to visitors (with PPE/testing as needed), could help their care and recovery, saving NHS resources.",
        "background": "Though national Covid restrictions have been lifted, many hospitals are still denying patients visitors. Elderly and vulnerable adults in hospital often depend on friends and family to advocate for their care, support them, and help with eating/drinking. Give them legal rights to hospital visitors.",
