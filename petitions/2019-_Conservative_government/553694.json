        "additional_details": "This sport can help keep young people off the streets and is an important part of some communities. Many boxers, coaches and officials volunteer their time unpaid yet are unable to compete in the UK. No coaching or education courses are being run and this is detrimental to the next generation of boxers.\r\n \r\nThis is about allowing volunteers to prove they can provide a safe environment for competitions to take place and boxers to achieve their dreams and careers. These young people need your support.",
        "background": "Currently young people can go to a pub and drink but cannot take part in amateur boxing, unlike football, rugby and professional boxing. We believe this is unfair, and amateur boxing should be exempted from Covid-19 restrictions so this activity can resume.",
