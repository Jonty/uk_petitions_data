Some children will have been able to keep up, others will have been unable due to illness, grief, parents working, sharing laptops / the internet.\r\n\r\nThis has put a huge amount of pressure on schools, parents and children at a time of unprecedented circumstances and worry. \r\n\r\nMany children won't be ready for the next school year, they need to complete this one. The school system is shaken let's make it better.",

From Sept 2020 the school starting age would be 1 year older. Give extra funding to Early Years to support an extra year group. Exam years could still move on if not retaking.",
