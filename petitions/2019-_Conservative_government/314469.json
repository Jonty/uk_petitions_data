        "additional_details": "Instead of making a fund for victims who can't afford funerals, daily conferences preaching for people to stay inside, whilst ignoring medical advice themselves, including the Prime Minister and the Health Secretary. \r\n\r\nThey have refused ventilator deals by non-sponsors of their party, sending vulnerable people to work, not giving medical staff appropriate PPE, not giving info to those flying back from affected areas and NHS 111 giving out incorrect advice, which has led to thousands of deaths.",
        "background": "Due to Government negligence, many families of the victims of COVID-19 can't afford to pay for funeral expenses. Instead of covering these expenses, the Government has chos to spend \u00a35.8mil on sending a letter with old info about the virus. The least they could do is cover the costs for funerals.",
