Furthermore, it will provide a much needed boost to the UK Economy during this difficult time. In addition, thousands of people worldwide are due to travel to the UK for this event and this is not fair on those people who are visiting this country for a competition that they love. This will damage the reputation of the United Kingdom and therefore - the government should block this strike action accordingly.",

This petition has been created for the government who has funded \u00a310M into the competition this year to block these strikes from taking place.",
