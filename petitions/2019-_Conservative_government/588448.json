Levels of physical activity have reduced during Covid. How can we get children to be active at school, when they are restricted by blazers, ties, shoes and skirts? How can we encourage physical activity throughout the whole day (not just during PE). Unbranded, activewear would enable more children to be active and encourage schools to provide more physical activities in school.",

Schools encourage physical activity, but many children are required to wear unsuitable uniforms (blazers, shoes, skirts) which restrict physical activity.",
