We're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. \r\n\r\nWe're not sure what you mean by 'cancer blood checks'. There are many different types of blood test, used for a range of purposes, including helping diagnose cancer and other conditions, checking for specific tumour markers, and checking general health.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. However, decisions on which clinical procedures to offer are an operational matter for the NHS. We can only accept petitions where the UK Government or Parliament are responsible for the issue you raise. "
