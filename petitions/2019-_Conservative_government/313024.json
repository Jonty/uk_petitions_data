        "additional_details": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak needs to address this large group of people and find a solution so they are not left without income. This is almost a repeat of the original disregard for self-employed people. \r\n\r\nThe government needs to treat new workers like any other employee. They should be furloughed with pay so they can stay in employment and receive 80% of their wages like the millions of others, rather than leaving new employees with no income out of no fault of their own.",
        "background": "PAYEE employees and self employed workers are entitled to furlough pay. However this doesn't apply to new workers who have just started a job with a new employer after the 28th of February 2020. This leaves thousands of workers with choosing unpaid furlough or having to find a new job.",
