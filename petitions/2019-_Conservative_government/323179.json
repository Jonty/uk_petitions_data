        "additional_details": "we have had people put on furlough getting 80% of there wages paid for staying at home with no risk to them self and then you have key workers having to go to work for the same normal pay with a much much greater risk of catching covid 19 I feel it\u2019s unfair that key workers are risking there lives for nothing extra when people are getting 80% with no risk. I think it would be nice if the government was to show a thank you for risking there lives to keep this county going",
        "background": "I think it would be a good thing to reward the key workers who have kept the county going during covid 19 crisis. Not all company\u2019s have given there staff a reward bonus for working though it to keep the county going.",
