        "additional_details": "University students signed contracts to attain the right of residency within their student accommodation without prior knowledge of government plans for lockdown. Thus they were not aware of the autonomous decision which has caused damage to their investment. \r\n\r\nThis right of residency has been damaged severely by government policy on travel to and from university - causing financial loss. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Government should provide compensation for losses (rent for the period of lockdown).",
        "background": "The Government should setup a scheme and process where students can claim financial damages and compensation for government lockdown policy which is currently preventing students access to their accommodation at university.",
