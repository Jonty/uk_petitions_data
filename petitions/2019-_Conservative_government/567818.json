        "additional_details": "Nursing courses require 50% of their content being practical learning. Yet some students are being denied this, clinical skills now being done online and placements being put back. Nurses will not feel comfortable performing duties that require physical intervention if they have not had the relevant support.\r\n\r\nSome universities are cancelling placements and clinical skills due to the current situation. I'm hoping this could be changed so it is made compulsory for critical care courses.",
