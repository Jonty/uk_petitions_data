        "action": "Let people recently made redundant apply for furlough directly from the Gov",
        "additional_details": "Companies have been forced to make redundancies and now there are people who could have been kept on furlough who find themselves unemployed and not eligible for anything more than \u00a370 a week, which is not sufficient when we have bills to pay, children to feed and no prospects of a new job anytime soon. It\u2019s now luck of the draw whether you are on furlough and former employers are not under any obligation to put former employees back on payroll.",
        "background": "Instead of making workers go to their ex employers to ask to be reinstated and put back on furlough, which would of course involve financial implications for them, let people apply directly to the government. Or make new JSA based on recent earnings instead of \u00a370 a week!",
