        "additional_details": "Bees pollinate about three-quarters of all British crops. It is thought that in the past 10 years, the British bee population has declined by a third. Neonicotinoids are known to kill bees & other insect life. The UN & WHO have said that their use is having an adverse effect on bees. Without bees, crops will not be pollinated. The Government should not be risking a future without bees for a short term gain.",
        "background": "Neonicotinoids are banned in the EU because of the harm their use causes to insect life &, more importantly, to bees. The UK Government is again allowing them to be used, this time on the sugar beet crop, to prevent virus from attacking it.",
