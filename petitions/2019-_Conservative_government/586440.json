The earlier you can catch the symptoms of abuse, the earlier you can stop homicide and child abuse. To be cynical, reducing the social cost of abuse not treated. \r\n\r\nBy providing a helpline funded by the Gov and with immediate referral to medical, social and psychological therapies, we can  help stop the trauma of many people and identify issues much earlier on than they are currently..",
