At this time, I was in a heterosexual relationship but now I am in a same sex relationship, I have been told I no longer fit the criteria and I cannot have free IVF treatment. This is discrimination and I believe anybody in my situation is entitled to free IVF. Especially, as I have been told prior that I was entitled to it.",
