Hearing Aids are amazing, but they are not always effective.\r\n \r\nMy baby boy, Alvie, is moderately deaf. We have chosen to learn BSL. It is amazing that BSL is now a recognised language, but it isn\u2019t enough if people don\u2019t have the money to learn it.\r\n \r\nPlease sign this to help parents to get free and easy access to learn BSL.",
