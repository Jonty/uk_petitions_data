        "additional_details": "If 30 free hours were available,  student midwives would feel much more supported and encouraged by the government and wider society. So many drop out of the course before qualifying because of the difficulties of childcare provision. I, as a grandma help with the care of my grandchildren but this family support is not available to all student midwives. Many including my family struggle with only 15 hours provision, so what happens to those who don't have wider any family support? They drop out!",
        "background": "I would like nhs student midwives to be entitled to the full 30 hours childcare/nursery provision. I would like the government to debate and approve this. We desperately need  midwives in training but only being able to access 15 hours nursery/childcare is a barrier to recruitment and retention",
