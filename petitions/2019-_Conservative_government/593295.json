        "additional_details": "The limit was introduced to combat erosion on the lakes shores at 10 knots, however modern research shows that the large boats limited at 10 knots cause damage to shores that water-sport boats could never at their 25 knots. Removal of the unneeded harsh speed limit would increase boats sales, boat hires, water skiing and water sports ten-fold and bring prosperity back to our beautiful Lake District. After the pandemic the UKs national parks need our help and support to bring back tourism.",
        "background": "The government should review the speed limit on lake Windermere and look to increase or remove the limit. This should be done to bring tourism, prosperity and funding back to our gorgeous national parks. Future investment would increase tourism and bring back to life to our neglected Lake District.",
