        "additional_details": "It is essential that the Government establish a competitive market rate for the job of a Prison Officer. Recommendation 3 by the PSPRB is evidence-based and a significant step towards addressing the long-term issues relating to both comparative pay and recruitment and retention within HMPS. Pay must reflect rates for similarly skilled jobs, e.g. Border Force and Police, which it currently does not; in light of these recruiting HMPS is at risk of losing staff who face record levels of violence.",
        "background": "In July Government stated they're 'accepting in full the recommendations made by the review body for implementation from April 2020. For clarity these are recommendations 1, 2 and 4 to 7.' This clearly omits point 3. This must be implemented to meet recruitment and retention challenges staff face.",
