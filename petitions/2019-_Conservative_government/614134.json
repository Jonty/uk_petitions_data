        "additional_details": "For many of us the recent cost of living increases mean we are choosing to either eat hot meals or heat our homes.\r\n\r\nIf the income thresholds for free school meals were increased thousands more children could be entitled to hot school meals.\r\n\r\nThere are some families on Universal Credit who have had to work more hours when their youngest child reaches 5, to retain their benefits. This will normally mean they no longer qualify for free school meals, due to the current income threshold.\r\n \r\nThe income threshold for free school meals for Universal Credit claimants was set in 2018, and has not been increased since, despite increased minimum wages and cost of living.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to review eligibility for free school meals, and increase earning thresholds above which people are not entitled to free school meals.\r\n\r\nThe cost of living has increased over the years and more so this year, and eligibility for free school meals should reflect this.",
