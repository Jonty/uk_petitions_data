Having the same six clubs dominate continental football would financially destroy English football making the gap between the top six and the rest of the league larger than ever before. The dream of playing in Europe is also a dream for many supporters, something that this proposal would eliminate.",

The Culture Secretary said that the Government would back the football authorities to stop this move, and if the football authorities couldn\u2019t act, the Government would. The Culture Secretary said the Government would \"put everything on the table to prevent this from happening.\"\r\n\r\nYou can read the Culture Secretary's full statement on the European Super League here: https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/statement-by-oliver-dowden-on-the-european-super-league\r\n\r\nYou can read a report about the English clubs' withdrawal from the European Super League here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/56823501.\r\n\r\nYou may like to sign this petition which calls for a related action:\r\n\r\n'Enforce the \u201c50+1\u201d Rule for professional football club ownership in the UK': https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/583310."
