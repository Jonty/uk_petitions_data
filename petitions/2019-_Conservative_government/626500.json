        "additional_details": "The main political parties leave the final decision of a leadership change to their party membership - a tiny proportion of the electorate. There is no problem with this approach whilst the party are in opposition. However, when this happens with a party in Government, the mandate held by MPs from the electorate can be overriden by this tiny and unrepresentative proportion of the electorate. The change should be determined by our democratically elected representatives.",
        "background": "We elect MPs and give them a mandate based on their manifesto. By doing so, we are trusting their judgement to make decisions and vote in Parliament on our behalf. The Government's mandate is determined by their party having a majority of MPs, representing a considerable proportion of the electorate",
