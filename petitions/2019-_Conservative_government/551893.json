        "additional_details": "Why does having 1 extra person at a household deny that household childcare options? If both parents work, the issues are exactly the same of that of a single parent household.\r\nIf this doesn\u2019t become more aligned, you run the risk of more job losses, increased mental health issues and potential increased relationship breakups when other options for childcare are limited! \r\nPlease review this rule to be based on employment status rather than relationship status.",
        "background": "Social bubbles are allowed ONLY if the household is a single parent household. This needs extending regardless of relationship status. Cohabiting/married households where both parents work full time also struggle for support in regards to childcare when grandparents are the key childcare providers.",
