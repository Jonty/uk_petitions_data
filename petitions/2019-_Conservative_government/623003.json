The Psychoactive Substances Act 2016 includes offences relating to the supply and possession with the intent to supply nitrous oxide. Those convicted of either of these offences may be subject to a maximum sentence of seven years\u2019 imprisonment, or a fine or both. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.
