        "action": "Release covid-19 support for self employed with less than 1 year of trading",
        "additional_details": "It's unfair to punish those who have taken the plunge to go self employed within the last year by only offering them Universal Credits.   The support also doesn't cover those on zero hour contracts, and grants won't be accessible until June which is too long for many people to wait. \r\n\r\nI urge you to keep working on this support to ensure people don't slip through the net.  Those who have been trading less than a year and who have been on zero hours contracts need equal support to survive.",
        "background": "I want Rishi Sunak to continue working on the Covid-19 support package to ensure that self employed workers trading less than 1 year are able to receive fair support.\r\n\r\nCurrently the support only covers employed workers and the self employed trading for over a year.  This is not good enough.",
