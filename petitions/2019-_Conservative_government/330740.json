        "additional_details": "Due to 5 years of war, the outbreak of cholera and COVID-19, 80% of the population are severely affected. Over 3 million people are homeless, thus increasing gender-based violence for women and children. Over 2 million children have lost access to education and are acutely malnourished. A ceasefire is necessary.",
        "background": "Yemen is currently facing the largest humanitarian crisis in the world. Without a ceasefire, critical healthcare, essential medication and PPE cannot be delivered to help those affected by the cholera outbreak and COVID-19. This can result in the extinction of an entire nation of people.",
