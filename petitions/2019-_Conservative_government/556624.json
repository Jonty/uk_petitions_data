The actions were right for an initial response, but we're not arguing over what Tier 1, or Tier 2 looks like - who cares! Please stop neglecting the British Public and help us see you have a plan for the future.",

We need a long term strategy such to stop us going COVID blind, or have a graph to count the thousands of deaths and ruined lives caused by taking resource away from where its needed.",
