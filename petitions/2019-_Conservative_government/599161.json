        "action": "End Violence and Discrimination through Early Years Education!",
        "additional_details": "1 in 6 young citizens in the UK are experiencing record levels of anxiety & depression in a mental health pandemic. Gender-based violence & systemic racism continue unabated, all in the midst of an intensifying climate emergency. We have seen the government responding reactively and not preventatively. Evidence-based programmes, like Think Equal, prove that preventative measures do work. Therefore the government needs to reassess its' strategy & prioritize Early Years education.",
        "background": "We ask the UK government to take preventative action through Early Years education, as a solution against the mental health crisis and rampant violence, discrimination and inequality that are engulfing our communities. Changing the world is not rocket science - it's neuroscience!",
