        "additional_details": "The government intervened to help stop the formation of the ESL when it became clear that it was not in the interests of the majority of clubs and supporters. They need to do the same in the case of VAR. It is no less contentious or beneficial than the decisions of officials. Neither is considered 100% accurate and the delay for a VAR decision is killing the excitement and flow of the game for players and supporters alike. It needs to stop for offside decisions at the very least.",
        "background": "VAR applies rigid and ridiculously precise rules to the offside rule in particular and should be stopped. The officials are good enough and allow the game to flow. Government should intervene for the fun and enjoyment of supporters and players.",
