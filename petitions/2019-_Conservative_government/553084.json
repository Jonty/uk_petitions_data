        "additional_details": "Parental Alienation has been removed from the ICD-11 & the DSM-5. Yet the courts are still using Parental Alienation to gloss over DV & dominate cases to exclude all else, DR Adrienne Barnett comissioned by the ministry of justice concluded that the rise in new child psycholgists is purely to strengthen the fathers case & make them unanswerable. Please look at her report. You need to make courts fully investigate DV/abuse claims to be able to genuinely determine the best interests of the child,",
        "background": "I want the family courts to fully investigate domestic abuse claims when deciding the care needs of a child, parental Alienation is being used as a defence and to trump DV claims, women are being told not to make genuine claims of DV as this increases the chance they will lose custody of their child",
