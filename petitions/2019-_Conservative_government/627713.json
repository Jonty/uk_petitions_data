This is having a long lasting impact on the victims of these crimes and their families. There are more than 850,000 registered sex offenders in the UK. This is not acceptable.",
        "background": "Give pedophiles, rapists, child abusers, and sex offenders tougher punishments so it is less likely they will re offend. Make people that have a possibility of offending not want to offend due to the punishment of these crimes.",
