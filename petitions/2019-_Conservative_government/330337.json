        "additional_details": "The choice to omit NEAs for non-art/design subjects is a choice that didn\u2019t consider the opinions of the people. If we were to consider the voice of the British people, this choice would change. It doesn\u2019t make sense to leave out NEAs when NEAs have always been used in the measuring of the students\u2019 grades. If consistency is desired then why omit such a considerable part of school work? Why completely dismiss the hard work students have contributed towards NEAs? This isn\u2019t fair nor is it wanted.",
        "background": "Consider NEAs in the determining of 2020 grades of A-level and GCSE students for non-art/design subjects. Many subjects include NEAs and thus for a fairer grade NEAs should be considered in the grade.",
