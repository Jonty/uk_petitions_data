        "additional_details": "Summer months do not see as many serious illnesses among school age children as winter months of Dec-Feb.\r\nHospital admissions for respiratory illnesses in children has been consistently higher for winter months. This problem is exacerbated by need to send children to school most of winter, making prevention against infectious diseases difficult.  \r\nThis could have a knock on effect on their attendance and long term development.\r\nLonger winter holidays is a much better option, which should be trialed.",
