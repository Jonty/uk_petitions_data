        "additional_details": "60% of people killed on Britain's roads die on rural roads. Following a THINK! survey 25% of drivers admitted having a near miss on a country road whilst 40% have been surprised by an unexpected hazard. A third confessed to taking a bend too fast. These roads are more likely to be single lane with hazards such as sharp bends, foliage, horse riders and walkers with no pavement to use. A 30mph speed limit could help reduce serious injuries and deaths on country roads.",
        "background": "The Government should reduce the national speed limit on rural roads to 30mph, to better protect pedestrians, cyclists, horse riders and wildlife, as well as drivers themselves. It could also reduce damage to roads and cars.",
