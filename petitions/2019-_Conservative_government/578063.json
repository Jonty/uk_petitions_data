We're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. \r\n\r\nWe understand you're seeking to make landlords liable for the anti-social or criminal behaviour of their tenants and make landlords responsible for reporting tenants' criminal acts to the police. However, we're not sure specifically what actions you would like the Government or Parliament to take, to achieve this.\r\n\r\nPrivate landlords have the power to seek a court order for eviction when tenants exhibit anti-social or criminal behaviour. However, it is up to landlords to decide whether to take action against their tenants. As a rule, landlords are not responsible for the actions of their tenants if they have not authorised the behaviour.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see:\r\nhttps://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn01012/\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition calling for the Government to introduce a legal duty of care on landlords to protect tenants from nuisance, anti-social or criminal behaviour by other tenants of the same landlord, if that's something you'd like to see happen."
