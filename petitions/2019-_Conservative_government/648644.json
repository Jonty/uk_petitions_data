        "additional_details": "We believe why this reversal is needed would be clear if you came to all nurseries with a potential 1:5 ratio and see the circumstances they have to deal with. We think it causes the children to have fewer needs met and also more mental health issues for staff thus meaning more staff have time off and again children's needs aren't met, with no consistency. It's difficult for the companies to recruit staff.",
