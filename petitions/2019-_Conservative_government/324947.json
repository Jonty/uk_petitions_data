Putting \u00a3400 a month into the account would be a good way to simulate paying for a mortgage every month as the current \u00a3200 isn\u2019t really a realistic mortgage payment and will cut in half the amount of time you have to wait to build up 5%.You could still deposit \u00a3200, but some people can put \u00a3400 away.",
