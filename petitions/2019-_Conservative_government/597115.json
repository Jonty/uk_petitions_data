        "additional_details": "Since we have left the EU we should be given back our grandfather rights and UK driving licence.

This would allow people with a driving licence to drive medium lorries and help combat the current driver shortage as well as combat the safety issues of people using 3500kg vehicles overweight because of the current inadequate licence.",
        "background": "Since the 1st of January 1997 new drivers have been restricted to driving 3500 kg MAM vehicles due to the UK driving licence being aligned with the EU model. Since we have left the EU anyone with a current licence should have it upgraded.",
