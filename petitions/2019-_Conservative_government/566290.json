You can find out more here: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-people-to-receive-oxford-universityastrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-today-4-january-2021\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling on the Government to provide additional funding to enable the NHS to increase the number of sites at which Covid-19 vaccinations are provided, although in practice the number of sites the NHS can operate will depend on the staff available to administer vaccinations."
