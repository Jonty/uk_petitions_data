We are not getting a chance to wash our hands after delivering our loads & the wash facilities are mostly dirty. Basically you don\u2019t always feel safe doing our job anymore because of the way we are treated.",
        "background": "All drivers are out working everyday in different areas meeting different people who want there produce & not all places or people are clean. And the places they go to won\u2019t provide toilet facilities so they can wash their hands afterwards. Shower facilities are not kept clean in service stations",
