Otherwise these local lockdowns will spread over the next few weeks and around christmas time , the full lockdown could happen then. Is this what the nation wants? For the sake of everyone in the Uk, we should do this now. The government cant run the economy if peoples health is at risk . Please sign if you agree and want this lockdown now! Surely give the circuit breaker a chance to see if it works, we all have to do this together, not local lockdowns for some.",
