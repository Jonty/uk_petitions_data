A solution would be to put it to a public as to whether the public truly want the strict restrictions that are being put into place on November 27th. I would like there to be more of a compromise in response, which may help reduce the detrimental damage being done to the retail and hospitality sector.",

The latest restrictions being implemented will destroy many small businesses in Northern Ireland. I want the government to allow the people to vote on these restriction issues.",
