        "additional_details": "We believe ticket offices have a vital role to rail passengers. As well as ticket sales they give help & advice on travel & carry out assistance & cycle reservations bookings, which can be difficult to book online or over the phone.\r\n\r\nSome passengers can't purchase tickets online, and closing ticket offices is likely to create accessibility problems for the elderly, people with disabilities & overseas visitors.\r\n\r\nSurveys have shown passengers want staffed stations, and the Government should act to protect ticket offices.",

We want the Government to require train operators to maintain ticket offices at railway stations, to enable passengers to purchase tickets and get advice over the counter.",
