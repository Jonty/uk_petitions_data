        "additional_details": "Learner drivers are currently unable to book tests or are having them cancelled thus, may also have to retake a theory test unnecessarily. This is extremely stressful and a lot of pressure is on to get the tests done before the certificate runs out. Furthermore, completing them with an instructor can make it easier to track who has been in contact with who, catch up on tests quicker and by making the pass plus scheme mandatory after these type of tests will ensure excellent future drivers.",
        "background": "Learners who have had the recommended 45 hours of driving lessons or a years experience should undertake a test with their instructor to help catch tests up, the tests could be recorded or written evidence. For further measure, all who use this method have to do the pass plus scheme mandatorily.",
