        "additional_details": "I would like the government to increase NHS staff pay. NHS staff have been battling increased workloads for years and it got worse when the pandemic started. A lot of NHS staff had to be off work due to stress and stress related illnesses as well as losing our jobs if we weren\u2019t vaccinated. I feel all NHS staff should be eligible for an increase in pay for all the trials, tribulations and stress we have endured before and during the pandemic.",
        "background": "As an NHS worker who also worked during the Pandemic, I know for a fact how hard it was before the pandemic was invented as well as working during the pandemic. It was extremely stressful but we persevered and we managed to overcome the battles.",
