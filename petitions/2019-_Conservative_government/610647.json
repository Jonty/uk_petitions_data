        "additional_details": "I would like the government to increase NHS staff pay. NHS staff have been battling increased workloads for years and it got worse when the pandemic started. A lot of NHS staff had to be off work due to stress and stress related illnesses as well as losing our jobs if we weren\u2019t vaccinated. I feel all NHS staff should be eligible for an increase in pay for all the trials, tribulations and stress we have endured before and during the pandemic.",
