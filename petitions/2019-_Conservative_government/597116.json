Therefore this subject matter would be the responsibility of the individual schools, rather than Government or Parliament. \r\n\r\nYou can read more about the RSE guidance here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/relationships-education-relationships-and-sex-education-rse-and-health-education"
