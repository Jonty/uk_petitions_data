        "additional_details": "In light of Covid-19 this morning Matt Hancock has suggested that there are imminent plans to ask over 70s to isolate for their own protection.  He said \u201c The length of time that they need to stay at home is a very big ask - it's a very long time.\u201d according to BBC news reports this morning.  During this time they may need to pay more for domicilary social care services and the new TV licence cost couldn\u2019t come at a worse time for this low income community.",
        "background": "The free licence for over 75s is coming to an end on 31st May 2020.  We are asking for the introduction of the fee for over 75s to be delayed by at least 6 months until the isolation period is over.",
