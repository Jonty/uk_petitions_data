        "action": "Keep public libraries open during lockdown",
        "additional_details": "Libraries should be classed as an essential service, especially to children. Books are expensive which makes libraries the only way for some to read. E-books are an alternative, but this increases screen time for children which already is an issue because of online schooling. Reading is essential to mental wellbeing, which is why libraries should remain open with restrictions.",
        "background": "Libraries are an essential part of society that almost everyone uses. They can provide a form of entertainment and education for a lot of people so keeping them open during lockdowns would be extremely helpful. They can easily be made safe through the use of track and trace and online reservations.",
