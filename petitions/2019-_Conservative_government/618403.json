        "action": "Reform the British education system based on the Finnish education system",
        "additional_details": "School takes up too much unnecessary time, this time could be spent better with family and friends as socialising is important mentally. Furthermore, by using this system we could increase kids productivity and willingness to learn. Also, we could finally teach kids things which are important to learn such as basic life lessons. There are many more issues that need to be solved in our education system, as such I hope we follow the Finnish system as a guiding principle to resolve many issues.",
        "background": "Simply put, follow suit in Finnish footsteps and copy their education system. Create a system where kids can just be kids and where education doesn\u2019t feel like a burden and takes up unnecessary time.",
