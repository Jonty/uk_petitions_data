        "additional_details": "While a referendum is not legally binding, a large proportion of our country in favour of net neutrality would demonstrate that the government's priorities should lay with protecting the environment and halting climate change. Our current target for 2050 is a valuable step, but the sentiment behind the target will be futile if we don't achieve net neutrality sooner. We aren't asking for an immediate commitment - we are simply asking that the question is put to the nation to decide.",
        "background": "We are asking that the government hold a national referendum to ask whether or not the UK should bring forward its target of net-neutrality to 2030. This may follow a similar framework as the 2050 target. The referendum would set the option of having neutrality by 2030 or keeping the current target.",
