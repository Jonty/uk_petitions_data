        "action": "Let vaccinated UK citizen expats return home with UAE administered vaccinations",
        "additional_details": "Currently the UK government recognizes vaccinations administered by the NHS, the CDC and several EU health bodies. This is very restrictive to fully vaccinated UK citizens/expats in the UAE wanting to return home. The UAE MOH has overseen one of the most effective vaccine drives worldwide with the same vaccines as those used by the NHS and CDC. There is no reason it should not be recognized in the exact same way.",
        "background": "We want the UK government to recognize the validity of the UAE\u2019s vaccination rollout on the same level as the NHS and the CDC, so our expat citizens can return home without unnecessary restrictions.",
