        "additional_details": "Poorly insulated properties can be extremely difficult to keep heated in colder weather, with many of them also suffering from damp and mould due to the lack of insulation and difficulties heating. This can have numerous negative impacts on people's health.\r\n \r\nIt also has a huge negative impact on the environment. It increases our reliance on fossil fuels due to increased gas usage. It also impacts our ability to become carbon neutral.\r\n",
        "background": "The Government must provide funding to all local authorities to ensure all social housing properties can be insulated as a matter of urgency. Far too many properties in England have poor insulation or no insulation at all. This is a particular issue with the current cost of energy.",
