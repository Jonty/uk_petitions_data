        "action": "Restrict landlords to charge no more than \u00a3200 per month rent for a property.",
        "additional_details": "If this proposal gets legislated this will save tenants huge amounts of money and will help them cope better with the rising cost of living that everyone has been experiencing. This will also them tenants save up to buy their own property. This will also leave tenants with spare money each month which they could use to save up to spend on recreational things such as a holiday either internal or abroad. This spare money could also be spent on more car fuel so people can drive longer distances.",
        "background": "I want the government to make it illegal for landlords to charge tenants more than \u00a3200 to rent the property as this will save tenants money. Those who are renting may be saving money for a deposit to buy a house. Paying high rent charges may deter some people from affording to buy their own homes.",
