        "action": "Reject North Yorkshire County Council's proposal for a 'mega council'",
        "additional_details": "The proposed new council would be unlike any other in England. It would encompass 620,000 residents and 8,000 sq km. We feel this would be too large and too remote to effectively represent residents. Only Birmingham and Leeds (big city councils) would have more people. Our unique county deserves genuinely local government, not a remote 'mega council'. The Government should, therefore, seek to approve a model with smaller councils closer to residents.",
        "background": "North Yorkshire County Council wants to replace our eight current councils with just one unitary authority. This would be the largest council in England, stretching 100 miles from side to side. We call on the Government to reject this plan, and back a more-local alternative.",
