        "additional_details": "Many students have lost their loved ones to Covid and because of this they are unable to concentrate in lessons and with them sitting their exams in less than 2 years time content should be reduced so they can focus on their studies and improving their mental health. A lot of students are being sent home and being told to self isolate and many schools and colleges aren't doing online lessons which is affecting their education. Reducing content will enable them to improve their mental health.",
        "background": "GCSE and A Level content should be reduced for students in Years 10, 11, 12 and 13 as they haven't been in proper teaching since March 2020 and with lockdown going on this has affected their mental health. A lot of schools and colleges didn't do online learning so this has affected their learning.",
