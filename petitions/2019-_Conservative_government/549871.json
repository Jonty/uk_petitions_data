        "additional_details": "The paying parent will always lose out because he may never see the children and would not know if the receiving parent is spending it on the children this system is really unfair and has to change, this damages the life of the paying parent and it is often said both parents share responsibility so why is there more force upon single dads to pay this is unfair, CMS should not hassle or threaten a individual to pay extortionate amounts this law is being misused by women.",
        "background": "I would like the government to do a fair system for single dads because these payments to CMS are extortionate and should not be re-calculated and be a fixed amount and single dads should not pay if they do not see their children, the law is very biased towards women and has to change.",
