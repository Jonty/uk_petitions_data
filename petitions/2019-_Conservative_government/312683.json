        "action": "Change train operator refund policies for season ticket holders impacted by C-19",
        "additional_details": "Having taken over the management of train operators the government should step in and force refunds to be calculated proportionately during the current exceptional circumstances. This means any discounts for \"free periods\" should be assumed to be taken equally each month. Train operators should not effectively be allowed to profiteer from COVID-19. The government banned administration fees for refunds so the train operators are now charging a \u00a310 refund fee",
        "background": "Train operators are offering unfair refunds for season ticket holders impacted by COVID-19. For example Great Northern Trains assumes annual season ticket holders get 12 weeks free and take this at the end of the ticket period so if you have 4 months left on your ticket you can only get 1 month back",
