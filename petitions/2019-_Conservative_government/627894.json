The cost of procedures and the way they are pushed onto owners needs regulating too. More than essential ones are done to get more profit. It has become big business and not about the animals.",
        "background": "The vast profit that is added to pet prescriptions and medications needs regulating. It should be the same as the human system. Affordable pet care is essential in this current time. Pets are being put back into rescues because people cannot afford the costs. This will help then stay in homes",
