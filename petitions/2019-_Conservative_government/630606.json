In residential areas the loud noise can cause reverb, distress to the elderly as well as many animals and babies.\r\n\r\nIt's time to make a change and encourage the public to attend organised, licensed and insured events which are safe and available to those who want to enjoy Fireworks rather than those who don't or are in a situation in their own home where Fireworks are not welcome.
