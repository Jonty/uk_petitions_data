        "action": "Introduce BSL into the primary school curriculum for all children",
        "additional_details": "We teach our children modern languages in schools, but we don't teach sign language.  The benefits of learning sign language at a young age could help so many people in society, it would allow so many more people to communicate more effectively and would help children who are deaf or hearing impaired feel more represented as a whole.  The ability to communicate freely is a basic human right and should be supported and encouraged by all schools.",
        "background": "Hearing loss affects up to 1 in 6 people in the UK, including my 12-year-old son. Less than 10% of the UK population knows any sign language. By teaching BSL as part of the curriculum from primary school age we make our society and communities more inclusive for deaf and hearing-impaired people",
