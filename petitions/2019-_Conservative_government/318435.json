        "additional_details": "A lot of people who have only been self employed for a year have fallen through the cracks and are not getting support. It affects others who had good years financially in 2019-2020 who will have a lower average if this isn\u2019t taken into account. The employed are getting support based on current income and the self employed should be treated the same. Many people upgrade their lifestyle as they earn more leading to higher bills so it\u2019s vital we use up to date figures.",
