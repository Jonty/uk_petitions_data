        "additional_details": "The figures clearly show that when educational establishments returned for the Autumn term, that Covid 19 figures sky-rocketed. With this new strain of Covid that is up to 70% more transmissible, one can only imagine what a similar return would now do. The NHS is already on it's knees and needs any and all the help it can get. To allow on-site education to resume now would likely trigger a healthcare disaster on a scale not seen in several generations. We need full lockdown, not people mingling.",
        "background": "The opening of educational establishments should be delayed until proven safe and sustainable, to assist the already buckling NHS. The new strain of Covid 19 is demonstrating explosive growth even whilst they are closed. They are proven breeding grounds and should not reopen at this time.",
