        "additional_details": "alot of parents have been notified direct contacts with their children are cancelled, Local Authorities haven't set up video link or phone contacts, they say our children are not priority! WRONG, OUR children are OUR priority, we have court orders stating we are to have contact. Contact between a child and parent is a priority, for the childs well being and mental health too, not forgetting the impact on the parents, primarily, the bond needs to be kept at all costs. So please Maintain Contact.",
        "background": "Id like the government to Ensure that contact is maintained via video link or phone calls between children in care & their parents, during The COVID-19 Restrictions, as direct contacts are getting cancelled by L.A. parents & childrens human rights need to be adhered to, their bond needs to be kept.",
