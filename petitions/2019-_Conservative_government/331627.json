        "additional_details": "There is not enough Domestic Abuse awareness in schools. Domestic abuse is rarely discussed. When it is, information is limited and focuses mainly on safeguarding children in abusive households, or pupils learn solely about physical abuse. Whilst important, more conversation is needed. To protect future victims from suffering at the hands of abusers, we must educate pupils on all forms of domestic abuse. Abuse cannot remain a taboo topic and must be discussed further than physical abuse.",
        "background": "Make domestic abuse a compulsory topic in schools. \r\nThis would include:\r\n- Learning about all types of abuse: physical, emotional, coercive, child sex exploitation, trafficking, female genital mutilation, sexual abuse.\r\n- Normalise all victims of abuse, including teenage, male and LGBT+ victims.",
