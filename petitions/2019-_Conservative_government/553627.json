        "action": "Stop the inhumane international shipping of live animals",
        "additional_details": "Why would you allow an animal to be shipped and killed in a fashion that would cause wars if it was found that people were being treated in such a way. An animal life is not worth less than a human one. It does not make any sense that the animal can not be humanely slaughtered within the United Kingdom and then shipped either frozen or chilled. Furthermore, it has come to light that if an animal dies en route, then their bodies are thrown into the sea. This is an environmental catastrophe.",
        "background": "Stop allowing livestock to be shipped to countries such as the Middle East, where they are consequently slaughtered in a horrific fashion. The conditions which they are sent to these countries are inhumane - they are crammed into small spaces where they die without proper access to food or water",
