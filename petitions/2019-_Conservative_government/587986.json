        "additional_details": "Reducing traffic, e-scooters are quicker than walking and it wouldn\u2019t make too much difference to how things are now, everywhere you look there\u2019s riders, on my way to work I see at least 6 and I only drive for about 15mins.",
        "background": "There\u2019s been a massive rise in e-scooters on our roads and pathways but the rules remain unclear and people seem to be ignoring it anyway so make it clearer and legalise the use of them as there\u2019s very little downside to them.",
