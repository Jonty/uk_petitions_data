        "additional_details": "Though face masks are already being worn voluntarily by some, this is not enough as masks are only effective in preventing the spread of Covid19 from those who are infected but will not protect individuals wearing them from infection, so should be made mandatory to reduce infection. The British Medical Association has called for face coverings to be made mandatory in all indoor settings. The government should be listening to the experts. Cloth homemade masks could be used ensuring the NHS would not be deprived of PPE.",
        "background": "The government has recently announced that schools and colleges are to reopen in full in September, meaning that in many cases, social distancing may not be observed. In order to protect our children, face masks should be made mandatory for all secondary education.",
