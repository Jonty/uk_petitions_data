        "additional_details": "Energy prices are currently at an all time high, with many small businesses seeing their electricity and gas costs increase dramatically in the space of a few months. This has pushed many small businesses into unprofitability and to the brink of closure.\r\n\r\nDomestic consumers are quite rightly protected by an Ofgem set price cap, however, because of this, some energy suppliers are increasing prices for small businesses, to offset the loss of revenue in the domestic market.\r\n\r\nWe petition the UK government to introduce the same price cap protection mechanism for small businesses as are currently in place to protect domestic energy consumers.",
        "background": "The energy price cap is a price protection mechanism put in place by the Government to protect domestic energy users. This same price protection mechanism should be extended to small businesses.",
