        "additional_details": "Diabetes is known to cause nerve damage and poor blood circulation that can lead to serious foot problems including gangrene (source: NHS). \r\nYet there are no mandatory checks for such conditions before discharging diabetic patients. We demand that all hospitals across the United Kingdom implement mandatory foot checks for all diabetic patients before discharge. This simple step could prevent unnecessary suffering and potential loss of life due to complications like gangrene.",
