        "action": "Stop payments and reimburse Postgrad students paying private accommodation fees.",
        "additional_details": "Across the nation, postgraduates have had to return to their respective homes as a result of the pandemic/lock-down. Despite their privately rented accommodation being uninhabited and no expenditure on household bills currently present for landlords, postgrads are still expected to uphold payments for their housing. Without a maintenance loan and most unable to work, financially it's becoming unfeasible to satisfy payments. Further pressure is being put on our family members (often guarantors) who already are struggling to satisfy their independent living costs.",
        "background": "We want the government to formally recognise postgraduate students circumstances independent to those of undergraduates. Postgraduate students do not have the same financial support as undergraduates and are without the crucial maintenance loan which would contribute towards living costs.",
