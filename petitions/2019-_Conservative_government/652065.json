        "additional_details": "The Equality Act 2010 and abolition of the default retirement age, because people were living and working longer, meant most employers stopped tapering redundancy payments for employees who are approaching pension age, but we want a new law to ban this practise.\r\n \r\nSome companies still use the old tapering system which is age discrimination and means parties need to use courts and industrial tribunals to seek justice. A blanket ban on reducing redundancy payments for workers approaching pension age would better protect our oldest workers, many of whom have given the largest contribution in time, loyalty and productivity.\r\n",
