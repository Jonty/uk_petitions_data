        "additional_details": "It is unfair to grant the scheme but deny students the full benefits of it, especially in light of unprecedented impact of COVID-19 on securing new jobs. On top of this, the UK Government have set out an ambition to increase education exports to \u00a335 billion and the number of international higher education students in the UK to 600,000 by 2030. It appears it is all about the money and not really about supporting international students. Please make the route count towards settlement.",
        "background": "The UK Government just confirmed that the Graduate route will open  on 1 July 2021. However, they also inserted a clause that \u201cthe route does not count towards settlement\u201d. We call on the Government to make the graduate route count towards settlement in UK.",
