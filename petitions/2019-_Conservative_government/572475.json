        "additional_details": "The Government must acknowledge the incredible efforts of NHS staff through this pandemic. For years NHS staff have had their wages slashed because of cuts to the NHS, bringing the services to it\u2019s knees. It\u2019s time to reward the real heros of the pandemic and boost their morale by eliminating and fee of parking services for NHS staff at their workplace. Staff should not have to spend their hard earned money - in one of the hardest jobs in the world - for parking in front of their workplace.",

On the first anniversary of Covid-19, we are all reminded that the NHS staff are the backbone to our healthcare system and they deserve the benefit of travelling to work safely - without the worry of paying for parking.",
