        "additional_details": "The National bee unit has powers to inspect apiaries, including following the outbreak of notifiable diseases.\r\n \r\nSome beekeepers choose not to register their hives out of concerns for privacy. This makes it difficult for the NBU to know where apiaries are that need inspections during an outbreak, which can create sinks of disease to spread to other populations and apiaries.\r\n \r\nBy legally obligating beekeepers to register we bolster our first line of defence in invasive disease and pest management.\r\n",
        "background": "Controlling the impact and spread of disease in bee populations is paramount to the economic viability of commercial and hobbyist beekeeping.\r\n \r\nLegally require all beekeepers to register their apiaries on BeeBase to help increase the visibility and traceability of disease.\r\n",
