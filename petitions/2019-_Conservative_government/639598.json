It is already a very difficult time to go through, and the stress of money worries should not be at the forefront of people's minds at this time. By having this requirement in place it gives every employee a little peace of mind to know that they will receive full pay while they receiving treatment or in recovery.",

This would allow them to receive treatment and recover without losing income.",
