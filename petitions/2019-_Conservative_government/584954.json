        "additional_details": "Higher education providers can choose to remove the age cap, however most keep the cap at 25 because that is the age many local authorities work to.\r\n\r\nLast year 37% of undergraduate students were mature students. And \"care leavers who do go to university are less likely to do so straight from school at age 18, and only 11.8% enter by age 23.\" (UCAS, 2021).\r\nTaking the age cap off care leaver bursaries would mean that higher education providers have a better picture of when care experienced people enter higher education, and will be better placed to offer support.\r\n",
        "background": "Many higher education providers offer care leaver bursaries. Definitions of care vary, but often mature care leavers (over the age of 25/26) cannot access the bursary unless they were under 25 at the start of their course. ",
