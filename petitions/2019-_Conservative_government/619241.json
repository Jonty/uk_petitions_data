        "additional_details": "Currently there are no regulations stopping dredged sediment being dumped into the sea. We have over 100 years of industrial pollution that has settled in the deep sediment of many of our industrial rivers. \r\nThe toxic sediment is currently allowed to be dumped out to sea, risking an environmental catastrophe which effects a wide range of sea life and a health risk to human life.\r\nAt this time of a climate emergency we can take no chances with the health of our oceans.",
        "background": "Bring into UK law a clear framework for the regulation and control of dredging. To set out safe systems and controls to cover all dredging activities. The decontamination and safe disposal on land of all dredged materials. Substantial fines to be imposed for breaches of the regulations.",

You can read this Act here: https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/23/contents.\r\n\r\nIt's therefore not clear how the regulation you want would be different from what is already in place.  \r\n\r\nYou could have a petition calling for these regulations to be changed in some specific way, so long as it was clear from the petition what these changes were."
