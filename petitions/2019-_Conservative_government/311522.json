        "additional_details": "My husband and I own two nurseries.  It is a partnership so our pay comes out of the profits - we are Self Employed and not on PAYE.  The COVID 19 support is only for profits of up to \u00a350,000 - this means our earnings each would have to be below \u00a325,000 a year to qualify. Please give nursery owners \u00a32,500 a month for each partner. We had to close as our key workers found alternative childcare. No income - funding only enough to pay overheads. We are not alone - please help",
        "background": "Many Nursery owners miss out on financial support due to Coronovirus \u2013 they are not on PAYE \u2013 profits just slightly too high to qualify for Self- Employment support- they are being penalised and yet are an essential service. Funding just covers overheads. We need help to avoid permanent closure.",
