        "additional_details": "A lot of shops   have started selling vape kits and liquids  with no training and without being able to give good advice. This has given the industry a bad name by some serving underage people. And selling illegal vapes.  Trading standards check on the vape shops for compliance but they are not aware of everywhere that sells them. Licencing will help people go to professionals for advice.",
