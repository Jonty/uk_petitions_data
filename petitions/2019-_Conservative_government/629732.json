Gov figures estimate the UK generated 2.5m tonnes of packaging waste in 2021. There are people trying to be environmentally responsible but its difficult & time consuming. UK Gov & UKPP  targets for 2042 aren\u2019t ambitious enough - by then we\u2019d we have created 50m tonnes of plastic waste & killed 2e9 animals?
