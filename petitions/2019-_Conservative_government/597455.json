        "additional_details": "There is a massive decline in the respect for drivers. first a lack of truck parking and rejection at food establishments. nobody wants truck drivers around. \u00a325-\u00a340 just to park overnight, dirty showers, and unsold, dried food that is overpriced. Not only have they been rejected from towns and cities. Trucks are robbed daily because there is no secure facility. Why would anyone want to go back to that? zero safe truck parking facilities, and restrictions are making the job undesirable.",
