        "additional_details": "Swift and skilled police responses are critical in domestic violence cases. By improving the timeliness with which cases are reviewed by the CPS, enhancing officer training on handling sensitive issues, and bolstering support for shelters, we could better protect victims, facilitate their recovery, and ensure justice is served. This comprehensive approach is essential to strengthen women's rights and support within the community.",
        "background": "We urge the UK government to review how police response times in sending domestic violence cases to the CPS can be improved, how police training on gender-based violence can be enhanced and, how funding for support shelters can be increased.",
