        "additional_details": "The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (furloughing) is a lifeline to charities with low reserves. Government encourages furloughed staff to volunteer to support the NHS or charity, but does not permit volunteering for one\u2019s employer. This risks charities\u2019 ability to operate through this crisis. Furloughed charity employees should have the right to volunteer for their employer, so charities can continue to support society by directing all available funds to beneficiaries, including the NHS",
        "background": "Relax furlough rules for registered charities, particularly those linked to Health and Social Care, so they can continue to support the NHS and society. Furloughed Charity employees currently cannot support their own employer by volunteering, even if this would supplement support to the NHS.",
