These public sector workers are the people that are on the front line working through the Coronavirus, that every day go to work playing russian roulette with their lives.They risk their lives for others, and even saved the Prime Ministers life during the pandemic yet they are now being unfairly  targeted financially again in a time where people, all people are struggling!",
        "background": "MP's and Gov staff are due a pay rise this year and it would seem fair that their pay be frozen for at least the next two years while the UK recovers financially from the 'Coronavirus'.  The Chancellor is happy for the frontline workers to do this therefore he should be happy to do it himself.",
