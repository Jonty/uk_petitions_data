Shops raising prices by 500/600 percent does not help the poor and the vulnerable nor does it help socially. As a country we should be stood as one to combat this but it seems that people are taking advantage of the poor for financial gain during this crisis. Fines should be introduced as well as a hotline allowing people to report this despicable behaviour.",
