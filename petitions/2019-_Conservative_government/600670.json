We believe the protections of consumers are deeply inadequate, and can leave the customer with poor / dangerous workmanship and deeply out of pocket (and it is frustratingly hard to get your money back). Its too easy for a rouge builder to prey on homeowners, and the few avenues of redress are costly for the customer/victims. Mandatory licensing and regulation across the UK of these workers should help protect consumers.",
