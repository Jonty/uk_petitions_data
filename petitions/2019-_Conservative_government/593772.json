        "additional_details": "The risks of certain health issues including tumour of the liver, autoimmune diseases and blood clots can be significantly higher for women taking some contraceptive pills.\r\n \r\nIn comparison, because of a possible link between the Covid-19 AstraZeneca vaccine and blood clots, thought to affect around 1 in 250,000 recipients, it has been advised that adults aged under 30 years without underlying health conditions be offered an alternative COVID-19 vaccine.\r\n \r\nYoung women have lost their lives due to these pills. This review needs to be commissioned to pretend more women suffering.",
        "background": "The Government should commission a review of the safety of contraceptive pills to assess whether pills currently available meet the appropriate standards of safety and quality, and consider if more research and development is needed to improve female public health.",
