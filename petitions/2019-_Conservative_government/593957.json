How and where are the hours available to make enough of a living and a life?\r\n\r\nStudent nurses/midwives are classed as supernumerary, being the reason as to why they aren\u2019t paid. There is no logic behind this. Students essentially give up their lives for upwards of 3 years to support the NHS, through full time placements, study time, part time work to make ends meet for themselves and their families, with mass student debts at the end of it all. The \u00a35000 grant, although a good gesture, is simply not enough to survive on. Why is earning whilst learning not a more accessible option?",
