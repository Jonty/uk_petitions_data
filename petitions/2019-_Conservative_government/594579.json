I have been battling with this condition on a daily basis.\r\n \r\nBeing a woman myself I want to help as many women out there, who are suffering on a daily basis, get diagnosed earlier so it doesn't do more damage than it's already doing to their body.\r\n \r\nGetting a earlier diagnosis would help thousands of women out there.",
        "background": "On average it takes seven years for diagnosis for Endometriosis which is too long, People are suffering in pain and it's affecting their daily lives. The longer the diagnosis takes the more damage it can do to their body. I would like the Government to provide funding to support earlier diagnosis.",
