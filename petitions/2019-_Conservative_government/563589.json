        "additional_details": "If you see a mobile number on your phone displayed as an incoming call you answer it as you don't know who is ringing and if you run a business that relies on calls from new clients. The use of cold callers now using mobile numbers to call from is causing wasted time and a real nuisance. these can be as many as 20-30 calls per day and this is preventing some genuine calls from being answered and businesses losing potential clients and revenue.",
        "background": "Recently cold callers have been using mobile numbers to call from and the number is displayed on the receiving mobile phone. I wish the government to put in place legislation to stop this from happening. as those who rely on the mobile phone for business are frustrated by these nuisance calls.",
