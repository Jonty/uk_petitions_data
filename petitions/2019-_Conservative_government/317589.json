We now want a pay rise that is in line with inflation. \r\n\r\nShortages of beds, PPE and staff in this pandemic have shown the realities of a health system that has been severely underfunded for 10 years. We demand a pledge and outlined plan for how the government will ensure the health service is properly invested in and a guarantee that another 10 years of austerity does not take place.",

We want a pay increase that is in line or exceeds the rate of inflation and not a \u201cpay cut\u201d in real-terms.\r\n\r\nWe also want a pledge and guarantee that the NHS will not be scapegoated and fall victim to another 10 years of austerity.",
