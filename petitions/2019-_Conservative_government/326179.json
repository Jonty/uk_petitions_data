        "additional_details": "I feel it is necessary that the government has their say because without correct enforcement the littering is always going to carry on and even worse than it has before. Our planet suffers enough with pollution so with little steps like this we can all care for the environment more and more as each day passes. The reason for this petition is that through the current crisis we are all in, the environment has benefited tremendously as all the restaurants have been closed, and as they have reopened the problem is slowly but surely creeping it\u2019s way back.",
        "background": "I would like the government to implement mandatory changes to all fast food establishments with a drive through takeaway to legally print the customers driving registration on the products bag so when it is thoughtlessly thrown out as litter it can be returned with a fine to prevent more littering.",
