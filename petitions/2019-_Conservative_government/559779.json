        "action": "Keep car washes open during COVID-19 lockdown",
        "additional_details": "As a car wash business owner i am highly affected by the lockdown closure, with bills still havingbto be paid but no income coming in from the business due to closure. The government agreed for automatic car washes which are attached to a petrol station to be open , for there to be no human interaction and the virus can\u2019t spread. This is not fair. We clean the car sales companies cars which allow them to be clean when people buy or rent them. An automatic car wash is never the same as a manual one. So please take this petition into consideration.",
