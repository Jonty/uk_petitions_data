        "additional_details": "Preschool staff have been completely overlooked in the latest announcement and are expected to open and work as usual. It has been proven that children carry the virus asymptotically, which puts the preschool staff and their families at risk and in direct danger. Preschools should be included in the school closures during the lockdown until middle of February 2021.",
        "background": "Preschools and nurseries are remaining open for children to attend whilst the rest of the UK is put into lockdown to keep safe and help our NHS.  This is not safe for the staff or their families. There has already been proof that children carry the virus, so keep the staff safe and close preschools.",
