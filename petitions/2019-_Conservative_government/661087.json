Early learning about pensions and long-term savings could empower children to make informed financial decisions that will benefit them and future generations.\r\n \r\nBy providing \u00a3100 in starting capital, the Government is kickstarting a wealth accumulation process for children that could, along with auto-enrolment, provide them with a substantial retirement fund by the time they reach retirement age.\r\n",
