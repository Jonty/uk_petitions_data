        "additional_details": "The annual exam should be a thorough assessment of an officer's knowledge and cover at least the following topics:\r\n\tEquality and diversity within the community\r\n\tCivil liberties\r\n\tBasic legislation\r\n\tPolice powers\r\n\tLawful use of reasonable force\r\n\tPolice misconduct and public trust\r\n\tServing the community\r\n\r\nThis measure will improve public confidence in the abilities of their police officers and educate officers about how police powers are disproportionately used against people from ethnic minorities",
        "background": "All Police officers undergo annual fitness tests; however, there are currently no formal and regular checks on an officer\u2019s knowledge. It makes little sense to check a police officer's physical fitness but not their policing knowledge. Therefore, all police officers should sit annual examinations.",
