        "additional_details": "With rental prices spiralling out of control, and less affordable housing available, Landlords are taking advantage of those desperate to secure a home by charging overcharging. Many people will be priced out of areas they have lived their entire lives, and others will never be able to save for a mortgage because they are spending over 75% of the monthly wage on rent. A landlord is not an occupation and they should not be profiting off of their fellow citizens most basic human rights",
        "background": "The govt must step in to ensure private landlords are not over charging for what many see as a basic human right, a place to live. The government must set out fixed caps on rental charges based of the average income of the area.",
