        "additional_details": "Car insurance for young drivers is getting out of hand. Prices are increasing and young people cannot afford it. Not being able to afford car insurance affects where people can work and study. I am also aware there are many unfair variables in calculating car insurance prices, and think this should be put to an end. If car insurance is a legal requirement, then it should be regulated and affordable, not an unscalable barrier to the motoring world.",
        "background": "Help young drivers afford reasonable car insurance, introduce regulations on prices which automotive insurers can charge and stop unfair and discriminatory factors from effecting prices.",
