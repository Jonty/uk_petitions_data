        "additional_details": "Any competent driver, no matter the experience, should know that using a phone whilst driving will distract them from the road. According to the Government's own campaigns, the likelihood of crashing whilst using a phone is a 4 time increase compared to not using a phone. Using a phone whilst driving puts the lives of passengers, other road users and pedestrians at risk. Anyone who does use a phone should be banned from driving, and not able to drive for a fixed period, and until they have retaken the driving test.",
        "background": "Currently the fixed penalty for driving while using a mobile phone is 6 points and a \u00a3200 fine. If you are taken to court you can receive a fine of up to \u00a31,000 (\u00a32500 for Lorry and Bus Drivers), and be banned from driving. We propose anyone driving while using a phone face an automatic driving ban.",
