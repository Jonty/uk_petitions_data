        "additional_details": "Early Years (up to the age of 5) is a crucial time in human development. Where we are able to effectively meet children\u2019s needs in the early years they are much more likely to become successful in school and in their adult lives. 1:13 ratios are massively inappropriate for so many pupils and settings and pupils need extra support to reach appropriate developmental milestones - particularly in prime areas of learning such as communication, social skills and independence skills such as toileting.",
        "background": "Currently when children are aged 2-3 the ratio of adults to children is 1:4, however upon turning 3 the ratio can then go to 1:13. This is an absolutely huge change and massively detrimental to children\u2019s learning and development, particularly where children are developmentally within the 2-3 range.",
