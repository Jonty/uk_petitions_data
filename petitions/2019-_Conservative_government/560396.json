        "additional_details": "We have seen many local shops shut for good during the Covid-19 pandemic and many others are holding on by a thread.\r\n\r\nThe Government is carrying out a fundamental review of business rates. \r\n\r\nBig cuts in business rates for retail will help local shops to survive and compete against online retail giants.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor should also introduce annual revaluations for business rates for retail from 2023.\r\n\r\nParliament should seek a clear commitment from government to put forward these reforms.",
        "background": "Since 1990, business rates have increased by almost 50% and are one of the largest costs paid by shopkeepers.  They have contributed to the closure of many of our favourite shops, leading to the loss of jobs and community ties.  A deep reduction in business rates will reverse this trend.",
