        "action": "Stop new oil licences and pursue energy self-sufficiency through Green Energy ",
        "additional_details": "New oil licenses won't guarantee energy safety or lower energy bills as the international oil companies don't legally have to sell extra North Sea oil to the UK.\r\n \r\nHowever, it definitely will increase greenhouse gases and further contribute to the climate disaster currently unfolding.\r\n \r\nWe have signed this petition so that the government can take the climate disaster seriously and become a world leader in green energy. This would secure energy self-sufficiency for decades, not just for now.\r\n",
        "background": "The Government has reversed their green pledges through new oil licenses. Instead of clinging to the past, the UK Government should look to the future and invest in new solar and wind farms to generate energy, solar panels on at least 50% of new houses, and improved public transport.",
