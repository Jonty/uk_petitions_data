        "additional_details": "MP\u2019s have never failed to have significantly high pay rises, when public sector workers have had crippling cuts for years, that do not meet rates of inflation or cost of living.\r\n\r\nMP pay rises being stopped will help to inject money back into the economy, faster than attacking the public sector yet again who earn less than a quarter of what MP\u2019s get paid! It\u2019s an absolute disgrace! They need to do their bit along with the rest of the country.",
        "background": "I want the government to reject a pay rise for MP\u2019s to help the economy to recover faster, rather than attack the public sector yet again, with crippling cutbacks, when they have been working their hardest, risking their safety and lives tackling the pandemic.",
