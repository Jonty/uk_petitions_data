Degrees comprised of group work are difficult to complete due to the current situation, meaning the standard of work is compromised. Also not being able to meet with teachers face to face makes it more difficult to seek help when needed. Finally teaching quality online is poor compared to physical lectures which are more interactive and more useful.",
