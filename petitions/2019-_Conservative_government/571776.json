        "additional_details": "Pupils can film other pupils with out consent whilst their camera is on. Pupils feel as though they are being invaded of privacy by having their camera turned on. Many students are raised in different environments within their households whether that be, siblings fighting, parents arguing, or just the look of their home in the background compared to wealthier pupils. Some students share rooms with siblings and their bedroom is considered their only place of privacy. I also think it is distracting when people within my class have their cameras on.",
