Putting their own lives at risk, they have taken the oath to save lives of others. As a country, the least we can do for these frontline workers who have sacrificed a lot, is to waive off their student loan that they have after graduating from University. During this pandemic, these frontline workers have gone to work everyday to fight this virus!",
