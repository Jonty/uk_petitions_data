        "additional_details": "The NEU are not representative of their members views, many teachers have been devastated by the impact moving to remote teaching had.  Another lockdown would result poor quality interaction, learning outcomes and other socio economic factors.  Parents working from home should not have to be teaching too, many parents also lack the necessary skill to undertake these tasks.  Yet more parents will not be able to take time off to home school their children, they need to work. Do not close the schools.",
        "background": "Please don't force schools to close.  Our children have been unnecessarily impacted for months by the previous lockdown, they will never get this time back.  Standards of online learning vary wildly.  They aren't the at risk category and need school for social well being too.",
