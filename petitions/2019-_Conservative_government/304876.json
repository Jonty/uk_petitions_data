        "additional_details": "10% of children and young people (aged 5-16 years) have a clinically diagnosable mental problem, yet 70% of children and adolescents who experience mental health problems have not had appropriate interventions at a sufficiently early age. CAMHS services currently struggle to accommodate appropriate intervention and treatment plans due to being understaffed and underfunded. Mental health is just as important as physical health and many young people suffer alone. We need to change this",
        "background": "CAMHS desperately require better funding so that the staffing, treatment and care problems can be improved.\r\nBy underfunding these services, the health and wellbeing of our young people is currently being put at tremendous risk.",
