        "additional_details": "Every human being especially in a rich nation like the U.K. deserves to be treated with love and respect no matter their reason for homelessness. \r\n\r\nBy having a roof over their head, food, good training and skills development, we should be able to encourage people to get back on their feet so they can to live freely, contribute to society and our economy.  As we educate society and help one another, we should be able to reduce the number of people struggling in whatever capacity that may be.",
        "background": "Most homeless people cannot get benefits or a job because they have no fixed address. It\u2019s also been noted that approx 73,000 people who have jobs are now living in inadequate accommodation. This is a vicious cycle that needs to be stopped.",
