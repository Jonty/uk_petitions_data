        "additional_details": "Children are being impacted in a big way because of the way things are currently. As a psychotherapist, I'm fully aware of the damage that's being caused to children by irresponsible parents denying the children of their human rights. Denying a child access for no other reason than to cause harm is child abuse and not a civil matter. It's causing sometimes unrepairable damage towards innocent children and can affect them for the rest of their lives. The process would be a lot easier if taking away children's human rights was to be classed as a criminal offence not a civil matter. It should be punishable and the courts should have the power to do so.",
