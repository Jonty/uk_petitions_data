        "additional_details": "D-deficiency increases with latitude from the equator, amount of skin pigment, age and obesity. Studies show it has a significant effect on frequency and severity of some respiratory infections and is associated with increased Covid-19 severity and death rates. Staying inside can increase deficiency rates, a particular concern during lockdown. We urge the Government to promote healthy socially distanced sun exposure and fund free vitamin D supplements for all, especially for those most at risk.",
        "background": "The UK has high vitamin D deficiency rates especially in BAME, obese, poor, institutionalised & older groups most affected by Covid-19. Vitamin D is vital for immunity. The Government should fund provision of vitamin D supplements and promote safe summer sun exposure to achieve optimal blood levels.",
