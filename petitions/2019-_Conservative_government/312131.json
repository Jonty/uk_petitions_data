Those, key workers remaining in work, are not receiving any benefits (including PPE) in continuing their commitment to the UK. This fund will eventually have to be paid back, which no doubt will include taxation increases. Front line key workers, especially the Blue light services, have to often fight for wage rises. This is simply not fair considering current climate.",
