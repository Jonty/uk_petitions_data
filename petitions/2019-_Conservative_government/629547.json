        "additional_details": "Working people haven't had any sort of wage increase since the 2008 financial meltdown. 12 years of Conservative austerity has fought against wages being raised for the low paid. A \"living wage\" is no such thing, it's barely a survival wage, working 40 hours or more to be able to afford the debts taken out to survive is no life for a lot of people. Putting profits before people will not increase productivity, shareholders are not the only people that matter.",
        "background": "The UK Government are trying to make it unlawful for workers to protest  against their pay, conditions or security. The people of the UK have fought long and hard in the past for just these rights. The laws have been in place already and didn't work. Do not re-instate them.",
