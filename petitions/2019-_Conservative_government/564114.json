        "additional_details": "Making it a legal requirement that a licence is essential for ownership of rodents would help ensure that only those who can provide appropriate care will buy these pets. It is very easy for owners to mistreat rodents, without consequences. This is likely because they are easily available to purchase at cheap prices. Sign this petition to ensure that only those who can provide the correct standards of animal welfare for rodents can become their owners. Help give them a voice!",
        "background": "Many small animals are mistreated, including keeping them in unsanitary conditions, releasing them in gardens, or feeding them inappropriate diets resulting in poisoning or other conditions such as diabetes. Help prevent owners who are not able to provide appropriate treatment from owning rodents.",
