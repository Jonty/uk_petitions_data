        "additional_details": "The 5.6% compound interest rate on student loans is prohibitive & not in line with interest rates. It will add 9% on to the tax rate of those earning over the threshold. This is punitive to our future generations, who will be paying off the debt accumulated from Covid and so must be lowered. It\u2019s time to help this generation, who have been shafted over recent years. Time to stop this assault on their future, prevent a brain drain and inspire our young to do great things with their education.",
        "background": "We require the government to reduce the interest rate on student loans to RPI -2% and to stop the compound interest. They will be paying for the cost of Covid, surely that is enough? An additional 9% to their tax will be punitive on top of what they will be expected to pay off due to Covid debt.",
