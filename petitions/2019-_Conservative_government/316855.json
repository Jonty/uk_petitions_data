A key part of babies development is socialising such as baby classes and activities, all of which have been stopped for the duration of the lockdown. All women on maternity would either be recieving furlough or be a key worker, therefore would be recieveing pay for the duration of the lockdown. I don't think it's fair to use maternity pay during the pandemic.",
