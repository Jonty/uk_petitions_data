        "additional_details": "It has been estimated that in the year to February 2022 around 3.4 million households gave up a pet. Many registered rescue charities in England are full, resulting in pets being put to sleep by owners and councils while new licences to breed are still being issued. Staff working in shelters are under immense strain, which can affect their mental health.",
        "background": "We want the Government to form a pet task force to look at ways of reducing the number of pets being put to sleep. The task force should look at licensing arrangements for breeders, online sales and enforcement, including the adequacy of sentences for animal cruelty and breeding without a licence.",
