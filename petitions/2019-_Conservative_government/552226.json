You can read the latest guidance here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/homes\r\n\r\nPeople delivering are recommended to:\r\n- Minimise contact wherever possible\r\n- Where possible and safe, having single workers load or unload vehicles.\r\n\r\nWe know that Father Christmas is already very good at both of these things, but we're sure he will continue to follow the guidance. \r\n\r\nThe Foreign Office's current guidance doesn't require that visitors from Finland, including Lapland, are required to quarantine. You can find out more here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/finland\r\n\r\nIn any case, aircraft pilots and drivers of goods vehicles are not required to self-isolate when travelling to the UK.
