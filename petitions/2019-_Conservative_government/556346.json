My animals have the security of a warm closed area they can use to try and hide from these explosions (although this doesn't help) but what about Foxes, hedgehogs, etc that can't get away or hide from these explosions. In a time where mental health is such an important issue I implore you to think of the wellbeing of our animals as well!",
