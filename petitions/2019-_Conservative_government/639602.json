        "additional_details": "Six million people use the Post Office network for accessing DVLA services per year. Half use cash as a payment method, linked to the cost of living crisis. As banks exit the High Street and communities across the UK, there is a growing requirement for a national structure that can provide vulnerable customers with essential face to face services. The existing network of privately owned small businesses that make up the Post Office is the obvious solution to support vulnerable groups.",
