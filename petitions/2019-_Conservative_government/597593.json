We would like ethanol free petrol to be widely available at the majority of petrol stations for classic cars and motorbikes.We would like the E5 timescale extended from the 5 year recommendation of review.\r\n\r\nProblems associated are numerous and include deposits blocking fine mesh fuel filters, degradation of fuel pipes and hoses and internals of carburettors suffering corrosion\r\n\r\ni think this action should be taken to keep the classic culture alive. It has many spin off industries.. On estimated mileages of 1,500 miles a car puts out less co2p that a laptop.",
