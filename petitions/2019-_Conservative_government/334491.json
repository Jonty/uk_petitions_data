        "additional_details": "Final grades have been determined on the area in which a student resides, meaning many have been downgraded unfairly, even in this stressful situation. Standardisation of results has been prioritised over students\u2019 true performance standard, which teachers have a good knowledge of. It is outrageous that final grades have been altered to fit the area over a student's true capability, which could have a huge impact on the emotional state of many.",

This will benefit students greatly and put many minds at ease in these already stressful times.",
