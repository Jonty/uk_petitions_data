        "action": "Allow a choice between CAGs and examination if you cancel exams for Year 11 & 13",
        "additional_details": "This year, uncertainty about the Government's plan for exams has caused thousands of students undue stress. It is imperative that a plan which does not disadvantage a large part of the cohort is made in order for us to reach our goals despite major setbacks. By allowing for a choice (e.g. CAGs are given in April, then students are able to choose if they wish to be entered for exams), I believe that the largest number of people will be satisfied, while additionally making exams safer.",
        "background": "Many wish for exams to be cancelled, but this ignores private candidates and those who have been unable to cope with or access online learning, leading to poor evidence for CAGs. For this reason, in the event that CAGs are given a June exam series should be available so no one is disadvantaged.",
