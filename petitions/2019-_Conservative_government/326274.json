        "additional_details": "It is important to show the the evils of British Imperialism in order to teach students the true history of Britain and her role in the oppression and exploitation of countries in the African diaspora. By omitting this side of history students are left lacking in their education concerning how Britain became the modern power that she is today, thus resulting in a lack of tools with which they can work towards abolishing racial inequality today and understanding their own cultural histories.",
        "background": "Make it mandatory to teach students and retrain teachers/staff in the effects of British Imperalism and the role that the African diaspora played in British history through histories of Africa, India and the Commonwealth. Teach the brutality of the British empire and racist colonialist ideologies.",
