        "background": "Currently the financial requirements to bring your spouse to the UK is \u00a318,600 per year and now the Government wants to up it to \u00a329.000. Most people in the UK don\u2019t make that per year. We believe this policy punishes those who fall in love with someone with a different nationality.",
