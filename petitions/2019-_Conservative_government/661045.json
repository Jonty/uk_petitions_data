        "action": "Outlaw restrictions on prayer at work and in education",
        "additional_details": "In 2024, a school won a legal challenge against its policy banning prayer rituals, claiming prayer rituals risked \"undermining inclusion\" among pupils. Surely the school restricting the rights of students to pray is the body perpetrating exclusion. Restrictions on prayer suggest a person's religion is unwelcome, which is certainly a discriminatory sentiment.\r\n \r\nRegardless of which religion, whether it is a school or a workplace, restrictions on prayer should not be allowed.\r\n",
        "background": "Restricting people from praying arguably goes against the Equality Act 2010 (which protects people from discrimination based on religion or belief). People should not have their right to pray restricted (see article 9 of the Human Rights Act 1998) and hence restrictions on prayer should be outlawed.",
