        "additional_details": "There is however, scientific proof and medical concern that build up of exhaled waste products and toxins on the inside of a face covering can have detrimental effect and presently unrecognised health implications.\r\nThe restriction of oxygen intake can have a range of effects from mild temporary to fatal.\r\nIt should not only be those with a physical or mental disability who are exempt. Everyone should be free to make their own informed decision as to health risks.",
        "background": "There is no scientific evidence or agreement that masks provide any protection to the wearer or others from COVID-19. \r\nMandatory use of masks is not justifiable and infringes human rights and civil liberties and should not be\r\nenforced by the threat of refusal of entry or of a large penalty fine.",
