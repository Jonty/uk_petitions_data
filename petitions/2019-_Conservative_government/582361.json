        "additional_details": "As a biologist and someone who believes in animal rights, I find it deplorable that a nation such as ours allows the suppression and vile abuse of these often at risk animals. For instance lions and other exotic cats are at risk in their natural environment of the African savanna. I understand there are regulations surrounding the ownership of these creatures. But it is simply not enough. These animals MUST be in their own natural environments, helping their population numbers",
        "background": "Ownership of exotic animals, not only threatens the general public if they escape, but our delicate ecosystem that is not accustomed to their presence. These animals have their rights abused from being subjugated to artificial, cramped conditions with constant human handling",
