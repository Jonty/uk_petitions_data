        "additional_details": "I think school punishments should get banned because it is bad for the children\u2019s mental health. Them being in trouble for little things like forgetting a piece of uniform of being late to school should not be punished. Punishments should only occur if something bad happens like fights ect. I think it is really unfair if you get a detention for being 1 minute late or if you forget a piece of uniform. These Children deserve better.",
