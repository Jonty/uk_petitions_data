        "additional_details": "A lot of students are incapable of memorising even 1 text and it gives them an unfair advantage to past students who have been allowed their passages into their exams with them. As well as this, teenagers already get anxiety and stress over exams and having them learn multiple different texts with complex language will not help nor improve their performance. In fact, it will only make their actions worse because their minds will be filled with all these texts and they can\u2019t think straight.",
