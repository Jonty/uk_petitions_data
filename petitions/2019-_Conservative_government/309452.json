        "additional_details": "The NHS workers are working long, tiring hours to provide care. Often they are over worked and are working over time. After tax, this overtime is often not very much considering the dangerous and risky jobs they are undertaking. I believe it would show appreciation and support to those working with the most vulnerable and risking their own lives to help, such as nurses, health care assistants and paramedics.",
        "background": "For the duration of caring for patients during the coronavirus pandemic, NHS workers should be given a tax break or pay less tax for this period. This would show support to their dedication in caring for the population during this difficult time.",
