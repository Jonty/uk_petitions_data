        "action": "Prevent the UK government cutting foreign aid to Yemen by 50% from \u00a3164m to \u00a387m",
        "additional_details": "Yemen is in crisis: the UK wants to \u2018balance the books on the backs of the starving people of Yemen\u2019. \r\n\r\nThis is an act that will see tens of thousands die in a war committed by the Saudi regime, assisted by the UK\u2019s arms trade. When the UK\u2019s resumed weapon sales last summer, the UK sold \u00a31.4 billion in weapons to Saudi Arabia between July-Sept 2020; these weapons included missiles and bombs.  \r\n\r\nWe must continue to provide sufficient aid to Yemen or the blood of Yemeni people is on our hands.",
        "background": "The UK has decided to reduce Yemeni foreign aid from \u00a3164million to \u00a387million in order to \u2018balance the books\u2019 following Covid-19. Given the UN has declared this the worst humanitarian crisis of our time, we should cancel this reduction of aid and find alternative ways to balance the budget.",
