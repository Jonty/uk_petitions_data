        "additional_details": "The government has decided it is acceptable to punish front-line workers some who are working on minimum wage to pay a surcharge to use the NHS. The charge currently stands at \u00a3400 and will rise to \u00a3624 in October. The government does in deed clap for frontline workers but decisions like this means their clapping is meaningless. \r\n\r\nThis government should be ashamed of this, we need our frontline workers more than ever.  Scrap the surcharge immediately and reimburse any payments made this year.",
        "background": "Scrap the NHS surcharge for carers, auxiliary staff in care homes and NHS staff including auxiliary staff. They are risking their lives to save us, it is a shameful tax policy. I also want the government to actually meet some of these frontline workers that are being punished with this cruel tax.",
