        "additional_details": "We can't be certain that passengers from other countries won't have the virus because the virus has been widely spread. In order to tackle this further, we need to introduce enhanced monitoring for all passengers on their arrival no matter where they are coming from as this will limit the virus to spread at a rate which it is at now. Thus, the government should introduce monitoring for all passengers as this may be the only way to stop the spread of the virus as soon as possible.",
        "background": "The government should introduce enhanced monitoring for all passengers as they arrive in UK airports. Right now the government has only introduced it for people who are coming from specific places such as China, Iran, Japan and a few others. But there is uncertainty to be sure which country has it.",
