The East division links the Pennine community of Alston with industrial Barrow in Furness (which is actually in the West of the county) and is 87 miles from Alston and two hours by road.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State has accepted that one unitary authority meets all the required criteria.",
        "background": "The Government must reconsider the decision to divide Cumbria into two 'East and West' authorities which is both illogical and unworkable. It should consider a single Unitary Authority or possibly a 'North and South' division.",
