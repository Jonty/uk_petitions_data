        "additional_details": "Therefore I believe that the government should enforce a law that all products sold to women are assured to be sold equally, although in 2010 there was an abolishment in the \"Pink Tax\" businesses pass this off through selling each product as a \"unit\" this leads to women still having to pay the additional tax for the same products, even though these products are under the 2010 law.",
        "background": "I believe the government & parliament could make sure that businesses do not sell these products with a tax that is not required as women may struggle to pay this tax, also pads and tampons are essential because women cannot control their periods, therefore pads would be essential.",
