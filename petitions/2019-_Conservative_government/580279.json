Majority  of girls don't get diognosed and slip through the net. We need to change the list of signs 9f adhd and autism schools and care providers have. As in girls this is so very different.  We need to educate teachers to help them  understand even though there are no apparent signs as per this list there is . These are just  some.......\r\nHyper focus on one set thing\r\nDay dreaming \r\nIn ability to make friends\r\nMasking others\r\nMelt down when they get home due to holding the stress in all day",
