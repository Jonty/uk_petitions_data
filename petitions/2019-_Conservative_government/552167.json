Also no facilities for people like pensioners and the disabled to maintain mobility and general fitness.  Many of us in St Ives Cornwall and elsewhere were originally referred by our GP's and we have continued with that.  Without a centre that will not continue.  The PM wants to end obesity and get the nation fit.  The way to do that is not to let these centres close permanently.",
