        "additional_details": "Single use plastics are polluting the world, they need to be banned. Our oceans are being destroyed. We actively ship recycling to other countries whose lands are polluted with our plastic waste. Single use masks are being discarded everywhere and being found in the oceans. Animals and their homes are dying. We are running out of room for anymore plastic wastage. It is in our water, air, fish, land. It needs to stop.",
        "background": "The change needs to start in super markets, big brands and companies. They need to be forced to change their packaging to sustainable material. Companies like Galaxy are already using a plant based packaging for their vegan chocolate, it can be done. Our oceans and planet need us to change.",
