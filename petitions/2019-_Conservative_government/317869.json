        "additional_details": "Circumcision started as a religious issue which was often done on babies at birth. However, within the last few decades many people choose to no longer be religious during adulthood and I believe it is terrible for this to be forced upon a young boy with no permission. Circumcision should only be allowed if it is for medical reasons in young boys or if they are over 16. This would prevent a surgery which affects the person forever, when they haven\u2019t even given consent for it.",
        "background": "The Government need to make circumcising a young boy at birth illegal. It is a choice made by parents which continues to affect the child throughout his life. It should be taken seriously because the child cannot consent to this. It needs to only be allowed with consent at the age of 16+.",
