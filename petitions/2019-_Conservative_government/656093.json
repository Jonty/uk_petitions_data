MS sufferers can require immunosuppression medicine which in turn can mean that individuals also need antibiotics. We need help with prescription costs and access to higher benefits.\r\n \r\nI am an immune compromised individual suffering with MS and all the issues that come with it. The cost of prescriptions is so high that I recently had to decide whether I could get the medication I needed, or would have to wait until payday. We need free NHS prescriptions to help cover all our medications and we need more financial assistance.\r\n",
