        "action": "Require large filling stations in the UK, to provide electric vehicle chargers",
        "additional_details": "Large oil companies are always telling us about their desire to achieve net zero, yet very few of their filling stations provide electric vehicle charging points.\r\n\r\nUK consumers are aware that making a long journey in an EV can be problematic, due to lack of (and reliability of) public chargers.\r\n\r\nIf filling stations had to provide (for example) one electric vehicle rapid charging point for every 3 petrol/diesel pumps, then motorists would be more open to switching to electric vehicles.",
        "background": "Set a target for larger filling stations in the UK, so that they are required to provide a minimum ratio of EV rapid charging points (minimum 50 kW output) to fossil fuel pumps, to give motorists the confidence that owning an electric vehicle can be practical, even when charging at home isn't.",
