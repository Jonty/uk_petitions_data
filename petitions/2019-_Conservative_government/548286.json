        "additional_details": "Asymptomatic cases account for 40% of community Covid transmission, and possibly more among school-age children. In September, many children will spend the day in 'bubbles' of up to 240 children with no social distancing. Without regular testing, many will contract the virus unknowingly, putting their loved ones at risk. Families, especially those with vulnerable members, are having to face the anxiety of sending children into a school environment.",
        "background": "To reopen schools safely, we ask the government to introduce weekly Covid testing of pupils. The Children\u2019s Commissioner for England and the Royal Society's DELVE group have said routine testing is an essential, cost-effective way to prevent transmission and keep our communities safe.",
