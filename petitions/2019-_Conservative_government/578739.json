        "additional_details": "I want these badges issued to prevent people without children parking in the allocated bays for parents. I have seen first hand people without children parking in these bays leaving those with children struggling to find spaces big enough. These people wouldn\u2019t park in a disabled bay as they need a badge but you don\u2019t need one for parent and child bays. Therefore I believe issuing these badges will prevent people from parking in these essential spaces for parents.",
