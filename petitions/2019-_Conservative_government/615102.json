        "additional_details": "It's not fair that these buyers should make offers, then use the time for completion of the sale to continue going around looking for cheaper properties while the seller takes his/her property off the market then goes about looking for and viewing properties, appointing solicitors, having surveys and searches done.  So, in this respect; a holding fee/deposit should be made compulsory and made payable to the seller or buyer just in case any party pulls out.  I believe this will make either party think twice before pulling out of a sale/purchase for no good reason.",
        "background": "I believe a better system would be that as there are costs involved in buying a house even before contracts are exchanged that the liability for any costs should be on the person/s who pulls out of and scuppers the deal.",
