        "additional_details": "Thousands of greyhounds are forced to race for worldwide betting markets. We believe that the welfare of racing greyhounds is not adequately protected by Animal Welfare Act 2006, GBGB, or any independent body, and that greyhounds endure unavoidable suffering on tracks that can be dangerously configured, race in extreme weather & can be housed in kennels that have not been independently inspected to gain UKAS accreditation, despite commitments to DEFRA.",
        "background": "The Government must introduce legislation to abolish greyhound racing, via managed shutdown of activities, and ensure welfare of redundant dogs through a levy on the industry. In 2019 Greyhound Board of Great Britain (GBGB) data confirmed 4970 injuries & 710 deaths (14 per week).",
