        "additional_details": "The long charging times through non-fast EV charging points and the lack of public charging infrastructure could prevent the next level of EV uptake in the drive towards zero emissions and the demise of the ICE vehicle. Extending grants for electric vehicle charging points could help encourage their wider adoption.",
        "background": "Current rules state that you must have off-street parking to access grants to install an EV charging point. We want the Government to recognise that there are options available that make this requirement unnecessary and extend access to existing grants to those without off-street parking.",
