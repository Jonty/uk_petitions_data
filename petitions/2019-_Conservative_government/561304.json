        "additional_details": "Coronavirus cases are on the rise again, and despite the country being put in a four-week lockdown, they continue to increase. Many people believe, and can provide proof to, the fact that cases continue to increase during this lockdown due to the fact that schools and colleges remain open. Closing the schools and colleges will absolutely decrease the infection rates in the long run, and make both the country and world safer, due to kids and teenagers being asymptomatic super-spreaders.",
        "background": "We need the government to completely close schools and colleges all across the country, with everyone being sent home, and the teachers and staff given furlough.",
