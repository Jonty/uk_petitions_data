        "additional_details": "The year 11 pupils have had huge pressure with constant revision before lock down and now feel forgotten with fragile mental health due to being forgotten many with no clear guidance on what the future holds. They have gone from being one of the most important year groups in schools to the least. Many have recieved little or no work from tutors, but what happens if they don't recieve a pass? They could have had around 6 months of no learning then face re-sits. They need to go back to school before the end of the school year.",
        "background": "I want the current year 11 students to be able to go back to school for the end of year celebrations and proms as well as their next steps guidance. Before they start their new journey at colleges. They have been totally forgotten and left out after having this huge milestone ripped away from them.",
