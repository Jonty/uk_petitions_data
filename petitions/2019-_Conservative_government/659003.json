        "additional_details": "We believe having a self-regulating body like the RCVS, is not helping anyone. The British Veterinary Union has stated the RCVS \"functions as \"an 'Old-Boys' club\". The BVU also said \"there is a strong distrust in the ability of the RCVS to perform its duty as a regulator and reach fair decisions through its disciplinary committee\".\r\n \r\nWe think a new Veterinary Surgeons Act isn't going to help either. To give families and their animals a fair system we want an external independent ombudsman. This could also help veterinary professionals who have to cope daily with frustrated clients who feel they have no form of redress against the cash hungry corporate shareholder groups or the inadequate RCVS.",
        "background": "The recently published Competition and Markets Authority report has revealed the hold the six corporate shareholder companies have on the veterinary sector in the UK. I believe this is having devastating consequences on animal welfare, animals families and veterinary professionals.",
