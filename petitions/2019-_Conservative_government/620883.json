        "additional_details": "I want the Government to introduce a regulator and mandatory licensing for animal groomers so they have some accountability for animal welfare and not just anyone can set up as an animal groomer. Under a licensing system animal groomers should have to be registered the local authority. This should ensure they can be held accountable and regulated in a way that protects animal welfare.",
        "background": "After recently collecting my dog from a groomer his front paw was bleeding after his nails had been clipped too short, he had suffered a \u201cclipper\u201d burn to his back paw, he was in pain. I was shocked to realise that animal groomers are not regulated and do not need a licence.",
