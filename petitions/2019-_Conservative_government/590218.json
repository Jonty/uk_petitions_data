It is unfair to allow misdiagnosis\u2019 to be continued as a proper consultation cannot be achieved over the telephone. Furthermore more people every day are being vaccinated, including key workers in the health sector, so why aren\u2019t GP\u2019s being made to have face to face appointments with their patients?",

If public places are opening up again, and life it continuing then doctors should be seeing/treating their patients.",
