        "additional_details": "The Environment Agency has a large budget but we believe not enough of this is being directed towards protecting or improving the environment.\r\n \r\nGovernment grants to the agency rose from \u00a3880m to \u00a31.05bn over the past two years, and money for flood operations has steadily increased. But Government funding for the agency\u2019s environmental protection work was \u00a394m last year. Work such as attending pollution incidents must not be deprioritised.",
        "background": "Government funding for the Environment Agency\u2019s environmental protection work has fallen from about \u00a3170m in 2009-10 to a low of \u00a376m in 2019-20, and \u00a394m last year. I want the overnment to increase funding in this area to 2009-10 levels at least, if not more to address years of low funding.",
