The term \u201csambo\u201d is a derogatory term used to refer to the enslaved black people during times when they were being captured and sold as slaves. The term rips black people of their identities, deeming them property; not worthy of names. This is unacceptable. The grave is of a young enslaved boy who died whilst being transported, he was never given a name. Please change the name of this \u2018historical grave\u2019.",
