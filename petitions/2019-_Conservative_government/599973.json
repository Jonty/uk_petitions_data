People should be free to make up their own minds as to whether they wish to purchase a product, without being penalised, and no higher power or Government should ever possess the authority to bestow its individual moral views upon the masses. Where cigarettes are subject to high taxes, this can lead to them being bought through the black market rather than official vendors.",
