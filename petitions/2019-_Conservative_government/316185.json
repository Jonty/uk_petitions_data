        "additional_details": "Doctors on Tier 2 dependent visas have gone through the same screening process as a tier 2 visa holder.  Applying for a Tier 2 visa for a Doctor already holding a Tier 2 dependent visa could greatly reduce the strain on families as well as on the NHS. It could streamline the process of commencing training and encourage more Doctors towards furthering their medical careers, ultimately providing a better workforce for the NHS.",

Increase risk of exposure to the coronavirus during travels. \r\n2. Increased overall cost of visa application. \r\n3. Reduced number of Doctors on the frontline due to travel.",
