The Doctors\u2019 Association UK has been collecting data on this for weeks and lobbying for improved PPE through our Protect the Frontline campaign. Despite multiple reassurances from the government the PPE shortages are now life-threatening. This weekend we may run out of gowns. This is unforgivable. Doctors are dying. Nurses are dying. We now need a commitment for a full public inquiry into the lack of PPE.",
