        "additional_details": "The McLaughlin (2018) and Jackson (2020) judgments resulted in the current law being found to be discriminating against the children who\u2019s parents are currently unable to make a claim as they were not married or in a civil partnership with their deceased partner. A draft remedial order has previously been laid out by the DWP to the government asking for this law to be changed following the success of the previously mentioned court cases. I would like the government to pass this law as a matter of urgency to enable eligible parents who are struggling financially during the current economic climate to claim this benefit.",
        "background": "The draft remedial order was laid out in July 2021 and last updated in December 2021. This has still not been made into legislation by parliament. I would like this to be made into law as soon as possible to enable those missing out on this payment to be able to claim it.",
