        "additional_details": "Women are at a significant safety disadvantage in cars. Factors such as seat height and firmness, as well as mostly male crash-test dummies that don\u2019t account for female muscle mass distribution, bone density, and pregnancy play a significant role in this.\r\nAs a result, in a car crash a woman is:\r\n\u2022 47% more likely to be seriously injured.\r\n\u2022 17% more likely to die.\r\nMen are twice as likely to get into car crashes, yet women still have an overall higher chance of suffering serious injury.",
        "background": "I was horrified upon reading the article 'The deadly truth about a world built for men' in the Guardian (23/02/2019). It revealed that women are at a significantly higher risk in many aspects of life. The section regarding car safety stuck out to me as a young woman approaching driving age.",
