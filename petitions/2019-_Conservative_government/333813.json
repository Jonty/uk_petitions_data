        "action": "Cut down content in core subjects such as Mathematics in 2021 GCSES",
        "additional_details": "The Parliment should assess an average of mathematics topics covered within schools across the country and ensure that exams only cover that which students have learnt properly and that which they are capable to cover before mock examinations and GCSEs in 2021. \r\nThis will ensure students are getting a fair chance on their gcses as many educators have covered subjects only briefly during lockdown, preventing students from having a full education. There is not enough time to recover from this.",
        "background": "The Parliament has recently stated they will allow students in 2021 to drop topics within their English Literature exams in 2021. \r\nThe Parliament needs to acknowledge that the majority of Year 10 students have not reached halfway within their mathematics course, making it near impossible to pass.",
