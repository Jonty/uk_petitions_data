        "additional_details": "The Government made a mistake wrecking the education and futures of many children. Last years A levels were re done but it was too late, the damage was already done. The students cannobt go to their original choice of University , most cannot even get in. \r\nGCSEs was a mess too. Not that many made it to 6th form. \r\n\r\nThe government should keep the schools open for vital years like year 11 to year 13. At least make sure these Students will not have a wrecked future. Please Sign to save our education",
        "background": "This petition is made to counter the 'close school petition'. This is very saddening that a petition to ruin our education has arised. First the government turns their back on the poor and now the people are stripping every chance they have of a good future. \r\n\r\nSign this petition. Help the Kids.",
