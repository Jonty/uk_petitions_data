It would be nice to recognise her in this way while she is present and able to see one way in which she is rewarded for her service to the UK, indeed to the Commonwealth. It would also bring the UK further into line with the amount of Bank Holidays the EU receive and could boost our business economy. This would be a huge gesture at a time when morale is low for many.",
