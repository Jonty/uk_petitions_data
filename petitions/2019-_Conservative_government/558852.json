        "action": "Legalise the personal use of cannabis to help mental health issues.",
        "additional_details": "Legalising the use of cannabis would help those struggling with stress, anxiety and other mental health issues during these hard times. Due to lockdowns, restrictions and the struggles across the nation during these hard times, the legalisation could help people stay mentally healthy. Limiting the quantity allowed at once and limiting the amount allowed in your system in units will keep the use to a low, while still allowing people the assistance while pushing through their hard times.",
        "background": "During the pandemic and lockdown, I have personally and have seen others impacted heavily from mental health issues. The personal use of cannabis helps ease my anxiety, depression and stress during these times, and I believe the legalisation would help others with mental health problems.",
