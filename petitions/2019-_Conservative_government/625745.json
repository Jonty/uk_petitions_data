It is also difficult to secure the individual components on bikes that are also targeted for theft. It is difficult to remove and carry wheels, saddles, batteries etc in addition to lights and panniers or baskets. Police statistics for resolving bike theft are extremely low. Particular problems in flats mean bikes may be too heavy to carry upstairs to store or charge.",
