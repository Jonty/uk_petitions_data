        "additional_details": "We all know social media sites are available to everyone, where you can find people just by knowing their first names and seeing them once. This makes retail name badges a concern when it comes to privacy. Employees of all ages and genders could tell examples when they wish they didn't have their names on display. There's 2.9 million of us work in retail. Our rights matter too.",

Now social media is part of everyday life, wearing name badges shouldn't be forced on retail employees.",
