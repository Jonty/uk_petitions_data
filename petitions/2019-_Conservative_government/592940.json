        "additional_details": "Poor, badly informed decisions are being made by judges in respect to abuse victims and the care of their children.  Unevidenced allegations of parental alienation and pro contact judges force contact where it is often not safe and not desired by the child.  Proceedings need to be more 'child's wishes' centric and have transparency.  Judges and barristers should receive more detailed information and training regarding the abusive use of family court systems and how to identify these situations",
        "background": "Reform how family court proceedings function.  In particular for those of domestic abuse, controlling and coercive behaviour and those who weaponise court proceedings to continue to abuse.  Proceedings should be transparent and public.  Judges should be trained to identify abusers",
