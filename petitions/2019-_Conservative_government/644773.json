        "additional_details": "I also want unfair sanctioning to be scrapped.\r\n \r\nThe reason why Universal Credit needs to be scrapped and for legacy benefits to be reinstated is I think it is making a lot of people worse off and putting them into debt, into poverty and putting them at increased risk of bankruptcy and homelessness.\r\n \r\nClaimants who make a claim for Universal Credit have to wait for up to at least 5 or 6 weeks before they receive their first payment which can make it very difficult for people to have the ability to buy food and pay their bills and rent.",
