She was simply sitting on my driveway as she did every single day. I believe dogs see cats as prey and we can\u2019t rely on people to be responsible and leash their reactive dogs, a law should be in place to protect cats that are just as worthy companions as dogs to many citizens. Even if a dog isn\u2019t reactive and has been trained well, they can have natural instincts and seeing free roaming cats could trigger that instinct.",
