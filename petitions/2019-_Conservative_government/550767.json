        "additional_details": "Funding should be provided on a sliding scale based on household income, with those on lower incomes be eligible for more funded hours, and those on higher incomes eligible for less. This should apply to all children aged 0-5, so that families of all ages are able to benefit. \r\n \r\nTo protect all families a cap should be placed on the hourly price of childcare, at a level that allows childcare settings to make a profit. Consultation with the early years sector would be needed to determine this rate.",
        "background": "The childcare sector is on its knees, with many settings running at a loss. Parents are struggling to afford childcare. To \"build back better\", we need to start with the childcare sector. The Government should reform childcare with increased means-tested support and an hourly price cap on childcare.",
