        "additional_details": "In the UK private companies can charge outrageous fines for \"parking violations\". Some of these violations are loopholes that the parking companies use in order to gain more income. For example if the ticket slips in the window, if a letter is missing when typing in registration numbers on machines or if you're 30 seconds over your time. The companies often refuse appeals even when the parking has been paid which causing innocent people to get life altering CCJ's destroying credit scores & lives",
