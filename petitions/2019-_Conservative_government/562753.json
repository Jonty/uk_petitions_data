        "additional_details": "As of late, the main roads and high roads in and around London are highly congested with traffic. Individuals, such as myself, are made to wait in long ques of traffic during rush hours, with side roads and streets being cordoned off too. The frustration lies within the fact that once you get to the point where the works are supposed to be taking place, there are no workers present, just cones and blockages adding to the unnecessary build up of congestion that we road users have to endure.",
        "background": "Enforce fines and introduce penalties to local authorities who authorise road works to be carried out during the day. \r\nDisable the use of temporary traffic lights and road blocks if work is not being carried at that particular point in time.",
