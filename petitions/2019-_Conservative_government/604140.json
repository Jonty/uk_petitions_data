        "additional_details": "We are facing a major staff shortage right now and most werehouses rely on students at the moment. Also most werehouses are forced to throw away food as there is no lorry driver or staff to move them. I believe if we don't do anything about tax our economy will collapse due to less productivity.this income tax is discouraging work and investment they are also increasing national insurance and this is like Putting petrol in blazing fire. We need lorry drivers and most don't do it because of tax.",
        "background": "The government should raise tax free allowance to \u00a340,570 and reduce the higher tax rate to 25%. No changes to national insurance contributions it should stay the same. This will encourage people to work more and countries with low tax policy has better economy.",
