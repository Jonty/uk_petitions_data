Horror stories.\r\nHow the assessor is poorly treating the student, or claiming to \u201cnot have time\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe assessor must undergo special training in order to get that position, even though they are not completing their work, which is crucial for the student to progress to the next stage.\r\nYet, the assessor will not fail if they are not completing all the paperwork? Why?",
