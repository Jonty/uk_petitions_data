        "additional_details": "Through creating this petition I hope to highlight the need for the DfE to make it absolutely clear to Head teachers that providing plant-based options in all schools is not something that can be debated or refused and that a hot, nutritious, balanced, plant-based option must be made available every day, as standard, if requested.\r\n\r\nIf 'Every Child Matters' then this inclusive step must be taken.",
        "background": "Due to both a lack of knowledge regarding the philosophical aspect of ethical veganism and the absence of clear instruction from the DfE, many Head teachers are still refusing to provide plant-based options for those parents who are entitled to request it. This is discriminatory and noninclusive!",
