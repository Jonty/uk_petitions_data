        "additional_details": "The Government needs to do this, to stop the continued coercive control an abuser can exert over their victim, through using the child as a weapon. An individual is free to leave their abuser but is dependent on a signed document from said abuser in order to take their child abroad. This is wrong and the law is flawed. \r\nAbusers should not be able to continue their abuse of their victim through a child. As long as there's a clear return date from the holiday, no permission should be needed.\r\n",

Currently, if the abuser has parental responsibility (eg. they're on the birth certificate), their consent is needed.",
