        "additional_details": "Having already missed 5 months of content, students are now further disadvantaged as schools move to remote learning. Students are being faced with uncertainty around their futures impacting both their education and their mental health. There has been a disregard for students. Provide students teacher grades as not only are they now missing at least another month of content, they are already struggling from the chaos of last year. Exam alternatives will damage health and futures. Cancel All.",
        "background": "In a period where assessments cannot proceed, alternatives will not be sufficient. Remote learning disadvantages large quantities of pupils, with not only poverty affecting their education but many other factors. Any plans for alternatives should be scrapped, allow Teacher predicted grades.",
