I have complained to the DVLA and was told that there is no flexibility as it was set by the Government.\r\n \r\nIn my view, the higher monthly payments should be sufficient to cover the costs incurred by the DVLA in processing the direct debits. I am paid by my employer on 9th of every month. Due to other financial commitments, I need to pay my road tax monthly as it is lower in the short-term. I, and many others, have the added undue stress of ensuring enough money is left to pay my tax.\r\n",
