        "additional_details": "SAFs are made from sustainable sources. A variety of SAFs are licensed for use in current planes. They can reduce the net CO2 impact of flying, but they cost more than fossil jet fuel, so demand & production are still low. That is why Government intervention is needed to accelerate progress by assuring growing demand.\r\n \r\nFor sustainability and ethical reasons, only SAFs which don't compete with food production or cause deforestation, and which are not sourced from animals, should be promoted.",
        "background": "The UK should pass a law requiring all aircraft operating in the UK use Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs). The share of SAFs required should rise annually, reaching the maximum allowed by 2030. Simultaneously, non-SAF fuel should be taxed at a growing rate to ensure it is costlier than SAFs by 2030.",
