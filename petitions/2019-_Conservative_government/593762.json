        "additional_details": "Carl Hester is arguably the person who has had most influence on the sport of Dressage in the UK, with his skills, talent, devotion and ambassador for the sport he has been pivotal to our country bringing home many Olympic medals over the past few years, including Team Gold at our own London 2012 games. His selflessness and generosity lead to him giving over the ride of his top horse Valegro to his now world-famous protege Charlotte Dujardin who became one of the most successful combinations in history. This man has done more for Worldwide Dressage and British Dressage than any other. Kindness; ability and training methods above and beyond. GB are only on the World stage because of Carl.",
