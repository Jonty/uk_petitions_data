The government must act now to prevent an even worse littering problem this summer. The answer is not more bins. Rubbish must be taken home if no bin is available. People must be taught that there is no excuse for littering, and the natural consequence must be that littering offenders are required by law to complete at least one week of community street cleaning service.",
