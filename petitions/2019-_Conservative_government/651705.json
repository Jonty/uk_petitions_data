With significant time pressure on schools, this is difficult to do.\r\n \r\nThousands of children in our mainstream schools rely on or regularly use BSL to support their education and/or communication at home.\r\n \r\nThis change would better allow schools teach BSL with the time and resources it deserves, and could help create an inclusive community and start children on a pathway to employment.\r\n",
