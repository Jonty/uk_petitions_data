        "additional_details": "We feel that this is necessary simply to reduce uncertainty. Making students wait until the traditional results days in August to receive their calculated grades (which in the case of this year is simply not necessary) leaves only two months for students to decide whether to partake in the proposed exam series in October and then to prepare for those exams, and that just isn't enough time. Furthermore, results days and the days leading up to them are usually days not of excitement but of anxiety, and by ensuring that students receive their grades as early as possible this will help to reduce that anxiety.",
        "background": "We would like the Department for Education or the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual) to ensure that GCSE and A-Level students receive their calculated grades as soon as possible.",
