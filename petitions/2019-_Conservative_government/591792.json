        "additional_details": "In some schools students have missed a third of on-site days since March 2020. Although students have had access to remote learning, it has not been possible to make this consistent across the country. Students must be assessed on what they have been taught, not what they have missed through no fault of their own. To ensure this the government should make sure exams are accessible to all students and that this accessibility should not depend on the GCSEs and A-Levels they happen to have chosen.",
        "background": "On 12/07/21 OFQUAL published its proposed arrangements for exams in 2022. These arrangements would see exam content reduced for only a minority of GCSEs and A Levels. This does not account for the significant loss of teaching time suffered since September 2020 nor that this loss varies by region.",
