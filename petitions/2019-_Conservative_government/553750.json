Many would now love to own but deposits are high & they have made their house a home and built a life. We, for example have a beautiful home in a village and would love to now buy it. We cannot due to restriction on when the HA purchased from the council. No logic. We have had an assured tenancy for 12 years and always paid our rent. We would be sad to leave our home and life to buy a small newbuild elsewhere.",

There are a whole generation who were not encouraged to buy and just put on the housing list automatically by parents. Many now would love to own but deposits are high & they have made a home",
