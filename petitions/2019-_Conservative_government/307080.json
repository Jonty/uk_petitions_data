        "additional_details": "Current NHS hospital capacity is insufficient even before the Coronavirus emergency. By halting HS2 and requisitioning all the compounds the Government can enable immediate construction of temporary and permanent hospital construction on these sites where needed most without having to source new sites. Enabling works to do this are already done. Sites are cleared and serviced. Road accesses already in place. Modular temporary or permanent construction can be started immediately (BIM technology).",
        "background": "HS2 currently have temporary construction compounds from London to Lichfield. They are cleared, serviced & ideal for temporary & permanent hospital construction near key population centres. Halt HS2 immediately and requisition these sites for emergency NHS & logistical provision.",
