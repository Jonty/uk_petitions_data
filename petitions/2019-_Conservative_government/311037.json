        "additional_details": "We are just asking for parity, to make it fair. Many of us self employed earning over 50k will have lost our income just as the self employed earning under 50k. We will have based our mortgages, cost of living, cost of running our businesses on our income. Many self employed employ others, contract work out to other businesses so if they go under, then other businesses will suffer. An income of  50 k may sound like a lot of money but if it is the families only source of income then its not.",
        "background": "Give the same financial assistance to the self employed (SE) who earn over 50k a year, but to make it fair cap it at the same amount as those earning up to 50K ie. \u00a32500 a month. We just want parity. SE healthcare, solicitors, accountants, could be bankrupted if we cannot meet our outgoings.",
