In August 2019, the procedure received approval by the FDA in America and has been acknowledged by the British Scoliosis Society as a potential treatment here in the UK.\r\nThe availability of this treatment could support medical advancements in our country; negate the need for patients travelling abroad to access treatment and significantly offer patients treatment choices.",
