        "additional_details": "New ICE vehicles will be banned from sale in 2030 and the demand for EVs will increase. The Government\u2019s vision for charging infrastructure is that everyone can access reliable public charge points at home and along major roads. The DfT has set a target of 300,000 charging points by 2030, There is a shortage of chargers, particularly outside Greater London. 5.2% of public EV chargers are broken. The UK needs a much larger and more robust charging infrastructure requiring significant investment.",
        "background": "The \u00a3950m rapid charging fund will support 6,000-plus high-powered charge points across England by 2035. Local authorities will also receive \u00a3500 million. The investment is inadequate. The Government must invest much more to meet the charging needs of battery EVs, predicted to be 10 million by 2030.",
