Although the company has registered their annual PAYE scheme with HMRC, if the RTI has been submitted after the cut off date, 19th March 2020 (usually end of the tax year (31st March)), this prevents the director from being eligible for the CJRS.\r\n\r\n2: New employee starts new job 1st March on monthly PAYE with payment due on 31st March. RTI not submitted until end of month preventing employee being eligible for CJRS.",
