Current measures are clearly not sufficient to tackle this heinous crime which strips victims of their dignity, freedom and many of their basic human rights.\r\n\r\nThe institution and implementation of stricter, harsher punishments of the highest degree in the UK will act both as a warning and a deterrent to those involved.",

We ask for the institution to have heavier prosecution for anyone involved in these crimes, to deter those operating at all levels of human trafficking networks.",
