Cancelling HS2 North renders this investment lost, and such waste of public funds cannot be allowed to happen without appropriate scrutiny.\r\n\r\nAny disposal of HS2 North & its Assets must first be subject to Due Process - Not rapidly sold-off by an (outgoing) Gov't for its own gain - And only furthered if this stands in the wider public interest.",
