        "additional_details": "The Government are the only people who can make a change and if not then protests can, I want to help women who have to use substitute materials to avoid embarrassment and they shouldn\u2019t have to do that, it shouldn\u2019t be something to be ashamed of. The pads and tampon situation is bad enough and for people especially men to mock it is worse. I\u2019m willing to help all women who need it. #womensrights #girlpower #equalrightsmovement",
        "background": "I want the Government/Parliament to make pads and tampons free and this is because there are many females who cannot afford to buy pads, brands are making pads more expensive assuming they are supposedly \u2018better quality\u2019. I think they should be made free as it isn\u2019t our fault we have periods.",
