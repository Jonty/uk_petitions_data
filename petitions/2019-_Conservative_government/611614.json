        "additional_details": "Every day in Scotland alone there are so many cats that are much loved family pets that are sadly hit by vehicles on our roads many of them are just left dead or dying a horrible painful death. However sometimes all it takes is someone to care and the cat can be saved. These a domesticated companion animals they matter to someone, they are family. It is now required cat owners microchip their cats or face a fine. It\u2019s time the law is changed so drivers report if they hit a cat on the road.",
        "background": "When I was a little girl I was witness to our family cat being run over by a car outside our house and the driver never stopped. My mum went out and picked her up off the road. I got bullied at school as a result of seeing such a horrible thing, 40 years on and the law still hasn't been changed.",
