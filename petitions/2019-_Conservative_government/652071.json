        "additional_details": "When individuals face accidents due to others' negligence, they often lose their vehicles, need time off work, and their families endure significant mental stress. Recovering from such trauma can take 6-12 months, with the emotional and physical toll often surpassing any settlement received. It's unjust that those who are not at fault in these situations should also face the added burden of increased insurance premiums.",
        "background": "Individuals involved in accidents often experience financial, physical, and emotional turmoil. It's unjust for insurance companies to substantially hike premiums, sometimes by as much as 200%, especially when the policyholder is not at fault. Parliament/government must stop this injustice.",
