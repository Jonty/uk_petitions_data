        "action": "Allow Driving theory test to expire three years instead of two",
        "additional_details": "It seems unfair that people are not being given the same opportunity to obtain their driving test and licence as those pre pandemic.  The backlog of people waiting for both Theory and Practical tests is so long now.  As people get older it maybe takes more time to learn the required driving standards and the space between the number of practical tests that can be taken has been reduced, due to the back log.  A one year extension on the Theory Test would help avoid this discriminatory anomaly",
        "background": "Because of the long delays caused by Covid, it is taking up to 6 months to get a driving test which only allows 3 tests before having to resit theory test again.  Pre pandemic, it was possible to attempt test every 3 months.  Until tests are back to this level, extend the Theory test to 3 years",
