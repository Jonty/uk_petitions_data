        "action": "Extending school hours and reducing holidays is not what the UK's children need.",
        "additional_details": "As a parent I believe strongly that the wellbeing of our children is paramount. Longer days in the classroom will achieve nothing because as the day drags on, their concentration becomes less and they will become resentful rather then engaged. They have already been robbed of enough time and as adults we know that childhoods are over in the blink of an eye and adulthood brings the burden of responsibility. In addition, teachers are exhausted and have already given their all for our children.",
        "background": "The government should reconsider its proposals to extend the school day and reduce the summer holidays for children to catch up on missed education. The UKs children have suffered enough this year and should be given the opportunity to reconnect with childhood.",
