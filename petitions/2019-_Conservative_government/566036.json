However they did not vote on leaving the European Single Market or European Free Trade Association. This option has never been offered to the British people but it is hard to think it is not preferable to our new trading relationship for BOTH 48% who voted to remain and sufficient leave voters to be a majority when given the option between this, a bad deal and no deal.",
