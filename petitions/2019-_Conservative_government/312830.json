        "additional_details": "It is inhumane and dangerous to leave a child in hospital alone. Numbers in hospitals should be kept to a bare minimum and so sadly adults with coronavirus can't have visitors. But a child cannot come to terms with being left alone with strangers. We believe being alone would result in pain, suffering, confusion and distress and such stresses would directly reduce the chance that the child has of recovering. Let an adult carer stay in hospital in isolation with any child suffering with Covid-19.",
        "background": "Hospitals must allow one family member/carer to stay in isolation with any child that is in hospital with Coronavirus. No child should ever go through a hospitalisation alone. A child will be distressed and confused if left alone in hospital and this stress will reduce survival chances.",
