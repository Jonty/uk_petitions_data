        "additional_details": "The government has already been petitioned about this (case 319899) and rejected it in July 2020 citing there would be 'data gaps' leading to 'fraud' and 'design and operational complexity' and that they 'prioritised the creation of schemes that could help as many people as possible as quickly as possible'.  These are now weak arguments in the light of all other countries in the UK managing to provide such a  scheme, and therefore proving it possible for such a scheme to be provided in England.",
        "background": "Scotland, Wales and now Northern Ireland provide \u00a32000 - \u00a33500 one-off grants to the Newly Self Employed. Northern Ireland recently launched its 1st grant, Scotland announced a 2nd round of grants, and Wales a 3rd.  Similar provision should now be made for the Newly Self Employed in England.",
