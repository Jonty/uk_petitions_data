The average UK citizen causes a far greater strain on the world than the global average.\r\nhttps://populationmatters.org/the-facts/uk\r\n\r\nWith new laws, we can combat climate change, improve overall quality of life, and make for a brighter future for the next generation.",
        "background": "A system should be set in place to financially reward those who have 1 or no children.\r\n\r\nThis money would be diverted from those receiving excessive benefits for having 3+ children.\r\n\r\nMeasures should be taken to educate why having 3 or more children isn't sustainable or responsible.",
