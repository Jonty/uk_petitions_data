        "additional_details": "The Chancellor has offered business rates relief to businesses operating in the retail, hospitality, childcare, and leisure sectors to help them through the pandemic. Both human and animal healthcare have been inexplicably and unfairly excluded, and practitioners fear for their futures. Many of these businesses continue to provide services with a significant reduction in income. Business rates relief must be extended to include all businesses operating in the human and animal healthcare sectors.",
        "background": "To request that the Government extends the Covid-19 business rates relief to all small and medium sized businesses operating in the fields of human and animal healthcare, including but not limited to dental practices, therapists and veterinary surgeries.",
