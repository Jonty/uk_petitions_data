        "additional_details": "We ask the Government to reduce this to 0% as a permanent measure.\r\n \r\nAirlines have been flying planes empty to retain their landing slots. These \u2018ghost\u2019 flights are a shocking waste of resources and a needless source of emissions.\r\n\r\nAt a time of climate emergency we need to drastically reduce our fossil fuel use, and in the context of our steadily dwindling carbon budget, it beggars belief that planes fly empty.\r\n \r\n\u2018Ghost' flights are of no benefit to anyone. This is a needless, wasteful practice, and reforming historic rights to landing slots will bring it to an end.",
        "background": "UK regulation states that airlines must use their landing slots more than 80% of the time in order to keep them. This was suspended at the outset of the pandemic but is now 50%, with plans to return to 80% by March 2022.",
