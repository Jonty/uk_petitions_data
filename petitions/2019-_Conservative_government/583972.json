        "additional_details": "As the UK comes out of this nightmare, with our vulnerable citizens protected by vaccines, we have a moral duty to support a country that has such close bonds with Britain.\r\n\r\nThus, we ask HM Government to urgently send medical supplies to India to ease the suffering of our brothers and sisters.\r\n\r\nIt is also in the UK's best interest to prevent the extension of the virus in other nations, specially those we are so close to, to prevent the appearance of strains that may be resistant to our vaccines.",
        "background": "The current health situation in India is critical due to an unprecedented surge in COVID cases, perhaps worse than what we have unfortunately experienced here over the past months. Many of the deaths happening could be prevented if they had access to sufficient medical supplies such as antivirals.",
