        "additional_details": "There are far too many people experiencing crisis as a result of mental health issues calling 999, where the support they need is not immediately available.\r\n \r\nThis takes resources away from others needing ambulance and police, while people needing mental health support do not receive the assistance they need as quickly as possible.\r\n \r\nAdding mental health crisis services to the 999 service should take pressure of police and ambulance, and better serve people experiencing mental health crises.",
        "background": "I work answering 999 calls and an extremely high number of callers need immediate support from the mental health service. There is no mental health crisis team available on 999. This means support is delayed because they are dealt with by police or ambulance then passed over to crisis teams.",
