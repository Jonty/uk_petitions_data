We want this to change.\r\n\r\nLack of toilets can lead to street fouling; a major public health issue,\r\ntoilets in private business premises do not meet everyone's needs.\r\n\r\nAge UK says the dearth of public toilets is adding to older people's social isolation because they are reluctant to risk going out without knowing there is a toilet available and that dehydration was an extra hazard.\r\n\r\nWe want a law requiring Local Authorities to provide and maintain suitable, safe, clean and appropriately located Public Toilets with realistic opening hours.",
