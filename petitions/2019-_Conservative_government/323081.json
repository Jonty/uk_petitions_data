        "action": "All schools to have non school uniforms when schools reopen after lockdown!",
        "additional_details": "This should be put into place because after the country is released from lockdown and students are back working in schools, it would help the virus a little bit from spreading if it is carried and spreads more easily from higher temperatures of the body. Being in black school uniform, the bodies temperatures rise by being in hot classrooms in winter and summer. Another reason is thst students can express themselves and if America can do this then we can too, schools will just need a dress code.",
        "background": "School Uniforms should be stopped because it gives students a chance to express themselves, most students hate wearing school uniforms because they feel uncomfortable and insecure. They want to express their personality and it gets really hot in classrooms, so no uniforms means it feels cooler.",
