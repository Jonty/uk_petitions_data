My daughter was the first one off the bus and checking the road she deemed it safe to cross, however she didn't see from behind the bus an overtaking van and was hit at nearly 40mph. She sustained serious injuries.",
        "background": "I would like the traffic laws to adopt a system where it is illegal to overtake a stopped school bus. Drivers should wait behind any stopped school transport bus where children are boarding or alighting to protect children from being hit by overtaking vehicles.",
