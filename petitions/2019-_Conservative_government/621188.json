However there is no funding for the nursery to employ anyone to provide 1-to-1 care. Therefore we have to risk our son attending on a 3 to 1 ratio, or I will have to give up work to look after him until he turns 2. This is a huge issue facing families.",

There is a huge gap between maternity and a child's 2nd birthday. Funding is needed to provide 1-to-1 childcare for SEND children under the age of 2, where this is required.",
