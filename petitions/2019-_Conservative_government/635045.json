Current measures are clearly not sufficient to tackle this heinous crime which strips victims of their dignity, freedom and many of their basic human rights. The institution of harsher punishments in the UK will act both as a warning and a deterrent to those involved to break the chain of trafficking taking place on our doorsteps.",

We ask for the Government to increase sentences for anyone involved in these crimes, to deter those operating at all levels of human trafficking networks.",
