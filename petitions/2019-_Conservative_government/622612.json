        "action": "Reform MPs' expenses rules regarding their right to claim for utility bills",
        "additional_details": "MPs have a minimum salary of just over \u00a384,000. Many have other positions in Government, and second jobs and businesses, which increase their income further. We believe reform is needed, with an end to the rules which allow MPs to claim back their expenses, expecting those earning as little as a 7th of their salary to pay towards their living costs. We hope this issue can be debated in parliament and change brought about to ensure fairness at a time when people cannot afford their bills.",
        "background": "The cost of living crisis is undoubtedly going to result in an increase in abject poverty among the British population. Meanwhile taxpayers are paying the rent, water, gas, electricity and internet for many MPs' London accommodation. This is unfair when many taxpayers cannot pay their own bills.",
