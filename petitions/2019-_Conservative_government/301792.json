        "additional_details": "There is a liner due in on Saturday 14th of march, stopping at shetland 1st who have confirmed cases of the virus.  Cruise ships are small confined spaces with large numbers of people on board being the perfect spreading haven.  Prevent is better than cure.  This is similar to large organised events so something must be done to protect our communities. This is happening now.  Please act before it's too late.",
        "background": "We want you to stop all cruise liners coming into Orkney during the Coronavirus outbreak.  \r\nThere are people from all over on these liners and the results could be devastating to such a small community.",
