        "additional_details": "I think the 2nd most stressful thing in a students life is homework (exams being the first). Some schoolchildren are more stressed than adults with jobs and partners. We are excluding core subjects and subjects you choose for GCSE because you should revise, but we don't think schools should be able to set homework for other classes. It is unnecessary stress and work, pointless when you know what you want to do in life.",
        "background": "Ban homework in secondary school apart from core and GCSE subjects as well as in primary to ban homework for subjects apart from core subjects. The departments that are not allowed to set homework should be allowed to instead do a project every term or half term depending on it\u2019s importance.",
