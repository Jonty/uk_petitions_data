Currently the only options for help are to wait for a GP appointment or specialist referral or to call a helpline or go to A&E. All of these things require time, which for someone struggling could be too late in helping them. Having mental health hubs where no appointment is required to speak to someone, I genuinely believe could help so many people struggling.",
