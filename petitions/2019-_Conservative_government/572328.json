My son who has ASD started reception the year the pandemic began. He will go in to year 2 this September & I feel so strongly that he has not had enough time; not just academically but also emotionally.  \r\n\r\nParents are struggling to home school & we must consider the mental health of everyone moving forward & do what is right.",

As a parent, I do not think they know what is best for our children. We need to be responsible & ask for more help.",
