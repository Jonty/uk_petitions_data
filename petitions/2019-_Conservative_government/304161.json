        "additional_details": "Extending the reach of this grant will help many businesses that either aren\u2019t big enough to have a property, or are in a sector that doesn\u2019t warrant it\u2019s use. There are still many other costs SMEs face that will be disrupted by the current measures and will help a great more number of businesses facing uncertain stability over the coming months.",
        "background": "Currently the \u00a310,000 Small business grant introduced to help SMEs during the Covid-19 outbreak is only available to businesses that have a property and either pay Business rates or are already exempt through Business Rate Relief. We would like it extended to all SMEs, even if they have no property.",
