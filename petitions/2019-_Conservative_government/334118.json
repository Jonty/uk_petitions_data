        "additional_details": "This has been going on far,far too long, and its about time the Government and Parliament made a stand to protect our country and turn these immigrants around and send them back. If they are claiming asylum,  should that not be done in the 1st safe country they arrive at. The only reason they come here is because they are given taxpayers money, often more than legal residents get. Look after our own first.",
        "background": "Use the Royal Navy to enforce our borders. The border patrol we have is not enough to stop the influx of illegal immigrants. This situation is costing the tax payer a small fortune allowing this to continue.",
