Mothers lose their young (and the young lose their mothers) just for milk. Male chicks are gassed and shredded up in the egg industry. Animals are abused and killed for their fur, for testing and \u201cresearch\u201d, for \u201csport\u201d, for \u201cpest\u201d control, for their wool and for their feathers. It\u2019s time to ban all of this and grant all sentient animals legal personhood and rights!",

Billions of animals are abused and killed unnecessarily every year. It\u2019s time to grant them legal rights!",
