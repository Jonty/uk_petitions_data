        "additional_details": "The UK Government says its aid to the PA isn\u2019t used for its 'Pay for Slay' programme. \r\nMoney is fungible and the PA often misappropriates funds to the detriment of the most basic provisions for its people.\r\n'Pay for Slay' promotes terror via financial rewards and is a major barrier to lasting peace. It is the first duty of the UK Government to protect all its citizens and paying terrorists whose murderous attacks have killed British subjects is as far away from that duty as is possible to get.",
        "background": "The UK Government gives foreign aid to the PA and other Palestinian projects. We want the UK to halt this aid as long as the PA continues to incentivise terrorism by paying salaries to incarcerated prisoners and the families of dead terrorists, a programme pejoratively known as 'Pay for Slay'",
