        "additional_details": "We need to act now, before it\u2019s too late. Plastic bags hinder the quality of our earth, despite it only being the start. We as the UK, need to start being more responsible for our actions on how we\u2019re damaging our earth. Although you might think this won\u2019t change anything, it\u2019s a start. A start to make our world a better, environmentally friendly world. Please share this to everyone you can so we can try and out a stop to climate change once and for all. Thank you",
        "background": "Single use plastic bags are problematic, taking up to 1000 years to biodegrade; even then they still exist as micro plastics. We need the government to ban plastic bags in order to try and help the current climate change issue to which these plastic bags are contributing majorly to.",
