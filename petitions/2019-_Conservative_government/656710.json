        "additional_details": "I believe this is a more logical rule. For example, currently a vehicle rated to tow 2000kg cannot tow a trailer rated for 3500kg even if the trailer and load weighs less than 2000kg, despite the fact the same load is legal on trailer only rated for 2000kg (a weaker trailer).I believe this would increase the safety of towing as it would mean people can tow equivalent loads on trailers that are tested and rated to a higher towing capacity. I think it would be a clearer rule as it means the towing capacity of the vehicle is what you can actually tow.",
        "background": "Change towing limits so they are based on the actual weight trailer and load rather than the maximum authorised mass (MAM). Meaning any MAM trailer can be used as long as the actual towed mass is within the car\u2019s capacity. To apply to anyone who passed their driving test after 1/1/1997.",
