        "additional_details": "It\u2019s been scientifically proven that even after being double jabbed you are still just as contagious as an unvaccinated person so the new rules make absolutely no sense what so ever, I believe these rules have been designed for the sole purpose of coercing people into being vaccinated and many people who don\u2019t want the vaccine or can\u2019t have the vaccine are being wrongfully discriminated against.",
        "background": "The latest government decision to lift Covid testing and isolation for vaccinated people whilst making unvaccinated people have even more testing and isolate for 10 days on return is simply disgusting. All testing and isolation rules need to be ditched immediately.",
