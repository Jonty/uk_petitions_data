        "additional_details": "The coronavirus pandemic has really stretched the NHS and Boris Johnson and the Government state that the public are the ones that must support them. However, where is the support from them? NHS worker's are lucky to get \u00a328,000 a year for 30 hour shifts a day whereas footballers for example, get nearly 10 times this for playing a 90 minute game a week. This is highly unfair, why should they get more when they are not the ones saving lives whilst risking their own? Something needs to change, NHS workers deserve way much more than they have right now.",
        "background": "Reduce footballer's and other athlete's wages who all earn a ridiculous amount each week from \u00a325,000 to \u00a3400,000 which those in the NHS never earn in their lifetime. Pass a law that footballer's and those in professional sport do not get paid more and that NHS worker's get the wages they deserve.",
