        "additional_details": "In 2015 the drug driving zero tolerance limit was set 3\u00b5g/L lower than advised by an Expert Panel. In 2018 Cannabis was made a legally prescribable drug and the law should reflect this.\r\nResearch has shown that over 1 million people in the UK use cannabis due to a medical problem.\r\n\r\nCurrently Police can decide any reason to issue a roadside test, irrespective of driving history.\r\n\r\nEven if a suspect is subsequently able to secure a prescription they still lose their license for one year, which can affect their employment and insurance.\r\n",
