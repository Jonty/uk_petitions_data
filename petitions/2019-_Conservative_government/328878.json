It's understandable that members can have a treat like the rest of us, but with a basic salary of above \u00a380,000 per member it's certain that these luxuries are unnecessarily paid for by the taxpayer when the tax payers money should be going to meaningful causes that benefit an unjust socio-economic society that is struggling more then ever in the midst of a global pandemic.",
