        "additional_details": "Manchester cases are currently 266.3 per 100k, falling at a rate of almost 40%. The London borough I grew up in have currently 367 cases per 100k, which are rising at a rate of almost 20% (source: gov.uk and the BBC, as of 26/11/20). Yet Manchester is in tier 3, and London in tier 2.\r\n\r\nA publicly available SAGE statement dated November 11, states: \"There is a great deal of uncertainty about the effect of tiers, particularly Tier 3.\"\r\n\r\nThe people of Manchester deserves justification for these lockdowns",
        "background": "Manchester and other regions in the north of England continue to get treated unfairly during this pandemic. They should either be provided with evidence and financial support, or be put in tier 2 in line with scientific logic, fairness, and facts, rather than economics and regional politics.",
