        "additional_details": "The government has promised to support the NHS, emergency services and employees who may lose income and jobs during and after the current crisis. There is little doubt that supermarket profits have soared above and beyond what would be achieved in a normal week. Supermarkets must now be forced to pay all excess profits made during this time to the government so that it can be used towards supporting essential services and those who will suffer financially through no fault of their own.",
        "background": "Supermarkets have profiteered from COVID-19 panic buying by failing to introduce strict limits when it became apparent what was happening. Even where restrictions have since been introduced, these are not always enforced. Members of my family are classed \"at risk\", but cannot buy basic essentials.",
