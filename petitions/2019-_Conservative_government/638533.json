        "additional_details": "We wish that our government introduces a law that forbids the use of Greenbelt, natural countryside and wildlife habitat for solar panel farms, nationwide. We are losing rural appeal for our future generations to enjoy and have sufficient brownfield alternatives in all Borough's to accommodate such developments, which would be infinitely more environmentally friendly. The proposals are an abomination and are the precise opposite of what we should be doing with precious Greenbelt",
