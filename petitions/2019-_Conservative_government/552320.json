        "additional_details": "The Government has imposed further restrictions on the wedding and events industry limiting guest numbers and the format of weddings and events. These restrictions are forecast to last well into 2021, with over 90% of events cancelling, this has left hundreds of thousands of self employed suppliers and companies helpless. The new schemes of support only cover people returning to work, the government restrictions on weddings and events means it is extremely tough to return to work if at all.",
        "background": "Due to the Government tightening the restrictions on weddings and events for the foreseeable future, it must now act to help the Wedding and Events sector survive, especially small businesses. The government can't hinder and stop people from working and then not support them financially any longer.",
