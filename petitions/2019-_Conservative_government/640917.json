While able-bodied children get this for free!!\r\n \r\nThese children never chose to be disabled, this ease of accessibility was cruelly taken from them.\r\n \r\nThis can make disabled children feel excluded and limits exposure of abled-bodied children to our disabled population, which can lead to segregation and lack of equality.\r\n",
        "background": " \r\nWe want the Government to provide funding for at least one piece of equipment in every playground around the country that is wheelchair accessible. So families don't have to travel, as their local playground has something accessible for them.\r\n",
