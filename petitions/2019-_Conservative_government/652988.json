        "action": "Legalise Cannabis  both medicinally and recreationally",
        "additional_details": "Cannabis has been legalised in the USA, and many other countries. I think the government should also become open minded about this substance and not criminalise it because criminalising it does more harm than good. \r\n\r\nA lot of people use Cannabis illegally, and the fact that it is criminalised affects their identities and formation of social milieus. Furthermore, Cannabis has been found to have medicinal uses and also it helps some people with anxiety.",
        "background": "It is a good idea to legalise cannabis because then people would be less exposed to criminal circles to obtain it. The government should decriminalise this product and join the many other countries that have legalised it.",
