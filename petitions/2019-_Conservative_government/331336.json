If lying is allowed without sanction, how can they do so properly?\r\nThe existing rule assumes that MPs are honourable and right honourable members, honourably disagreeing with and contradicting each other, not impugning each other.\r\nThe entire basis of accountable democracy falls apart if policies and actions cannot be disputed without such challenges being stonewalled with a barefaced and unchallengeable lie.",
        "background": "MPs must be allowed to call out provable instances of perjury. Justification for doing so must be supplied, and the challenge must be answered with an admission of guilt or proof to the contrary.",
