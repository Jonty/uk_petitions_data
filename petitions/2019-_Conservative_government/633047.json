        "additional_details": "It's unfair that some parents are oblivious, and this means head lice circulate within schools. Require schools to bring back Nit nurses to stop the cycle. As it was when we were young. Everyone would be issued a sealed letter to take home to parents. Whether they have them or not. Kids also need to know there is no shame in having them, but that checks and treatment must be done to eradicate these pests from all schools!!",
        "background": "I and many other parents who comb, treat and try preventive sprays are sick of our kids continuously getting head lice. It's cruel and never going to be eradicated without these essential workers checking, notifying and explaining how to treat nits, to those who aren't aware.",
