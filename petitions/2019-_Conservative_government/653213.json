        "additional_details": "I believe that trail hunting is a smokescreen and that police don't adequately monitor trail hunts, and it is difficult for the public to gather sufficient evidence of illegal activity to enable a prosecution. I believe that banning all forms of hunting would help the enforcement of the Hunting Act 2005.",
        "background": "I believe that Trail Hunting is a cover for the illegal act of fox hunting to carry on, and think that banning trail hunting would make the countryside much safer for the general public as well as the horses, the hounds, the foxes, the wildlife and the volunteers who police the situation themselves.",
