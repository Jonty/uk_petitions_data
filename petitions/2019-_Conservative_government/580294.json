        "additional_details": "The UK's illegal cannabis industry is in an absolute state with lots of fake products and people who self medicate and use cannabis recreationally don't truly know what they're ingesting, something that can be fixed with legislation. Furthermore legalising cannabis and regulating it's market would greatly improve the UK's economy, giving a new stream of tax money to the government helping pay off this covid debt.",
        "background": "Legalising cannabis for medical use was an amazing step but we need to go further. Allow people to use cannabis by self medicating for more conditions and regulate the market so people know they're getting clean, safe cannabis allowing recreational use and medical use.",
