No other faiths have this privilege, and nor do the other UK regions. \r\n\r\nThese bishops can vote on every law that is passed - even laws that the church doesn\u2019t have to abide by because it has legal exemptions from Equality legislation. \r\n\r\nWhatever goes on inside religious organisations, the Church should not be allowed to hold sway in the Houses of Parliament.",
