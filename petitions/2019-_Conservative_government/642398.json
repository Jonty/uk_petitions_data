        "additional_details": "The Institute of Alcohol Studies (IAS), found that the risk of dying in a vehicle crash increases to at least six times with a BAC between 0.05 and 0.08. Norstrom and Laurell (1997) examined the effects of lowering the BAC limit from 0.05 to 0.02,  they found an 11% reduction in single-vehicle crashes, a 9.7% reduction in fatal crashes, and a 7.5% reduction in all crashes. With this information, we can hypothesise that a reduction in BAC from 0.08 to 0.02 would lead to even higher reductions.",
