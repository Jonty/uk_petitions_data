        "action": "Decriminalise abortion for any reason in the whole of the UK",
        "additional_details": "People should have security in the stability of their bodily autonomy, so abortion should be fairly included as it is part of bodily autonomy making it a human right. You removed this right for people who need it when abortion is critically under fire, putting people in danger. You have not decriminalised it, despite the Infant Life Act (1929) being out of date and formed on sexist grounds and that the Human Fertilisation & Embryology Act (1990) were passed to provide safer access to abortion.",
        "background": "Recognise abortion as a human right, better protect clinics from protestors, allow abortions for any reason, put references to Bodily Autonomy & Sexual/Reproductive Health Rights back on the Statement of Fundamental Rights for Women & Girls, decriminalise abortion.",
