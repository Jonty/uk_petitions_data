        "additional_details": "Everyone is aware that we are in a global pandemic however the traffic light system has unfairly disadvantaged British Citizens. Many countries remain on the red list that have a better control of the virus than the UK. The system appears nonsensical. For transparency, we want the government to publish reasons for why countries are placed on the red list and allow all vaccinated British citizens with a negative PCR test the right to quarantine with their families.",
        "background": "There have been recent exceptions made to the red list. There remain countries on the red list which have better COVID statistics than the UK. Reasons for placement should be given and vaccinated British Citizens who live abroad should have the right to visit family and quarantine with them.",
