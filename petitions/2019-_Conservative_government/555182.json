        "additional_details": "We would like freedom to sing and worship in our places of rights. There is no reason as to why we should be banned from doing so. There is much more to our life than simply just surviving - our worship is a big part of our lives.\r\nThe government has put an extremely large amount of anxiety, depression and stress on people\u2019s minds, both with young people and the elderly. The least they can do is give us back our human rights to worship...\r\nOur singing/worship has no effect on COVID-19.",
        "background": "Our worship should never be restricted by a government, no matter what. Singing is a substantial part of people\u2019s worship, and we should be free to do so. \r\nAlongside this, there has been scientific evidence that there is no difference in projection when singing, as opposed to speaking.",
