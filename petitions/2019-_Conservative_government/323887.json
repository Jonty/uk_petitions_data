        "additional_details": "Race issues are increasingly being discussed more widely, thanks in part to social media and movements such as #BlackLivesMatter. But the UK education system does not prepare children to have these conversations. Our classes are more diverse than ever yet we don't want to discuss the impacts racism continues to have on our past and present, we must make it mandatory to discuss 'the impacts of racism' in school.It is not as simple as name calling, it runs much deeper and we need to talk about it.",
        "background": "Children should understand the importance the impact racism has had and continues to have as part of the national curriculum. This is in line with understanding equality, human rights and having the right for their voice to be heard encouraging meaningful conversations in the classroom.",
