        "additional_details": "The UK government and councils have a duty to process waste in a responsible and environmentally conscious way, we cannot pass on this responsibility. If waste is to be exported (to the detriment of the environment) then stringent processes should be in place to ensure its final destination is a legitimate and monitored recycling facility or scheme. \r\n\r\nThe UK public have diligently separated waste for recycling for many years. We demand that our efforts are actually making a positive difference.",
        "background": "A recent and previous BBC investigations found the UK are exporting recycling to countries that are unable to process their own waste, yet alone that of other countries. Some if not the majority is destroying the local communities and ending up in landfill or being burned or dumped into waterways.",
