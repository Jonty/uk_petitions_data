        "additional_details": "Multiple students have positively tested for COVID after being 100% asymptomatic. Guidelines say that without symptoms, you can\u2019t get a test meaning possibly hundreds of students are COVID positive without even knowing it. The Government has also allowed household mixing for Christmas. Asymptomatic carriers meeting family for Christmas are unknowingly putting loved ones at risk. The Government should have closed schools earlier! They must close NOW to restrict the spread and save lives.",
        "background": "Close the schools! Possibly hundreds of asymptomatic carriers are planned to meet vulnerable family members over Christmas. The Government has not only failed everyone in the education system but everyone who contracts COVID from their lack of due diligence.",
