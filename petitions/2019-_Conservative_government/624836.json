        "additional_details": "I am fed up of seeing our flag flown incorrectly. The final straw, which incited me to start this petition, was attending events in Denmark & Sweden where, with our Queen having just passed away, our national flag was flown at half-mast. Initially I saw this as a lovely sign of respect. That was until I realised that it wasn't the right way up. Still, if many of our own people can't fly it correctly, there's no hope for the rest of the world!",
        "background": "Choose an emblem to add to the Union Jack. It is frequently flown upside down, as many people don't even realise there is a right and wrong way. If an emblem is added, this should aid the correct flying of our national flag.",
