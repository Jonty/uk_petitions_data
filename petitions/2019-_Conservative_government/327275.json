The idea that informed people may have skewed the result in a sensible direction is no rebuttal to this. If the government does not take the consultation under advice, then the consultation is a sham. These reforms, which should have allowed trans people to self-determine, are instead currently on track to force them to choose between staying indoors, breaking the law, and risking violence. This must change.",

We demand:\r\nFor trans people to be allowed to choose their gender via informed consent;\r\nFor people not to be segregated by assigned sex",
