We think the changes could lead to the UK essentially vetoing new tech features. \r\n \r\nWe also think the IPA 2016 does not fit with the principle of innocent until proven guilty as we consider that it allows the Government to snoop on us. \r\n \r\nWe believe that the UK Government must abolish this act immediately.\r\n",
