We think the changes could lead to the UK essentially vetoing new tech features. \r\n \r\nWe also think the IPA 2016 does not fit with the principle of innocent until proven guilty as we consider that it allows the Government to snoop on us. \r\n \r\nWe believe that the UK Government must abolish this act immediately.\r\n",

Now the Government are looking to amend this Act so technology firms have to notify the government about proposed new features that could impact the government\u2019s ability to do this. ",
