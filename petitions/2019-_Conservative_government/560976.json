        "action": "Abolish the TV License making the BBC a pay to view service.",
        "additional_details": "The TV license is an old out dated and not fit for purpose tax on the British public. The BBC should become a pay to view service like Netflix, Amazon prime and Apple TV. This would give the public the option to pay and watch instead of being forced to. The BBC are forcing the license on everyone and adding to the debt of a household making the elderly and less fortunate struggle to pay bills and put food on the table.",
        "background": "We would like the UK government to abolish the UK tv license. Making the BBC a pay to view service will give people the choice to watch it and not force the public to pay for a service they may not want or use.",
