Above that level, the entire value of that support is removed - creating a \u201ccliff-edge\u201d effect [...].\r\n\r\n\"The distortions that this can create are among the most severe you will ever see within a tax and benefit system. A  parent with two children under 3 whose childcare provider charges England\u2019s average hourly rate for 40 hours per week [...] earning \u00a3130,000 would be worse off than one earning \u00a399,000.\"\r\n \r\nSource: https://ifs.org.uk/news/childcare-reforms-create-new-branch-welfare-state-also-huge-risks-market",
