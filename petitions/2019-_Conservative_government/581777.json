        "action": "Make sexual harassment and assault education in schools compulsory",
        "additional_details": "Currently there is too much flexibility between schools concerning the sex education curriculum leading to inconsistencies in many students understanding of sexual harassment and consent. Students have been let down by this, with many of them experiencing sexual harassment in schools; an environment they are supposed to feel safe in. We need to implement compulsory education in sexual harassment and assault so students can feel more confident in recognising and addressing situations they feel uncomfortable in.",
        "background": "Sexual harassment in schools between students is too much of a common occurrence. There is little education for students on how they can recognise this, leading to many students sexual harassment and assault in schools.",
