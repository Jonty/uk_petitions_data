        "additional_details": "At present the publication of drone film is not sufficiently regulated. 'Auditors' can film businesses with no consent and then publish their footage online. The drones may alarm residents, livestock and workers. The footage may, unintentionally, give viewers insights into site security, the presence of property desirable to thieves, and be used for acts preparatory to terrorism. 'Auditors' often obscure their identity, and will not give their names, which can leave businesses frightened.",
        "background": "To prohibit the publication of drone footage taken on/over private property without the written consent of the property owner. This is sometimes referred to as 'auditing', and whilst many 'auditors' behave with integrity, many are provocative in order boost viewing numbers (and income).",
