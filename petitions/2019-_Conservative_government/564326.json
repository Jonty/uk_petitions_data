        "additional_details": "Following the governments decision yet again to cancel driving tests leaving 1000's in a state of panic at this already stressful time it seems almost spiteful to do this again since many tests have been cancelled 4 or 5 times already. if the government are trying to discourage us from using public transport at this time, shouldn't they be encouraging us to drive? Moreover, since driving lessons are a form of education and all other sectors of education can continue shouldn't driving be allowed?",
        "background": "in tier 4 as the new regulations regarding driving have left I and many others with cancelled driving tests, some already for the 4th or 5th time I am asking, if a test is only 45 minutes with masks and gloves and all windows open is it not feasible to allow driving tests and lessons to continue?",
