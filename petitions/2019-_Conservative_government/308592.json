        "additional_details": "The coronavirus has shattered the lives of students- with many losing jobs, isolating alone in still-unfamiliar areas without friends, family or classmates for company, and therefore struggling with their mental health. Whilst Unis are no doubt working hard to reach need, the shift towards virtual learning is not the experience originally desired and is adding additional stress to their lot. If the mode of delivery is no different to say the OU, then Unis should price match their course fees.",
        "background": "Universities should not expect students now having to move to virtual learning to pay the same fees as those originally signed up for. Virtual learning is not the same quality experience as learning in class so the government should make them reduce fees in line with online education providers.",
