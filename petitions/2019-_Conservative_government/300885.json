At this point we have two choices: do everything within reason to mitigate its spread, or accept that the death rate could be inflicted upon the entire population, possibly within an unmanageably short space of time.\r\n\r\nWe do not need a draconian lock down and we must respect individual liberties and economic necessities. But any clearly irresponsible behaviour beyond the necessary must be strongly discouraged or outright banned.",
