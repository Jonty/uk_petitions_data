Currently, this is achieved by removing the sexual organs, I believe with no consideration to the health and welfare of the dogs.\r\n\r\nAllow breeds that are banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act to have hormone sparing sterilisation. Some studies have shown that hormone sparing sterilisation (vasectomy / hysterectomy) can prevent multiple health issues. These alternative methods still achieve sterility.",
