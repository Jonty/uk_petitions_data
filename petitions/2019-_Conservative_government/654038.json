Some parents on UC don\u2019t have enough money up front for childcare, which can prevent or delay them from returning to work. DWP can sometimes calculate claims incorrectly and not respond to complaints in a timely manner. Most nurseries require fees up front, but UC claims are paid a month in arrears. This can leave claimants out of pocket. People on UC might not have this money. They are living on the breadline!",
