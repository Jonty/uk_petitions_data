It is a public right to understand the dangers of fossil fuels, just as it is for tobacco.\r\n\r\nEmerging evidence suggests air pollution worsens covid19 outcomes. Health warnings connect the abstract threat of climate change with the vast array of health risks linked to fossil fuels. They should encourage use of alternatives to fossil fuels, and increase demand for zero-carbon renewable energy. Making fossil fuel use more of a public concern should inspire improvements to cycling and public transport networks, car sharing, EV charging stations and city planning.",
