        "additional_details": "This bus pass is a lifeline for students to travel across the Capital and between boroughs for work and study. It has been suspended as part of the government bailout for TfL from Covid19 The bus pass has become a victim of the pandemic. It shouldn't be part of the negotiations. The impact of this decision will be felt across schools and colleges with attendance, punctuality, retention and indeed recruitment. \r\nWe need the government to reverse this decision and put this vital support back in.",
        "background": "Students across the Capital need this bus pass to travel to school and college. It will cause financial hardship for families with lower incomes who can't meet this cost.\r\nThey rely on this for their children to travel to learn and work.
