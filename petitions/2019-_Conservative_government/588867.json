        "additional_details": "Following the recent devastating events surrounding footballer Christian Eriksen, the world has drawn its eyes to the fact that many grassroots football clubs and public places do not have access to a defibrillator - a lack of access for such a lifesaving device can often be the difference between life and death, especially during the crucial minutes when CPR is first being performed. The government should act to fund a national program to install defibs in order to save lives.",
        "background": "The government should act now in order to prevent unnecessary deaths from cardiac arrest due to a lack of available defibrillators, by finding a national program to install them or make them accessible in all public places.",
