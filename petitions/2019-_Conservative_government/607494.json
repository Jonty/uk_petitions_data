        "additional_details": "Many people believe that this has already been abolished, but it has only been amended, in very exceptional circumstances when the DPP agrees that there is new and compelling evidence.\r\n \r\n'Double Jeopardy' is an 800 year old principle in common law that protects suspects of crimes from being retried, or even requestioned, for the same crime.\r\nWe believe this fails to consider the continuous suffering endured by victims of unsolved crimes. Police are still being prevented from reinterviewing acquitted suspects even in murder investigations.",
