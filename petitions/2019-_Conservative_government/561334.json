We make a daily choice between becoming homeless or risking our lives to work. The \"high risk\" group were the only group advised to take more precautions than the general public during England's current lockdown, while over 70s (moderate risk) followed only the general advice. We are classed as higher risk yet much lower on the priority list. We cannot be an afterthought. Protect us.",
