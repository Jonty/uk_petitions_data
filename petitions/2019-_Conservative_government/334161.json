        "additional_details": "Many students have lost motivation due to numerous reasons that COVID has provided and as a result are behind on class/coursework. Some colleges and sixth forms were not able to provide learning resources as soon as we entered lockdown and these resources were delayed for some students. A-Level content is harder to understand and learn and so it would be an unfair judgement to make from exams when most of the course has been self taught with limited to no help from teachers.",
        "background": "I would like for the government to consider changing the A-level course content as there is a lot to learn & know for exams and we are at a disadvantage due to COVID-19.",
