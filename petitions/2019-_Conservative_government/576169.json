        "additional_details": "Many students are now living at home and paying rent on a property we can't live in, due to Mr Johnson's guidance. Asking landlords to refund rent is unfair, they have no control over this situation. Instead, wipe maintenance loan debt to cover rent paid on places we cannot live. Many of us will leave university with an enormous amount of debt, with the money loaned going towards rent on property we have been unable to live in. We ask that you wipe this debt.",
        "background": "Students are paying rent on private accommodation they cannot live in due to the pandemic. It would be unfair to ask the landlord to reimburse rent. Instead, we ask that Mr Johnson wipes maintenance loan debt as acknowledgement and reparation for the money we wasted on renting places we cannot live.",
