        "additional_details": "After 17 months of a constant development to immunity and an extremely successful vaccination program, the vulnerable, elderly and those who are deemed at risk are protected from the virus. All of our livelihoods have been majorly disrupted due to the pandemic and it is now time for England to reopen it's doors to the nightlife sector. Making fully vaccinated customers only, able to be admitted to nightclubs, punishes young people who wish not to have the vaccine for their own personal reasons.",
        "background": "The PM and Healthcare Secretary announced that they have future plans to only allow full vaccinated persons into nightclubs and populated events from September 2021. This means that people who choose not to take the vaccine, for their own personal reasons - will miss out on the clubbing experience.",
