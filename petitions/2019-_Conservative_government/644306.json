        "action": "Change breeding and ownership laws for all dog breeds",
        "additional_details": "Current UK breeding laws allow virtually anyone with a dog and adequate living arrangements to produce and sell puppies. At present, temperament and health testing is not taken seriously enough. As a result of this a growing number of dogs are not fit for domestic living. With no restrictions in place, breeders can sell puppies to anyone.This means that people are buying dogs without the first clue of how meet their needs or how to raise/train them to be a safe and enjoyable part of our society.",
        "background": "As a dog lover and owner, it is my belief that we should be pro-active to prevent any other large breed being considered for ban by implementing stricter breeding and ownership laws. Including introduction of a law for health and temperament testing and licensing for dog ownership.",
