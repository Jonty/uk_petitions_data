        "additional_details": "One of the most common form of heart valve disease is narrowing of the aortic valve (AS). It is estimated roughly 200,000 people currently have severe AS in the UK, but many are either undetected or go untreated. Without proactive treatment around 50% of people who have symptoms due to severe AS die within two years, and up to 95% within five years.\r\n\r\nWhile AS is serious, it is treatable by surgical or transcatheter valve replacement, and once treated, patients can get back to a good quality of life, symptom-free.",
        "background": "Heart valve disease is a common, serious, but treatable condition that affects over 1.5 million people in the UK. We urge Government to provide additional funding for the diagnosis and care of aortic stenosis (AS) in order to improve the detection and treatment of the condition.\r\n",
