        "action": "Introduce a stay on eviction proceedings for tenants over Christmas",
        "additional_details": "The government could introduce a stay on eviction proceedings during the month of December 2020 to ensure that tenants have sufficient time when restrictions are lifted in early 2021 to find alternative accommodation. It also ensures that the courts are able to focus their efforts on clearing other backlog cases, and tenants can enter the Christmas period knowing that they will not be expected to attend hearings.\r\n\r\nThe ban on bailiff evictions is not the same as a stay on proceedings.",
        "background": "The Government has indicated that during national lockdown and until 11th January 2021 bailiff evictions will be halted except for the most extreme cases. This gives a potential cliff edge on 11th January where people could lose their homes as bailiff evictions restart.",
