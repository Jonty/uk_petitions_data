        "additional_details": "Funding for public services has been stretched for a number of years. Many services that support people with a learning disability are having to cut costs, which can mean less successful support. Some community services are being cut, and professionals not being replaced when they leave. There have been tragic cases where individuals have died, due to misunderstandings of their needs. More funding is needed for these services.",
        "background": "I think that public funding to support people with a learning disability is too low, and adequate support is not being provided. People with a learning disability are often marginalised and experience significant challenges. We believe they need extra help, which the Government should fund.",
