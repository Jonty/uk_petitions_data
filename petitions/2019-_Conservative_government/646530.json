        "additional_details": "I have had to deal with multiple customers this year who have won fish as prizes and have not been given adequate equipment or advice on how to take care of them correctly. One major incident I dealt with in the summer of 2022 was on the day temperatures in North Wales hit 34 Degrees, a regular customer of my fish shop brought a fish in that had been left on a hay bale in the heat with very little air and extremely hot water. I managed to revive the fish but these instances have to be stopped.",
        "background": "Currently there are still counties that allow live fish to be given as prizes at events, because there is no national ban on this. As a Marine Biologist and Aquarist I find this cruel as the conditions the fish are kept in are completely unacceptable",
