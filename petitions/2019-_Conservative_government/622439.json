        "action": "Shift subsidies and tax breaks from fossil fuels to renewable for a safer future",
        "additional_details": "Although the government claims to not support fossil fuel industry through subsidies it does so in ways that are hidden to consumers.\r\n\r\nBritain currently supports the fossil fuel industry through tax breaks and subsidies for exploration and research and development.  It estimated this at around \u00a310 billion a year.\r\n\r\nNot only does Britain not have reserves to draw on making us vulnerable to monopoly leaders, continuing the use of these as energy is detrimental to our ever more fragile environment.",
        "background": "Gas and petroleum companies are economically supported through tax breaks and hidden subsidies, UK is reliant on external suppliers at detriment to our immediate and global environment. Shift support to UK based renewable energy production and storage to create a stable and safe supply.",
