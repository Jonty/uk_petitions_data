Companies were still sending out Clsss 1 and 2 Drivers in those High winds to do non essential deliveries. \r\n These risked those drivers lives along with other people's.   These weather warnings are going to become more and more.   Lots of lorries were involved in accidents and ended up on their side causing injury and hold ups.   Sending out drivers in winds excess of 70mph is nothing short of dangerous.",
