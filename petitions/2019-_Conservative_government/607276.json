A legal temperature has been set for humans, why must a loyal, innocent, dependent animal be used as no more than an object (guard dog) living in conditions less than what is the minimal requirement for a human. If a low temperature is declared as dangerous to humans an animal will suffer forced torture in temperatures below those that are considered dangerous for humans.
