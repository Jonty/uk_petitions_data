        "action": "Enshrine into law the right for biological women to be called women.",
        "additional_details": "Women are being erased without their permission and the government seems to be doing nothing about it. If fringe elements wish to call themselves something else, that should be a separate issue and should not, in any way, eliminate a majority element (women). You have not put these changes to a referendum and you have not sought biological women's input.  This is a hasty and obtuse infringement of the rights of women. Are men prepared to lose their biological sex label? No, so why should women?",
        "background": "The UK government needs to protect the right of biological women to be called women, woman, female, mother, etc, in every area of life, including in verbal speak, written words, forms, online, etc. The option to choose 'women' or 'woman' should always be available to biological women.",
