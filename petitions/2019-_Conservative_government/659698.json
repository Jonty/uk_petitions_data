        "additional_details": "The current system doesn\u2019t make sense. Why pay 52 weeks rents because the resident can\u2019t afford it but not cover the extra Monday which generates another rent week? The resident is still in the same situation they were when the rent was paid. It causes disruptions for landlords who have to chase the rent and costs them extra resources that they could use in better ways to help residents. I am also blown away that I had to get to 60 to learn about this. It is time for this to be resolved forever.",
        "background": "With the cost of living crisis pushing more residents into poverty, it is unfair for that burden to be added to with not paying the extra week\u2019s rent when there are 53 Mondays in a calendar year, as the burden of the rent due lands with the residents who has to find in excess of \u00a3100.",
