        "additional_details": "Although pesticides make farming more profitable, it is the biggest threat to soil and of the biggest threats to bee populations. By 2050, it is possible bees could be entirely extinct, which could potentially extinct humans. Albert Einstein said that if the bee disappeared from the surface of the earth, humanity would have only four years of life left, as food crops would have no one to pollinate them. Organic farming is definitely plausible, banning pesticide's is the best way forward.",
        "background": "Ban all forms of pesticides, especially thiamethoxam, which the government recently legalised. This pesticide was banned across the EU for its devastating effect on bees. The government legalised it for so called 'emergency purposes' despite many experts stating the danger it has on bees.",
