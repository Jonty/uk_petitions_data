        "additional_details": "The main organisation in the UK that manages postal voting for trade union votes is Civica Election Services, formerly Electoral Reform Services. Due to the COVID-19 situation, they have sensibly suspended many of their services. Therefore, it is currently impossible for trade unions to comply with the law. \r\n\r\nWith the Prime Minister urging people to go back to work, unions need the power to ballot for strike action against employers that don't follow best practice, including social distancing.",
        "background": "Trade union votes, including elections to statutory positions and strike ballots, by law, must be carried out by postal voting. This is not currently safe or possible, so the law needs to be changed to allow online voting.",
