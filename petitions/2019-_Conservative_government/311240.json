        "additional_details": "I am watching news everyday  and I felt government is spending more time to tackle funding for public, instead of focusing mostly on NHS.\r\nEven though government have announce 330 billions of grant to business but still many are left without help, so Mr Sunak have announced for self employed people too. Still it\u2019s not covering all. And because of all this I personally feel it\u2019s waste of time and money. \r\nSo instead of making more complicating just give fixed amount to everyone.\r\nPlz Treat all same.",
        "background": "Government is making much more complicated for giving money to employees/self employed, can\u2019t they just do same amount for all people in UK? \r\n\r\nLike if they grant \u00a368 billions a month until Coronavirus crisis cleared, UK have population about 68 millions, so everyone get straight \u00a31000 every month.",
