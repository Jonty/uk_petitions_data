        "additional_details": "The British Horse Society statistics show that from November 2010 to March 2019 of the 3,737 incidents reported to them there was 315 horses killed and 43 humans killed on our roads. (NB: These are only incidents reported directly to the BHS.)\r\n\r\nThe BHS recommends that vehicles should not pass horses at more than 15mph and no closer than a car width.\r\n\r\nThere have been far too many incidents on the road including deaths both equine and human. Many of these deaths are the result of drivers driving at an inappropriate speed and too closely. The number of prosecutions at court does not reflect the seriousness of driving in such a manner.\r\n\r\nMaking rules 163 and 215 of the highway code law would give more power to the police and the courts to prosecute in these cases",
        "background": "I am calling on the Secretary of State for Transport to make the following rules in the Highway Code actual laws:\r\nSection 163 - Overtake only when it is safe and legal to do so.\r\nSection 215 - Horse riders and horse-drawn vehicles pass wide and slow max 15mph and abide to our stop slow, signal",
