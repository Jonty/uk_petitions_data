Prosecuting these offences and deciding what penalties to apply are a matter for the Crown Prosecution Service and the courts, not the Government or House of Commons.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for minimum sentences to be increased for certain offences, but it would need to be clear what offences you wanted minimum sentences to be changed for, and how you wanted these to  be increased."
