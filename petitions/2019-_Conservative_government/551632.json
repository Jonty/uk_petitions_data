The reason is simple - lives of UK citizens and indeed all life on Earth is at risk due to the unprecedented destruction being caused by fires burning there. All life on Earth is dependent on a thriving Amazon Rainforest to provide the oxygen we breathe and absorb carbon created by our greenhouse gas emissions. This is an emergency and it needs to be treated like one.",
