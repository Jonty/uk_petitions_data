African and Caribbean desendents have suffered severely. The Government should compensate the descendants of the injustice the British Empire has caused. We want the equivalent to what the politician owners were paid in to a Africa and Caribbean trust fund for mothers, children, youth with business plans, and improvements plans. This will be set up to better African and Caribbean communities in Britain.",
