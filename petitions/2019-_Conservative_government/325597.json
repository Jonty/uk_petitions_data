        "additional_details": "Horses are prey animals.  In the recent disruptive protests in London horses were either directly or indirectly hurt.  One horse threw it's rider and bolted.  One horse suffered a broken nose.  No matter how much training a horse receives, their natural instinct will be to run when they feel attacked.  They are a prey animal.  They are being exploited to this end, and it seems inappropriate to be using an animal in such frightening circumstances.",
        "background": "I would like to see the use of horses by the Police force in the UK to cease.  These animals are vulnerable to being hurt and as has recently be shown, do in fact get hurt.",
