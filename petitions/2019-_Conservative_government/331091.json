        "additional_details": "Bullying and ignorance often develops from a lack of knowledge. Requiring schools and preschools to teach under 5s about autism and other learning difficulties could help young minds understand better, helping both children with learning difficulties and children who might know someone that has them.\r\n\r\nThe Government should therefore amend the statutory framework for the early years foundation stage to require schools and preschools to educate under 5s on learning difficulties.",
        "background": "I am a proud mum of a six-year old son with autism. In our journey I realised there isn\u2019t much educating in schools to little ones about disabilities and learning difficulties. I feel in doing so at early years stage could make children understand better and prevent future bullying.",
