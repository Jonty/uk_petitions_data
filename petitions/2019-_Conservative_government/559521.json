        "additional_details": "As an art student myself - the university still believe we should be able to get the same quality of work as before the coronavirus. We are unable to even go into university on a Saturday or Sunday due to less exposure. We are art students who need to use the facilities to create samples, or for theatre students they aren\u2019t getting the full experience.\r\nWe all understand that the creative arts universities are trying their hardest to work around the COVID effects, but believe we should be refunded",
