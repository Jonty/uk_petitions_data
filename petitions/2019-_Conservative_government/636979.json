        "action": "Stop the government from requiring teachers to out trans kids to their parents",
        "additional_details": "LGBTQ+ youth deserve the same right to privacy as any other child. There tends to be a reason why a child has not told their parents about their gender identity. Wether it is simply because they are not ready or for safety reasons, it is necessary that this is recognised and respected by schools. In a culture where transphobia is so prevalent, the last thing the government should be doing is creating policies which will actively harm transgender youth.",
        "background": "Rishi Sunak has promised to give guidance on policies for trans pupils in schools. Teachers may be forced to out trans kids to their parents without consent. This will put many kids in an unsafe position. Schools should be a place trans kids can feel safe but this new guidance would do the opposite.",
