        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to ban all trading on Ebay, and all third party trading on Amazon.  These companies are contributing to the crisis by failing to prevent such blatant and callous profiteering. Many families cannot source basic items due to these practices. By removing these two well known and widely used platforms, there should be a significant reduction in these practices.",
        "background": "The UK is struggling to cope with consumer demand of basic and essential items, such as, baby formula, soap, medicine and personal protective equipment. Unscrupulous people are bulk buying key items and then attempting to sell them on Amazon and Ebay for many times their value.",
