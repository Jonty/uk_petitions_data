        "background": "Since 2000, London has had a directly elected Mayor.\r\nOur current Prime Minister, Boris Johnson is a former incumbent.\r\nThe current mayor is Sadiq Khan.\r\nWe believe that Mr Khan has used his position to promote his own political agenda to the detriment of our capital city.",
