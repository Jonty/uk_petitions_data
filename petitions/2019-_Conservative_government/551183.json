        "action": "Mandatory for all dogs to be on a leash in all public places.",
        "additional_details": "Currently the law only considers where dogs may be a threat to animals such as sheep.  However if a dog jumps up or barks at a person who is not the owner there is nothing that person can do.  Essentially therefore dogs are given a greater right to enjoy public open space than people including small children.  Whilst most dog owners are responsible, a significant minority are not.  This would remove a glaring anomaly in the law.",
        "background": "Make it illegal for dogs to be off the leash in public places where there are people.  For instance on public footpaths, rights of way, public woods etc.  Everyone has the right to walk without being barked at or jumped on.",
