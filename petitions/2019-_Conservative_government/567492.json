        "additional_details": "Gyms are an essential service in underpinning the health of the nation.\r\n \r\nActivity levels fell dramatically during 2020 lockdowns, as people could not get to their gym to exercise safely.\r\n \r\nThe government opened pubs before gyms and spent \u00a3500m on the Eat Out to Help Out scheme which encouraged unhealthy behaviour in a health crisis.\r\n \r\nThe virus is more serious for people who are overweight and unfit. The focus this time must be on health and wellbeing and getting people active.",
        "background": "We want the government to recognise the importance of gyms, health clubs, leisure centres and swimming pools in empowering people to look after their health and stay fit and for them to open first as we come out of lockdown.\r\n\r\nWe're also calling for government to fund a Work Out to Help Out scheme.",
