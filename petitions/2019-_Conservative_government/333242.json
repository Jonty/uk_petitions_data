        "additional_details": "By putting numbers next to meals it teaches the population to judge a food by its calorie content not its nutritional value. This could trigger an even bigger eating disorder epidemic as people judge the health value of food by numbers. Calories are needed to survive and this will teach people to be afraid of calories when they shouldn\u2019t be. Sugar content is much more telling of how healthy a food is. There is no evidence putting calorie content on a menu will have any benefit.",
