        "additional_details": "Through refining the education system to tackle the issue of racism, we can hopefully start building towards a future where racial injustice is overcome and where the worth of individuals are not based on their skin colour. \r\nBy exposing students to the normality of different cultures and how racism is detrimental, we can build a much more open-minded generation and create unity between racial groups. This can bring us a step closer to eradicating racism, ignorance and supremacy.",
        "background": "Include black authors e.g. Malorie Blackman and books on politicianry in GCSE English reading lists.\r\n\r\nMake the Scramble for Africa a bigger part of the History curriculum to make lessons more inclusive, diverse and less ethnocentric - without glorification of the British Empire - less savior language.",
