        "additional_details": "At present 'recovery' or 'rehabilitation' houses can be set up anywhere because these services are unregulated. The landlord doesn't have to monitor or help the people they are housing, which can mean addicts continue their habits, causing distress, nuisance, and intimidation to those living nearby and even drawing drug dealers and associated crime into the area. There are safeguarding issues associated with this for all concerned. I would like to see such services subject to CQC regulation.",

Only residential services providing health and social care services are regulated by the CQC. Regulation needs to be extended to protect the public.",
