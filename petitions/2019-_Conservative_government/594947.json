        "action": "Urgently expedite visas for Afghan Chevening Scholarship holders",
        "additional_details": "The Taliban are advancing on the Afghan capital Kabul following the withdrawal of international troops. Defence secretary Ben Wallace has called this rushed withdrawal a \"mistake\" for which we will \"probably pay the consequences.\" But those who will pay the harshest consequences are the educated young people of Afghanistan, particularly women. The Afghan Chevening Scholars are devastated and afraid. They may not live to take up their deferred places. We owe it to them to expedite this process.",
        "background": "The BBC has reported that 35 Afghan students, nearly half of them women, offered scholarships by the UK government to study here from next month have been told there is no time to process their paperwork. But the UK has a moral obligation to do everything possible to honour these offers.",
