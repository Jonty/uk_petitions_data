        "action": "Drop the legal age for getting a tattoo from 18 to 16 with parental consent",
        "additional_details": "A lot of teenagers are becoming a lot more independent around the age of sixteen, a lot more freedoms are given to those at that age. Children younger than sixteen have to have parental consent to get piercings, and as teenagers grow up a bit I believe that they should also have the opportunity to get a tattoo at sixteen with parental consent. I personally would like to get tattoos and I am still a few years away from being allowed to, I see myself as mature and would get suitable tattoos.",
        "background": "I hope for this to be spoken about in parliament, and for changes to be made to allow sixteen year olds to get tattoos with consent from a parent.",
