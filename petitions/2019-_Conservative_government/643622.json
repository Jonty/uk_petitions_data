Too many of these attacks have occurred as a result of dogs that owners appear to have bred or trained to be aggressive. However, any dog can become aggressive, depending on the circumstances. The right to use public spaces safely must trump the rights of dog owners to exercise their large pets unmuzzled.\r\n",
