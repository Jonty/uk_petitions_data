        "additional_details": "Michelle Donelan, Minister of State for Universities, has announced today (23/06) that beginning in 2021, EU/EEA citizens will no longer be eligible for home fee status enrolling in British universities. It is in the hands of government/parliament to recognise the detrimental effect this will have on the quality and standard British universities are proud to advertise. Only parliament can force a turn on this change in policy. Do not make access to higher education a privilege for the wealthy.",
        "background": "Acknowledge that EU/EEA citizens are an immense contribution to the British education sector, including in terms of students, researchers and staff. Acknowledge that British universities depend on this group. Acknowledge that British universities will not maintain high standard without this group.",
