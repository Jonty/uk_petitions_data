The logic does not hold \r\n\r\nlet's reassess like many parts of the world have and make marijuana legal",
        "background": "I want legalising marijuana to be considered in Parliament. Considering how the rest of the world is legalising this isnt it time to reassess what we believe as being detrimental to health? Along with medicinal, recreational and monatary benefits to our society there is value in considering this.",
