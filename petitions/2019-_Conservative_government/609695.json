        "action": "Go further with sanctions against Russia. Hold nothing back for 'later'.",
        "additional_details": "We hand out investment visas to many more Russians including those who have strong links to the Russian government. They invade Ukraine. We put tiny sanctions in place saying we need to hold something back in case they go into the rest of Ukraine. Now they have begun a full scale invasion and we are still holding back. Once this happens, that's it for Ukraine. No more freedom. And it won't end there with Russia.",
        "background": "To impose more sanctions on Russia even if to do so would mean an economic 'hit' for the UK. Do not hold anything back for later. There is no later for Ukraine. This is it. Do more to ensure other countries back 'evicting' Russia from SWIFT banking system. Include energy arrangements in sanctions.",
