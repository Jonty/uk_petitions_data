        "additional_details": "Universal credit payments will be made after Christmas this year as there is a bank holiday. Unless an individuals regular Universal Credit payments are made prior to 29th of every month, they will not receive said payment in time for the Christmas season. This will leave many people struggling during Christmas, on top of the stress of the current situation we're in. I plead with the government to revise this and make changes for the people who need it most.",
        "background": "As the Covid-19 pandemic has put millions out of jobs, many individuals are left to survive on Universal Credit alone. However the Government has not taken into account the needs of the public at Christmas.",
