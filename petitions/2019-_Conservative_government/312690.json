        "additional_details": "We're calling for a review of NMC registration fees during this crisis period - either cancelled or at the very least suspended during this period. Every year our medical staff have to pay just to practice - they should not be having to pay for the privilege of saving our lives during the coronavirus crisis. We're essentially sending our underpaid and overworked troops to battle on the frontline of our NHS - let's show them the respect they deserve and cancel their fees.",
        "background": "Our medical staff have to pay at least \u00a3120 every year in registration fees. They are still being requested even now during the Covid-19 crisis, when they are our frontline troops. We're asking them to risk their health and lives, with minimal PPE, whilst paying for the privilege of saving ours.",
