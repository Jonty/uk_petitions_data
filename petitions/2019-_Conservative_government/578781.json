        "action": "Impose sanctions on China for their treatment of practitioners of Falun Gong",
        "additional_details": "In 1999, about 100 million people were practising Falun Gong in China so Communist leader Jiang Zemin gave the order to eradicate it. Millions have been detained or imprisoned. Over 100,000 have been tortured or abused in custody, and thousands have been killed merely because of their faith.\r\n\r\nIn 2020 an Independent Tribunal, chaired by Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, concluded that Falun Gong practitioners were being killed for their organs in China and that this practice continues today.",
        "background": "Falun Gong is a traditional practice teaching truthfulness, compassion and tolerance. Falun Gong practitioners continue to face human rights violations in China. We urge the UK Government to oppose these violations by any effective means (e.g. Global Human Rights or Magnitsky-style sanctions).",
