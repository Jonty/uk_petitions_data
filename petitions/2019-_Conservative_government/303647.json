        "action": "No further rent payment from students living in university halls.",
        "additional_details": "The desicion made by universities to move every aspect of university academia to online teaching was encouraged by the government. Most students will be leaving halls as it's safer to stay with family or carers as support will be provided if anyone was to catch COVID-19.\r\nTaking into account that the majority of First Year students live in halls of residence, a heightened risk of exposure to COVID-19 remains. It is therefore practical and sensible for students to move out of halls.",
        "background": "Due to the closing of universities, all residential hall payments for rent from the date of university closure to the end of contact date should be suspended. Although it has not been made compulsory to leave, there is no reason for students to remain in halls if they are unable to attend lectures.",
