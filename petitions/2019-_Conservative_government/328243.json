        "additional_details": "The fees should be reduced to a more manageable fee, based on average wages for the immigrant population. It is unjust to have this expectation when there are already so many barriers that someone who wants to move to the UK face already, and this fee seems unnecessarily high with this in consideration.",
        "background": "Non-EU immigrants are expected to pay almost \u00a33000 per person to apply for Indefinite Leave To Remain or to extend their stay in the United Kingdom. \r\nThis amounts to \u00a312,000 for a family of 4. This is a completely unrealistic and unjust expectation and should be reduced.",
