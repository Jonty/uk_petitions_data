The survey also found 22% of adults who prior to Covid-19 had no mental health issues now possessed poor or very poor mental health. We need to address this ASAP as we face an impending economic downturn that will severely worsen the issue.",

Also we should aim to increase the number of mental health professionals therefore reducing waiting times & we should include more MH discourse in the national curriculum.",
