        "action": "Reduce the 2022 GCSE syllabus to make it fairer for all students",
        "additional_details": "Some children have not been able to work because of living conditions, family issues, stress or anxiety, the lack of a working environment, the loss of a family member or a mix of these factors. These are factors they cannot control and so it is not their fault if they have not progressed adequately with their learning. If they are set a full syllabus GCSE and are aiming for the same grades as students who have been in perfect conditions, they will be at a severe disadvantage.",
        "background": "Most students who will be taking their GCSEs in year 10 will have had over 5 months of home learning by the time they take their exams, with many of them not being able to work properly in their circumstances, some making none at all. It would be unfair to set full syllabus GCSEs to everyone.",
