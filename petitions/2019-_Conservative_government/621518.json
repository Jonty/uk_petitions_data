        "additional_details": "Currently, this loan can be a maximum of \u00a311,826. This means many Master's students can only afford to cover their fees. If they are unable to find work or cannot work due to course demands, they can be left with nothing towards living costs. We believe this is unacceptable, and will prevent many students, particularly from the working class, from accessing Master's level study. This loan should be increased to a minimum of at least \u00a318,000 to cover fees, accommodation and living costs.",
        "background": "Postgraduate study should be accessible to all, regardless of background or financial situation. But the amount of Postgraduate Master's Loans is insufficient for many students, especially working class students, and can be a significant barrier to them continuing onto this level of study.",
