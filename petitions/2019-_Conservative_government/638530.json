        "additional_details": "Allocate teacher training days to give training and lessons to teachers on how to communicate and respond to children with ADHD and autism. This will give teachers an understanding of learning needs and help to teach the child to succeed and learn in their own unique way. Not having their educational needs met can cause frustration for the child, teachers and parents.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to make training on ADHD and autism a mandatory part of the teacher training. We believe too many people see the stigma of ADHD and autism, classing ADHD children as 'naughty' and autism isn't fully understood leading to children not having educational needs met.",
