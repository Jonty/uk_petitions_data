        "additional_details": "We are in a cost of living crisis and fossil fuel companies have recorded record profits. They do not need government support especially when people are struggling to pay rising energy costs.\r\n\r\nWe also have a climate emergency and giving money to fossil fuel companies will surely reduce our ability to hit net zero by 2050. We should not be subsidising polluters while trying to reduce our carbon footprint.\r\n\r\nThe money could be better spent improving health care, schools or even combating climate change.",
        "background": "The UK is reported to have given over \u00a313bn in subsidies to fossil fuel companies since the Paris agreement in 2015, including \u00a310bn in tax reliefs for exploration and production. This is the third highest in the world, after India and China. These need to stop, and the money put to better use.",
