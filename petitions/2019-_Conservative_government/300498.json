        "additional_details": "The Supreme Court has overturned decisions of a political nature. I believe these actions represent a dangerous and undemocratic means of carrying out political action without any democratic mandate or control. The cases over our efforts to leave the EU made this danger perfectly clear and raised concerns regarding Parliamentary Sovereignty. We are not a US style republican system and do not practice the doctrine of separation of powers and so the Supreme Court should be reincorporated back into Parliament.",
