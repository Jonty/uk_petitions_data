If you are subject to proceedings the prosecution has access to a huge pool of money drawn from such funds. The accused does not. If the defence body refuses to cover the accused has to fund their own defence. If found guilty then the accused faces huge poverty especially in high profile cases where there has been a miscarriage of justice.perjury or framing. Charities must not cause poverty.",
        "background": "Given the current economic crisis, the government should review the charitable status of bodies which have avoided taxes. The regulatory bodies for professions allied to medicine have avoided paying VAT and other taxes by becoming charities. However, their charitable status should be reviewed.",
