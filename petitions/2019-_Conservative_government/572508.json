        "additional_details": "We are asking the government to stop discriminating against those with religious beliefs that prohibit co habitation. Marriage is more than a celebratory social event but a rite of passage. Without legal marriage many couples are not able to start a family, live together, reduce their living costs or move forward with their lives. While it is simple to calculate the financial loss from cancellation of weddings, the emotional distress and disruption to individuals\u2019 lives is immeasurable.",

Every aspect of our lives has been put on hold indefinitely. The uncertainty of the wait has become intolerable. Can provision be made for religious couples who can\u2019t cohabitate.",
