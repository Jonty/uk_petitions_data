        "additional_details": "Rudi Guiliani was awarded the Honour of KBE while Mayor of New York and following the 9/11 attacks. Since then he has shown disregard for democratic processes. He has called, without evidence, the recent elections a fraud. He is stoking racial and community tensions which have a potential to lead to violence. He has stated peaceful \"Black Lives Matter\" protesters are secretly anarchists who will steal the US Government. His actions undermine the due process of fairness and democracy.",
        "background": "Parliament should debate the role of Rudi Guiliani in undermining the democratic process in the US Elections. A debate will show the UK determination to maintain a free and fair democracy. Any decision on the revocation of the honour should be forwarded to the Honours Forefeiture Committee.",
