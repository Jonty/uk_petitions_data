        "additional_details": "Individuals and businesses that operate to support the health of British citizens have invested huge amounts of time, thought and money to re-open in a Covid secure way following the previous 'lockdown. These businesses perform a vital service to citizens, particularly in the times we are living through. \r\n\r\nThe health and well-being of all citizens, young and old should be a priority and to this end, businesses that can perform this function in a Covid safe way should be allowed to remain open.",
        "background": "Allow people to visit health practitioners and participate in sports in a Covid secure way. \r\n\r\nThe continual vacillation and imposition of rules that may end up doing more harm than good to the general population is unhelpful. Rather focus on sensible guidelines that can be adhered to longer term.",
