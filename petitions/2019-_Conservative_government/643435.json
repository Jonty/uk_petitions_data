        "additional_details": "Artificial grass products adversely affect our environment; causing flooding, heating, water pollution, waste, and harm to biodiversity.\r\n\r\nCurrent policy prefers to 'help people and organisations make the right choice rather than legislating on such matters', yet the industry continues to grow. \r\nIn artificial grass, we have a clear example of 'avoidable plastic waste'. Surely, there can be no justification for delay of a ban. \r\n\r\nFailure to address this issue now will be an historic one.",
        "background": "We remind the government of their 25 Year Environment Plan, which  ''sets out our ambition to eliminate all avoidable plastic waste''.\r\n\r\nYet again, in response to sinister climate and biodiversity trends, we request a change in current policy and a ban on the use artificial grass in gardens.",
