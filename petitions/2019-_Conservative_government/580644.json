        "action": "Make \"box-office\" data from on-demand entertainment public in the UK",
        "additional_details": "The digital space is becoming less of a public space and more of a private, walled garden, without any regulation on transparency or validity on information reported. As digital entertainment becomes more entrenched behind private platforms, the current public \"box-office\" data from cinemas and TV becomes less accurate with the risk of skewing claimed revenue measurements. Since COVID started, all \"box-office\" data recording has stopped while video on-demands habits have boomed.",
        "background": "We should establish a \"standard of data sharing around digital entertainment consumption\" (e.g. purchases/views) where all platforms delivering on-demand media to UK households, like Netflix and Disney+, can report the same metrics on how specific media products fare and better inform the UK public",
