Dogs have become status symbols and are too easily moved on or disposed of into the wrong hands.\r\n\r\nWe feel that introducing an education and licensing system would help to eliminate some of the issues we face every day.\r\n\r\nOwners and their companions would be recorded and be legally required to transfer ownership, the system could record what breeds, how many etc each individual owns and where.\r\n\r\n#responsibilitybeforerescue",
        "background": "Introduce a new dog license system. The system should include education before licensing, similar to a driving license, including experience days and/or a test of competence for new owners and carry endorsements for bad ownership. This could also be linked via the microchip databases.",
