        "additional_details": "As one of the circa 76,000 voters in the current Speaker's constituency, I am not fully represented in Parliament. My MP cannot speak or vote on any issues be they local, national or international. This is clearly a case of disenfranchisement of the 76,000 voters in the Speaker's constituency and will continue unchanged for the remaining time that my MP stays in the Speaker role. Once appointed Speaker an MP should cease to be a constituency MP, and a by-election held to replace them.",
        "background": "The Speaker of the House has to be impartial and cannot have any party political affiliations. He/she cannot speak or vote in the commons. This means the Speakers constituents are not truly represented in Parliament. This is undemocratic and should be remedied.",
