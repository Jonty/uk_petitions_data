        "additional_details": "In this time of coronavirus we have realised just how essential health workers and the nhs is to us as a country. I believe that in order to recognise their achievements and the mammoth tasks they pull off and the amount of effort they put in everyday, which has been highlighted by the coronavirus, they should have an increase in pay. The work and tasks that they carry out is truly phenomenal and they put their social lives and sleep schedule on hold for the well being of others that they do not know",
        "background": "We want the government to increase the wages all of types of healthcare workers by 25% at least. The proposed 27\u00a3 per day is measly considering they put their lives on the line everyday and have sacrificed so much of their own lives for the well being of others.",
