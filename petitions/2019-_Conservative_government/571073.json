Centre-assessed-grades (teacher assessment) backed up with course work evidence enables all students to have an equal chance of reaching their earned grade.",
        "background": "This petition calls on the government to scrap the planned use of 'mini-assessments' and instead revert to a system of centre-assessed-grades. These could be backed up with evidence and coursework from the students' entire learning period.",
