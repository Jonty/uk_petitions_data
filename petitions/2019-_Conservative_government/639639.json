        "additional_details": "We believe Britain is in an increasingly vulnerable position. Dwindling recruitment in the armed forces, declining police numbers, rising crime, and illegal migration on an unprecedented level has made it clear that a British Volunteer Guard is necessary. Harnessing the skills of veterans and civilians, they will be on call to help police maintain law and order. TA centres and Army Cadet Huts could be appropriated for use by a British Volunteer Guard. We believe this scheme will lead to a safer Britain.",
        "background": "We want the Government to establish a British Volunteer Guard which can assist Police and other services, comprising of military veterans and civilians whose skills and experiences can help maintain law and order in the country, and help to ensure the protection of the populace.",
