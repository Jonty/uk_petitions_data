        "additional_details": "The mental health, safety and well-being of HE students should be a Government priority. Student engagement, retention and success should be another. Both are indisputably linked to the duty of care students receive.\r\n\r\nA duty of care already exists for staff, and for students under the age of 18 in HE. There should be parity in duty of care for all members of the HE community.\r\n\r\nThis is not a petition for \u2018in loco parentis\u2019 or for duplication of the NHS. We only seek parity and legislative clarity on duty of care for all students.",
        "background": "No general statutory duty of care exists in HE. Yet, a duty of care is owed to students, and the Government should legislate for this. HE providers should know what their duty is. Students must know what they can expect. Parents expect their children to be safe at university.",
