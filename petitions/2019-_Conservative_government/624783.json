        "additional_details": "The DVLA must write new specific codes and rules for the electrification of classic cars that resolves their current conflict with government environmental policies and so stop the twisting of old rules to make them fit this new issue. \r\nThis new stand-alone code should provide clear guidance for vehicles in the process of being converted, guidance on how to avoid or reverse registration refusals, and encourage the review of recent cases like 96628439 and others in the light of the new rules.",
        "background": "DVLA rules used on converting cars to electric power are outdated and act to prevent conversions, act to remove converted cars from the road, and if a conversion requires any 'modifications', as small as holes drilled in the boot to secure a battery, they require a full IVA test. This must change.",
