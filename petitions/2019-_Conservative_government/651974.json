A week for the foreign nationals will get the world to realise that uk is an inclusive and multinational multicultural society. This will be embraced worldwide and uk will be at the forefront. The divide that is growing can be overcome when foreign nationals realise they are appropriated. A lot of demonising rhetoric on immigrants has fuelled conflicts and this will help build bridges",
        "background": "Set aside a week for foreign nationals honouring them of their contribution to the uk economy. The uk government is aware how much help they get from people from all over the world who have come to live and work in United Kingdom. As a lot of local people do not realise what the foreign person does",
