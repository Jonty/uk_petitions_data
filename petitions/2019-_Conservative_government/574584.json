        "additional_details": "The Government introduced new penalties for sitting in the middle lane from 2013, however it clearly isn\u2019t enforced enough as people continue to be selfish and lazy and commit this offence. The problem with hogging the middle lane is that is causes so much back log, delays and sometimes accidents. On occasion drivers are forced to manoeuvre over 3 lanes to overtake one selfish driver which can be dangerous but undertaking is also illegal so people have no choice.",
        "background": "Driving now on the motorway is a painful experience as so many drivers still sit in any lane they feel like, this petition is to get the government to put up signs to tell people to \u2018Keep left unless overtaking\u2019, instead of \u2018don\u2019t litter\u2019 and \u2018don\u2019t drink and drive\u2019 signs.",
