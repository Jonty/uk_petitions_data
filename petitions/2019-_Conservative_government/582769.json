        "additional_details": "Executive powers were introduced to allow the government to take rapid emergency action to deal with the Covid pandemic.\r\n\r\nWe are no longer in an emergency.  With high vaccine uptake, there are no circumstances under which the government will need to take rapid emergency actions.  There is no reason why Parliament cannot be consulted on every action, without any unreasonable delay.\r\n\r\nIn a democracy, executive powers demand exceptional circumstances.  We are no longer in exceptional circumstances.",
        "background": "Though the pandemic continues, there is no longer any emergency.  The government should rescind its executive powers and return to democracy immediately.  Parliament should resume proper oversight of legislation and resume its normal business.  There is no longer any place for executive powers.",
