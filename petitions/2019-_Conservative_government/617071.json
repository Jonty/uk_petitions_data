        "additional_details": "The trees provide shade combating the urban heat-island effect.\r\n\r\nThey absorb C02 and felling them means the loss of carbon sinks combating climate change. \r\n\r\nDecrease in air quality close to the airport.\r\n\r\nPeople living in the town centre will be affected by noise pollution.\r\n\r\nA lack of green spaces has a negative effect on people's mental health. \r\n\r\nIt will cause a huge loss of biodiversity and habitat for wildlife.\r\n\r\nWe are challenging this development on the grounds of RBC's own Local Plan.",
