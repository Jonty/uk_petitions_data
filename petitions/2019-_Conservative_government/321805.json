        "additional_details": "The Government needs to extend student loans to cover the summer months because many parents cannot afford to support their children financially during the current pandemic. Students mostly rely on summer jobs and internships that have mostly been cancelled due to COVID-19. With student loans issuing their final payment in May many are left wondering how they will support themselves until their next payment in September or at it's earliest late in August. Students should not be left vulnerable.",
        "background": "The government needs to extend support to full time students who are not eligible to apply for universal credit and who are dependent on student loans to survive. Students are amongst the most likely to suffer from the lockdown as many rely on seasonal jobs for income during the summer months.",
