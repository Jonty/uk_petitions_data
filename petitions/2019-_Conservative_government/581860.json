        "additional_details": "The figure realised recently on the percentage of women who have experienced sexual harassment is not limited by age, nor to just harassment but violence and assault. Giving women the ability to protect themselves in a way that is safe will allow women to protect their bodies without the use of weapons. Teaching it secondary schools in the assigned P.E lessons will not remove or waste any time they have learning but instead teach them vital life skills whilst still providing exercise.",
        "background": "Teaching self defence in assigned P.E lessons will give women the ability to protect themselves. As we are not allowed to carry defence weapons in the uk, teach self defence within P.E syllabus to help women feel more comfortable and more able to protect themselves. Pay for a tutor to do this in P.E",
