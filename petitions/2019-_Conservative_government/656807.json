Despite bail conditions & orders such as non-molestation orders being in place the police can find it difficult to charge people whilst on bail for further offences or enforce bail conditions such as where they\u2019re ordered to reside as it can be difficult to prove. This can result in an increased risk for victims or for victims to drop charges or return to an abusive relationship.",
