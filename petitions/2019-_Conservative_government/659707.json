        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the total abolition of leasehold ownership in the UK, either by amending the current bill or by creating a new one.\r\n \r\nLeaseholders are left exposed to service charge hikes, ground rents hikes, refusals by some freeholders to extend their leases etc. Many feel they are trapped in flats they cannot sell because of the conditions that come with leasehold ownership.\r\n \r\nAbolishing leasehold ownership would liberate all leaseholders from this feudal type of ownership. We propose doing so with an eighteen-month notice period, allowing investments in freeholds to be detached in good time.\r\n",
