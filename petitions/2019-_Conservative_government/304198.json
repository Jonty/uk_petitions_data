        "additional_details": "If exams are allowed to go ahead as normal, groups of students will be put at a disadvantage. High-risk students may have to choose between their safety or their education, coming in to exam centres despite social contact putting them in danger. Children who have lost loved ones due to COVID-19 will be harmed by stress caused by exams. A-Levels/GCSEs should be pushed back to after the peak of this pandemic - students can be assumed to have their predicted grades until exams can be carried out.",
        "background": "The current pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus is set to only get worse as time goes on, with the peak due to hit exam season at the current trajectory. Allowing exams to continue poses a range of health problems, and allows the most at-risk students to fall behind.",
