        "additional_details": "The financial support being provided to furloughed workers and the self-employed is well in excess of that provided under the universal credit system. Many jobseekers are also ineligible for universal credit because of their relationship status. Jobseekers who will re-enter the workforce once the lockdown is over should be being provided support equivalent to that for furloughed workers, based on their earnings and tax contribution history.",
        "background": "The Government\u2019s instruction to 'stay home' has prevented many jobseekers from seeking and gaining employment in their fields. Those who can demonstrate strong earning and taxpaying histories should receive support equivalent to furloughed workers, at least until the end of the lockdown period.",
