From day 1 you are given the impression your body can't possibly produce enough. Then, over time, because these topups get in the way of the delecate supply and demand relationship, the mothers milk really does reduce. By week 2 most mums give up completely. Formula companies win. Babies lose out. Depression is up. So is obesity....",
        "background": "when women give birth, they immediately begin a new and crucial journey into breastfeeding. The NHS and the WHO state breastfeeding is recommended. Yet only a third of UK babies receive milk from their mother. This is because we are offered formula in maternity wards as \"top up\". This needs to stop",
