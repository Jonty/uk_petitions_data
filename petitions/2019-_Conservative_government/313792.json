        "additional_details": "There are lots of key workers out there on the front line during this pandemic, many workers are part time, single parents who claim Universal credit to help pay their rent, council tax, bills and food. Big companies are now giving their workers a \"thank you\" bonus to say thank you for working hard during this difficult time but sadly these people who claim U/C will have this taken away as it will be counted as income and deducted from their entitlement. These workers should keep their bonus' during the lock down.",

Many key workers are risking their lives going to work to keep this country going and bonuses are a great way to show appreciation for what they are doing.",
