Allowing pets could save an animal from its uncertain fate and in tern reduce pressures of over crowding with rescue centres.\r\nPets are part of the family and should not determine the opportunity or outcome of securing a home. \r\nI\u2019ve recently taken a cat into our rescue for a young lady who was forced to live in her car as she couldn\u2019t find a vacant property that allowed pets.",
