Puppy farms and cruelty to animals is an offence, but breeding puppies to have tubes in their throat and chemicals pumped into the stomach is legal for research? \r\nThese animals are intelligent, sensitive, social and loyal and are suffering horrific testing and surgeries that are of little value to humans. The results and unreliable and the testing on animals outdated.",
