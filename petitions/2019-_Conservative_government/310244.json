        "additional_details": "Students graduating this year have missed a total of an entire semester\u2019s worth of access to on-campus study materials and to in-person teaching due to Covid-19. Students are not receiving the level of education they were led to expect at the beginning of their degrees due to the complications brought by self-isolation. It is unreasonable, therefore, to ask for the same amount in repayments after our contractual agreements with our universities have been frustrated in this way.",
        "background": "We would like the Government to write-off 1/6 of our student loan repayments, to take into account the lost second semester of the 19/20 academic year.",
