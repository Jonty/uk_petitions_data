No-one enters into a union expecting it to break up, yet one third of them do, with many individuals losing family contributions and savings generated before marriage. This change in law will protect families by allowing parents to make financial sacrifices to help their children and will encourage individuals to further their education, careers & business without fear of later loss.",
