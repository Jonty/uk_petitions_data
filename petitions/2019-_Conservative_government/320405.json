        "action": "Make Year 10 & 12 students the first to go back instead of Primary Schools",
        "additional_details": "During Boris\u2019 speech, he gave details that primary school would return first, and this makes sense in part. However, I speak for many students across the country who would prefer year 10 and 12 to return first, as this is our final years and is crucial for our future. If you also return primary school first, it will be extremely hard to monitor their health and hygiene (they constantly touch surfaces and each other). Yet, older students understand this, therefore we will take safer precautions.",
        "background": "We want you to reconsider your option of returning primary school students first, instead returning Year 10 & 12, who have crucial exams next year that will affect their future lives permanently. They are also more aware of how to stay safe from getting Corona, consequently less spread will occur.",
