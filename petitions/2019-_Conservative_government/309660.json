Building sites can have hundreds of people working at any given time and employers are not adhering to the safety guidelines. My husband is working on building sites where there are no hand sanitisers available, no gloves, no running water. Social distancing is impossible. Public are calling the police to the sites. Close!",

Trade specific businesses should also cease trading if work is non-essential to the situation.",
