        "additional_details": "Despite declaring a climate emergency in 2019 the UK Covid-19 recovery plan has an overly strong focus on construction and development at the expense of protecting the natural environment.\r\nPolls show a public preference for a change to the economy and a greener focus, which was promised but quickly forgotten. \r\nThe UK has failed to meet the majority of climate action targets. \r\nIt is our responsibility to protect the natural environment, especially after it has provided us with so many benefits.",
        "background": "The government must enforce stronger environmental protection within plans for Covid-19 recovery. It must implement a green focus and invest in active travel, energy efficiency, renewable energy, nature tourism, wildlife and environmental conservation, and other green projects.",
