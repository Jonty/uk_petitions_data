        "additional_details": "We believe that the approach taken by the UK and other Western governments to sanction Russia and to send weapons to Ukraine has not brought and will not bring any tangible benefits to ordinary people in Ukraine. Instead, we believe that a position of neutrality will bring the conflict closer to its end, saving many Ukrainian lives and with many benefits for the people in Donbas, Crimea and in other regions who just want to carry on with their lives peacefully.",
        "background": "We want the Government to adopt neutrality on the Ukraine-Russia conflict, to remove any sanctions on Russia and to stop sending weapons to Ukraine. We ask the UK Government to be proactive and facilitate an immediate ceasefire and peace negotiations by taking an equidistant stance in the conflict.",
