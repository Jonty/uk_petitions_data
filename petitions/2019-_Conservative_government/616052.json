Children are susceptible to both family and peer influences and marketing campaigns. Children\u2019s charity BigDeal say that if children accompany peers and parents who are gambling, the chances are higher that the child will develop a gambling problem themselves. If we remove children from these situations we help to safeguard them from future addiction and harm.",
