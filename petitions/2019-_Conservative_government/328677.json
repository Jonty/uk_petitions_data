As a current year old 12 I am currently missing one of the biggest summers of my life and with festivals like Glastonbury canceled we are missing a large chunk of our teenage hood. Along with this if our exams are pushed back into the summer of 2021 it won\u2019t be possible for people like myself to attend Glastonbury and other festivals as we will be working extremely hard to get the best grade possible in our exams!",

Another option like using work throughout the course of the two years or giving more options of topics in the exam papers must be strongly considered.",
