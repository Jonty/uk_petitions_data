        "additional_details": "Overlook and fix the plans already in place. Forming a concrete protocol for when a child opens up about these events. Making sure they are in the best environment for learning, they are in a good mental state and make sure they are not having to repeat their story. \r\n\r\nThis should be mandatory without a court ruling as a large quantity of cases are either dismissed or add to distress in the mind of the child. None of these rulings would act as punishment to the rapist as it does not concern them.",
        "background": "The current system for victim support is incredibly stress filled and complicated. It is traumatic to have to repeat your story constantly just for certain agency's to believe you. Funding of tuition for survivors who leave school also adds to this stress. As well as the CAMHS system in general.",
