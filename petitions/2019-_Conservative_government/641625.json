We cannot afford to use the facilities being built on our local parks and we need this space for the residents to enjoy days out with children that are free of charge. We don\u2019t want a huge 3G pitch, car parks next to a children\u2019s play area, flood lights, anti social behaviour from football hooligans. We have 12 pitches in the area, and hardly any green space. Please help.",

We weren\u2019t consulted as locals and we have very few green spaces available within preston. Please help us preserve these important spaces for our children and the local families of preston",
