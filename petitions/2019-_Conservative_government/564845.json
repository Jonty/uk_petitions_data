The metric system is much easier to understand and also in-line with nearly all countries in the world. This will be especially important in a post-Brexit UK as it should allow easier trade with countries throughout the world. It should also be beneficial to teach children only 1 system.\r\n \r\nA useful website to learn more about the metric system and why it should be used fully is https://ukma.org.uk/",

The Government should require that road signage use the metric system, and imperial measures are not required to be taught as part of the curriculum.",
