        "additional_details": "I am starting this petition because I have recently noticed that people are riding electric scooters really fast on the pavement, and loop around people. I have a fear of injury, because they can crash very easily into someone. I think that these should be forbidden on pavements, but not on roads. I have once witnessed a person on an electric scooter get close to someone, and they were ready to crash. If people want to ride this, they can, but I strongly discourage this on pavements.",
        "background": "I want the Government/Parliament to ban electric scooters on pavements because anyone can easily crash, especially when riding at high speeds. I think the electric scooter is a new phase of technology, that shouldn\u2019t be used on pavements, but can be used on main roads. This will be better for y\u2019all.",
