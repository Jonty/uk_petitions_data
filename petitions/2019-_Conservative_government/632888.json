        "additional_details": "The recent earthquake that hit Syria in February 2023 worsened the suffering Syrians face everyday, as medical and financial aid provisions are prohibited under the imposed sanctions. Huge amounts of humanitarian aid that are sent to Syria do not reach the Syrian people. Ultimately, it is civilians who suffer from the resulting lack of investment in basic services and infrastructure. Syrians\u2019 efforts to re-build their lives post-war and natural disaster are hampered by these sanctions.",
        "background": "Sanctions on Syria, imposed by the UK, have led to Syria\u2019s isolation from trade and aid entities. This is having a devastating impact on ordinary Syrian citizens. It is time for the UK government to act in this humanitarian crisis by lifting the economic sanctions on Syria.",
