        "additional_details": "The company which has been handing out free school meals is blatantly making a profit. They are giving children and families a tiny amount of food to last them ten days. The food they are handing out is no where near \u00a330. Its absolutely disgusting. The uk government should be ashamed of themselves. This job of handing out food should be given to a truly independent unbiased company and should be to the full amount of \u00a330. Prime minister Johnson should also issue an apology for this heinous act.",
        "background": "Get rid of this company which provides free school meals and provide proper food to those receiving free school meals. The food these children are receiving is not anywhere near the \u00a330 benchmark. A public apology by Prime Minister Johnson should also be issued to all those you are suffering.",
