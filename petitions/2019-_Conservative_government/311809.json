I know that some will not be able to afford care if we trade our NHS to American style, for profit system.  It comes down to this,  do I get heat, food or pay for my families healthcare.  Medicines would skyrocket! Some people in America go without their medicines due to cost, or don\u2019t take the prescribed doses to make it last longer. I\u2019d rather fund the NHS by simply charging people that misuse the NHS. \u00a325 for missing appointments, anyone that uses the NHS more than 5 times in a month pay \u00a35 after that. And similar protocol for A&E.",
