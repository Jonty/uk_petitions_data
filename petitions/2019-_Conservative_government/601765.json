        "action": "Remove Clause 9 from the Nationality and Borders Bill.",
        "additional_details": "British citizenship should not be a status that can be removed at the whim of the government. If an individual is granted citizenship then they should not have to fear their citizenship being randomly removed, and being forced to leave to a country they have never been to before or have not been to since childhood. This bill will disproportionately affect Muslim people and children of immigrants despite having legal citizenship, as similar bills have already been used to hurt these groups.",
        "background": "We demand the government removes Clause 9 from the Nationality and Borders Bill, which allows citizens to have their citizenship removed without notice and with decreased ability to appeal (in reference to subsection 5A and 5B).",
