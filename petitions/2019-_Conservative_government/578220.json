        "additional_details": "The NHS workers have been facing some of the toughest working conditions ever experienced in the history of our NHS over the past year.  They have kept the system going against the odds. Clapping for our NHS heroes and painting pretty rainbows will not give them the financial support they need and deserve.  We should give a more tangible expression of our rightful pride in having a national health service that is made up of such dedicated and stoic people.",
        "background": "Let\u2019s give NHS workers more disposable cash through a tax system that gives them a higher level of tax free income before income tax kicks in, to help boost the low pay rise being offered and as an acknowledgment of our gratitude as a nation for them going above and beyond during the pandemic.",
