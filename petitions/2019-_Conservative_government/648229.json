        "additional_details": "We believe current practise for assessing those with chronic illnesses and pain is not adequate and assessors often don't acknowledge the struggle we face on a daily basis just trying to manage symptoms and cope in life. We believe that PIP assessors require greater knowledge and training around lifelong chronic illness and pain, including how to take into properly account proof of medical conditions and information from doctors and specialists.",
        "background": "The Government should ensure that PIP assessors are fully trained in chronic illness and pain. The current process for PIP can be stressful for those living with chronic illness and pain, and the stress caused by the process can have a profound effect on people's conditions and lives.",
