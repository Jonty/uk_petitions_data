        "additional_details": "The United Kingdom has many varying issues facing it\u2019s people. To continue to prop up an outmoded, anti-democratic, bloated, culturally embarrassing, and outright harmful institution sets us as the last seat of regressive and repugnant colonial imperial culture. We must leave the shadow of the Empire once and for all if we as a nation are to have any hope of a healthy future.",
        "background": "The government must transition away from an institutional monarchy to a true democratic republic. There are no substantive reasons why this nation should prop up such an institution when it does not serve any real unique benefit to the nation.",
