The result of this is that parents are no longer being informed at all if their child has had contact with a positive covid case during the school day. Parents don\u2019t have access to the class lists and contact details that the school has, so the school is best placed to inform parents of close contacts.",

This has resulted in some parents not being informed at all about positive cases that their child has been in contact with in school. Schools must resume the role of contact tracing.",
