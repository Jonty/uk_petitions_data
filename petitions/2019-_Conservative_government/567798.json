        "additional_details": "We are now nearly a year on from the outbreak of COVID-19 & still continuing to keep our borders open with potential cases and new strains coming into the country. In September, 2 people travelled from South Africa to the UK with a new strain of COVID-19 which has now spread around the country,  Sir Patrick Vallance has advised it might have some effect on the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness. The UK is now in a nationwide lockdown, we must close the borders until we have our own country under control.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to close the borders of the United Kingdom for all but essential travel excluding imports of supplies and medical equipment. The UK are repeating the same mistakes we've seen the UK Government make throughout this crisis & now we have a new strain of COVID-19 as a result.",
