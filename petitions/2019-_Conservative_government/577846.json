        "action": "End the freeze on fuel duty and raise it to match or exceed inflation",
        "additional_details": "The predominant effect of the freeze is to keep the cost of petrol and diesel used in vehicles down. This reduces the incentive for motorists to switch to electric vehicles, & comparatively penalises users of public transport, who have still faced regular fare increases throughout the freeze.\r\n\r\nIn a time when climate change is a more serious issue than ever before, it is simply irresponsible of our government to adopt policies which discourage adoption of far more environmentally friendly modes of travel.",
        "background": "The current freeze on fuel duty - of which 2021 is the eleventh consecutive year - should be abolished.\r\n\r\nFuel duty should be increased to match, or exceed, inflation over the past eleven years - in other words, it should be equal to or greater than what it would be had it never been frozen.",
