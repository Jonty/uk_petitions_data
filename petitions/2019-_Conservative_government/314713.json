        "additional_details": "Because it\u2019s not good hygiene in this environment for joggers to be heavy breathing around people in such close proximity. It\u2019s also not good for kids on scooters and bikes and families taking up whole foot paths when they could easily go out as two people. Not whole families and dogs. Lockdown isn\u2019t a family day out to the park.",
        "background": "Tell joggers they must wear face masks as too many don\u2019t respect social distancing and are huffing and puffing or spitting near people. \r\n\r\nStop families going out in groups of more than 2. Kids don\u2019t do social distancing, they bump into anyone, climb over everything and take up whole foot paths.",
