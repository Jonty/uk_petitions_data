        "additional_details": "I feel that the government should allow kids to wear their own chose of clothing as teachers can identify students by their clothing (giving teachers a taste of what students are like.) Children should not be wearing uniform to make them feel like factory workers. If government allows this, students would also be more excited to participate in school as they would feel more comfortable then wearing a suit.",
        "background": "Students should have the freedom of expressing them selfs. Wearing uniform takes away their unique identity. Students should be allowed to wear clothing they feel comfortable in and clothing that makes them feel like them selfs instead of feeling like office workers.",
