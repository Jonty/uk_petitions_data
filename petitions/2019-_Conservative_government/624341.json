        "additional_details": "We need to make educating teenagers about cancers they are at greatest risk of a priority, in a bid to save more lives.\r\n \r\nTesticular cancer prevalence is high in teenagers but caught early (stage 0-1) has a 98% cure rate. Many younger males eg. 18yrs have little or no knowledge of testicular cancer and therefore no understanding of the importance of getting help if something changes in that region of their body. This can lead to a late stage diagnosis and this is where lives are being lost when there would be a much higher chance of survival if caught earlier.",
        "background": "We want the Government to require schools to teach teenagers more about cancers, particularly those that are common in early life, such as testicular cancer, leukemia and bone cancer. This should include how to identify signs of cancer, and how to seek advice and treatment.",
