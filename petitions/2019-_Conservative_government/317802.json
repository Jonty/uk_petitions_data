This strategy appears to be the most successful abroad, in South Korea, Germany, New York and Iceland for instance, for controlling the virus. To resuscitate the fifth largest economy, we should execute this strategy. Billions of pounds should be invested in this effort and over 10,000 test centres should be created. The government's plans and achievements have not gone far enough",
