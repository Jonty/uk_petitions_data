        "additional_details": "Social distancing for under 5s should end because:\r\n \r\n- 30% of pre-school children do not attend formal childcare (currently the only setting where social distancing has been relaxed for children).\r\n- A study of parents of children under two showed 48% felt their child had become more clingy since lockdown.\r\n- Evidence has shown the first 1,000 days of a child's life are essential for providing a firm foundation for their future.\r\n- Under 11s in Wales and Scotland no longer need to socially distance.",
        "background": "Many babies and toddlers are being kept away from extended family and peers, many baby and toddler groups have stopped, and families have lost support. We believe this is causing damage, and the Government must end guidance recommending social distancing for under 5s.",
