        "additional_details": "There is a huge economic & social cost & research would help address that. \r\n \r\nWhile menopause is in the spotlight & strides are being made in the workplace, we still don\u2019t know the answers to many questions related to menopause treatments or why many of those who go through it have severe symptoms affecting their ability to work & quality of life. The long term benefits/safety of HRT, how testosterone might help symptoms, if HRT reduces the risk of dementia are just a few examples of the questions we don\u2019t have full answers for. Research would help get the answers we need.\r\n \r\n",
