        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to allow British service personnel to display this medal, as service members involved in this operation are not living in the best location, in the best conditions, and get no extra money to make the tour and be separated from their loved ones, but still go through the tour, only to be unable to display the medal NATO are issuing. We want the Government to add this medal to the list of NATO-issued medals that British service members are allowed to display on their uniforms.",
        "background": "Service personnel are enduring a long six months on Operation Cabrit on behalf of NATO's EFP across the Baltics, with basic food, in a camp isolated from a lot of the population of the JOA. NATO are issuing a medal, but British service members are not allowed to display this on their uniforms.",
