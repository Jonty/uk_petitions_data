        "additional_details": "There are a number of costs and logistical issues associated with Asylum Seekers, providing accommodation and support to people claiming asylum, \u00a3500m to France to help stop boats crossing the Channel.\r\n \r\nI am also deeply concerned about their mental health and sense of belonging. We can offer them a simple way out - allowing them to work in Climate Change Adaptation + Regenerative Agriculture projects.\r\n \r\nIt's worth noting that with access to manual labour, it is possible to use less heavy machinery, less fertiliser, better yields, more supply, lower food prices, loads of other benefits too.",
        "background": "The current asylum system is costly. Those who claim asylum in the UK are not normally allowed to work whilst their claim is being considered.\r\n \r\nWe can do better than that. We need additional people in variety of jobs, including Climate Change Adaptation and Regenerative Agriculture.",
