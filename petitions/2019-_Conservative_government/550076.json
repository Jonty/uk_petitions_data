        "action": "Reduce content drastically for GCSEs 2021 in every single subject.",
        "additional_details": "The government very rightly so decided in March 2020 to cancel the 2020 GCSEs due to the COVID-19 pandemic and hence the loss of GCSE learning time, which the government acknowledged to be unrecoverable. The same has been suffered by students of the 2021 GCSE cohort. Content reduction will allow students to still take part in a system fairer than a system based on prediction. Content reduction will provide an opportunity fair and equal to all. It is time the government took matters in its hands.",
        "background": "OFQUAL has unfortunately made very small changes to the content and examination of GCSE subjects. This has made many GCSE students across the UK suffer immense pressure of catching up 4-6 months of lost teaching. A consensus has been gained that a short 1-2 month exam delays will not greatly help.",
