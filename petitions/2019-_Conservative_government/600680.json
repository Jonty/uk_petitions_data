Currently there are limits on working hours, although people can opt out of these, but there are no limits on the number of days a week people can work.\r\n\r\nPreventing people from working more than four days would also not necessarily increase leisure time, as people could work more hours on the days they are working.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
