        "additional_details": "It has been estimated that 6,006 Christian Nigerians were killed between January 2021 and March 2022. This has been followed by the killings in a Catholic Church in Owo, southwest Nigeria, in June 2022.\r\n \r\nIn 2021, Genocide Watch stated that \"Nigeria is worst in the world for the persecution of Christians.\" Our Government must intervene. Signing this petition may help stop the persecution of Christians who simply want the right to practice their faith in peace, and without fear.",
        "background": "We want the Government of the United Kingdom to urge the Nigerian Government to do more to protect its persecuted Christian population. As one of Nigeria's top 15 trading partners, the UK is in a strong position to apply pressure and seek an end to the persecution of Christians in Nigeria.",
