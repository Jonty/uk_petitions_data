        "action": "Remove the BBC Licence Fee make TV licences free during coronavirus (COVID-19)",
        "additional_details": "This would be a temporary measure during the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis. TV has an important role to play in reducing isolation, boredom and mental health issues. The licence fee is set by the Govt. and agreed by Parliament. It should be straightforward for Govt. to lift the licence fee for households. This would benefit \"at-risk\" sectors of society, including those with less access or ability to get information and entertainment online. For e.g. some 70+ year olds or those on low incomes.",
        "background": "Temporarily remove the TV licence fee for households: 1] People need easy, quick access to broadcasts on COVID-19. TV is a way for Govt. to inform about latest situation/guidance. 2] During social distancing/lockdown TV/catch-up essential for entertainment, education & to stay connected with society",
