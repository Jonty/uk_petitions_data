        "additional_details": "I want this done becuase in alot of schools they have alot of homophobia but with this club we can change that and help those who are struggling to find who they really are. In abbywood and patchway they already have one of these clubs however bscs does not and we want to change that. It will be voluntary and we will social distance outside if it's a nice day but inside if not.",
