        "action": "Do not increase the minimum income requirement for family visas to \u00a338,700",
        "additional_details": "Increasing the income requirement to more than twice the minimum wage is unprecedented. No  other country in the world has such a harsh requirement. As family visa holders are already not entitled to public funds, the argument that it prevents them being a drain on the state is plainly wrong. This policy goes well above making sure families are able to support themselves and essentially restricts the right to a foreign partner to the wealthiest in our society. This must be reversed.",
        "background": "On 4th December the government announced their new immigration strategy. This includes increasing the minimum annual income requirement for family visas to \u00a338,700. This is an increase of more than 100% on the present level of \u00a318,600.",
