By making the second payment on account optional and allowing taxpayers to pay the remainder in the balancing payment in Jan 2022, HMRC will be leveling the playing field between self-employed and PAYE taxpayers and giving people greater control of their cash flow.\r\n\r\nhttps://on.ft.com/3kYn4O2",
