        "additional_details": "The beauty industry contributes \u00a327.2 billion pounds to the U.K. economy annually and yet is often overlooked or forgotten about by the British Government, particularly the service based brands such as nail bars and beauty salons. We are asking for beauty salons to be treated in the same way as hairdressers and be allowed to reopen on 4th July, as many of these businesses have safely prepared for.",
        "background": "The Government\u2019s decision to allow hairdressers to re-open but not other beauty salons will be crippling to those businesses. If a hairdresser has face-to-face contact to cut your fringe with only a visor for protection, then why can\u2019t a nail bar provide a manicure with a Perspex screen in place?",
