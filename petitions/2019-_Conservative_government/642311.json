        "additional_details": "I have a serious allergy to coconut and I\u2019m pescatarian which has led me to discover that a huge portion of vegetarian and vegan options have coconut in them. The reason I\u2019d discover this wasn\u2019t because it was clearly stated with the ingredients, it was because I\u2019d miss a set of brackets saying coconut oil and go into anaphylactic shock upon eating what I thought was a safe food option. Many people have a coconut allergy and it should be as clearly marked as other major allergens.",
