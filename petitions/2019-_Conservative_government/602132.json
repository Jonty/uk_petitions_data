This is leaving many working parents financially crippled, with a third of families paying more on childcare services than on their rent or mortgage. Parental pay is also inadequate, which combined with unaffordable childcare means many parents return to work early and miss vital time with their child.",

From birth to five years old is one of the most critical time periods for children, and Parents should not have to choose between their child and their career due to lack of affordable childcare.",
