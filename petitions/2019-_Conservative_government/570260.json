        "additional_details": "Following the passing of Scotland's Bill that was introduced by Monica Lennon MSP, the UK Government should follow suit.\r\n\r\nRemoving the 'luxury' tax on period products is a step in the right direction, but period products are a necessity and should be treated as such. Many companies and educational institutions may already be doing this, it should be a legal requirement to protect people's dignity and to ensure period poverty does not get in the way of education.\r\n\r\nEnd period poverty in the UK!",
        "background": "The UK Government must set up a UK-wide scheme to allow free period products for anyone who needs them and have the power to make other public bodies provide free period products. Educational institutions (schools, colleges and universities) should provide free period products in their toilets.",
