        "additional_details": "Many people are oblivious to how much these companion animals can help people with mental health issues to get out and do things. To be refused or laughed at can have an impact on our wellbeing.\r\n \r\nI have been told I don't need a service dog, and been refused service in shops. This has been detrimental to my mental health and made me think I would be better off just staying indoors and not facing the world. These service dogs can help people to feel normal as can be and free to be able to get out in the fresh air. Without this we can feel stuck inside.\r\n",
        "background": "Mental health can be challenging enough let alone when you are shut down or snubbed for having a support dog. I want the Government to recognise Emotional Support Animals (ESAs), so that people with a support animal can't be refused access or services.",
