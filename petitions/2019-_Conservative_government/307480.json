        "additional_details": "All face-to-face university lectures and exams have been cancelled and put online instead. Due to this many students have returned home as they feel it is safer than living in large, shared accommodation. However they are still being held to their contract and made to pay rent for a flat that, due to no fault of their own, they\u2019re not living in. Government should suspend students rent who are no longer staying in student flats because of covid-19.",
        "background": "The government should suspend all rent for students who\u2019ve had to move out of student accommodation and back home due to Covid-19. They should not be charged for a flat they\u2019re not currently living in through no fault of their own.",
