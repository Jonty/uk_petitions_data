        "action": "Prevent mobile phone companies from increasing prices mid-contract.",
        "additional_details": "Mobile communication services are a backbone of modern society, with many relying on mobile phones as a source of income, to keep in touch with people, or access to sources of information. However, customers are unable to negotiate terms with mobile service providers, which often include a clause to allow providers to increases prices mid-contract by inflation, plus an additional margin. This means many people are caught out this year by price rises of over 15%, straining finances even further.",
        "background": "Most mobile phone companies have a clause in their contracts which allows them to raise the price every year by inflation plus an additional margin. With inflation having increased to 13.4%, it means that people's phone tariffs are also increasing by that amount, even if they're mid-contract.",
