        "additional_details": "Every year there are hundreds, if not thousands, of:\r\n\r\n- Petrified animals (both pets and wildlife) that are shaking and hiding as they have no idea what is happening. Often leading to death due to the stress fireworks cause them. \r\n\r\n- People with PTSD / trauma / sensory issues who are triggered and suffer - often our war heroes who have fought for this country and deserve better. \r\n\r\nIf fireworks are quiet/silent they can still be enjoyed by all, without the unnecessary suffering.",
        "background": "Fireworks are great, except for the loud noises they make. Over the years they have gotten louder with unnecessary booming noises that can be heard from miles away, causing serious distress to both humans and animals.",
