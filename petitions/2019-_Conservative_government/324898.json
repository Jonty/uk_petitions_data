        "additional_details": "Unlike companies that can hibernate and furlough staff, zoos are required to remain open to staff in order to look after all the thousands of animals they look after. Therefore their costs have remained high without the support from the government to help them during this time. By opening to the public again, whilst maintaining the high standards of safety and social distancing measures, zoos have a better chance of survival during this time.",
        "background": "Currently the government has allowed parks and open spaces to be reopened to the public, yet zoos across the UK that have acres of open space and viable for social distancing measures are still closed without any notice of reopening. This needs to be changed ASAP so that zoos are able to survive.",
