        "additional_details": "With the undoubted popularity of tattoos over recent years, it is amazing that people can still be refused employment based on their tattoos.\r\n\r\nThe look of tattoos has improved immensely over the last decade and is now seen as more of an art form.\r\n\r\nOver this time, the demographic has changed to a more mainstream and affluent clientele with a wide range of careers. It is extremely unfair to affect the employment opportunities of an ever-increasing percentage of tattooed adults in the UK.",
