        "additional_details": "We as Students deserve a right of learning at a higher level with facilities and teachers during the period of study. However, with online learning this has become difficult in terms or help from teachers and accessing facilities we are used to in person. \r\n\r\nAs the pandemic is on the decline and isn't a cause for concern we don't see the reason as to why we should continue to be online learning. All this does is hinder our learning and ability to succeed which could have a negative impact on all.",
        "background": "The government and/or Parliament should reinstate all lessons at university to be face to face rather than online. Students have suffered enough through this pandemic with expectation to carry on as normal with a lack of resources and help. This should not continue for future years as it didn't work",
