        "additional_details": "Many businesses and employees operating in the UK have suffered great hardship as a result of the Government's policy responses to the Covid pandemic. There are, however, some, mostly large multinational companies and their senior executives, who've massively profited from these responses, e.g. pharmaceutical companies. The Government have now announced an increase in overall taxation on the British people to the highest level ever. A windfall tax would reallocate the tax burden.",
        "background": "For large companies with operations in the UK who report profits greater than their 5 year average, whether that is reported to UK authorities or authorities abroad, during the years 2020/2021 and 2021/2022, (the Covid pandemic years) a high windfall tax should be levied upon those excess profits.",
