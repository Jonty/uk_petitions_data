I want the government to immediately accept BAME communities should be offered the vaccine now in the same way as the most vulnerable have.

        "background": "The government has accepted in their own findings, from the outcome of an analysis carried out by the DOH, that BAME communities were at higher risk of catching COVID-19 than others. Therefore, it only seems right for BAME communities to be placed in the same category of those with priority.",
