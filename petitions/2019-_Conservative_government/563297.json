I want the government to immediately accept BAME communities should be offered the vaccine now in the same way as the most vulnerable have. This is not a time for a long debate and the facts speak for themselves. The government needs to appreciate in treating BAME communities as less of a priority for early vaccination could be viewed as institutional racism.",
        "background": "The government has accepted in their own findings, from the outcome of an analysis carried out by the DOH, that BAME communities were at higher risk of catching COVID-19 than others. Therefore, it only seems right for BAME communities to be placed in the same category of those with priority.",
