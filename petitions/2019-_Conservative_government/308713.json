        "additional_details": "The NHS is already low on doctors and nurses; the current pandemic has the potential to worsen this by increasing burnout. Mental health services are already stretched with long waiting times common. In 2018 there were 55 suicides by nurses and 18 by medics in England and Wales (https://tinyurl.com/sjfjhp3) it would be a tragedy for this to increase. Informal groups have sprung up offering support: we need formal provision for the mental health of these staff.",
        "background": "NHS staff working with COVID-19 patients are at risk of mental health problems such as PTSD from their work during this pandemic. The government should increase the availability of mental health services and psychological therapies for this group, so that they can receive support without long waits.",
