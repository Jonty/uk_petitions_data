        "additional_details": "Due to COVID, workers costing more than they produce are furloughed, meaning by law they can't work and don't produce for the economy.\r\n\r\nHowever many of these workers can do some work. By working reduced hours for remote working, many workers could earn more than they do when furloughed, companies can produce more with reduced wage burden, and the government pays less than under JRS.\r\n\r\nWhereas JRS is new, Germany continues to use Kurzarbeit after the financial crisis as an effective policy.",
        "background": "Adopt the Kurzarbeit protection scheme by splitting workers' wage payment between government and employer:\r\n\r\n\r\n. Allow firms to pay workers half of their wage for reduced hours of working where possible.\r\n\r\n. Commit the government to supporting ~60% of the remaining half of these workers' wages.",
