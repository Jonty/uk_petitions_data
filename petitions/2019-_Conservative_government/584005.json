        "additional_details": "We believe that Shisha pipes can be provided safely like they did before in the previous reopening of business on 4th July 2020. \r\n\r\nShisha bars are a part of everyday life for many people who live in the UK. They provide a place for people to socialise and an industry that has created many jobs. \r\n\r\nThey have also had many measures in place to stop the spread of Covid but have not been allowed to reopen.",
        "background": "The government should allow Shisha pipes to be served with specific measures that most places already had in place, such as not allowing customers to share and use of disposable pipes.\r\n\r\nThe new guidelines have written off a whole industry without any explanation or evidence, putting jobs at risk.",
