They sometimes find their families in financial challenging circumstances due to Corona impact on family/spousal income. A typical family: nurse, spouse and the average two children will cost \u00a34684 in naturalisation fees without the additional costs. This is for many nurses at this time not affordable. Welcome NHS nurses to stay!",

This could be waived for a year enabling nurses to feel welcomed and settled at a time where many consider leaving due to Corona and other reasons. Finances can be tough on nurses at this time.",
