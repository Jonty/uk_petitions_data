        "additional_details": "\"Companies that seek to dodge their obligations to broader society by cutting their tax bills shouldn't expect to get bailed out when things go wrong,\" - Robert Palmer\r\nTaxation is a major source of funding for the country as a whole. If a company won\u2019t contribute, why do they deserve support? The only just & fair answer is that they don\u2019t deserve it. \r\nThe money intended for financial aid would be better used supporting our infrastructure or better yet our currently exhausted healthcare system.",
        "background": "Like Denmark and Poland, any company that has registered itself in a tax haven should be denied any access to financial aid, regardless of the company and its services. \r\nThis could prove beneficial in both the short and long term, helping to dissuade corporate tax evasion, hopefully forever.",
