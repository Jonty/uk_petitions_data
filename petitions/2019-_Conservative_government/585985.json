This often results in women and families requiring time off as sickness leave. Which can in some cases, result in an impact on their income. The unplanned loss of a pregnancy is a bereavement to the family and should be treated in line with bereavement leave constituting up to 3 days leave.",

People taking statutory bereavement leave are entitled to get either \u00a3151.97 a week or 90% of your average weekly earnings (whichever is lower) if you\u2019re eligible.\r\n\r\nIf you would like the Government to change statutory bereavement leave in a different way to the above petition, we could accept a new petition requesting this, but it would need to be clear how you wanted existing entitlements to be changed.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay and Leave here: https://www.gov.uk/parental-bereavement-pay-leave"
