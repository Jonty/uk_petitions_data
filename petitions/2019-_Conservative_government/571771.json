By keeping English, Maths, Science compulsory we are projecting these subjects as more important than others. Most individuals will only need a base level on these subjects & thier skills may lay in Art, Sport, Music yet these subjects are not given equal value in this country. Education needs looking at for individuals to feel worth in their skills.",

Maths & English is important to a level but beyond this, not necessary for every individual. Other subjects such as Art, Music & Sport to be valued on par",
