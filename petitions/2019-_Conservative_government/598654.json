        "additional_details": "Tips are voluntary gifts given to individuals for good service therefore should be treated as such and given tax exempt status. \r\n\r\nThe reduction of cash use in society is affecting cash tip earnings. \r\n\r\nGrowing number of proprietors refuse card tip processing due to the cost and PAYE administrative burden resulting in loss of income from tips.\r\n\r\nDue to complicated HMRC guidlines on tip pooling, individuals and staff are at risk of accidental tax evasion.  \r\nNow more than ever industry needs support.",
        "background": "We want the Government to abolish income tax on voluntary tips paid in cash or electronically. \r\nThis should include direct tips as well as pooled tips where proprietor is not involved in decision making on how tips are distributed.",
