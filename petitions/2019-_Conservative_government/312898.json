        "action": "Extend driving theory certificates by six months from when test centres re-open",
        "additional_details": "Many people that have theory certificates expiring later in the year will have booked a driving test that have now been cancelled due to the lockdown to lessen the pandemic. Normally people would have enough time for multiple attempts but now may not even get the chance to before certificate expiry if there's a large backlog. Asking people to pay to redo their theory test when it expired through no fault of their own is unfair and adds to the stresses many are going through right now.",
        "background": "Due to the government implementation of lockdown to limit the spread of the coronavirus, driving test centres are closed and all tests have been cancelled. We would like the government to implement the same measures as done with MOTs and extend the validity of driving theory certificates.",
