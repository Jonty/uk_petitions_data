        "additional_details": "Removing historical Items is wrong. The world is full of historical images and statues that feature not too pleasant scenes, some depicting violence, sexual and race inequality. Removing these does not teach tolerance, it only causes division. \r\nThe only way to teach about history is by making the information readily available. I believe that it would be better to place information plaques next to each statue, monument or piece of art giving information about the what they stood for GOOD and BAD.",

I would like the protection to include their removal without the explicit permission of central government.",
