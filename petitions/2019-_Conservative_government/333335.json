        "additional_details": "The UK is now an independent coastal state and, as such, the fish in our waters are one of our natural resources and are valuable commodities. Natural resources are almost never offered up in trade talks, so if the French want access to ours, we need access to their valuable vineyards. \r\n\r\nMacron et al have cited 'historic rights of European fishermen' to British waters. We cite historic rights to Western French vineyards through the Angevin Empire.",
        "background": "In the ongoing trade negotiations with the European Union, it has been stated by the French Government (and other Member States) that they expect 'fair access' to UK fishing waters. If that's the case, we would like the UK negotiating team to demand fair access to French vineyards.",
