Gambling is a huge issue in our society with millions of lives affected and even ruined. With many people confined to their houses during the covid-19 crisis, the issue is heightened with vulnerable people subjected to persistent campaigns from gambling companies at every turn, preying on those who are suffering addiction in an already difficult time emotionally and financially. Ban the use of adverts to protect those fighting this addiction and give them a chance!",
