        "additional_details": "In normal years the content is excessive so it isn\u2019t fair that we should be expected to learn the same amount with so many disruptions and changes to our lives, routines and community. Extending the starting time of exams is not enough. The content needs to be reduced for the sake of both pupils\u2019 and teachers\u2019 mental health. Exams are stressful in normal years so expecting us to sit exams in these uncertain times is not fair.",
        "background": "Content of AS and A-levels should be reduced for every subject. Due to being off over the last 6 months it has been extremely hard for everyone to get back into the routine of school never mind the step up from GCSE\u2019s to AS.",
