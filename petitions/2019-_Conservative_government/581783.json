It is also impossible for a restaurant to trade without being in their platform.\r\n\r\nThey compete directly with the restaurants by establishing their own \"delivery kitchens\" with far less costs, both in terms of delivery but also fixed costs and staff costs.",
        "background": "1) Impose a cap on the commission they are entitled to charge, up to 20%, following the example of the USA.\r\n\r\n2) Prevent them from charging commission on the VAT of an order. VAT does not belong to the provider to be charged commission.\r\n\r\n3) Make them pay their riders and staff minimum wage.",
