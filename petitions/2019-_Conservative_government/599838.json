        "additional_details": "There's no difference between an 18 year old and a 23 year old. Both will put in the same effort within a workplace, both could have the same living circumstances, and yet one gets paid more than another. The difference of \u00a32.35 an hour could make is massive. That's an extra \u00a394 a week, \u00a3376 a month and \u00a34,512 a year. That's enough to provide extra food, or electricity or anything to a struggling family. The same goes for apprentices who also do the same job and get paid minimal. Change it!",
        "background": "Since minimum wage has been introduced, it has never been equal for everyone. The segregations between 18-20, 21-22 and 23+ are outrageous. It is unfair to individuals who are of the younger age, but are still putting in the same amount of work from within a company.",
