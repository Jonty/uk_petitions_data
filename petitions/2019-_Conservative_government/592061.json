It is not easy stepping up to take a penalty with the whole world watching and to be abused based on your colour on social media is not acceptable and should be stopped. A message should be sent to the people responsible for this vile and disgusting behaviour and these lads need to be knighted for their amazing work and suffering abuse after England loss against Italy.",

There should be no place for racism in society and we should stamp it out. We call on our Prime Minister to act now",
