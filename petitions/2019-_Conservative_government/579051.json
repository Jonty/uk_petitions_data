        "additional_details": "AGCs will now be the only retail premises on the high street which will not be allowed to reopen on April 12th.\r\n\r\nThe sector has worked extensively with Government to evidence the safety of its premises and their strict adherence to safety measures.\r\n\r\nAGCs are an important part of the high street, bringing amenity, employment, and economic activity to many communities up and down the country.\r\n\r\nIf they aren't allowed to reopen on April 12th, hundreds of jobs and businesses will be at risk.",
        "background": "The Government's Covid-19 Roadmap announced that Adult Gaming Centres (AGCs) would not be able to open alongside other non-essential retail sites from April 12th and would instead open \u2013 at the earliest \u2013 on the 17th May. We are urging the Government to fix this mistake.",
