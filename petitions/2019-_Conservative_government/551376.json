        "additional_details": "Norway is on the peaceful country list and also has one of the lowest crime rates despite 21 years being maximum sentence. I believe that by capping the prison sentence to 21 years it will make people think and have a second chance and be able to live a life after punishment.\r\n\r\nDeath penalty was abolished 60 years ago and now we need to get ride of life sentences like Norway did. People should have a chance to reform.",
        "background": "I want the government to cap the prison sentence to 21 years no matter what the crime like Norway. I feel that life in prison is too much and people needs to rehabilitate no matter what the crime is.",
