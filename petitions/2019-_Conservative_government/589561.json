        "additional_details": "The UK is lucky to have a diverse selection of public owned, independent broadcasters. Yes, they may be too left/right or establishment focused at times. They may need reform. But that's what makes them great, they can be reformed unlike private companies! They challenge us & endeavour to tell the truth. They can get it wrong but they are accountable and in this post-truth era we need that. We must not end up like the US. Full of trashy TV networks who are prepared to say anything for views.",
        "background": "The government is pushing ahead with the privatisation of Channel Four which has been publicly owned for 40 years.  We demand the government stops in its privatisation of the broadcaster and instead protects it as a public asset.",
