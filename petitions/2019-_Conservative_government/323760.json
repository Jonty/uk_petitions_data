        "action": "Open our Churches and other places of worship for private prayer.",
        "additional_details": "At a time when such services as estate agents have the freedom to open their premises, it is contrary to justice to continue to deny to churchgoers access to an environment which by very many people is regarded as essential for their mental and spiritual welfare. A church, synagogue or mosque is a visible sign of local community, and freedom to use a place of worship is a basic human right, the denial of which we have hitherto tolerated patiently. It is time to put an end to this privation.",
        "background": "Now that non-essential shops and services are allowed to open, it is time that churches should be allowed to open also. Religious buildings which are large enough to maintain the necessary distancing and hygiene regulations should be available again as places of prayer, quiet and reflection.",
