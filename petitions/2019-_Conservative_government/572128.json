        "additional_details": "I\u2019m a single parent of two and have disabilities preventing me from getting a full-time job. I didn\u2019t qualify for the \u00a320pw uplift as I\u2019m on the old 'legacy benefits' system. Our financials got worse by the pandemic. \u00a320 extra would mean giving the kids good food and to not hear them saying \u2018I\u2019m still hungry\u2019. \r\n \r\nMy close friend Rebecca is a single working mother of one. Living on Universal Credit is very challenging for her, especially with no family or friends to help. \u00a320 is her food budget. She\u2019d be in trouble without it. ",
        "background": "By putting in place the \u00a320pw Universal Credit uplift at the start of the crisis, the Government provided a vital lifeline to low income families & children. It is clear the crisis is far from over. The Government must keep the uplift in place and grant it to all families on benefits.",
