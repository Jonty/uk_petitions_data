We don\u2019t meet the BSP eligibility criteria, because we were divorced & not cohabitating at the time of death. We believe this is unjust and should be changed.\r\n \r\nOn top of supporting my children through their grief, I have the financial worry of supporting them alone. Children are entitled to receive maintenance from a non-resident parent and shouldn\u2019t be excluded from financial support when a parent dies.\r\n",
