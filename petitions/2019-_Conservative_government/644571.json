        "additional_details": "This petition sheds light on the ongoing struggle faced by many students due to the escalating cost of living crisis, impeding their access to crucial resources like laptops, computers, and reliable internet or data for educational activities. Living expenses, including accommodation and halls, further compound the challenges students face. Financial difficulties significantly impact students, particularly those vulnerable in our society, making it even harder for them to access education.",
        "background": "The aim is to withdraw simplistic solutions like activity sheets and presentations, striving for a comprehensive and inclusive educational approach accessible to all. It is imperative to implement a more effective system and provide guidance during strike days.",
