        "additional_details": "We call on the Government to launch a public consultation into anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial in the United Kingdom, following with a published report into this horror. This would bring some peace to British Jews and ancestors of Holocaust victims, who do not want to see their families names tarnished.  Wednesday, 27 January 2021 represents Holocaust Memorial Day, a day of commemoration to the dead and suffering of the Holocaust. A point must be made about the scourge of Holocaust denial.",
        "background": "Holocaust denial is commonly associated with certain racist propaganda, and is illegal in several European countries and Israel. Shamefully the United Kingdom hasn't taken this step. Efforts to conceal the historical record are deep-rooted in anti-Semitism and discrimination.",
