        "additional_details": "A Levels are essential to pursue many other courses and opportunities, but once people are over college age there is no easy and free way to take A Levels. It doesn't seem right for individuals to miss out on future opportunities because circumstances left them unable to get A Levels at an earlier stage. Sometimes life really doesn't go to plan, and the Government should recognise this by funding free access to A Levels for all under 25s.",
        "background": "Some young people were unable to get A Levels at Key Stage 5 because they were affected by circumstances such as poor health or loss of a loved one. We want the Government to fund free access to A Levels for all under 25s, so they don't miss out on future opportunities.",
