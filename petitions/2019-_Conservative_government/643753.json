        "additional_details": "Stop the Welsh Assembly imposing 20mph limits, there is no scientific evidence to prove this has anything to do with emission levels, in fact the emission levels are higher at 20mph than at 30mph and the cars are moving slower and are on the road longer at more congestion. There is also the added risk of tailgating and impatient drivers overtaking others driving too slowly which we have already witnessed. Outside schools is a great idea but everywhere else absolutely not",
