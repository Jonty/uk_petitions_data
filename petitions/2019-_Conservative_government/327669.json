        "additional_details": "It would benefit the students\u2019 mental health & their grades to have open-book exams & reduced content. Globally, 1 in 5 students already suffer with a mental health issue, depression & anxiety are the top 2 offenders. Professor Elliot Major stated that \u201cpupils are set to lose at least a third of teaching time for their courses.\u201d Furthermore, students from disadvantaged backgrounds may have been affected more by COVID-19 resulting in them falling even further behind their counterparts. Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union: \u201call exams \u2013 including primary school Sats \u2013 would have to be slimmed down in 2021. \u201cAny idea that GCSEs and A-levels in 2021 can just be the same as they were in 2019 is profoundly wrong,\u201d",
        "background": "There has been a lot of disruption to those who are taking exams next year: many missed lessons & there simply is not enough time to cover what has been missed. No change means adding more stress to an already unfortunate situation. The idea of 2021 exams being normal is \u201cincreasingly tenuous\u201d",
