        "additional_details": "The virus was present in most European countries including UK by mid January. Introducing social distancing measures 2 months later has little practical importance as the virus was able to reach every neighbourhood in the country.\r\nNo excess mortality is being observed in almost all European countries. It may however become the case in the following months when prolonged lockdown brings about mass unemployment, poverty, deprivation, substance abuse, mental health issues and suicides.",
        "background": "Lockdowns have not been introduced in Sweden or countries closest to China. Their approach proved to be far more effective as shown by rates of hospitalisations and deaths. In absence of mass testing these rates are the only reliable indicators of the outbreak severity.",
