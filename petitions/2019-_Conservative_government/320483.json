        "additional_details": "Around half of school leavers do not go into Higher education after Year 13 and are entering the job market at a time of crisis without support because their formal schooling is now over due to Covid-19. These young people need to be supported to find employment or training.\r\n\r\nA high proportion of this group comes from low income families, meaning that many who are poor and may not have done well at school are not being supported at the worst time to find a job in recent economic history.",
        "background": "This petition is to ask the Government to recognise and provide support to the more than 300,000 school leavers who are not going to university or other formal higher education in September.",
