I am 70 years old and have a physical disability and full mental capacity yet I was placed on an end of life ward wiith an average age of over 80, many with dementia. The Carehome is in an  area with no opportubity for family  to call in. In 16 months I have been out of the home on 4 occasions for a total of 12 hours. I stay in bed for 20 hours a day. I hardly know my grandsons.lMedical advice would not have left me in this inhumane situation.",

I was placed in a Carehome by my Local Authority. The Carehome was not in a town that I knew, or knew anybody, or where I had lived for 30 years.",
