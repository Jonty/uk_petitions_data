Whilst the sentiment is acknowledged, setting fireworks off disrupts the sleep of those who currently need it the most and/or other young family members in the household. \r\nBeyond this, there is a potential for an unnecessary increased traffic to our emergency departments at a time where we need to keep them free to help those suffering from Covid-19.",
