        "action": "UK government prevent English football clubs joining the European Super League",
        "additional_details": "The creation of a European Super League does the following: -\r\n\r\n1. Destroys the ideals of sport being merit based\r\n2. It provides financial mis-balances - which will in future cause smaller clubs to act only in the interests of the 'big 6'.\r\n3. Puts jobs under risk - by diverting finances to the largest clubs it simultaneously puts all jobs in the tiers of English football at risk, as focus switches from our national game to the European League, destroying our national structure as result.",
        "background": "We ask the government to create a law which requires all professional clubs who wish to televise football matches in the UK to have an FA issued license. Clubs without a licence cannot have matches broadcast in the UK - this protects the integrity of our game by ensuring the FA maintain control.",

            "details": "Decisions relating to broadcast rights for football competitions or individual matches are a matter for the relevant governing and organising bodies, in this case the Football Association and the Premier League, and broadcasters, not the UK Government or Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn any case, on Monday 19 April the Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden MP said that he was appalled by the announcement that a handful of clubs are proposing to form their own breakaway European league, ands said the Government would not hesitate to protect one of our greatest national institutions: football. The Culture Secretary said that the Government would back the football authorities to stop this move, and if the football authorities couldn\u2019t act, the Government would. The Culture Secretary said the Government would \"put everything on the table to prevent this from happening.\" \r\n\r\nYou can read the Culture Secretary's full statement on the European Super League here: https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/statement-by-oliver-dowden-on-the-european-super-league \r\n\r\nSince you started your petition it has also been announced that all six Premier League teams that were initially involved in the European Super League have withdrawn. You can read a report of this news here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/56823501 \r\n\r\nFurther, on 19 April the Government announced a 'Fan-led review of football governance', which will explore ways of improving the governance, ownership and financial sustainability of clubs in English football, building on the strengths of the football pyramid.
