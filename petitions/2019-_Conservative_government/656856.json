With limited mobility and the responsibility of caring for the baby solo, safety concerns can arise. Birth partners can play a critical role in providing essential support.",

Partners can provide crucial support, and help ensure the safety of the baby and the birth giver. Allowing overnight stays can foster bonding, support the birth giver's wellbeing, and promote inclusivity.",
