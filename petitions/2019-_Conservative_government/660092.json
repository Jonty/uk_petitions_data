        "additional_details": "The scientific evidence points to increases in adverse health consequences from changing the clocks, including in heart attack and stroke, but what is the benefit?\r\n\r\nThe change is also associated with a heightened risk of mood disturbances and hospital admissions, elevated production of inflammatory markers in response to stress. The potential for car crashes also spikes just after the spring forward; a 2020 study found that the switch raises the risk of fatal traffic accidents by 6%.",
        "background": "I would like the parliament to discuss the benefits of the current clock changes and assess the negative impacts on people's health, children's education, road accidents, etc. Then vote on whether clock changes should be maintained or abolished.",
