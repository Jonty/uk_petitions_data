        "additional_details": "The MP's had a debate on this issue on the 8th June 2021 before the G7 meeting. Virtually all the MP's who spoke were in favour of restoring the 0.7% GNI. These MP's were from across the political spectrum and many spoke very passionately as this cut will result in the loss of many lives in some of the world's poorest countries. Parliament made a legal promise that it was committed to maintaining the 0.7%. Our MP's should have the right to vote on whether or not to break that promise",
        "background": "I want the MP's in Parliament to be able to vote on whether or not they wish to restore the 0.7% GNI for Foreign Aid following the cut to 0.5% GNI. The MP's were only allowed to debate this issue but were denied the right to vote on it which was wrong.",
