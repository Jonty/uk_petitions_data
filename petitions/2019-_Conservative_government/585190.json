        "background": "For some reason schools are used as polling stations. This often means school closure and kids sent home.\r\n\r\nIt must be possible to organise elections without disrupting our children\u2019s education and causing disruption to parents.\r\n\r\nPass a law to stop schools being used as polling stations.",
