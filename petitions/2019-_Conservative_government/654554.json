        "additional_details": "The current policy is unfair and outdated. \r\nCurrent rules mean both parents could be earning \u00a349,999.99, a total income of \u00a399,999.98 and not pay a change. Yet if one parent earns over \u00a350,000.00 a charge is brought in, even though the second parent could have a low / zero income. \r\nThis \u00a350,000 cap has also not been increased for 10 years, since 2013; which does not reflect on salary increases or inflation, pushing more and more people into this higher charge bracket.",
