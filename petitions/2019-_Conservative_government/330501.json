The Gender Recognition Act should only be expanded to grant transgender people more freedoms that cisgender people take for granted everyday: the ability to fully express themselves, to live.",

These changes would prohibit teenage transgender people being able to transition, and would make an already arduous process extremely difficult for hundreds of thousands of people.",
