        "additional_details": "This change would allow childcare providers to thrive. Government funding places for children is excellent. Underfunding it is a disaster that will lead to closures and staff burn out. There's no way they can afford to pay their staff and their bills if they're running a deficit. This is completely avoidable just by simply changing the name of it.",
        "background": "The UK government provide funding for early years care; by calling the funding 30 hours free childcare  they don't allow the childcare providers to budget for their real costs. If they changed to name to \"Childcare Grant\" this would allow providers to determine how much care this really covers.",

At present the scheme does fund 15 or 30 hours free childcare.\r\n \r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. "
