        "additional_details": "Covid-19 has shown us that intensive care nurses are specialists. They use life-saving equipment, learn complex equipment and gain extra skills requiring added training such as multiple clinical skills packages as well as taking an intensive care course.\r\n\r\nLooking after an intensive care patient competently requires these added skills and should be reflected in pay for the time spent completing these courses and maintaining these skills.",
        "background": "Once an intensive care nurse has completed their intensive care course (usually a few years into working on an intensive care unit) give them a pay rise to band 6 - acknowledging that this field of nursing is specialised.",
