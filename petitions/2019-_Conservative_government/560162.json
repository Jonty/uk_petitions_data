        "additional_details": "Saying bandanas in school a 'distraction' is ridiculous. No one is getting distracted other than the teachers pointing it out. \r\nIf worn as something 'innocent' e.g a hair accessory it should not be frowned upon. \r\n\r\nWearing bandanas could also be just as effective as the average face mask & should be classed as a facial covering.\r\n\r\nThis is not a personal issue, but one of many of my friends & students.\r\nFrom mine & majority if not all students views, they are not a distraction in school(s)",
        "background": "Create a law stating students can wear bandanas in school or alternatively just in plain colours and/or matching with school uniform.\r\n\r\nNormalise the wearing of them in general & stop associating them with gangs especially if worn as just a hair accessory.",
