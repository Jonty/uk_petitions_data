This protects people against sex discrimination and discrimination because a person is transgender. \r\n\r\nThere has been much confusion about how the Equality Act and GRA interact. This has caused uncertainty and conflict for women, transgender people, and service providers. The GRA includes a provision to amend other laws to make it clear whether a GRC changes the definition of sex for that law.",
