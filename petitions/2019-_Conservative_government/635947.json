I would like to know why it is so easy for the government to put up the cost of living in every aspect such as food, gas, electricity and much more immediately however postpone the help you give us for a year. I know you probably don\u2019t care about anyone\u2019s back story but I am a single mother trying my best. I receive nothing",

I am a single mother with one income and receive zero help towards my childcare or the cost of living. I am trying my very best as a single mother and no help is available",
