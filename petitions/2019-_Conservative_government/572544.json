We're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. \r\n\r\nWe're not sure exactly whether you'd like Scotland only to become independent if a majority of the UK vote for it, and what would happen if the vote in Scotland was different to the rest of the UK. Under existing legislation, the Scottish Parliament cannot be abolished except if the people of Scotland vote to do so in a referendum.\r\n\r\nYou could start a petition calling for any vote by the people of Scotland in favour of independence to have to be ratified in a UK-wide referendum, if that's something you'd like to see happen."
