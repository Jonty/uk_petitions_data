        "additional_details": "I think that if an individual is willing to work, they should be entitled to get help and support when it comes to childcare for their children. I go to work to pay the majority of my earnings on someone to look after my child. Whereas those that do not work are given more support than myself, my husband and other families who chose to work. I feel that we would be better off not working, than working. I think the system is backwards.",

I currently work 40+ hours and I have to pay full-time childcare which approximately costs 900+ a month. I feel that we should be entitled to help with childcare before the age of 3 if working.",
