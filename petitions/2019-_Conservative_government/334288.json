        "additional_details": "The Government should intervene with the lack of changes that have been made. Although GCSE students have had changes, A-level students have been left out due to their age. Being older just not mean we are able to teach ourselves extremely difficult content. Not only would these changes relieve students of stress, it would also relieve teachers of stress of having to teach over a years worth of content in less than a year.",
        "background": "The Government have routinely ignored the requests for changes to these exams as students have not had adequate lessons and preparation for these exams. Students have missed over 4 months of school and have been put under massive amounts of stress.",
