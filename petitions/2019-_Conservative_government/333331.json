The offer of residency to Hong Kong nationals could cover 3 million people. This is equivalent to 1,500 years of confirmed slavery survivors.\r\n \r\nDespite the Government's promise to protect survivors of human trafficking and modern slavery, many are kept in limbo for years awaiting decisions on their case, with the fear of being deported. Many feel insecure, isolated and unsafe.\r\n \r\nSupport the right to a secure future.",
