        "action": "Abolish University Tuition Fees For All Students",
        "additional_details": "I strongly believe that an 18 year old student should be focused on studying, not worrying about how they will pay off their student debt. As a citizen of this democracy, I aim to use my voice to tackle this major injustice British students face. This is a burden systematically placed upon us. With COVID-19, the future of British students is left uncertain. No one should ever be deprived of an education. I am calling on all students to unite to pressure the government to abolish tuition fees.",
        "background": "I believe the British Government must abolish university tuition fees for all students. Education is a fundamental human right. The only way we can live in a fair and equal society is for education to be accessible by all. It is unfair that the poorest of students suffer most from tuition fee debts.",
