        "additional_details": "By restricting rent to the maximum to \u00a3400 and house prices to buy, it will have a certain impact in the UK economy and improve everyone's lifestyle dramatically. By doing this you'll see a sharp decrease of loans being taken out just for essential needs to survive, also the number of homeless people will also decrease as the rent prices drop to a reasonable price. Answer me this, can you afford to see people suffer and homeless? They will turn to crime in order to survive",
        "background": "Set a limit for maximum rent to pay to \u00a3400, which restricts housing companies charging ridiculous prices just to live in 1 house. Also by reducing house prices to buy to about \u00a320,000 for example",
