        "action": "Lower income tax for members of the Armed Forces.",
        "additional_details": "Currently, a growing number of Forces personnel are opting for higher paying jobs within the private sector. Although the government has attempted to tackle this through ideas such as the new Childcare Scheme (July 2020), it still doesn't prevent people from leaving for higher pay and Childcare in the private sector. Given the recent Russia Report and the Coronavirus response it is clear that the Armed Forces are vital to this country and retention of skilled personnel is key.",
        "background": "Lower income tax for defence personnel in an effort to increase personnel retention, which should slightly lower the need for such a big push in recruitment to fill Armed Forces size quotas and in turn keep already qualified personnel within the forces, lowering spending on further training.",
