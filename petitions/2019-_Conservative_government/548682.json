The offender was able to continue driving for 11 months before being disqualified as only a court can disqualify a driver.\r\n \r\nWith Tom's Law we want Police Officers to be able to issue a suspension notice to an offender when arrested at the Road side to stop them from driving until they attend court to protect other Road users.",
        "background": "We want Police Officers to be able to provide a suspension notice from the moment an offender is caught drink, drug or dangerous driving until they appear in court. It would then be for the Judge to decide whether a ban continues or they are able to continue to drive again.",
