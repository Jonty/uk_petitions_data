        "additional_details": "If the debt is written off, these workers could benefit from not having to pay back over \u00a350,000. This would be a particularly valuable benefit in a time where the Government are not able to raise wages due to the economic climate. It would reward the professionals who help the system and hopefully help prevent too many people going to the private sector too quickly.",
