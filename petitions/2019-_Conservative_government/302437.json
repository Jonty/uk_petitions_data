So why not manage it with volunteers.\r\nWhy men! Logistically it\u2019s easier. 1000 men in each School sports hall, will share the showers and WC. The school canteen can cater with donated food. \r\nThis plan could be implemented around the school Easter break. \r\nAs I set this petition up, I\u2019m happy to volunteer first.\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/2XRc389TvG8",

To qualify, a volunteer will need to prove their lungs are healthy by running round the schools field in a set time. It\u2019s fast and cost effective.",
