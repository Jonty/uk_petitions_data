        "additional_details": "All students, specifically students who require face to face teaching have been given a raw deal. Being forced online, having only a minimal amount of time on zoom/ teams etc. With tutors has affected not just the mental health of students, but also the education. Many students have worked ferociously to make it into their university of choice, for it to only be thrown back into their faces with sub-par teaching.",
        "background": "I believe the government should refund half, or at least 25% of the tuition fee for university students who have been forced online. Failing that be given freedom of an extra year of student finance allowing to retake 2 years.",
