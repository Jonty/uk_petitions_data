Countries that move fast will reap the benefits of cleaner technology, jobs of the future and breathable air. Active travel and public transport are vital too \u2014 electric cars are not the solution alone \u2014 but net zero is impossible without electrifying transport. There is no good reason to delay, and every reason to support people in the transition.",
        "background": "With Government backing, it is perfectly feasible to sell only electric cars from 2030. A stable target is vital to give everyone confidence. Used petrol and diesel cars will be around for many years after that. For climate and health, we must reduce emissions as fast as possible, not just by 2050.",
