        "additional_details": "The Government highlights it's support for women, yet breast cancer remains an area where the approach to developing cures and treatment is fragmented and significantly under-funded. \r\n\r\nWe want a new Government backed Breast Cancer Taskforce established to drive additional investment and better collaboration with partners, to find cures and more effective treatment options for the many women who are diagnosed and suffer with this disease.",
        "background": "Breast Cancer is the leading cause of death in women under 50 with 11,500 women dying every year of Breast Cancer in the UK. We want a National Taskforce approach similar to that taken to identify a vaccine for COVID, to be used to develop effective cures and treatment for Breast Cancer.",
