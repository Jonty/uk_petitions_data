        "additional_details": "The UK can set the example, leading change in the global market using our consumer power. Producers must adapt to a changing world, and shift to working under a circular economy. This legislation can begin this change. Although supplementary, we must look past recycling to instead reduce the use of plastic, reverse waste pollution and the growing damage of micro plastics. Our consumption can be reformed and this ambition to reduce our plastic production be realised with this call for change.",
        "background": "The Government must ban non-compostable mixed material consumer food packaging by 2030. This should force manufacturers to use compostable packaging such as PLA instead for multi-layer material packaging e.g. crisp packets.",
