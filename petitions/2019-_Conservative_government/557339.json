A consistent message and plan put in place that has a long term effect.\r\n\r\nClosing the borders may mean staycations become the norm for the next few years, but that's better than stay at home.\r\n\r\nFollow successful countries - New Zealand and Taiwan have both had success from this approach. Why wouldn't we learn from them?\r\n\r\nWe can't keep destroying our economy and toying with people's wellbeing - with years of lockdowns.",

Set up a robust track and trace programme, rollout mass testing and close the borders to non UK residents until a vaccine is available and/or cases drop around the world.
