        "action": "Order Ofgem to not increase (and ideally reduce) the energy price cap in October",
        "additional_details": "Ofgem have the power to control the domestic and commercial energy market, and the impact this has on the lives of millions. Energy underpins goods production, health, wealth and a key driver of inflation. If Ofgem reduced the price cap and standing charges, and instead the Goverment used the additional VAT and unexpected windfalls to support industry shortfalls, this would have a material impact. This is a much simpler and likely cheaper mechanism than providing funds direct to the public.",
        "background": "This petition is requesting that Ofgem reduces the price cap in October, and directs energy companies to not have differential tariffs for non-direct debit paying customers. Government should support those energy companies in difficulty and reduce the standing charge impact to consumers.",
