        "action": "Change laws of ADULTERY to include same sex relations in extramarital affairs.",
        "additional_details": "I\u2019d like the legal description of adultery to change to ensure it does not disregard same sex relations during marriage. Currently, if a married person in a straight or same sex marriage sleeps with someone of the same sex it does not constitute as Adultery. This means that there are many straight and same sex marriages that have ended due to extramarital affairs (with someone of the same sex) that cannot state this as a sole reason for the divorce.",
        "background": "The law of adultery specifically refers to the following:\r\n\r\nA married man having sexual intercourse with a woman other than his wife OR a married woman having sexual intercourse with a man other than her husband.\r\n\r\nThis law needs changing and updating alongside same sex marriage laws.",
