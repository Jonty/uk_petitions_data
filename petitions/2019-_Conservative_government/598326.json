        "additional_details": "The Government needs to commit to better, NOT weaker, regulations on genetic technologies and to support farmers with adopting agroecological methods that support nature. We should be investing in solutions that tackle the underlying problems in our food system, such as the reasons behind disease and pests in the first place. At a minimum, UK shoppers should be reassured and confident that products will not be produced using genetic technologies. That includes the organic market.",
        "background": "DEFRA held a consultation about proposals to change regulations around certain forms of genetic technologies (such as gene editing). This received over 6,000 respondents, and over 85% of responses from individuals were AGAINST deregulation. DEFRA announced plans to deregulate anyway.",
