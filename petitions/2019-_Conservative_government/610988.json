Many of these students have been mentally affected long term and many think that is only fair that they receive guided revision or something similar to help them. They struggled to find ways to help them in their studies with so many lessons being disrupted by online learning, isolations and various other things.",

Schools already provide support to students to prepare for exams, and the curriculum sets out what topics may be covered in exams.\r\n\r\nIf there are particular adjustments that you want the Government to make to how exams run next year, you could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, we could accept a petition calling on the Government to reduce curriculum content for next year, so that there are fewer topics that might come up in exams."
