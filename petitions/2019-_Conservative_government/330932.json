        "additional_details": "As a couple who recently stretched ourselves to purchase a home during lockdown we paid \u00a39,750 in stamp duty just over a week ago on the 30th June. We were absolutely devastated to find out a week later that had we waited, we would have not paid any tax at all. There was no warning from government about tax holidays, and so many people narrowly missed out on saving life-changing sums of money. Yet we still purchased houses in lockdown and faced the same challenges of those who will now benefit.",
        "background": "The government should do the right thing and back-date the Stamp Duty Holidays and discounts to all house purchases from the beginning of lockdown.",
