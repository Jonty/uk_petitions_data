        "action": "Require swimming venues to maintain single-sex or private changing facilities",
        "additional_details": "Safe single-sex or private facilities are vital to ensure women's safety, privacy and dignity when undressing to swim. This can be particularly important for instance because of trauma from sexual assault or for religious reasons. Facilities or services that are labelled female or women-only must be single-sex (as the Equality Act 2010 allows for). Women should not unexpectedly encounter a naked male in these spaces or be forced to self-exclude from swimming to avoid this possibility.",
        "background": "In the context of new policies introduced by swimming venues allowing biological males who identify as women to access female facilities we believe the Government must protect women's access to swimming by ensuring access to safe single-sex or private changing facilities.",
