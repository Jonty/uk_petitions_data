        "additional_details": "Anyone found carrying a knife for the first time should be sentenced to at least 12 months in prison, and anyone with previous offences should be sentenced to a minimum 36 months prison sentence.  \r\n\r\nI urge the UK government to make carrying a weapon and committing knife crime a more serious offence in order to dissuade at-risk teenagers from endangering their own and others' lives.",
        "background": "The legislation pertaining to knife crime and carrying blades should be revised. At the moment, carrying a knife as a first-time offender carries a 6 month minimum term. The legislation has to be reviewed and altered in order to combat the spike in knife crime.",
