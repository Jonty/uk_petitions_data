        "action": "Change the age range of Apprenticeships to allow all citizens to apply.",
        "additional_details": "People of any age can want or need to change their career but most are limited by the need to earn a living and the lack of affordable adult education which can fit around working hours. Apprenticeships offer the chance to train in a new career while you earn. The last few years has seen many people losing their jobs and needing to retrain. Opening up Apprenticeships to all age groups, as well as providing appropriate wages, means that more citizens will have more opportunity.",
        "background": "I believe that limiting the age range of Apprenticeships to 16-24 year olds is discrimination. Age is a protected characteristic under the Equality Act 2010. There is no legal or logical reason for training programmes to be restricted to young people.",
