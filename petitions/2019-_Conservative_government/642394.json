And not provide access in medical emergencies or power cuts to phone for help via a land line service or no mobile signals such as in rural areas and Highlands and Islands. My wife suffers from compromised immune system and has needs to order emergency medication from the local gr surgery or have an emergency ambulance take her to hospital neither of which we could do in the event of a power cut on digital",
        "background": "to investigate and make telephone companies to still provide emergency landline connections in the event of power cuts.\r\nBT offer a battery back up for their digital service which has an expensive price of \u00a385.00 each and only lasts one hour. So useless if the power is out for a couple of days.",
