These illegal, vehicle users are shredding moorland to pieces. This problem has grown over the years and the increase is mainly adults using our moorland to exercise off-road bikes/4x4s and has now reached an overwhelming level.The huge increase in this illegal activity is damaging breeding grounds and the environment to a huge level",
        "background": "Section 34 Road Traffic Act 1988 needs enforcing more strictly with arrests, bigger fines, vehicle confiscation & prosecutions to deter the huge increase in recreational off-road vehicle usage on grazing/common land which is damaging the livestock, our wildlife, environment and rural communities",
