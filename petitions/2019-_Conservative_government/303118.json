        "additional_details": "There are many situations in which both lanes of the A1 can be occupied with traffic. This creates a problem for traffic on slip roads intending to merge. A simple reduction in speed limit would allow drivers more time to respond accordingly in this scenario.",
        "background": "Under current regulations, sections of the A1 dual carriageway have a speed limit of 70mph. However, many slip roads are unsuitable to safely accelerate to this speed. Due to the increasing volume of vehicles on the UK's roads, reducing the speed limit of this road would improve traffic safety.",
