        "additional_details": "Many parents, not just those entitled to benefits, are already struggling financially and simply cannot afford increased heating costs. \r\nWhilst home-schooling, our children are expected to sit for extended periods whilst participating in live, on-line and desk based lessons. At school, children are used to warm classroom environments and it is essential that our children are afforded the same comfort at home so that they can focus on their education.",
        "background": "As children are forced into home-schooling during the national lockdown, parents will face higher heating bills due to keeping homes warm for longer periods. Direct payments to suppliers or vouchers that can be redeemed for meters will help ensure children are kept warm during these cold months.",
