If you can not re book another holiday within the insurance cover period.\r\nYou are not going on holiday, Therefore the health cover is not required or used.\r\n\r\nAs you did not use the service, why will the insurance company's not refund your premium, they have had no risk what so ever.\r\nA service or handling charge to cover administration yes but to retain \r\nthe full premium, often in the \u00a3500 reign dependent on age and health.\r\nI think its morally reprehensible to treat people this way. \r\nI took out the insurance to provide the cover I required at the price quoted.\r\nBut can not get a refund on some thing I never used or needed.",
