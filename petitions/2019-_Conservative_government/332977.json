        "additional_details": "Forced Marriage was made a crime in 2014. Predatory Marriage is a form of financial abuse. Predatory marriage victims often have dementia so it can be impossible for them to give evidence, and the evidence of financial abuse or even the marriage is sometimes only found after they have lost capacity or have died. The current law makes it very hard to protect the victim and prosecute the abuser. We must change this law.",
        "background": "To protect vulnerable people from predatory marriage, the Government should:\r\n1) change the law so that wills are not automatically invalidated on marriage (intestacy)\r\n2) make it easier for the annulment of any marriage found to be predatory",
