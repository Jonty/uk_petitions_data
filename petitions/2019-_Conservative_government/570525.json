        "action": "Reintroduce limited shopper capacity and social distanced queuing to enter shops",
        "additional_details": "Shops have no limited capacities in place for the amount of shoppers in store at any one time. This means social distancing in places such as supermarkets is nearly impossible. Large supermarkets can have capacities of roughly 1,000 people, making these locations an ideal spreading platform for COVID-19. Even with facemasks being worn and sanitising hands before entry, the inability to socially distance, even by 1M significantly hinders any efforts made to stay safe by shoppers.",
        "background": "We would like the Government to reintroduce socially distanced queuing to enter UK shops, including supermarkets and introduce limited shopper capacities at any one time, the same as Lockdown 1 beginning in 2020.",

This includes calculating the maximum number of customers that can reasonably follow social distancing guidelines and limiting the number of customers in the store accordingly. See:\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/shops-and-branches#shops-2-2\r\n\r\nHowever, responsibility for designing and putting in place specific measures to ensure social distancing between customers is the responsibility of individual retailers."
