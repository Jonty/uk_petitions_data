        "additional_details": "I understand the reasons and the carbon foot print is very much in the fore front of our minds. However, with the impact that this could have on the construction industry, I fear people may be put out of their jobs or even firms becoming insolvent because of the cost of the fuel. No other rebated fuel entitlements are being granted to the construction industry i in place of the red diesel. This needs to happen before entitlement to use rebated fuels are taken away from the industry.",
