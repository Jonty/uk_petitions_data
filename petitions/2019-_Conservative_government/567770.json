        "additional_details": "I think the government should extend maternity leave for at least 3 months with pay more so for those who have suffered with the struggles. People and myself who have waited so long for a baby and then have to miss out due to Covid-19 should be allowed the opportunity to have more time without losing out. Places are shut or limited which is why the government should extend it so then we get longer to do the things we\u2019ve always wanted to do with our babies.",
        "background": "I am a mother to my 5 month old son, we have not been able to do anything with other mothers and their babies due to Covid -19. From my 20 weeks scan till now I have had to do it on my own as my baby was poorly, I have to attend appointments on my own which is a real struggle. It has been very hard.",
