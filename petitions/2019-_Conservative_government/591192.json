        "additional_details": "Previous calls for public holidays for minority religions have been denied because of the cost to public. An alternative, to make sure that minorities are able to celebrate these festivities with their loved ones, is by implementing laws so annual leave priority is given to them on these occasions, which only form a few days per year. This is not a request for any extra holidays and will not be an expense to the public but a morale booster for the minorities who helped us through the pandemic.",
        "background": "Religious minorities play a vital role in running key services. In the NHS alone, at least 13% of the staff practice minority religions. Despite their contribution, there is no legislation for employers to make sure minorities are granted or prioritised for annual leave on religious holidays",
