We believe there is no good reason why these cannot be used for demonstrating covid status for international travel.\r\n \r\nUnlike PCR tests, lateral flow devices do not require lab processing and are already widely available for free. Passengers and the travel industry should not be further burdened with wholly avoidable costs for private tests that are imposed by Government regulations.",
