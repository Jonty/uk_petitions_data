        "additional_details": "The vaccine can easily be prioritised using the shielding letters list as a basis for prioritisation. Where there are contra-indications for having the vaccine, they should be considered but this should not exclude the clinically vulnerable as a whole from being prioritised.",
        "background": "The flu vaccine is already given based on clinical need and age. The Covid vaccine should be prioritised along similar lines. Currently, in the priority list for a Covid vaccine, healthy people over 65 will be prioritised over people who have been shielding. This is not fair and should change.",
