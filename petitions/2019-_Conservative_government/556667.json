By many Islamophobia is considered \u201cnot racist\u201d because it is about a religion which has allowed a normalisation of such hatred within the UK.\r\nI believe most non-Muslims often lack the understanding of the deep passion, love and devotion Muslims have for their Prophet PBHU and their divine book the Holy Quran.",
