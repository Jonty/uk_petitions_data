        "additional_details": "I want the Government or Parliament to do it because since Louth has lost it\u2019s rail link completely the town is cut off from the rest of the UK. Today, the nearest railway stations to Louth are either at Grimsby Town or in Market Rasen. There is over 15 miles between Louth and these two stations. I think that a town of this size should have it\u2019s own railway connection with a new station to be built elsewhere in the town as the original station cannot be reused due to several different factors.",
        "background": "I want the Government to re-open the railway line to Louth, reconnecting the town to the national rail network via the Boston - Skegness (Poacher Line).\r\n\r\nThis line was rejected for further funding from the Restoring Your Railway Fund from the Department for Transport.",
