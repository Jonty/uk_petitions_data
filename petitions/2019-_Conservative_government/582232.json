        "additional_details": "A miscarriage can be extremely traumatic and frightening. Women after a live birth have follow up appointments to check on their health, however when you have a miscarriage there is often no support or aftercare whatsoever.\r\n \r\nA Government review could investigate gaps in existing care and make recommendations for improvement. A simple follow up to check how a woman is doing physically and emotionally would be a great start.\r\n \r\nPlease review NHS care for miscarriage.",
        "background": "The Government should review NHS care women receive after a miscarriage. Many women do not receive adequate care and support at present. Women deserve better and the Government should review existing care to ensure that women get the care and support they need after a miscarriage.",
