        "additional_details": "From 2020 nursing students receive a bursary and the NHS pays their tuition fees, meaning that many of those who started in 2017 have a student loan of \u00a327,750, while most of those in earlier and later cohorts do not. We pay a lot of money to our student loan every month and many others pay nothing. It is a massive effect on our pay and it is only fair to get rid of the student loan debt for everyone.",
        "background": "Get rid of the debt that student nurses incurred for tuition fees between the years 2017-2020.\r\n\r\nStudying nursing was free to the individual previously, then in 2017 the Government ended its system of bursaries and we had to start paying \u00a39,250 per year.",
