        "additional_details": "Previous cohorts taking exams during COVID have endured immense stress through exams cancellations and uncertainty over fair grades. Now is the time students sitting exams in\u00a02022\u00a0are beginning to face similar struggles. It is unfair to expect students to sit exams as time is lost in years 10 and 12 missing valuable face-to-face teaching. It is unreasonable to adopt a 'catch-up attitude', adding to their mental burden. Use this experience to act now and change to fairer marking schemes",
        "background": "Changes must be made NOW to\u00a02022\u00a0exams to ensure students in years 10 and 13 are treated fairly to receive their deserved grades. A disrupted start to studies, limited face-to-face teaching and mental stress is detrimental. Let's learn from the past 2 cohorts, stop exams now for ongoing assessment.",
