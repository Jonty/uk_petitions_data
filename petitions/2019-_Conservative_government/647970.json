        "additional_details": "Telegraph poles erected by operators for the expansion of FTTP broadband do not need planning permission under the Electronic Communications Code (Conditions & Restrictions) 2003 & The Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development (England) Order 2015.\r\n \r\nThere is no requirement to consider alternatives (like underground cabling) or to inform residents of the installation, so no opportunity for them to engage. The first knowledge residents have of a pole installation is when it appears on their street.\r\n \r\n",
        "background": "We want the Government to remove permitted development rights for telegraph poles, so telecommunications operators have to apply for permission to the Local Planning Authority (LPA) on any proposed installation and the LPA has to consult with affected residents before issuing permissions.",
