        "additional_details": "It would be a way to get people into the hobby as there wouldn\u2019t be a need to find someone with a van and would stop people seeing them ridden illegally in the road, there are plenty of disused parks etc where this could take place and it is a shame to see the areas going to waste. If the users agreed to take care of the areas we would use I feel this would be a very constructive thing for the government to introduce for many reasons. I think it\u2019s time we do something",
        "background": "There are a shortage of places to ride off road bikes as tracks are many miles away and I believe it would deter people from riding illegally on the road and encourage more youths to take to a constructive hobby that is quite expensive to get into",
