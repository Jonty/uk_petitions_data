        "additional_details": "Connecting with nature has numerous mental and physical benefits. Currently wild camping requires consent of the land owner yet many tolerate it in national parks without consent. The majority of wild campers are discrete, camp in remote areas and respect the landscape by leaving no trace.\r\nWith the current cost of living crisis, it is even more important that the public have the ability to enjoy our stunning national parks more, responsibly and without fees.",
        "background": "By introducing a legal right to wild camp in England\u2019s national parks, it would enable the public to enjoy those areas which are less accessible. Guidelines for responsible wild camping should be established, which include leave no trace principles, encouraging good practice.",
