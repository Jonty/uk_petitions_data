        "additional_details": "The theft of pets has been on the increase over the last few years and with pet prices increasing we have also seen an increase in the theft of pets.\r\n At present Pets are classified in the same category as a mobile phone, lawnmower or inanimate object. Pets are not inanimate objects, they are much more than that and provide emotional support, physical support and help with mental wellbeing. Most would classify them as part of the family and current sentencing does not take this into account.",
        "background": "We would like the Government to reclassify pet theft into its own category with tougher sentencing, taking into account the emotional trauma it causes, rather than it being in the same category as theft of an inanimate object such as a lawnmower or phone.",
