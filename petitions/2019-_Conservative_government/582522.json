        "additional_details": "With non-essential shops and facilities opening on April 12th, it is ridiculous to think that non-league clubs are not allowed spectators until May 17th despite being outdoors and fully able to social distance. With Cups in place to fill the void left by a curtailed season, how is it fair to reject fans while Spa's, Beauty Salons, Gyms and Leisure Centres opening with a far higher risk of Covid. We must allow fans back if for no other reason then for the diminishing morale of those who enjoy it.",
