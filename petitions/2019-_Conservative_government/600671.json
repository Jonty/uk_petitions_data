They cause so much distress to pets and vulnerable people, and on the night of 5/6 November this year we had them going off all night, they're still going at 10am. And as today is a Saturday, even though Bonfire Night is past, we can expect them again tonight and possibly tomorrow, as it's still the weekend. Then at New Year it will start again.",
