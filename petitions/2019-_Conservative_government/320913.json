        "additional_details": "Arthur is kept on his lead at all times. If anyone approaches us we immediately move out of their way by a considerable margin. \r\n\r\nHowever, too often and more so now, we encounter other dog walkers who in open spaces such as parks and meadows allow their dog(s) to run free. Habitually the other dog(s) will approach us. \r\n\r\nAsking the owner to put their dog(s) back on a lead generally has no effect. The owner then has to come and get their dog(s). In doing so, they encroach on me making it difficult to socially distance.",
        "background": "I am a person in the extremely vulnerable category. And I am fully aware that I should be shielding at home. But I am also a dog owner. And both Arthur, my Jack Russell, and I need to exercise. Since starting isolation, we go for an hour's walk each day so as stay both physically and mentally fit.",
