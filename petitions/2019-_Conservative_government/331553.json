        "action": "I want to replace the BBC compulsory licence fee with a new arrangement",
        "additional_details": "I believe that the BBC compulsory TV licence fee at present is not fit for purpose in today's world.\r\nA survey has shown that 75% of the public want the BBC licence fee abolished and support the introduction of a subscription model which would be fairer to everybody, especially for those people that don\u2019t watch it. \r\nAlso, many people consider it wrong that you can be imprisoned and get a criminal record just for not paying for your TV licence and that it\u2019s enforcement punish the vulnerable. \r\nThat is why I propose putting forward this petition.",
        "background": "I want the government to change the way the BBC licence fee is funded, i.e. by making it a subscription only channel or funded by advertising as all other free view channels are funded.",
