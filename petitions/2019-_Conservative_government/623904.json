        "additional_details": "K Kwarteng's budget, of Sept 22, will increase the ever widening gap between the rich and poor.\r\n\r\nThe energy caps should not be paid for by the people, when many big energy companies are making massive profits.\r\n\r\nChanges, such as removing the 45% highest income bracket and removing restrictions like banker bonuses, will not boost the economy. They clearly only serve the most wealthy and promote risk taking in the banking sector.\r\n\r\nIf the Tory party is \"leveling-up\", this budget fails to deliver.",
        "background": "K Kwarteng's budget must be repealed, the changes only benefit the most wealthy and big business, whilst saddling the public with massive debts. At the least, we must:\r\n\r\n* Fund all energy price caps through a windfall tax\r\n* Reinstate 45% the highest tax band\r\n* Reinstate limits on banker bonuses",
