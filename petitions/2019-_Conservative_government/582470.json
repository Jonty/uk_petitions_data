        "additional_details": "At present, EY funding is released on 3 sets of dates throughout the year, meaning that some children born just after the cut off date, say 1st April, have to wait another 5 months before they are able to receive any funding.  This additional 5 months some parents pay for 1 child could cost them an additional \u00a35200 (average UK full time cost) compared with another child born a day earlier.  For some families, this means another 5 months unable to work.",

All children and families should be entitled to equal support no matter what day they were born.",
