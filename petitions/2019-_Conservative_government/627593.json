        "additional_details": "Currently, the Prime Minister plans to revise the Equality Act 2010 to remove protections for transgender people.  Hate crimes against the protected characteristics continue to rise, with a 56% increase in the number of hate crimes towards transgender people between March 2021-2022 (gov.uk).  The protected characteristics need protecting from the government, as without the Equality Act, minority groups have no legal protection from hate crimes, whether in public, in school or in employment.",
        "background": "We want Parliament to pass an Act that prevents the government from removing the rights of any of the Protected Characteristics as stated under the Equality Act 2010.",
