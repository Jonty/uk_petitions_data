Factors such as seat height and firmness, as well as mostly male crash-test dummies that don\u2019t account for female muscle mass distribution, bone density, and pregnancy play a significant role in this. \r\nAs a result, in a car crash a woman is:\r\n\u2022\t47% more likely to be seriously injured.\r\n\u2022\t17% more likely to die. \r\nMen are twice as likely to get into car crashes, yet women still have an overall higher chance of suffering serious injury.",

It revealed that women are at a significantly higher risk in many aspects of life. The section regarding car safety stuck out to me as a young woman approaching driving age.",
