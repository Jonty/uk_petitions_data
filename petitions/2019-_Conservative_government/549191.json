        "additional_details": "We believe that the current system of private donations creates opportunity for corruption and influence peddling, and that the only way to tackle this is to exclude private contributions to political parties and politicians.\r\n \r\nGenerous public funding should provide the foundation for a renewal of our politics and thence our public administration and government, and eventually of our society.\r\n",
