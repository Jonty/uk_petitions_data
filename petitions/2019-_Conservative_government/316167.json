        "additional_details": "Testing is key to limiting and controlling the spread of this virus. Not only frontline health staff but the wider community including children are affected. Other countries such as Germany and South Korea have had extensive testing for weeks and this has significantly reduced the death rates,spread and impact on society. If the UK has capacity - which it does - we should use that capacity without delay.  This petition originates from a nurse whose colleagues have died while working in the NHS.",
        "background": "To enable evidence based decision making about the COVID -19 outbreak in the UK we request the government involve the widest possible range of UK suppliers in the provision of COVID-19 laboratory testing. We strongly support Sir Paul Nurse's proposal for a Dunkirk approach.",
