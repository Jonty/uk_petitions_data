        "action": "Stop excluding thousands of annually paid employees from furlough support scheme",
        "additional_details": "The UK has 2 million+ owner-directors of small businesses, many paid low annual salaries. It is unfair to exclude employees paid annually later in the same tax year, yet CJRS makes them ineligible by requiring employers to have sent an RTI to HMRC before 19/03/20. As the annual PAYE guidance was not posted until May, many, unable to work, discovered they were ineligible after 6 wks of furlough and cannot claim Universal Credit. Covering 80% of these salaries would give a lifeline to thousands.",
        "background": "Many long-term, tax-paying employees who contribute to society via small businesses are unjustly left out of CJRS simply because they are paid annually at the end of the tax year. We call upon the government to revise the law and direct HMRC to include those paid annually from 19/03/20 to 05/04/20.",
