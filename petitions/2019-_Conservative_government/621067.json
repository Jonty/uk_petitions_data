        "additional_details": "The new legislation could for example say that parties keep everything they had before marriage and share equally everything accumulated during the marriage. Such or similar is the case in many other countries. Spouses should be able to have a legally enforceable nuptial agreements to define which assets and property belong to the marriage and which to each party individually. Disputes should be settled according to contract law.",
        "background": "The rules governing marriage and divorce are not set out in a single piece of legislation. The Government should set out the terms of marriage in a new Marriage Act, give nuptial agreements legal recognition, and set out what happens in the event of a divorce where there is no nuptial agreement.",
