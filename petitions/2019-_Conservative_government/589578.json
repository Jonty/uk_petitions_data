The subsequent Jubilee Medal awards were far more fairly conducted and it is requested that the Silver Jubilee Medal be awarded to those, still alive or posthumously, who served during the time of the Queens Silver Jubilee.\r\nIt could either be awarded in the normal way or permission be granted, giving those qualified, the opportunity to buy and wear their own.",
