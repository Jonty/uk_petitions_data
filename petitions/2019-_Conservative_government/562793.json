        "additional_details": "For years the BBC was a well respected and non biased organisation providing top quality content for the licence payers. These days are long over, the BBC's content and constant drive for \"wokeness\" has destroyed what it once was. The licence fee that is forced on the people regardless of if they watch or record live is atrocious and outdated, many people use streaming services with total dislike for BBC programming and values. Strike of the licence fee, refund the charges for the past 3 years.",
