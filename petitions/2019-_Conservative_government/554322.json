A society devoid of fine Art, Music, Poetry or Theatre, a society rife where no one knows where they came from, where they are going, or how and why someone else thinks the way that they do is naught but a dried husk of a society in which no one would truly wish to live.",
        "background": "To reverse (at least in part) the cuts made to Teacher Training bursaries for English, the Arts and Humanities subjects. This decision  will do lasting damage to these subjects by putting off the highly qualified practitioners that they need.",
