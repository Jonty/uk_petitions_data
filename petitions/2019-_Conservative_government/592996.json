        "additional_details": "As this summer shows again, we cannot ignore anymore that climate change affects workplaces as much as anything else. There's tens of thousands of people working in factories and warehouses, where maximum temperature at summer can reach a 35-40 celsius indoor (depending of the structure and the condition of the building). It's not only uncomfortable, but also a health risk. We're all have different tolerance of heat, but none of us can stand 35 celsius for 8 hours for days.",
