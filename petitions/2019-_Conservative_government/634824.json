        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to review provision of fully accessible toilets in NHS hospitals. Standard wheelchair accessible toilets are not meeting the health and sanitation needs of a wide range of people, particularly those with limb loss or shortened limbs.\r\n \r\nThere needs to be suitable staff disabled toilets in all hospitals as well. Toilets should be maintained regularly and cleaned well too. I can use disabled toilets at public places, public attractions and many more places but I can't use the toilets everywhere in the NHS. There are 14.6 million disabled people in the UK and there's an ageing population, so this needs to be addressed.\r\n",
        "background": "I used to work in the NHS as a trainee pharmacist and I'm a double amputee. One of the reasons that I was unable to complete my foundation training year is due to accessibility issues. I graduated with a First Class Master of Pharmacy degree, but I've been forced to leave the pharmacy profession.",
