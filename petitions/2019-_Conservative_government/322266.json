        "additional_details": "The r rating is going down. In September their is only 2 months before the potential next wave and so we need to see how the schools perform in the summer months.\r\n\r\nFurther, I understand the teachers are concerned. But our NHS, supermarkets and soon to be shops are opening soon and if they are returning back, then the teachers should too. They are at less risk due to the population they are being exposed too.\r\nI am also aware the private schools are returning too.",
        "background": "We would like all children, all years to return to school, unless they have any underlying health issues in the immediate family. This is for the both education, well being and for the countries economy. We need to try and get back to normality in the summer months rather than wait until September.",
