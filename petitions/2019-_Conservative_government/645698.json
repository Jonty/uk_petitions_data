        "additional_details": "Requiring the school day to end by 3.30pm will give many students more quality time to spend with family, and give them more time to complete any homework or chores without feeling rushed or overwhelmed. I think this will make a positive impact on the student but also their education, as they may be better able to focus if they are not required to be at school for as long.",
        "background": "Some schools don't finish until after 4pm. We believe this is too late, and that all schools should be required to finish by 3.30pm, to give children time to spend with their family and friends, avoid them getting overtired at school, and reduce the burden on teachers.",
