        "additional_details": "This new requirement covering table service may well drive smaller pubs out of business. The number of customers makes it uneconomic and unnecessary and it could expose staff to a higher risk of infection. Either give landlords discretionary powers, or fix a limit on size or the amount of trade so that small pubs will not be required to provide table service.\r\n\r\nFailure to do so could lead to the closure of very large numbers of pubs, particularly in rural or semi-rural settings.",
        "background": "Many small pubs simply don't have enough customers to make table service practical or necessary. In most smaller pubs excellent measures are already in place.",
