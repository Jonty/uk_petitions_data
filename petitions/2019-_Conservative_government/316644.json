        "additional_details": "Please help push forward an honour for Captain Tom Moore who is again fighting for the country he loves so much. \r\nTom Moore has again gone to battle for Great Britain and should be rewarded for his efforts. \r\nNot only has he inspired a nation again by showing that, even at the age of 99 you can still get out there and exercise but he has raised a substantial amount of money that will greatly benefit the country in the time of need. I think he is worthy to receive the honour of a knighthood.",
        "background": "Captain Tom Moore aged 99 fought for our country in the Second World War with distinction and now has been fighting again for our country to raise \u00a313 million for the NHS in these tough times. \r\nIf this isn\u2019t going above and beyond for his country on many different levels I don\u2019t know what is.",
