There is no valid argument against this, only archaic attitudes which wish to hinder change and development in our society.\r\n\r\nAttempts by Parliament to allow 16 and 17 year olds to engage in politics have been relatively ineffective. Youth Parliaments and councils go ignored, and more and more young people want a say in their futures. Young people should not be forced into silence.",
