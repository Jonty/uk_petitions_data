We're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. \r\n\r\nYour petition calls for the Government to withdraw the Health and Social Care Bill 2021 in order to prevent the creation of Integrated Care Systems. However, ICSs already exist and cover all parts of England. \r\n\r\nYou can read more about ICSs, including an assessment of the possibility of private companies taking a greater role in NHS decision making and service delivery, here:\r\nhttps://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/integrated-care-systems-explained\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do."
