        "additional_details": "We believe the current vaccination scheme is unfair to older people who are at increasing risk the older they get, according to the NHS.\r\n \r\nI understand the desire to widen the group of people who can benefit from the new vaccine but the NHS should be vaccinating older people first and working its way down the age groups.\r\n",
        "background": "The new shingles vaccine scheme prioritises those who turn 65 after 1 September 2023, who can be vaccinated when they turn 65. Anyone already aged 65-69 will have to wait until their 70th birthday before they can get the new vaccine. We want this to change, so older people are vaccinated first.",
