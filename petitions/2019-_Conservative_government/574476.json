        "additional_details": "I was very disappointed and surprised to find out that there is no funding available in the form of student loans, grants, bursaries, apprenticeships etc for courses such as Play Therapy or Child/School Counselling. Funding was actually removed in 2019 by the government for Play Therapy training! This means it is very difficult for professionals to find the money to train for these types of jobs which are vital in the world we live in at the moment in order to support our children.",
        "background": "Last week, the government announced there would be support provided for children suffering from mental health issues due to the COVID19 pandemic. In order for this support to be provided, there is a need for funding to enable professionals to be trained in relevant jobs such as Play Therapy.",
