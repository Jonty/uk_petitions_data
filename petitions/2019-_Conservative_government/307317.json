        "additional_details": "Whilst the government has now put in place funds to cover 80% of full time employees' salaries, it has done very little to help the self employed and those in the gig economy. There are around 5 million self employed in the UK and they contribute hugely to the economy. But they are being the hardest hit by the closures and the current crisis. Many are facing serious immediate financial difficulties particularly those who are renting their homes. Urgent action is required.",
