        "additional_details": "Many rural health providers struggle to provide local and timely healthcare.\r\n \r\nIt is more challenging to provide NHS services in rural communities. A number of factors contribute to unavoidable costs for providing health care in rural areas. They include:\r\n \r\n- difficulties in staff recruitment and retention, and higher overall staff costs\r\n- higher staff travel costs and unproductive staff time\r\n- difficulties in realising economies of scale while adequately serving sparsely populated areas\r\n \r\nGiven these issues, the Government should increase funding for NHS services in rural areas.",
        "background": "We want the Government to increase funding for NHS services in rural communities, like Lincolnshire, where there are almost 800,000 residents, but only 2 A&Es, and poor transport links.",
