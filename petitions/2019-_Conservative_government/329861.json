        "additional_details": "For healthcare courses in the UK, a DBS check and an Occupational Health form are required before starting the course. These combined can cost up to \u00a3200. Student loans and bursaries can\u2019t be claimed until the course has begun meaning many students struggle to pay for the necessary documents. These forms often have to be completed within a month so there isn\u2019t time to save up money. A bursary would prevent young people from being disadvantaged and discouraged in the application process.",
        "background": "The government should extend the NHS Learning Support Fund to support those who can\u2019t afford the compulsory documentation costs. To prove eligibility, students would provide evidence of their conditional offer(s), family/personal annual income and the exact cost of the documentation they need.",
