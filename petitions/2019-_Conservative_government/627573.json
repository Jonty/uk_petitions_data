        "additional_details": "Research has shown potential medical benefits to people with medical conditions such as anxiety, chronic pain, ptsd, etc. Legalisation, with clear rules on distribution, similar to America, could create new jobs and stimulate the economy. It would also stop people being sent to prison for marijuana use or possession, which should save the police, courts and prison system thousands of pounds.",
        "background": "Since cannabis was legalised in California and other countries, local economies have benefited from legalised marijuana dispensaries, which can help boost the economy and create new jobs. Legalisation can also eradicate the stigma that has surrounded marijuana for years.",
