        "additional_details": "Education for all is key to dismantling inferiority/superiority complexes and this starts in the classroom. We must deconstruct the one sided misinformation of a proud accomplished people both PRE and POST colonial and civil rights. We need a change in the repetitive forlorn and downtrodden narrative, a dated, imbalanced and bias curriculum that aids in the negative stereotypes of Black people, for the future and the stability of our society and that of our children. It is time to take action.",
        "background": "It is not enough to simply campaign for Black History to be taught in schools, we must examine and scrutinise what is being taught.The history of a vibrant and accomplished race goes far beyond politicianry and civil rights. The former predominantly the focal point over the latter giving rise to bias.",
