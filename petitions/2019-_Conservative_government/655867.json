It can be difficult to get a GP appointment and dental care can be basic and expensive. People are on very long waiting lists, and may be absent from the work force waiting for treatment. We think that employer provided health insurance promotes healthier living, reduces employee absence and saves the NHS and the benefits system money. We think that taxing people for saving the government money is simply wrong.",
