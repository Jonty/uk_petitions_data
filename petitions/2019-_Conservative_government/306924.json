        "action": "Consider extending this academic year until December in response to coronavirus.",
        "additional_details": "Suddenly ending their school year will be very hard for pupils.  An extended academic year would mean pupils could come back to their current classes/schools; a familiar educational environment; with their friends; amongst teachers who know them well \u2013 with time spent getting back to where they are now academically and socially. Many will be grieving, traumatised or negatively affected in some way, they will need some nurturing to safeguard their mental health \u2013 this will equally be the case for teachers and support staff.   This adjustment would give the possibility of pupils being able to sit some of their GCSE and A level exams.  Pupils and staff would be prepared to start the new academic year, which would be shorter but more effective, in January 2021.",
        "background": "Extend this academic year until Dec 2020 (assuming that education providers are able to reopen in the Autumn), enabling pupils to return to their current schools and classes.  Start the next academic year in Jan 2021, when students will have had the chance to readjust to educational environments.",
