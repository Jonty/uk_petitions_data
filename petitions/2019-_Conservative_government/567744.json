        "additional_details": "A Key Worker Bonus has been paid to care workers in Scotland and Wales. In England, nurses and teachers received well deserved pay rises. Some supermarket workers were also given a bonus by their employers. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the front line workers in Early Years have been stuck on minimum wages for years, if not on even lower Apprenticeship wages. \r\n\r\nNurseries, in England only, are being forced to remain open, exposing staff to a higher risk of COVID-19. Pay these workers a bonus to say thanks.",
        "background": "The government has declared Early Years to be an essential part of lifelong learning and, in England, decided to keep nurseries fully open during the January lockdown whilst closing schools. \r\n\r\nEarly Years Practitioners (nursery nurses) are often apprentices or paid minimum wage only.",
