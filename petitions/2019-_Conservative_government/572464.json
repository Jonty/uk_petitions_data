        "additional_details": "Covid-19 is a global pandemic targeting the elderly & vulnerable. There is immense inequity in vaccine distributions, with the UK buying stocks at the expense of others. Creating a system that gives less vulnerable people an option to donate their vaccine allocation \u2013 without penalty \u2013 to poor countries, will promote global recovery without risking life: our 34m least vulnerable (JCVI-defined) have less annual risk of Covid death (1 in 30,000) than of dying on the roads (1 in 20,000 \u2013 Bandolier)",
        "background": "The UK Government should enable less vulnerable UK citizens to donate their Covid-19 vaccine allocations to vulnerable populations in poorer countries that are unable to access vaccines, without penalty. This will promote global recovery from a global problem, by protecting the vulnerable worldwide.",
