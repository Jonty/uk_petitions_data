As of March 2019, over 2,000 learning disabled and autistic people were detained in ATUs & secure hospitals in the UK. This needs to stop. \r\n#WeAreHumanToo are working for change, in 2021 there are concerns that repeated abuse in some institutions is still happening.  People are being stripped of their Human Rights, living in fear without a voice.",
