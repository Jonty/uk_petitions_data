        "additional_details": "NHS workers are working around the clock, 12 hours a day (sometimes more), 4-6 days a week and staff are still being made to pay to park on hospital grounds. During this pandemic they are under even more stress to save people\u2019s lives from the virus as well as the usual medical care. Charging NHS workers to park every day when they\u2019re working so hard and making themselves ill from the stress they\u2019re under and sheer number of hours they\u2019re doing, shouldn\u2019t be another added stressor.",
        "background": "We\u2019re relying heavily on the NHS during such hard times and Staff are under so much pressure and stress as it is, without having to pay parking charges. \u00a33.20 - \u00a310 A DAY in some cases. The government should remove all car park charges (private and non private) to ALL NHS staff.",
