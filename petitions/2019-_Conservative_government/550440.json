UCAS predicted grades are a great representation of a students potential. This double lock system should be implemented to preserve justice. Private candidates should also get mental and financial support to compensate for their year that has been wasted due to government incompetence.",

Ofqual guidlines encouraged centres to deny private candidates CAGs. Leaving them in limbo. Without grades and university places. When it's not their fault.",
