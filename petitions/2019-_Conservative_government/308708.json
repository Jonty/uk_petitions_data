        "additional_details": "We all face long-term impact on future rental agreements, personal and business loans, etc. Many institutions are trying to help. However, reporting missed payments to credit bureaus is still a legal obligation; e.g. Nationwide Building Society are informing customers that loan repayment holidays up to three months are possible, but that they must report such months as 'missed payments'. Disruptions to payments should not reflect badly on anyone during this unprecedented time.",
        "background": "This year, inspired by entrepreneurs across the UK and expecting our baby daughter's arrival in March, I started my own business. As no other financial assistance is available, the Government must prevent these abnormal circumstances reflecting badly in credit reports on honest hard-working people.",
