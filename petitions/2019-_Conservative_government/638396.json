        "additional_details": "Currently, citizens are concerned that the Prime Minister evades questions, deflects issues, answers with slogans or whatever he feels will get him through PMQ's and fails to address core concerns. This undermines democracy and erodes trust in elected representatives.\r\nParliament should review and strengthen PMQ rules. By implementing these measures, PMQs will foster meaningful exchange and democratic accountability and strengthen our democracy and peoples confidence in it.",
        "background": "Urge Speaker to intervene to ensure PM answers Opposition's and others questions in PMQs. Accountability is crucial for democracy. Speaker must intervene when PM evades questions, hold PM accountable, and strengthen PMQ rules. Even if this means pro-longing PMQ's the PM must not dodge the question.",
