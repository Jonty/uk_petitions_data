        "additional_details": "This scheme is coming at a crucial time where there is a lack of funding for the NHS, victimisation of care homes for their response to the pandemic, and to distract from the government's failings, it is targeting those struggling with their weight. Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness, with more people vulnerable during this pandemic. Weight is no indicator of health and the scheme endangers the vulnerable and helps no one.",
        "background": "End the \u00a32b scheme that the Prime Minister has presented to tackle the obesity levels in the UK. This scheme harms the 1.2 million UK citizens with eating disorders. The plan will cause more disordered eating in our population, particularly calorie details on menus, alongside prescribing cycling.",
