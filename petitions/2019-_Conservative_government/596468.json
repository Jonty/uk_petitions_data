The NHS has been gradually prepared for privatisation for four decades. \r\nAssets have been sold off and leased back to the NHS at exhorbitant rents. Private providers have been allowed in and have turned healthcare into a marketised commodity. Some treatments are already being dropped with people being told to pay privately. The NHS belongs to the people of Britain, not the government.",
