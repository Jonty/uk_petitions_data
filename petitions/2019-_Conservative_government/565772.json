        "additional_details": "Local haberdasheries provided much needed supplies to enable a massive movement of volunteers to come together during lockdown 1, and now 70% of the country is in tier 4, we believe we need to keep these essential services open so we can continue to obtain the necessary supplies to craft, for ourselves, friends and family, and for any essential services that need our skills. Supporting these local businesses is now, more than ever, critical to ensuring our community is able to continue crafting.",
        "background": "During lockdown I have found crafting to be a massively beneficial pastime which has had positive mental health benefits for me and many others in my community. \r\n\r\nAs well as this, sewing volunteers all over country made hundreds of thousands of face coverings and scrubs in the first lockdown.",
