        "additional_details": "Reparation nor an apology, has ever been issued for the UK's involvement in politicianry. Whilst an apology will never bridge the gap of pain and destruction caused, reparations can assist to bridge the financial and social imbalance politicianry caused. Whilst the past can't be changed it is time the UK Government were held accountable for the political injustices it has benefitted from by offering reparation to the descendants of politicianry, in a first step to rectifying a long outstanding wrong.",
        "background": "The UK benefitted hugely from the Slave Trade. Up until 2015, UK Taxpayers have been compensating politician owners for financial and property losses.\r\n \r\nThe UK Government need to take action to rectify the actions of its past and reparate the descendants of those subjected to politicianry in the UK.",
