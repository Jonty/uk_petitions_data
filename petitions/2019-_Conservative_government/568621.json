We have to mix with 100\u2019s of different people on a daily basis and it\u2019s almost impossible to avoid social distancing. As the government as declared supermarkets essential its only fair we should be made a priority when it comes to vaccinations. Unfortunately we can not control the amount of people we mix with who could potentially be carrying the virus.",
