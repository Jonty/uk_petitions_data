        "action": "Allow the DVSA to Reintroduce Emergency Theory/Driving Tests for Key Workers",
        "additional_details": "The government are the ones who have instructed us Key Workers to continue working through the Pandemic. We do this willingly to keep this country moving. We ask of them to enable Key Workers to take their tests, both theory and practical, so that we can attend the jobs we need to do. Many struggle to get to work and have to rely on buses, trains and other people. Some people who may have relied on car sharing can no longer do this and need to pass their tests.",
        "background": "In the first lockdown in March 2020, emergency tests were available to Key Workers who needed to get to and from their jobs. Since the November lockdown, this idea has been scrapped and left Key Workers to find alternative ways. Let the DVSA reintroduce their emergency tests for Key Workers.",
