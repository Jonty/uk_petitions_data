Before the 1950s nothing in shops was wrapped in plastic meaning that it is possible and we can do it again. This would just be one step to becoming a more sustainable society and stopping the destruction of our planet and ourselves. The plastic that is destroying our oceans and wildlife eventually gets back to us and negatively impacts our health. This is effecting us too.",
        "background": "The fruit and veg wrapped in plastic is cheaper than the loose fruit and veg. This needs to be changed so that people will buy the loose fruit and veg resulting in our consumption of plastic being reduced. Some countries are already doing this. Why can't we?",
