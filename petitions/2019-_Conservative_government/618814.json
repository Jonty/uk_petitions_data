        "additional_details": "Recent research showed that 74% of Brits believe this should exist, and based on their experience, 94% think that an official employer bereavement policy should be flexible. It\u2019s estimated that bereavement at work costs the UK economy \u00a323bn a year through reduced tax revenue and increased use of NHS and social care services. Investing in appropriate bereavement leave and support could lead to a significant long-term saving for the UK economy through reduced absence and increased productivity.",
        "background": "Grief is not linear, so a Paid Leave To Grieve policy should be flexible. We're asking all parties to add to their 2024 manifesto a commitment to table an amendment bill that asks employers to offer flexible, 2-week paid leave on the death of a family member, spouse or partner; including pre-grief.",

It is up to individual political parties what to include in their manifestos.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, we could accept a petition calling on the Government to give workers a legal right to two weeks paid leave if they lose a family member or partner."
