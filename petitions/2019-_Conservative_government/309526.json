It is a win-win behavior for Cardiff to cancel the examination so that candidates can go straight to the next academic year to prevent the loss of foreign students, which is beneficial to Cardiff's economy.",
        "background": "Like the university of Birmingham, exams have been scrapped or the way they are assessed changed because many international students from overseas are unable to take them because of Internet isolation",
