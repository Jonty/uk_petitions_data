Currently, menus on food delivery websites/apps do not display allergens next to each item. We have already seen in the case of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse how a lack of information can cause deaths. Something as simple as listing the allergens, would help to save lives and reduce the risk of anaphylaxis. Everyone has the right to use these apps without worrying about their life.",
