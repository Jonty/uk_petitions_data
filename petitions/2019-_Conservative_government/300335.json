        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned call for the government to introduce legislation ensuring rescue centres are licensed and their conduct regularly monitored. \r\n\r\nAnyone can start up and run an animal rescue. Whilst a majority of these shelters are genuine, there are a few that use it as a means to make money and don\u2019t care for the animals they \u201crescue\u201d. Bringing in licensing and regular monitoring will help prevent unscrupulous persons from opening such \u201crescues\u201d and ensure animals are kept safe.",
        "background": "Currently, rescue centres don\u2019t need a local authority pet store or boarding licence to operate. There may be no inspections of these rescues, their premises, conditions or financial circumstances unless there has been a complaint made to the authorities.",
