Interest in cleaning and hygiene since the start of the pandemic has increased, so now is the time to raise standards for the UK. We currently have Food Hygiene Regulations primarily aimed at preventing cross-contamination between cooked/uncooked food and meat/fish. So why not adopt the same for the cleaning industry?",
