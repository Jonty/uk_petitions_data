        "action": "Ban virginity testing and any certificates or indicators given as a result.",
        "additional_details": "Virginity tests are a way of checking if a girl or woman is a virgin. There is no scientific way to prove virginity. A hymen can be broken during exercise, riding a bike, using a tampon or falling over. Some women are even born without a hymen. In reality these tests are used by men to intimidate and control women's behaviour. Taking the test can cause severe mental distress and, tragically, failing one can result in violence, sexual assault, banishment from the community, and honour killings.",
        "background": "MEWSo wants virginity tests banned & all adverts, certificates & gestures that convey any information related to such tests. It should be a criminal offence to conduct, administer, force or coerce these tests. There should be education to dispel the myths, and services to protect those most at risk.",
