If he has said anything that offends people then that does not diminish this achievement and it can be learnt from not hidden away. for those that don't like Winston Churchill you are free to point to his monument and teach your children about him whether your opinion is good or bad that is what is called free will that you wouldn't have without him. This man is a massive part of our history and should not be covered up under the pretence of protection rather than its real purpose to appease protestors",
