        "action": "Grant John Sentamu, former Archbishop of York, a peerage.",
        "additional_details": "As the first black Archbishop in England, it seems extraordinary that the Government would choose to exclude John Sentamu from the House of Lords. Further, in a reforming House, his life experience and knowledge would make an invaluable contribution to improving legislation as it passes through Parliament. Plus his work in breaking down barriers and promoting diversity merit a place in the Lords on their own. Please correct this oversight.",
        "background": "It has been customary for many years that retiring Archbishops in both Canterbury and York are given peerages and a seat in the House of Lords. It seems extraordinary that John Sentamu has been excluded from this tradition, and this oversight should be corrected immediately.",
