        "additional_details": "International applicants are denied the opportunity to engage in a fair application process simply because they possess a Graduate visa (also known as a post-study work visa) and not a British passport, EU settlement scheme or an Indefinite leave to remain.\r\n\r\nGraduate visas are not free - they are paid for after meeting specified requirements to enable eligibility such as successful completion of an academic programme. However, international applicants are being rejected and not even afforded the chance to show their suitability for graduate roles solely because they possess this visa, as some organisations apparently uses the right to work documents as a criteria for disqualification, regardless of them having sponsorship rights.\r\n",
