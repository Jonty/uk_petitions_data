        "additional_details": "PIP assessments can be inaccessible for some patients e.g. with fatigue. This system could be improved with a fast-track system where claims are approved by NHS staff, through a centralised, simple online system. Money could be saved as fewer PIP assessors would be needed, as they would only be needed for appeals and applications where the claimant doesn't have a diagnosis through the NHS. Certain NHS teams currently lack the time and resources to supply PIP evidence and a check box would reduce the burden on NHS staff. We believe this change would make the application process swifter, easier, accessible, and much more effective.",
        "background": "We want the Government to create a fast-track for Personal Independence Payment (PIP) claims where NHS staff can decide whether a claimant is entitled to the benefit, without the need for any formal assessment. This would mean most decisions about eligibility can be made by health professionals.",
