We believe that these incredible citizens should be rewarded for their hard work and effort. They have put their lives at risk and overcome everyday fear for the good of the country.\r\nFrozen pay is no opponent to rising prices of houses, petrol, and milk. NHS staff are paid to look after our nation, they should be able to look after their own families.",
