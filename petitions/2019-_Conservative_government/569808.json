The British government recently abolished the tampon tax, but this still isn\u2019t enough.\r\n Last year the government introduced the School period product scheme, meaning that young people had access to free period products at school should they need them. \r\nThis scheme is potentially the only way some of these young people get menstrual products which means during lockdown they\u2019re not being provided with products to keep them sanitary.",
