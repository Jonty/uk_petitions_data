        "additional_details": "There are concerns that Government policy, on issues such as climate change and the escalating energy crisis, is influenced by wealthy individuals and companies that donate to political parties. \r\n \r\nUnder the system proposed, donations to parties would be limited to individuals, allowing for supporters of a party to still be able to donate but also assuring that the integrity of our democracy is preserved from influence by large donors. This should help ensure that parties serve their voters, and not big donors.",
        "background": "Impose a limit on donations to political parties to \u00a31000 per person per party per year and restrict party donations to individuals only (no companies or other organisations).\r\n \r\nIf an organisation or individual were to be found breaking this, the funds would be seized by the government.",
