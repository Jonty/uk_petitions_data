        "additional_details": "Regulating the use of ethical AI is critical to protecting citizens and their jobs in a rapidly advancing technological age. AI can displace workers and exacerbate social inequality, leading to economic insecurity. Unregulated AI systems can also perpetuate bias and discrimination, harming marginalised groups. Ethical AI regulation should promote transparency, accountability, and fairness in AI development and deployment, ensuring responsible use and safeguarding job opportunities.",
        "background": "We believe the advancement of AI technology poses significant risks, from job displacement to biased decision-making. Regulation is needed to protect against these risks. The Government has a responsibility to protect its citizens and ensure that AI is developed and used ethically.",
