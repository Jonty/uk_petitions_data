        "additional_details": "We would like government to remove the franchise from Greater Anglia just like with Northern Rail.\r\n\r\nWeekend Engineering works means I find it hard to get a train at weekends, more than a half of the year it seems there are no trains available at weekends. Despite these works the service has no improvement and the cost has gone up considerably, we have seen landslides cancel services and now speed restrictions cancel peak hour trains due the track no being fit for purpose. The environmental impact is now being hit as I know of many individuals that are returning to their cars instead of the train.",
        "background": "For many years now I have found the service provided to be inadequate and overpriced, yet further increases this year and yet still hardly any weekend service and any service that does run during peak hours is often delayed. ",
