        "additional_details": "Essex being placed in the High category would massively harm our already struggling local economy with businesses in the hospitality, entertainment and travel sectors being hit particularly hard. It is also important that Essex County Council are stopped from making this decision as It will mean many of our towns will be in a higher category than many towns around the UK with higher cases. Allowing ECC to make this decision makes a mockery of the government\u2019s new three tier system.",
        "background": "This petition is to ask the government to stop Essex County Council trying to add Essex to the new \u2018High\u2019 category despite Covid case numbers not reaching the governments own criteria for the High\u2019 category. The council have made this decision without consulting with the people of Essex.",
