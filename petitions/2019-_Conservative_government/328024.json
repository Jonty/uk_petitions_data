        "additional_details": "Currently, people have to \u2018prove\u2019 their gender by handing in a series of documents, including the aforementioned medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria reviewed by a panel that will not meet the applicant.\r\nThis should not be needed under the reform. The Equality Act has \u2018safeguards\u2019 to protect single-sex spaces for women however this will exclude transgender people from single-sex spaces like bathrooms and locker rooms, and services they require access to, such as refuges and homeless shelters.",
        "background": "The government is reportedly planning to scrap the reform of the Gender Recognition Act. The reform sought to change a lengthy, bureaucratic and expensive process where you required a medical diagnosis to change the gender listed on your birth certificate.\r\nThis reform is needed now more than ever.",
