        "additional_details": "Discrimination is becoming increasingly apparent within our society, especially over social media during the COVID-19 pandemic. These issues regarding discrimination need government legislation as this problem is ongoing and efforts by the general public need to be backed by the government. Some actions, if not made virtually, would lead to arrest and prosecution. However, due to lack of regulation, these people over social media do not receive punishment.",
        "background": "Ensure social media companies don\u2019t provide a platform for people to discriminate with no consequences. Filtering out and reporting any discriminatory actions should be a necessity. Legislation surrounding this topic will decrease the large number of social media users anonymously abusing others.",
