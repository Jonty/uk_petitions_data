        "additional_details": "We want help with childcare to be extended to all unpaid carers claiming Universal Credit, because the carer, while unpaid, is working at least full time as a carer. And yet, they do not get the same support with childcare as claimants in paid employment. This is particularly unfair where someone is an unpaid carer for a partner who cannot work.\r\n \r\nThis means unpaid carers are responsible for their children as well as their caring responsibilities, and we believe should be entitled to the same help with childcare as someone in paid work. A person in paid work is likely to have a higher income than an unpaid carer, and the costs of even part-time childcare can be totally unaffordable to parents who are unpaid carers.\r\n",
        "background": "Currently Universal Credit claimants must be in work in order to be able to claim  back up to 85% of childcare costs. This means that anyone who is a full-time unpaid carer, but is not also in paid work, is not entitled to help with childcare costs. This is true for single or joint claims.",
