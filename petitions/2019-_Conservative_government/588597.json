        "additional_details": "There should be enough data to show that those vaccinated carry very little risk of testing positive for Covid, making the restrictions unnecessary at best. At worst it\u2019s a waste of police resources to check on people and the tests seem like a money making scheme. We should be able to trust the vaccine works and and open up the UK again, especially for those desperate to see loved ones living overseas. It will also allow people to holiday in Europe freely as other countries already do this.",
        "background": "The government needs to remove quarantine for all fully vaccinated people arriving in the UK from Amber list countries. Most other countries in Europe are now doing this and the UK risks being left behind.",
