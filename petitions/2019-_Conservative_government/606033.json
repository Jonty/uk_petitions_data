        "additional_details": "The current government has lost its mandate to govern. The last election was won by the Conservative government on the basis of \u201cGetting Brexit Done\u201d. But now that Brexit has happened, the government have used their majority to force through laws that many 2019 voters did not even support. They have also broken many manifesto promises, and therefore this government has no right to govern the country.\r\n\r\nHad the 2019 election not taken place, we were due an election in 2022 anyway.",
        "background": "With the expected removal of the Fixed Term Parliament Act 2011, the government could force a general election at whatever time they choose. This gives the opportunity for the government to take its case to the country and give us a say on who governs Britain.",
