The largest rescue, the Greyhound Trust, have up to a one year waiting list. Greyhounds retained by greyhound trainers have found to be kept in barbaric conditions, no light, no bedding, lying in their own urine, no access to water, suffering with untreated injuries. No routine kennel inspections are required by any authority.",

Greyhounds are used commercially and once they are no longer of use,  protection is insufficient.",

Investigating possible offences would be a matter for the police, not the Government or House of Commons.\r\n\r\nYou could start a petition calling on the Government to regulate greyhound trainers by creating licensing requirements and new standards for the keeping of greyhounds, if that is what you want to happen."
