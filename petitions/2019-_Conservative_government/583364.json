        "additional_details": "Of the 6 PL teams involved 5 are owned by foreign investors who clearly don\u2019t have local interests at heart. They are motivated solely by money with no consideration for native fans, past and current who made it what it is today or, for the grassroots football played all over.\r\n\r\nNationalising, and implementing the 50+1 rule would give ownership of the clubs back to us, it would increase competition and would prevent the dissolution of a fundamentally British part of life. Bring football home.",
        "background": "The creation of the European Super League intends to take 6 of the inaugural Premier League clubs out of the UK. Football is at the heart of this great nation and this petition proposes that the government nationalise the industry and give the British public control of our once great sport.",
