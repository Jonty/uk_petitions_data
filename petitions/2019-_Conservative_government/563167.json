        "additional_details": "Many areas in the UK have been affected, meaning young people are not being properly educated and have lost too much time, while in other areas, students are receiving proper education. As a student, I must say that the exams are stressing not only me, but other students and my friends too. This is severely affecting our mental health and even with the new changes done to the exams, too many schools are being put at a disadvantage. Schools do not need to be closed, but exams should be scrapped.",
        "background": "GCSE and A-Level exams must be cancelled due to large amounts of time lost during the coronavirus pandemic. Teacher assessed grades should be given. Otherwise, students should be given the option to not do their exams and receive teacher assessed grades. England must respond just like Wales did.",
