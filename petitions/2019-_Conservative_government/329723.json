        "additional_details": "Yemen is simultaneously facing a violent conflict, cholera epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic. Yemen's medical facilities and food supplies have been decimated by the ongoing conflict. 25% of its population are classified as malnourished and 80% need humanitarian assistance.\r\n\r\nThe UN is still $1bn short of the $2.4bn needed for aid in Yemen. Without this, it is estimated that 230,000 Yemenis will die of COVID-19. We must act immediately to prevent a further tragedy in Yemen.",
        "background": "Stop facilitating the conflict in Yemen by ceasing the supply of arms via Saudi Arabia. Advocate for a permanent ceasefire across the whole of Yemen. Increase funding to UN Yemen aid efforts - this should reflect the profits the UK has made from the conflict (arms deals worth at least \u00a34.7bn).",
