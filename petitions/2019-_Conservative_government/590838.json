        "additional_details": "In addition to the risk of hearing loss, loud fireworks can be a significant disturbance for autistic people and people with PTSD, hyperacusis, and dementia.\r\n\r\nThe noise is distressing to animals. The panic induced by loud fireworks can lead to injury and death to horses and birds. Wild animals abandon their young in fear. Bees can become disoriented and unable to find their way back to their hives. They can make it difficult for service dogs and support animals to carry out their duties.",
        "background": "At the current 120 dB limit, fireworks are a source of disturbance for people and animals. Even brief exposure to 120 dB can risk hearing loss.\r\n\r\nQuiet fireworks are available at 70 dB, and hearing damage can occur above 85 dB. We suggest reducing the legal dB limit of Fireworks to 70-85 dB.",
