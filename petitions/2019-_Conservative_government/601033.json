        "additional_details": "I feel that as a mother with a deaf son whose only 15 months. There is very limited sign language around, not all children understand, so we feel like this would be extremely beneficial to bring sign language in as a GCSE, to help the deaf community be able to feel accepted, to be able to communicate with other students and not feel alone, this will widen their ability to learn and be able to have a different range of communication between all, so one student/ child doesn\u2019t feel alone.",
        "background": "We would like all schools to start including sign language in their curriculum, we would like this to become a GCSE. We know that this is an extremely important subject, to help the deaf community not feel so isolated, To feel apart of a community to all.",
