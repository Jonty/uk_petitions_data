        "action": "Reverse cuts to central government funding for local government made since 2010",
        "additional_details": "I have worked in local government for several years and have seen the effects of central government cuts to local authority funding. There is a high demand for a wide variety of public services and local populations are increasingly vulnerable. However, cuts mean authorities need to make efficiency savings by reducing staff and the services they offer. Reversing the cuts should stop this and mean the burden of funding reduced services isn't passed on to the public through further council tax rises, especially during a cost of living crisis.",
        "background": "Since 2010 successive governments have cut central funding for local authorities. It is estimated that Government-funded spending power of local authorities has fallen by over 50%. There has been an increasing reliance on higher council tax charges, which affect ordinary people and can lead to debt.",
