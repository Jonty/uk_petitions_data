        "additional_details": "Across the country, standard hours have changed due to earlier opening times for Licensed Premises. More Door Supervisors have been resourced for Retail security etc. The shortage of staff increases but the vacancies are unappealing because of the poor rates of pay. NMW for some Retail work. It is unfair and degrading considering SIA staff have to pay for courses/license and renewals now only subject to completing and paying for up-skilling and first aid training.\r\nNow being worse off financially.",
        "background": "Door Supervision has become increasingly needed across the UK and there is still a great lack of Door staff. Security especially since the beginning of the pandemic and after the easing of restrictions and Lockdowns has become more and more needed. It is about time the basic ROP was increased.",
