        "additional_details": "This needs to be looked at and considered a move from tier 2 to tier 3. Greater Manchester has been under the strictest restrictions since back in March, we have all played our part in keeping each other safe and are being punished for doing so! Our rates are very low in most boroughs, if you wish to keep the few areas which are high in tier 3, then do so, do not punish us all. You really should be thinking of peoples mental health, people\u2019s jobs and small businesses, not to mention the hospitality sector, which this has near enough wiped out!!!",
        "background": "This needs to be looked at and considered a move from tier 2 to tier 3. We have had zero proof that our infection rates and hospitalisations can warrant us being in tier 3, this is because you are very aware our rates are very low and we should already be in tier 3!",
