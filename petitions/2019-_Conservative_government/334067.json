        "action": "Remove the restriction for face coverings during a wedding ceremony",
        "additional_details": "The government should reconsider face coverings at a wedding ceremony as the guests have likely already been in close contact and the risk is very low, how can 30+ strangers gather in a restaurant to eat for an hour yet two families can't attend a wedding ceremony for 15 to 30 minutes without face coverings? There is no scientific evidence of the risk\r\n\r\nWedding businesses are very hard hit already and this will result in less weddings and more wedding suppliers going out of business.",
        "background": "From August 8th 2020 the government are making it a requirement for everyone at a wedding ceremony to wear a face covering.The only exception is for the bride and groom. This is going to limit the number of weddings taking place and and badly affect wedding businesses that are already struggling.",
