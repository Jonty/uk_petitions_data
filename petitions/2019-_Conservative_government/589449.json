We need a warning that a particular show or film specifically has photosensitive material. This would help reduce anxiety when using these platforms, but more importantly, potentially stop preventable seizures.",
        "background": "I am proposing that the Government introduces requirements for photosensitive warnings on streaming sites. Around 20,000 people in the UK have photosensitive epilepsy where seizures can be triggered by flashing lights. Streaming sites often do not use trigger warnings.",
