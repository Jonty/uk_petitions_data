        "action": "Hold Boris Johnson & UK Gov Accountable for a Delayed Response to the Pandemic",
        "additional_details": "UK Government and Boris Johnson should accept responsibility for a delayed/insufficient response, delayed/unclear lockdown and disproportionate infection/death rates. Why did they not take greater action at airports and stop flights sooner? Why were there not enough security and virus checks in place in airports? \r\n\r\nAs a result there is a huge distrust between the public and government, deeming lockdown ineffective and leading to inevitablely increased death rates.",
        "background": "Why was lockdown announced in March, three months after China declared a global state of emergency through WHO. Why was no action taken in January when Boris was on his Caribbean cruise and missed three Cobra meetings? Why did UK government not take responsibility and take action without Boris?",
