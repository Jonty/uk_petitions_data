        "additional_details": "Since 2015, Saudi Arabia has played an active part in the Yemeni Civil War. As a result of their countless airstrikes and attacks, thousands of innocent civilians have been killed. Poverty and disease are widespread, and about 80% of the population is dependent on humanitarian aid as a means for survival. In the midst of this pandemic, Yemenis are suffering more than ever. UK-made arms have already played a huge part in the bombing of Yemen; to continue these sales is nothing short of criminal.",
        "background": "Yemen is currently facing the largest humanitarian crisis in the world, and Saudi Arabia must be held accountable. The UK must not resume arms sales with Saudi Arabia when they have inflicted such inexplicable suffering on the people of Yemen.",
