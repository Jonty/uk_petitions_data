Fee\u2019s which are required to pay back are substantial. Thus, it is unfair to have paid such fees when students are not receiving their teaching in the manner which has been paid for. Online classes/online exams mean that we are not learning the content or sitting assessments as should be. This is very unfair & a huge inconvenience.",
