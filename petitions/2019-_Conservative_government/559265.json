        "action": "Ban importation manufacture distribution & sale of fireworks with noise element",
        "additional_details": "Every year decibel level of fireworks continues to increase. They are being used all throughout the year often at night causing sleep disturbance and trauma for elderly, vulnerable people, children, pets and the general public. This matter has been raised many times to local authorities & the police. Placing time restrictions on use has proven ineffective and police officers have stated they are powerless to enforce this for practical reasons. A ban as mentioned above would resolve the matter.",
        "background": "Government should legislate a ban on the importation, manufacture, sale and distribution of fireworks with a noise element. Fireworks can be made without the need for a 'loud bang', this will allow users to enjoy the visual display without creating a noise disturbance for those around them.",
