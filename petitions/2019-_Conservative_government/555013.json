        "additional_details": "Someone should be held accountable for the impact these decisions have made on the general population. Lives have been destroyed because those in power have not listened to advice quickly enough or used information on trends from other countries to establish a plan. The UK is the worst affected country in Europe despite having 2-3 weeks of seeing what was happening in other countries.",
        "background": "A public enquiry is needed to investigate the gross mismanagement of awarding PPE contracts to newly formed companies, sending vulnerable people back into care homes without testing, implementing lockdown too late, the testing farces and millions wasted on track and trace.",
