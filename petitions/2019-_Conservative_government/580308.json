With the growing importance of Social Media in younger peoples lives, they need to be aware of what news sources they can trust especially on key things like politics. Furthermore, younger people are more manipulatable, so they need correctly educating (by a senior figure in their lives i.e. a teacher) how to participate in our democracy.",
        "background": "Young people need obligatory lessons on Political Parties, Electoral Systems and The Constitution and the running of our country. By learning this from a younger age, then they can independently formulate their own political views, meanwhile, increase political participation in our democracy.",
