        "additional_details": "The current Covid 19 crisis has seen many farmers having to pour milk away and prices slashed. The supermarkets have in many places run out of milk yet many farmers are being asked to 'dump' their milk. The current supply chain is not fit for purpose and this epidemic has again highlighted the need for the Government to step in and establish a fair trade to ensure the milk supply is reaching the demand. The MMB will guarantee a fair price for farmers, packers & processors alike whilst ensuring farmers can afford the best animal husbandry practices.",
        "background": "The Milk Marketing Board (MMB) up until 1994 controlled the production and distribution of Milk. Since its abolition Dairy Farmers have been subjected to one sided contracts in favour of the processors & packers. The re-establishment of the MMB will help create a fair trade market place.",
