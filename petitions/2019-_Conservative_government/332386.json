        "additional_details": "The COVID-19 pandemic has rocked all of our lives. Nurses have shown up day and night for the general public. They have saved lives, and held hands where lives could not be saved. \r\n\r\nWe stood on our doorsteps up and down the land clapping for them each Thursday night. Claps don't pay the bills. Due to inflation, nurses are worse off now financially than they were in 2010 (https://fullfact.org/health/nurse-pay-may-2020/).\r\n\r\nLet's put this right and financially recognise their truly heroic efforts.",
        "background": "On 21.7.2020 nurses were omitted from UK public sector pay rises as  a pay deal spanning 2018-2021 is in place. I would like the Government to bring forward a further pay rise to 2020 to give timely financial compensation to nurses for their heroic efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
