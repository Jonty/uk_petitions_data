The criteria of the offence is half complete as consent is distinct but intentions are ambiguous. My private images were shared without consent during a seemingly trusting relationship. These were posted on indecent and pornographic websites to satisfy his sexual desire to degrade me online.",

This excludes those that act for sexual gratification, financial gain, or to humiliate the victim (or those who are indifferent). Distress and embarrassment regardless of intent must be included to fill this gap.",
