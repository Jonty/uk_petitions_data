        "additional_details": "The UK is going through an economical crisis that has seen budgets cut everywhere and it is negatively impacting children causing a rise in poverty and a need for support from charities. Children will sometimes go into schools not having had any food at home and will go home to no food. By providing fruit trees the children can have free access to them where they can take fruit home and be at ease knowing that they have access to some form of food. This includes fruit trees in public spaces.",
        "background": "I want the Government to make it compulsory that every school in the UK has fruit trees planted on the grounds of the school to make a food source accessible to children who might not otherwise have food available to them whilst also planting more fruit trees around the UK in public spaces.",
