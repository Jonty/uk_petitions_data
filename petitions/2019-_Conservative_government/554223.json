        "additional_details": "Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, many students have missed out on a huge chunk of learning, leaving huge gaps in their knowledge. We're asking the Government and/or Parliament to remove content from the GCSE and A-Level specification in all subjects, to give students a chance to progress further into their adult life/career. Without a content reduction, Grades could be considerably lower, once again linking to the fact that many students have had no teacher to pupil intervention.",
