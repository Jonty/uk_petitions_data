        "additional_details": "As a survivor of domestic violence more than three years ago, I am hearing much too often of people being severely abused by partners who are supposed to love and protect them. Offenders are often released on bail multiple times, and the physical and mental trauma us survivors go through during these times are horrific. Often offenders are released after a short time, and free to go back to life as a free person, while survivors may be left using medication and trauma therapy just to get us through life. It needs to change.",
        "background": "The Government should increase minimum and maximum sentences for men and woman who are commit domestic violence offences. Offenders should also be subject to strict bail conditions, ineligible for early release, and sentences for additional offences should be served consecutively, not concurrently.",
