        "action": "Ban the use of beagles in Laboratory experiments",
        "additional_details": "The national institute of health reports that every 95 out of 100 drugs that pass in animal tests fail in humans. Animal experiments are so worthless that up to half of them are never even published. New footage has shown whimpering beagles being forced into overcrowded crates, by the scruff of their neck to then be taken away to Labs across the country that will then perform painful experiments on 'mans best friend'. We claim to be a nation of dog lovers, dogs are family and this needs to end.",
        "background": "Thousands of thinking and feeling Beagles are used in torturous experiments every year in the UK. They're left to spend their short, painful lives in cages. The government needs to listen to the people, support Camp Beagle and end the evil that is happening in the heart of the British countryside.",
