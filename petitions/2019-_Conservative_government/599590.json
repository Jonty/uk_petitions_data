        "additional_details": "Many employees sign contracts that allow their employers to dismiss them if the employee posts something the employer believes \"could\" impact their reputation. This broad definition has resulted in many employers dismissing employees with no evidence that they have negatively affected them. Dismissed employees often rely on government support, costing the taxpayer money. We believe judges have too often sided with employers, so it is time for the Government to take action and protect workers and free speech.",
        "background": "The Government should make it illegal for employers to dismiss or discipline employees for the content they post or produce publicly, unless the content clearly defames the employer or there is clear evidence that the content has negatively impacted the employer.",
