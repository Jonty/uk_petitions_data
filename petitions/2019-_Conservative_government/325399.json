        "additional_details": "We can\u2019t expect society to grow, change or to foster equality when we are not providing the education that our children deserve. The curriculum is Eurocentric and disregards the achievements and contributions of those from a BAME background. We have an expectation of children being the voice of the future but we don\u2019t give them the right tools. We need to educate about racism and its pervasiveness in all areas of society to ensure we don\u2019t keep repeating the same discriminatory narrative.",
        "background": "Amend the national curriculum so pupils are taught about racism, the devastating effects of colonialism and the ways in which racism pervades our society today. The national curriculum should also be amended to include the achievements and cultural contributions of those from a BAME background.",
