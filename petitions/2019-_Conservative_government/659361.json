        "additional_details": "The early detection of brain cancer and other degenerative eye disorders is imperative to treat and improve the prognosis for many patients. However, eye testing still remains inaccessible to many, and can be last on the list of expenses since the rise in the cost of living. We believe that with an eye test being free as part of the NHS, these life-threatening and life-changing conditions could be identified in the early stages, when symptoms may not be apparent, to improve prognosis and the chance of recovery.",
