The UK has a huge amount of coastline affected by plastic waste. On both counts it makes sense for us to give a lead globally. Plastic bans have proved effective in other countries. It is essential that we drastically reduce the production of new plastics and work towards an efficient, circular economy.\r\n\r\nMicroplastics in placentas:\r\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/22/microplastics-revealed-in-placentas-unborn-babies\r\n\r\nMarine Conservation Society on plastics on UK Coast:\r\nhttps://www.mcsuk.org/clean-seas/microplastics",
