        "additional_details": "For most people, there is no place safer than home. However, for children in an abusive household, it can be the most dangerous, even life threatening. With schools having been closed during lockdown, referrals to child abused surged. And with further restrictions coming into effect, more must be done to protect children. British Association of Social Workers found that 65% of social workers say referrals are up compared with September 2019. If more is not done, children\u2019s lives will be at risk.",
        "background": "I want the government to give more funding to social services and schools to help protect children in abusive households. More must be done in the public health crisis to help vulnerable children be more aware about how to seek help. The government must show that their suffering will not be unheard.",
