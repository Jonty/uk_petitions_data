        "additional_details": "Along with the freedom of movement being reduced like the previous congestion charge this will increase traffic in the surrounding areas. Unlike the previous congestion charge the new proposed zone is generally residential; which would penalise many residents and SME's for living and operating in those areas.\r\n\r\nThis will have a negative affect for many of us especially SME's as this would increase transport, and operation costs while reducing revenue due to the reduction in footfall.",
