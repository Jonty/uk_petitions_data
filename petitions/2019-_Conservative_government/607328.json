        "additional_details": "Sarah's Law and Claire's Law were passed to protect women & children. I believe similar arrangements are needed for social media. Requiring users to have a criminal record check before getting a social media account could save lives , so that people convicted of any offences can be refused social media accounts. This subject is very important to me. I have experienced DV, Physical & Sexual abuse.  I believe we need to move with the ever growing digital age.",
        "background": "I have witnessed first-hand, women and children being exploited online. Some by repeat offenders, some leading to significant harm to women and children. I believe that it is too easy for people to join social media, and set up social media groups, without having to undergo any checks.",
