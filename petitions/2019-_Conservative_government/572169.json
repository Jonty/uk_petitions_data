These are the cheapest and most accessible fuels for many households.\r\n\r\nCovid has seen an extra 600,000 homes drop below the fuel poverty line, taking the number to over 3 million in the UK.\r\n \r\nWith 17,000 deaths occurring due to cold homes in the Winter of 17/18 we can\u2019t afford to see more lives lost because people do not have the money to stay warm.",

Provide financial support packages to those reliant on coal the necessary funding required to change appliances or upgrade the ventilation systems to burn the smokeless alternatives safely and effectively.",
