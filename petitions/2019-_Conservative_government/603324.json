They are there to make the journey as comfortable as possible, helping control pain and medication, offering respite and caring for babies, children and teenagers at the end of their lives. Their specialist care is free for as long as is needed, within the family home or at a hospice. It costs thousands to keep them running and they rely on fundraisers and donations.",
