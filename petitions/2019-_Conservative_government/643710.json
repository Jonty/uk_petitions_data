        "action": "Abolish age based minimum wages.",
        "additional_details": "A loaf of bread is the same price regardless of how old you are. Considering the cost of living crisis, many young people are having to get jobs on top of school to be able to afford bare necessities for themselves and their families, especially those at university.\r\nLower minimum wages based on age has allowed for employers to exploit students into more work with no compensation. It is impossible to live off of a minimum wage from the ages of 16-21. Wages should be dictated by skill, not age.",
        "background": "I would like the government to enforce a single, standard minimum wage regardless of age. Having lower minimum wages for anyone under 21 is seen by many as age discrimination. Someone who is 16 in the same position as a 21 year old can legally be paid less than a living wage.",
