It will increase the cost of household goods and make life harder for millions of britons. Leaving the single market during the worst recession in hundreds of years is an act of extreme recklessness. The public were not consulted on withdrawing from the single market. It is possible to be part of the single market without being a member of the EU. Rejoin the Single Market Now!",
