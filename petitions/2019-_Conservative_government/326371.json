        "action": "Childrens Lives Matter: Scrap social distancing in schools with immediate effect",
        "additional_details": "Pupils have so far lost a whole term of education. Online schooling varies significantly, is not adequate or viable. Inequality of opportunity is increasing. Mental and physical health, and vulnerable teens are devastated. Children have been forgotten, and their lives matter too. \r\n\r\nThe fatality risk to schoolchildren is 1 in 3.5 million, while the role of children in viral transmission is minimal. Much evidence suggests little or no risk to pupils, families or teachers in schools returning.",
        "background": "Listen to wider scientific opinion on this, accept the minimal risk, and update the guidance accordingly for the sake of our children. Full exclusion from the general guidance is required, to accelerate the opening of schools before the summer, and to restore full capacity by September.",
