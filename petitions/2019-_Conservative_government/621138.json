        "action": "Remove the religious exemption to the non-stun slaughter ban, e.g Halal & Kosher",
        "additional_details": "Animals deserve to be treated fairly, and when slaughtered to not be in pain, stress, or suffering.\r\nAnimals slaughtered without being stunned experience a painful and distressing death. The FVE called the practise \"unacceptable in any circumstance\", and the FWAC - which is a government advisory body - recommends the practise be banned. Other organisations such as the RSPCA support and end to non-stun slaughter. It is clear the practise is cruel, and must be stopped.",
        "background": "Currently in the United Kingdom all animals are required to be stunned before slaughter, however some religions are allowed exemptions. I, like many others, believe this cruel and barbaric practise must be banned - with no exemptions.",
