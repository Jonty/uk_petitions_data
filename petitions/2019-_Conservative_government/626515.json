        "additional_details": "The Public Duty Costs Allowance was introduced to assist former Prime Ministers still active in public life. But to justify an allowance many times the national average salary for someone who has done a job for 44 days is fundamentally against the British idea of fairness.",
        "background": "Past prime ministers are eligible to draw on a Public Duty Costs Allowance, the current limit is set at \u00a3115,000 meaning that if Liz Truss claims this allowance until the age of 81, she will cost the taxpayer upwards of \u00a33,910,000. We suggest there should be a minimum service requirement of 1 year.",
