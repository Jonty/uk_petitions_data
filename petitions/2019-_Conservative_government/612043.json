        "additional_details": "Under current UK law employers only have to provide a space for breastfeeding mothers to rest or lie down. Unlike many other European countries there is no legal protection to provide mothers the time or facilities to express milk during work.\r\n \r\nExclusive breastfeeding is recommended for the first 6 months of life with continued breastfeeding alongside solid foods recommended for at least the first year of life. However for many not returning to work isn\u2019t an option. Expressing breast milk is the alternative allowing children to be fed and allowing mothers to continue this bond with their child.\r\n",
        "background": "I want all breastfeeding mothers returning to work to be legally entitled to paid breastfeeding breaks and work place facilities to express during the working day, to enable them to better feed their children.",
