        "additional_details": "With increased homelessness and limited availability of social housing, the Government has a duty of care to regulate private landlords and limit rent. Extortionate rent prices are making it impossible for people to rent homes, with rents often increasing each year making it unaffordable, with limited protections for tenants. This has to change.",
        "background": "As there is a housing crisis and the stock of social housing is depleted there is more of a need for private renting. This has made private renting a lucrative business for private landlords. This all needs to be regulated and rents capped using the existing fair rents scheme.",
