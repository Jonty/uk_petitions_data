        "additional_details": "Whilst we need to reduce our emissions, we are taking a hypocritical route by using fossil fuels that are not our own. We are increasing the cost and increasing the emissions by using sea and road transport to move the fuels, especially coal. \r\nReplacing central heating systems and building wind farms might help towards reducing our emissions, but production of these items causes more emissions than we are saving. We should take into account that many of the redundant items cannot be recycled.",
        "background": "Use our own supplies of gas, coal and oil until suitable, efficient alternatives are found. \r\nAlternatives to be researched for supplying new builds. \r\nHeat pump installations used only when suitable, not if impractical and costly.\r\nFracking rules revised to allow extraction of shale gas, as in USA.",
