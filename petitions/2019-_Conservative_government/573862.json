        "additional_details": "1.\tAll asthmatics on inhaled steroids are still being advised by NHS guidelines that they are at increased risk and must be especially careful.\r\n2.\tAll asthma was identified as a significant risk factor for long Covid in the ZOE study.\r\n3.\tThere is considerable evidence that risk from Covid is determined by type of asthma and not just asthma severity. \r\n4.\tJCVI categorisation doesn\u2019t agree with NICE/BTS definitions and doesn\u2019t acknowledge that risk is non-binary and can change rapidly.",
        "background": "The JCVI vaccine priority list only mentions severe asthma (rightly featured in Group 4- Clinically Extremely Vulnerable). Yet Group 6 (At Risk) also covers only severe asthma. Almost all other asthmatics have been excluded and are to be treated the same as healthy individuals their own age.",
