        "additional_details": "Supertrawlers (80m+ in length) are associated with high levels of marine mammal bycatch. Short-beaked common dolphins are dying in record numbers in UK waters and it is thought that midwater trawling by pelagic fishing vessels is a major cause. Supersized fishing vessels operate in UK waters without supervision such as onboard observers or remote CCTV. We are urging the UK government to set a size limit for all fishing vessels operating in UK waters and adequately supervise the ones that are.",
