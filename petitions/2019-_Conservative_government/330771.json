But, despite growing levels of forcible displacement and environmental migration, climate refugees do not receive any legal protection.  This is not a 'faraway' problem and we will increasingly see displacement both within the UK and displacement to the UK. Climate change is a human rights issue and the UK government must recognise this to achieve equitable futures for all.",

We want the UK government to develop and deliver climate-policy for the protection of environmental migrants and climate refugees.",
