        "additional_details": "85% of UK schools do not have a bereavement policy, yet 1 in 29 children are bereaved of a parent. That is 1 child in every classroom in the UK bereaved of a parent. This does not include any other significant person such as a grandparent. Covid has meant so many children and young people have experienced a loss of a significant person so now more than ever it is vital we have as many tools in place in relevant establishments such as schools to help support children and young people.",
        "background": "During the first lockdown my daughter was on a bike ride with my children's dad when their dad suffered a heart attack and passed away. Schools have tried to be supportive but lack guidance, resulting in my children being upset unnecessarily as it could be avoided if a policy was in place.",
