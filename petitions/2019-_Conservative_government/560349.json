Businesses will be put at a great disadvantage compared with new startups which do not carry such a burden and prevent them from competing on an international stage.\r\n\r\nBusinesses put good faith in the Government. The Government can not rebuild the economy without reciprocating this faith.",

The Government failed to control and eradicate the virus. It should issue grants to the same value of each loan, effectively clearing them.",
