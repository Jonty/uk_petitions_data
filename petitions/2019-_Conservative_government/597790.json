        "additional_details": "All police officers have had an extremely tough number of years due to the pandemic, with very little, to no thanks at all. With the Queens Platinum Jubilee approaching, many have been told that medals will not be offered to officers with less than five years service. To those officers, this is not only disheartening, but frustrating. Officers who have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic deserve it just as much as those officers with 5 years and one day.",
        "background": "Many serving police officers will have less than 5 years service on the date of the Queens Jubilee. This means that many serving officers will miss out on the opportunity to receive this medal, despite working through what has been a very difficult 2 years.",
