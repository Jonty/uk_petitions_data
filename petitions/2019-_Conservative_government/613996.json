        "additional_details": "Channel 4 is an open access channel with rich documentaries, news and shows that is rich in culture and provides a fair alternative to the BBC and ITV.\r\n\r\nThe government should allow loyal viewers to continue viewing the channel as it is and not allow private companies to alter the business model which even Margaret Thatcher presided over.\r\n\r\nThe government must not take on the free media in their culture war by turning Channel 4 into a free-for-all witch-hunt.",
        "background": "We want the government to stop their plans to privatise Channel 4 during Spring 2023 with plans to have it sold off before a 2024 general election.",
