Latex allergy is an ever increasing issue and can occur with just one exposure. Development of a latex allergy has significant ramifications for the sufferer. \r\n\r\nEveryone should be able to access all necessary tests and procedures, including COVID test kits without fear of either developing an allergy or being exposed to a substance they are allergic to but aren\u2019t told is present in the kits.",
        "background": "Currently all COVID test kits nationally contain latex, meaning those with latex allergies can not access testing. Given the current pandemic and being subject to test and trace, this is problematic for a potentially significant amount of allergy sufferers and others.",
