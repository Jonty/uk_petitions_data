        "action": "Immediately remove TV licence fee for elderly due to impact of Coronavirus",
        "additional_details": "The over 75s in the UK should not have to bear further stress and anxiety of bearing the financial burden of the TV licence. In particular at a time when they are asked to self isolate / social distance for a considerable period of time. It may be the case for some of these individuals that they may be isolated from grandchildren, carers, wider family and community.\r\nThis type of isolation can increase their sense of loneliness and is heartbreaking. We must be attentive to their needs.",
        "background": "Due to the growing concern on the UK population from COVID-19, in particular the most vulnerable and elderly across our communities, it must now be the case that the pending TV licence fee for over 75s be removed.",
