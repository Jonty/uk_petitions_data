It sounds like you want to make it illegal for schools to use any products containing plastic for one day a year, but it's not clear how this would work in practice.\r\n                \r\nWe have published the following petitions, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nEstablish a national waste plastic collection/recycling programme for England: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/553651\r\n\r\nIntroduce a levy on single-use disposable plastic: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/554035\r\n\r\nHeavy tax and public awareness on all 'Not Yet Recycled' plastics: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/315755\r\n\r\nReduced VAT on plastic-free products: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/552824\r\n\r\nImpose a levy on all plastic production in the UK: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/555701\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling on the Government to fund a public awareness programme for schools on plastics, if that's something you would like to happen."
