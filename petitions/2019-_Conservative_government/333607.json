        "action": "Protect the jobs of extremely vulnerable (shielding) employees.",
        "additional_details": "We call on the Government to protect the jobs of those who are shielding or high-risk and cannot safely return to work. No one should have to choose between their job and their health. These workers should not feel compelled to return to work if they feel it is unsafe. The Government should urgently communicate and implement legislation that makes dismissals of these workers who refuse to return to work automatically unfair - if their refusal to return is because of the coronavirus.",
        "background": "Thousands of workers will not be able to go back to work because they still face a high-risk from coronavirus. People who are a high-risk or shielding have made great sacrifices over the last few months to protect their community and the NHS; it would be unfair if they lost their jobs as a result.",
