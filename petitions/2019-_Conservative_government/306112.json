It is extremely unethical that consumers are not protected by their own government, during exceptional circumstances such as a pandemic. Protect the consumer and give them the right to refunded travel fees.",

If a consumer cannot travel due to the social distancing instruction from the government, and the general threat to their own safety and others, they should not be penalised for it.",
