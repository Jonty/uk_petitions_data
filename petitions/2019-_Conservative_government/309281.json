It should be simple to implement this as the tax is paid through the CIS before being paid to the worker, and should be able to be identified by HMRC.\r\n \r\nA Freedom of Information request made by Unite last year found that 1.03 million construction workers were paid via the CIS scheme in 2018/19. The Government should support these workers.",
