        "action": "Legalise Natural Organic Reduction",
        "additional_details": "Natural organic reduction is not natural burial - it is much faster (< 1yr, vs natural burial's 8-12yrs) and the nutrient-rich compost can be used anywhere. This could be of great benefit to areas in the UK where the soil has been depleted. It is also cleaner than machine cremation because it does not release ash and pollutants into the air whilst taking up a similar amount of land room. I also believe that people should have access to more funerary options, especially eco-friendly ones.",
        "background": "Natural organic reduction - AKA human composting - is an ecologically friendly alternative to cremation. The deceased is covered in plant matter and then placed in a chamber to compost for 1-2 months. Afterwards, the compost can be used for growing plants. I would like the government to legalise it.",
