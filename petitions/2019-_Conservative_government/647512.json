Currently, there is nowhere that is fenced in in Crystal palace to safely allow your dog off lead to play and teach them recall. People complain when your dog approaches them but it is essential to be able to let our dogs burn off energy in a safe environment where they can\u2019t chase a squirrel into the road or accidentally bump into a toddler",

The only fenced areas are for children where dogs are not allowed to go.",
