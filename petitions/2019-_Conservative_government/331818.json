Because we're not sure exactly what action you want the Government to take I'm afraid we can't accept your petition.\r\n\r\nIf you are unhappy with how your local authority's social services have dealt with your case you could complain about this. The Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman has published advice on how to complain about child social services, which you can read here:  https://www.lgo.org.uk/make-a-complaint/fact-sheets/social-care/children-s-care-services\r\n\r\nYou might also like to raise your case with your local MP, who might be able to take up your case on your behalf. You can find contact details for your local MP here: https://members.parliament.uk/FindYourMP"
