We need it to be more affordable, allow us to claim back our mileage to help with the increasing costs of living, if nothing is done, you will lose some of the most hard working student nurses and midwives. Some of us have roofs to keep over our heads and mouths to feed, but we cannot do paid work as we are already working 37.5 hours a week in placement, on top of theory and assessments. Make it more achievable for us.",
        "background": "I am a second year student Midwife and we are in placement 50% of each year, with rising petrol costs and parking at hospitals it can cost well over \u00a3120 a week to drive and park at placement where we work 12.5 hours a day, for free and sometimes even without a break.",
