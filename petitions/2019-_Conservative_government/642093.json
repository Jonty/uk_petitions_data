        "additional_details": "Some local authorities charge for over 16s to use existing school bus routes, because these students aren't entitled to free school transport. We want the Government to extend free school transport to over 16s, so that these students are not disadvantaged. The cost of school transport can affect the decision about whether a child attends further education. Extending free school transport to over 16s would reduce this inequality.",
        "background": "Currently it is up to local authorities what school transport to provide for over 16s in further education. We want the Government to require local authorities to provide free school transport for all over 16s, in the same way they do for under 16s.",
