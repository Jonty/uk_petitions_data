        "additional_details": "We call for fair wages for young people as we believe its important that young workers are compensated fairly for their time and effort. When workers are fairly paid it promotes economic stability and growth.  By ensuring fair wages, we can create a more equitable and society for all. Should we as young people work less as we are getting paid less? Just because we are younger doesn't mean we have less experience. Lets stand together and make a difference.",
        "background": "I would like parliament/government to consider the struggles of young people and take into account that they face similar struggles to older people who are getting paid more.",
