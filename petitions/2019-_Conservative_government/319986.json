        "action": "Pay for every 2020 graduate to gain a postgraduate qualification free of charge.",
        "additional_details": "As a result of Covid-19 and falling international student numbers, universities are facing a financial black hole. At the same time tens of thousands of students graduating in 2020 are likely to be out of work for months or years to come. By paying for every graduate to study for a postgraduate qualification, free of charge, the government will help both graduates and universities to recover from the consequences of Covid-19 and to prepare for the future during the next difficult academic year.",
        "background": "The Government should give every student graduating in 2020 the opportunity to study for a postgraduate qualification free of charge by paying the value of the tuition fees directly to the universities or other HE institutions concerned. This should not be considered a loan.",
