        "additional_details": "The decision on whether to release from supervision should be based on a case by case examination of risk and how much the individual has reformed.\r\n\r\nPreviously the minimum supervision period was 4 years, now it\u2019s 10. This change has impacted ex-prisoners already on parole who were not informed or consulted of the change being made. Some have had their minimum supervision terms doubled with no warning. This is obviously demoralizing, and demotivating for those prisoners who have reformed and been looking forward to release from supervision within the timeframe originally stated to them on release.",
        "background": "Change the ruling for minimum supervision of 10 years for those on parole to the original term stated when they were released for those already on parole prior to the law change in November 2020.",
