        "additional_details": "As a new parent of a child with an allergy, when reading labels it is very confusing as companies label their \u201cmay contain\u201d nuts and peanuts differently. If all companies labelled nuts and peanuts separately it would help a huge amount of people feel safer when choosing foods to consume and it would open a huge door of products to people who are allergic to peanuts & not tree nuts, and vice Versa. As companies are mixed in their labelling it causes confusion which could be life threatening.",
