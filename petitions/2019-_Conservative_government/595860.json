If all companies labelled nuts and peanuts separately it would help a huge amount of people feel safer when choosing foods to consume and it would open a huge door of products to people who are allergic to peanuts & not tree nuts, and vice Versa. As companies are mixed in their labelling it causes confusion which could be life threatening.",
