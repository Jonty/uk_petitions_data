And they put their lives at risk to help others at the road side. Just recently in the last couple of weeks alone, 2 local recovery drivers have been killed whilst doing their job. This must stop. The general public do not slow down, and they do not move over to help keep everyone safe on the road. The government need to change the law to protect recovery drivers",
