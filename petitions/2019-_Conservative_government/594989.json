We can follow Canada's lead and offer sanctuary to people escaping Afghanistan. The UK has very few safe routes to safety, the Vulnerable Person's Resettlement Scheme to support Syrians is a good model to create a scheme for Afghanistan. Following our government's intervention in Afghanistan the UK has a moral duty to create a safe route for those fleeing from Afghanistan.\u00a0",
