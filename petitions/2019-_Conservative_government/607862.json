        "additional_details": "Every day since the report has been published, further new evidence has been coming to light. The Met have confirmed that the maximum consequences of their findings will be fixed penalties. The public is not so much concerned about fixed penalties as it is about the integrity of senior politicians including the Prime Minister and the original Sue Gray report will furnish the public (and MPs) with the information they need to determine whether parliament has been misled. This takes precedence.",
        "background": "The Sue Gray report has been watered down significantly following a request from the Metropolitan Police to ensure minimal interference with their investigations into 12 'events' at Downing Street and Whitehall which have met the threshold of potential criminality. The full report is needed now.",
