        "additional_details": "Due to COVID-19, many university students have had a very different teaching experience to that which they agreed to pay for. Students have had lower levels of support, they have been unable to use campus facilities, and have been told to guide themselves for the most part. We have been expected to do work as if things are normal, and have been overlooked when it comes to the discussion about education. We shouldn't be paying the same amount of money for a lower quality experience.",
        "background": "I am asking that for the academic year 20/21, tuition fees for University students should be reduced, due to the lower standard of teaching there has been because of COVID-19.",
