It could also help prevent upset for children, the parent with limited or no contact and their wider family too, as well as huge amounts of money parents could otherwise spend on their children. \r\n\r\nI think that the system is archaic and sexist; it's too easy for one parent to prevent children seeing other parents equally, or at all. I believe this is often done to punish the other parent and/or for reasons other than what is in the child's best interests.",
