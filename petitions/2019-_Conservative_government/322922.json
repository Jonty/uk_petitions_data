        "action": "Extend Maternity Exemption Certificate for dental care due to covid closures",
        "additional_details": "Some women will miss out on treatment or check ups during lockdown leading to further dental health problems to be addressed after lockdown. However, many will need to pay as their certificates expire or be unable to get appointments due to the post lockdown rush and, in turn, certificates may again expire. Therefore many women will not benefit from dental care included in maternity exemption and will need to pay; in some cases this will be for treatment that was delayed too long.",
        "background": "Dentist surgeries and clinics have been forced to close, for 3 months so far, during lockdown which means that those with maternity exemption certificates currently in date cannot access care. Many will be forced to pay post lockdown for treatment and check ups needed during the lockdown period.",
