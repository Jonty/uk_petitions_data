        "additional_details": "Autistic children can become unsettled in the school environment, particularly if they are bullied by their peers through their lack of knowledge and understanding. This places stress on parents and the school also. I am an early years practitioner of 17 years and I am passionate about special educational needs. We instil diverse values from a young age so why not carry this throughout the entire school years but in more depth knowledge and understanding is key.",
        "background": "Please make it mandatory that students learn about neurodiversity in school, to help children develop a better understanding and relationships of their peers within schools so that children with additional needs can remain more settled in mainstream.",
