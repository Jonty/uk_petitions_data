        "additional_details": "The Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) report on Russian interference in UK democracy determined that the UK Government and its agencies have failed in their duty to investigate whether there was Russian state interference with key UK democratic processes.\r\n\r\nThe ISC also highlighted that the UK is a target of Russian disinformation campaigns.\r\n\r\nAs servants of the British people, the Government owes the public answers on the fundamental question of the autonomy of British democracy.",
        "background": "We demand that Parliament immediately establishes a cross-party committee to determine whether there was Russian interference with the 2014 Scottish Independence referendum, the 2016 Referendum on membership of the EU and the 2019 General Election.",
