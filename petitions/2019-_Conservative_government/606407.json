        "additional_details": "Fathers should be able to enjoy and cherish time with their new baby and family without the financial burden. Their partner would already be earning less due to starting maternity leave and with a further reduction of household income, it can cause unneeded stress. If Statutory Paternity Pay had the same rules of SMP where employees would earn 90% of their average weekly earnings, this would help many new parents have one less worry in what should be an amazing time in their lives.",
        "background": "2 weeks paternity pay should be aligned with the first 6 weeks of Statutory Maternity Pay where the amount paid is 90% of average weekly earnings or the statutory amount, whichever is greater.",
