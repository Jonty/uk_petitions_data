        "additional_details": "Some decisions made in the womb are eye colour, hand we write with, how fast we move. We don't call the outcome of these a disorder! \r\n\r\nMany mental health conditions; the decision in the womb of how we think, are labelled a disorder (broken). Wrong. People with 'so-called' mental disorders (OCD, ADHD, Bi-Polar Disorder), have superpowers.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate and leverage neurodiversity, the narrative should be positive to encourage people to share their excellence, and others to embrace it.\r\n\r\nLevel up.",
        "background": "If we are to truly celebrate all people and their contribution to life, work and society we must level up our language when referring to mental health conditions.\r\n\r\nDrop the negative labelling of using the word disorder, which suggests people with mental difference are sub-optimal. That's wrong.",
