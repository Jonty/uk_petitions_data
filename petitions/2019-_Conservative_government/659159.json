        "additional_details": "We believe Westminster fails to represent England. Devolution in Scotland and Wales has proven successful in allowing people a greater say over how they should be governed and represented. We think this model could be just as effectively applied to the regions of England. We believe the current system of devolution and local governance is complex and confusing for many and discourages participation. Regional devolved parliaments with clearly defined powers could improve representation and participation.",
        "background": "We believe England should be split into regions according to those used previously in European parliamentary elections. We think giving these regions their own elected assembly would allow better representation of their distinct cultures and politics and provide a structure for English devolution.",
