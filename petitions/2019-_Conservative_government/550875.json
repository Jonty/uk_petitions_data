        "additional_details": "The UK needs to look to our neighbours who do not wear uniforms. The cost of them is prohibitive (a skirt can be \u00a340), the argument that is stops poorer children being bullied is now a moot point, clothes are now cheap, and if we want to treat secondary school children like young adults then we need to set some guidelines. They will be more comfortable and schools will be able to concentrate on important behaviour, not spend a lot of time worrying about type or uniform the child is wearing.",
        "background": "In Europe, Britain, Malta and Ireland are the only countries where a uniform is adopted by schools although there is no legislation governing school uniform in the UK. Schools sell these uniforms via \"special suppliers\" which are expensive and there is little evidence of any benefit to wearing one.",
