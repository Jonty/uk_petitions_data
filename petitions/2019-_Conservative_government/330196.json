        "additional_details": "Students have been significantly impacted over lockdown and so the government, should cancel the 2021 exams or at the very least give us some consideration as we have been studying with no clarification around the 2021exams which has lead to extreme stress which will inevitably effect our results. GCSE and A-level exams should be cancelled next year as you have done this year as you are putting a lot of students in a disadvantage. I am calling on you to acknowledge this and help us by cancelling the exam which is due to shape our future.",
        "background": "Today it has been announced that the exams will go ahead as of 2021, using the same curriculum. This, therefore, disadvantages students within these year groups we've had to study from home which hasn't been particularly successful and now we are expected to sit an exam as if nothing has happened.",
