        "additional_details": "I would like this rules changed as this is having a huge impact on the lives of many people. There are lots of bi-nationality families who split their time between France and the UK. This rules makes no sense in light of how the vaccination plan is rolling out. Allowing fully jabbed people from France does not seem unreasonable considering how the vaccine is proving effective, even against the variants. Please, this is tearing families apart and has become a political decision rather than one of safety.",
        "background": "Apply the same coronavirus travel rules to France as you have for other amber countries. Fully jabbed people should be able to travel to the UK from France without having to quarantine. The rules should not exempt France, as they are still in the amber list. This is separating a lot of families.",
