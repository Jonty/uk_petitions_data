        "additional_details": "There are over 250,000 animals that going to a rescue centre each year in the UK, but controlling and regulating the amount of new animals bred each year, we can not only drop the number of animals going into a shelter, but also drop the amount of time and animal spends in the shelter, using simple supply and demand mathematics.",
        "background": "I would like the government to regulate the currently free and over exposed breeding and selling market of cats and dogs in Great Britain. Making all breeders licensed and regulated and thus having more control on what is bred and why. This will intern drastically drop our rescue animal numbers.",
