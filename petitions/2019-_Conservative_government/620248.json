        "additional_details": "Because it is unfair to say cannabis has a negative effect on health and society, when in actual fact alcohol may have a bigger effect on society. a regulated cannabis system stops the growing smoker population from spiked buds and means less stress on the jail system. Let us smoke a J, have some food, have a giggle and have a good nights sleep.",
        "background": "There is significant evidence that the criminalisation of cannabis is derived from racist propaganda in the history of Britain. if the response to legalising cannabis is always the health and societal impacts, then why is alcohol and tobacco still allowed.",
