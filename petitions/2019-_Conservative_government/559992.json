        "action": "Remove non-essential retail from the list of businesses to close during lockdown",
        "additional_details": "This petition does not dispute the need to take action in order to slow the spread of the virus. However, the catch-all approach to business closures is self-defeating and unnecessary. These small retailers all have limits on the number of people who can be in the shop at one time, making it easy to socially distance from other customers and staff. Masks must also be worn and the time a shopper spends inside the shop is minimal so there is significantly less risk here than in the supermarket.",
        "background": "The government must provide evidence to show that Covid-19 is being transmitted in non-essential retail businesses. If there is no such evidence then they should be allowed to reopen immediately. A lack of Christmas trading will damage these businesses permanently.",
