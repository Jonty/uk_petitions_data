        "additional_details": "Many other countries dropped social distancing for under 11s months ago and saw no increase in transmission rates. \r\n\r\nCurrent data has found no transmissions between child or from child to adult. \r\n\r\nToddlers are missing the window of opportunity to develop vital social skills in order to progress in their general development.\r\n\r\nChildren under 11 need to play to develop and cannot play 2 metres apart. \r\n\r\nFamilies of children under 11 remain isolated as they are unable to adhere to the restrictions.",
        "background": "Allow children under 11 to be children and play and interact with each other, which is vital to ensure their basic development. \r\n\r\nToddlers, who are unable to social distance, are not allowed any social interaction and haven't done for 4 months, a significant chunk of their lives.",
