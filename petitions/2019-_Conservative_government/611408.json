        "additional_details": "In the past few weeks, Kerosene (Heating oil) has more than doubled in price. This is incredibly worrying for home owners in rural areas with oil fired boilers especially low income households who are already worried about increasing energy costs. 500L is usually the minimum order required and as of writing this, this would cost over \u00a3700 and only two weeks ago, this would cost around \u00a3340. Households are being forgotten about in rural areas. The government need to step in.",
        "background": "In the past few weeks, Kerosene (Heating oil) has more than doubled in price. I would like the government to impose a price cap similar to the electricity price cap that's currently in place.",
