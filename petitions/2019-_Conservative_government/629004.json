        "additional_details": "The next generation includes people who will experience these conditions and we need to provide them with information and support. We believe current education and understanding of this disorder is woeful. These children are also our future doctors and psychologists. This is how we can enact real and systemic change. We believe education in women's health is insufficient and this topic in particular is extremely important.",
        "background": "We want the Health Education curriculum for secondary school to require schools to teach about Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, its symptoms and how to get support. This should include talking about neurodivergence, as some research has found a higher proportion of autistic women suffer from PMDD.",
