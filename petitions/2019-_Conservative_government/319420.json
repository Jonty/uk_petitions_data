        "additional_details": "It is simply immoral to allow the students to sink further into debt with an inferior educational experience, i.e solely behind a laptop, the Government should be supporting young people and their future in these times, by reducing online tuition fees dramatically, online courses cannot be compared to a full university experience, and many subjects demand more than an online PowerPoint or class to enable students to thrive. Students are aware that this may cause some financial difficulties for universities, but students should not be the one to pick up the tab on all of this. This will be detrimental to our futures and our education.",
