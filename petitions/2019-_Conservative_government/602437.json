This Committee is made up of councillors from each of the two Joint Authorities, Plymouth City Council and Cornwall Council. This means the UK Government is not responsible for the action this petition calls for.\r\n\r\nYou could therefore start a petition calling for Cornwall Council to take this action. You can find out how to do this here: https://www.cornwall.gov.uk/the-council-and-democracy/campaigns-consultations-and-petitions/petitions/.\r\n\r\nYou could also raise your issue with a local councillor who represents you.
