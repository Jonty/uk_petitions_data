        "additional_details": "In proposing a review of the model tenancy agreement the government recognises the importance of pets to people, & how traumatic it is to have to give up a pet when moving into rental housing. This however is not enough, we call on our government to go further. Without legislation like that proposed in 'Jasmine's Law' landlords can still include blanket bans on pets.\r\n\r\nChanges in legalisation would open doors for love and companionship for many humans and animals.",
        "background": "We call on the government to introduce legalisation that bans no pet clauses in tenancy agreements, protecting existing human companion animal relationships, as is common in many countries. Every pet has the right to a loving home.",
