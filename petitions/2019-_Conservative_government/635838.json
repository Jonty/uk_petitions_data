        "additional_details": "Recently, the maximum penalty for animal cruelty was increased to five years imprisonment. This is great, but at the same time not enough.\r\n\r\nThe maximum penalty for animal abusers should be increased to ten years imprisonment to deter further cruelty and to ensure justice is served and animal cruelty rates are decreased.\r\n\r\nJust because animals are not of our species and don\u2019t speak our language doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s okay to treat them cruelly or treat them as any less important than humans.",
        "background": "Animal cruelty is not taken anywhere near seriously enough by the law. Animal cruelty is horrible and perpetrators can go on to commit violence against humans. Animals are not inanimate objects - they are not property! They are sentient beings, who are aware and able to think and feel.",
