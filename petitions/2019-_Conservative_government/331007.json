        "additional_details": "We find it deeply upsetting that from 4th July the government have allowed so many hospitality, hairdressers, entertainment and pubs to open, yet a birth partner cannot stay at the hospital to be with their child. How have the above things have been prioritised over maternity services? Partners could potentially miss the first few days of their child\u2019s life, something they can never get back. How can an English postcode dictate that you have to experience part of birth and postnatal stays alone?",
        "background": "On 9/07/20, Scotlands First Minister announced changes to birth partner restrictions, allowing partners to attend scans, birth and visiting postnatal wards. In England, it was announced nail bars and gyms could open- no mention of partner restrictions so we want the same rights as those in Scotland.",
