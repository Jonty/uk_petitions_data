        "additional_details": "The Government should increase the maximum price threshold to match the price cap on the Help to Buy Equity Loan scheme - \u00a3600,000.\r\n \r\nIn December 2020 the average first time buyer purchase price in England was \u00a3224,560 - almost 10% higher than 5 years ago. If the ISA price cap had increased at the same rate they would now be around \u00a3500,000.\r\n \r\nThe price cap is particularly restrictive in London, with the average first time buyer price in parts of the capital being \u00a3489,000 - \u00a339,000 more than the current cap. This means that many first time buyers can be forced to abandon claiming their bonus or face limited choice in an already tough market.",
