Through discussion I have found I am not alone in my concerns, especially surrounding 5G radiation and its effects.\r\n\r\nWe feel let down by our MSM, which never mentions this, ever! Despite it being discussed the world over. When they do provide information it is confusing and frequently contradictory.\r\n\r\nThe debate must be opened up. There are many questions that need to be asked and answered.",
        "background": "I request the government instruct Matt Hancock, Chris Whitty and selected experts to engage in a live TV debate. The signatories of this petition will select a panel containing health and science professionals to engage with them.\r\n\r\nWe must establish the health risks associated with 5G radiation.",
