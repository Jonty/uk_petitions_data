        "action": "Challenge the Indian Government to protect and seek justice for Dalit women.",
        "additional_details": "Dalit women and girls are losing their lives at the hands of higher caste men, who are not facing justice as the police won\u2019t challenge them. In many instances the police themselves obstruct justice. Some don\u2019t even consider it to be a violation of law because it has been traditionally enforced in a caste hierarchy. We petition you to act now, to prevent this from remaining an accepted act within the caste system and stop this from happening to future generations of young Indian women.",
        "background": "For centuries Dalit women in India have been persecuted based on their caste. Girls are being raped and murdered and higher caste perpetrators do not face arrest. These men must answer for their actions and the women and their families need justice. Law making is not enough, laws must be enforced.",
