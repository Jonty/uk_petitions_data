        "additional_details": "Is it disgraceful that panic buyers are depriving NHS workers at the front line from having access to basic staple goods. Under the new law, nurses and doctors will be able either order food and amenities online or in person from their local supermarkets. The supermarkets will be legally bound to prioritise and set aside supplies for them before offering what is left to the general public. These people cannot be disadvantaged by panic buyers in light of a pandemic for risking their lives.",
        "background": "Create a list of all doctors and nurses in the UK that are currently fighting the coronavirus and distribute their names to all super markets in the UK. They can then register with them and order goods in person or online and supermarkets will have a legal obligation to prioritise them over buyers.",
