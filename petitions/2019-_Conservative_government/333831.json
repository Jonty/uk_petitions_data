        "action": "Reform the House of Lords because its membership is chosen undemocratically.",
        "additional_details": "All members of the House of Lords should be elected and serve for a set period of time. It should enjoy greater independence. Political parties currently appoint people to it who support their own ideas. The most recent appointments were stuffed with those who agree with the government\u2019s views on Europe. The election of members to the House of Lords could enable independent intelligent voices to put themselves forward as well as those from political parties, all of whom should hold the lower chamber to account. Members should have fixed terms of office but be able to reapply for re-election. \r\n\r\nI am envisaging that a committee would be set up to oversee reform arrangements and make recommendations about the changes needed",
        "background": "The House of Lords is an archaic institution. Some are given membership out of favour or political whim or because they support government ideas. They have lifelong membership. This is undemocratic and does not fit with a fair and equal society. It is overburdened in numbers and costly to run.",
