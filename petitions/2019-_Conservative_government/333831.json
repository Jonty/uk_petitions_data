        "action": "Reform the House of Lords because its membership is chosen undemocratically.",
        "additional_details": "Members of the House of Lords should be elected and serve for a set period of time and not be given life-long membership. It is not sufficiently independent. It is too greatly linked to political parties. Political parties appoint people to it who support their own ideas. The most recent appointments were stuffed with those who agree with the government\u2019s views on Europe. The House of Lords should have independent intelligent voices who can hold the lower chamber to account.",
        "background": "The House of Lords is an archaic institution. Some are given membership out of favour or political whim or because they support government ideas. They have lifelong membership. This is undemocratic and does not fit with a fair and equal society. It is overburdened in numbers and costly to run.",
