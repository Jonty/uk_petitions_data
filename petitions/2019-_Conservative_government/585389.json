        "additional_details": "Since protests began, there are 24 confirmed deaths, over 800 injured. The Colombian government are being extremely silent in a period of great national outcry, and therefore we believe that the UK, as a global defender of human rights and democracy has a responsibility to help the people of Colombia. During the Colombian state visit to the UK in 2016, Boris Johnson stated \"we have an important national interest in the security and prosperity of Colombia\" and that Colombia has \"our ongoing support\" for peace. The people of Colombia need that support now more than ever.",
        "background": "From late April there have been social demand protests in Colombia \r\nmet with unnecessary force from authorities. We ask the UK government to pressure the Colombian government, urging they listen to the people protesting to find solutions and end the use of unnecessary force against the population",
