        "action": "Ban the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2024, six years earlier than planned",
        "additional_details": "It is agreed that petrol and diesel cars are bad; the consensus is that these vehicles cause illness-inducing pollution, and that they also contribute to global warming. Indeed, the danger of the vehicles is why the government's policy is to ban their sale by 2030. \r\n\r\nThe debate concerns timing. I think that 2030 is far too distant. These cars are killing now. The climate emergency is occurring now. During times of crisis, it is incumbent to act at the earliest opportunity - and not delay.",
        "background": "The government's current plan is to end the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2030. The end of 2030 is almost nine-and-a-half years away. My strongly held belief is that the UK government must act sooner. That is why I am advocating a 2024 cut-off for the sale of petrol and diesel cars.",
