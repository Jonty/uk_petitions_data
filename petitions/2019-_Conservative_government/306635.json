        "action": "Give parking and congestion charge exemptions to the NHS staff.",
        "additional_details": "The NHS are working round the clock and are endangering their lives and their families lives every day with the current Covid 19 crisis. They have to travel on public transport and are open to more germs which will be carried in to the hospitals. If they can drive or go by taxis, that will lessen their risks. But its expensive to park and the congestion charges make it impossible for them. London taxi drivers are now struggling financially so this could possibly help out lots of families in different ways but keeping them safer also.",
        "background": "Offer free parking or taxi rides to NHS staff, including waiving congestion charges to enable staff to travel to work with safe social distancing in the current climate. Possibly paying London taxis a fee, keeping them able to feed their families a little.",
