        "additional_details": "For both professional and personal reasons, there are many UK-based British Citizens that need to travel to / from Red List countries for business / work or to visit family members (right to family life). While recognizing the need to protect against the importation of new variants into the UK, the government should consider revising its policy in order to allow fully vaccinated UK citizens to arrive from red list countries without significant quarantine restrictions.",
        "background": "The Government should urgently review its travel policy towards 'Red List' countries with respect to fully vaccinated travelers from the UK, allowing such travelers to quarantine at home on return to the UK rather than in a government sanctioned hotel",
