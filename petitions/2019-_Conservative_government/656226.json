Becoming an adult not being able to drive has been extremely hard. Giving people that help and that ability would make our lives so much easier. Being able to drive, pick up our kids from school, do the groceries \u2013 having that freedom is like no other. I just want there to be hope for us and for future generations to come.",
        "background": "Around 340,000 people in the UK are registered as blind or partially sighted. Legalising bioptic driving would change the lives of so many. It is currently allowed in places across the US and Canada, and there is some research suggesting it is safe. Please consider this to make a significant impact.",
