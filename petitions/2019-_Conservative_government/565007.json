        "action": "Reverse the decision to leave the Erasmus+ programme",
        "additional_details": "Erasmus+ is an EU programme for education but non-member-states can take part. The Prime Minister assured MPs in Jan 2020 that there was no threat to the UK's involvement in Erasmus+ but has now reversed this decision. A report from the House of Lords EU Committee warned the benefits of the programme would be difficult to replicate with a national programme and that withdrawal would \"disproportionately affect people from disadvantaged backgrounds and those with medical needs or disabilities\".",
        "background": "The school and university exchanges of the Erasmus+ programme are an essential part of the language learning ecosystem. We call on the Government to reconsider the decision to withdraw from Erasmus and to make continuing membership a priority in order to safeguard the future of languages in the UK.",
