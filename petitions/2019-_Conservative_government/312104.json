        "additional_details": "Following the COVID-19 outbreak, the UK Government instructed people to wash their hands regularly with soap. This was not a big ask. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, 25% of the world's population have no access to hand-washing facilities with soap and water. Research collected by the WHO suggests that up to 2 million people die of diseases each year that can be prevented with better hygiene.\r\n\r\nLet's make a stand to ensure that future generations live in dignity and do not have to suffer from preventable diseases.",
        "background": "I'm asking the Government to increase its commitment to the SDGs and to ending global poverty by funding greater access to water, sanitation and hygiene amongst the world's poorest communities and by supporting emergency responses where water supplies have been halted by military forces.",
