A study has shown a 5-6% increase in pay for people moving jobs within these states, with a larger increase for women (8-9%) and African-Americans (13-16%).",

Often this means the salary will be based on the new employee's previous salary. We want questions about salary history banned, as it can perpetuate existing gender pay gaps.",
