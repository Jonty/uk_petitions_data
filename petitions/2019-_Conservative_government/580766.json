There\u2019s no specific definition of \u2018reasonable force\u2019 - it depends on the circumstances. The guidance on 'reasonable force' states that \"If you only did what you honestly thought was necessary at the time, this would provide strong evidence that you acted within the law\" meaning that a resident using 'any means necessary' could already be acting within the law.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore not clear how you'd like the law to change.\r\n\r\nYou might like to sign this petition which calls for a related action: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/577568"
