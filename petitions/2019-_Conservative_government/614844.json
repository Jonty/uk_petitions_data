        "additional_details": "For many, the resultant mental trauma from child sex abuse is like being in prison. Because of this many survivors don't have the ability to apply for jobs, work or find any success. Talented survivors circle around a life of silence & fear because they are ashamed of what has happened to them.\r\n\r\nBy allowing this conversation some air we can create increased productivity and success for the many survivors suffering in silence.\r\n \r\nThe Government must fund specialist schemes to provide more support for survivors than is currently available, including support for people to get into and return to work.",
        "background": "I know first-hand how difficult it was to be heard, and how uncomfortable it was for me to speak up in my professional environment. Labelled a failure and the girl going nowhere, I was absolutely held back by the stigma attached to my life, that I hid for years - ashamed of what had happened to me.",
