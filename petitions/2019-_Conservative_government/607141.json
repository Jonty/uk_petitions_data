        "additional_details": "Public trust in government and public bodies has been eroded in the last 2 years through many reasons but it seems none more that this issue has been such a threat to this. Trust in Police, Authority and the people who govern us are all at stake. The public deserve to understand in full what has been investigated and what the conclusions are. To do any less would only drag the issue out longer and do long term damage to public trust and engagement in politics.",
        "background": "Publish the report in full. If it is truly without fear or favour, there is nothing to stop it being published now. To delay further would be an insult to the people who suffered and abided by the rules who want the truth.",
