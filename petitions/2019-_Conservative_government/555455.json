Not to mention the mental trauma and stress in the community now. I also treat several NHS frontline workers, who have cried in my salon, been overwhelmed, anxious, exhausted & longed for their 1hour massage time to relax and forget all stresses of today. It's a duty of care to our people & heros throughout this pandemic.\r\nLet us help them!",
