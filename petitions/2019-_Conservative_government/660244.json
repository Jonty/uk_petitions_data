        "additional_details": "Currently the motability scheme provides assistance to lease either a vehicle or a wheelchair / mobility scooter. Disabled people might then purchase the other equipment they need but often this means buying second hand, or older, items which may unreliable or unsafe. Some people access funding from the NHS, but may wish to purchase something that suits their needs that costs more. By having a no deposit, interest free, payment plan for all new or approved refurbished equipment it will allow anyone eligible to purchase safe and reliable equipment that suits them.",

This should be available for all new equipment to anyone with PIP or equivalent.",
