There is an epidemic of young teenagers becoming addicted to nicotine and poisoning themselves with lead, other heavy metals, and carcinogenic compounds.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, the e-waste created wastes valuable resources, and poses a fire risk.",
        "background": "For a combination of health and environmental reasons, the import, manufacture, and sale of disposable e-cigarettes or vapes should be completely banned, and the sale of reusable e-cigarettes and liquids should be properly licensed.",
