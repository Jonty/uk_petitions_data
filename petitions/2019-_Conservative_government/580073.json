        "additional_details": "There is a wealth of evidence to demonstrate how ineffectual lockdown policy has been, the damage resulting from the policy itself is huge and impact on civil liberties is a serious concern. When comparisons are drawn with countries or states that didn't use lockdown policy, the evidence is clear, lockdown leads to more deaths per million than not locking down. The economic impact will be felt for years, the taxpayer is burdened with huge debts, putting many people into poverty, ruining lifes.",
        "background": "There is now overwhelming evidence that lockdown policy during a crisis is ineffective, however, it is abundantly clear that the outcome of lockdown policy is devastating in many ways; it causes harms to education, mental health, jobs and businesses, ultimately saddling the public with vast debts.",
