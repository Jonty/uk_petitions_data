        "additional_details": "For the vast majority of us, COVID-19 is nothing more than a bad flu. The country cannot afford another lockdown and people do not want it. The best way to protect the NHS is by keeping the vulnerable shielded and allowing the economy to thrive which will, in turn, pay for the NHS. Mental health problems, enhanced due to lockdowns, unemployment, and uncertainty, are killing people.",
        "background": "Ask people who are high risk of dying from COVID to shield themselves for the winter. Keep the shops, bars, restaurants, and gyms open to ensure further jobs are not lost. Maintain sensible social distancing rules. Let life go on.",
