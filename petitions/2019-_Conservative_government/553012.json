This has proved ineffectual in some locations where social distancing is unsustainable due to local conditions. Legislation is urgently required to raise public awareness and reduce the spread of Covid 19 in these areas. The aim is to reduce public apathy and potential transmission opportunities in these high-risk areas by deploying a workable universal scheme tailored to meet complex local needs.",

For uniformity of messaging, all zoned areas should be marked by standardized colour-coded notices.",
