        "additional_details": "Future generations do not deserve to live in a world where: lakes, rivers, streams and seas are polluted by sewage. Our eco systems should be preserved. Enjoyment of water systems has been a tradition of society in the UK for centuries; children deserve to swim in clean waters, wildlife and nature deserves to be untouched by human interference. The nation deserve more. Stricter rules should be placed on water companies to dispose of sewage in ways which do not damage the environment.",
        "background": "Legislation permits lawful dumping of sewage by water companies. This pollutes bodies of water, and destroys eco systems. This should be legislated against. Punishments should also be harsher for illegal dumps as a deterrent for companies.",
