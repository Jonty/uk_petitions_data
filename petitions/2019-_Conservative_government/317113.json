To have this day on the birthday of Captain Moore is a fantastic way to honour this man, who has served this country throughout his life in so many ways. He embodied all that is great about our beloved country and it\u2019s people",
        "background": "We need a national day of remembrance for those whose lives were lost, a day we thank those who gave lives as front line staff & a day to thank those who served in key roles- NHS, social care, postal & transport, emergency services, teachers, & Local council staff who delivered emergency services",
