        "additional_details": "It's unfair that sporting/gigs/theatre to have an increase in venue capacity without considering other events like weddings/funerals which usually have a list which is traceable and when they are usually limited to close friends / family rather than thousands of members of the general public. Every time a couple has to delay a wedding it can cost them and the venues hundreds if not thousands in rescheduling.",
        "background": "With the latest increase in venue capacity allowing 4000 or 50% of capacity for stadiums / 1000 or 50% for indoor venues (theatres etc) weddings/funerals should receive the same increase in capacity.",
