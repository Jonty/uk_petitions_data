        "additional_details": "According to the Electoral Reform Society, 22.6 million votes didn\u2019t count towards the result of the last election. In other words almost 3/4 of voters had their votes ignored. 49% of all seats in Great Britain are so safe that voters who live there effectively don't have a voice\r\n\r\nFPTP locks out smaller parties. A quarter of votes went to parties other than the largest two, but they got less than 13% of seats. STV maintains the constituency link, whilst reflecting the diversity of views in an area",
        "background": "Change the voting system in the General Election from First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) to a Single Transferrable Voting system. This would help ensure that the composition of Parliament more accurately reflects the proportion of votes cast.",
