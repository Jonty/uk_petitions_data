        "additional_details": "It is not just about the 10 doctors that have died, three out of the six nurses named as having died from Covid-19 have also been BAME as was a hospital pharmacist and at least one healthcare worker. 44% of medical staff in the NHS are from a BAME background which is significantly more in comparison with 14% of the population in England and Wales. These figures are disturbing and further highlight the underlying inequalities that members of the BAME community continue to face even in 2020.",
        "background": "It has been widely reported that the first 10 doctors in the UK named as having died from the virus were all from the black, Asian, and minority ethnic community(BAME).  Furthermore, reported data shows that there is a disproportionate percentage of BAME people getting ill from Covid-19",
