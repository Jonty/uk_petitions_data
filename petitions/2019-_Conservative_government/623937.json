The IMF is concerned and some major lenders have withdrawn mortgage products today.\r\n\r\nGetting rid of 45% income tax only helps the rich. If you're earning \u00a3150k pa you can afford food and bills. \r\n\r\nThe financial markets don't like the increase in UK borrowing. \r\n\r\nWe are coming out of a time covid lockdown spending. \r\n\r\nHave you seen the waits in NHS.\r\n \r\nThink about how much you're borrowing.",

Inflation is high (due to fuel costs and increased production costs) & the Bank of England are trying to reduce it through interest rates. \r\nI couldn't believe the mini budget, totally undermining what BoE is doing & destabilising \u00a3 stock mkt.",
