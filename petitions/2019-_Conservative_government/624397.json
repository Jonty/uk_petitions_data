        "additional_details": "Early years childcare is unaffordable in England and the high financial cost does not encourage parents to work to support their families.\r\nAt an average of \u00a352 per day for a two-year-old (daynurseries.co.uk) attending nursery 3 days per week and using the childcare tax-free account, the fees would be \u00a3540.80 monthly. This puts childcare out of reach of most families.\r\nThe funding on offer does not do enough for low-income working parents. Even when using the universal credit childcare element, parents must pay childcare providers before receiving 85% of childcare costs, which can lead to escalating debt.",
        "background": "Give all children access to 30 hour free childcare funding from their first birthday with working parents resident in England, automatic access to 30 hours free funding per week during term time or 22 hours per week all year round at the hourly rate.",
