        "additional_details": "Having been through this divorce system starting in July 2016, completion was May 2020. I've spoken to many people who have had a similar experience, a very long time frame and spending in excess of \u00a310,000 on legal fees. Not only are people already stressed from the breakdown of marriage and all that entails, this is compounded by the present system. The stress and frustration caused must not be underestimated. There is a lot of scope for a much fairer, quicker more cost effective mechanism.",
        "background": "Despite the new \u201cno fault\u201d divorce law coming into effect 2021, it doesn't go far enough to speed up the divorce process and reduce costs. I'm asking the government to commission a review into the present system with a view to making it more efficient, fairer and more cost-effective.",
