        "action": "Make penalty taking part of the English National Curriculum",
        "additional_details": "Dedicate at least 2 hours a week to penalty taking at school between the ages of 5 and 16. Anyone attempting a fancy run up will receive a 1 week suspension. Sacrifice a session of home economics-we've all got Deliveroo now, and maybe one Maths lesson -until there is a  time when 5 people can disappoint 60 million others by not being able to solve a quadratic equation.",
        "background": "I've just witnessed another agonising England defeat on penalties in a major tournament. It's clear that it's something that should be taught at a younger age. Italians can pick a corner before they can walk, German women give birth 12 yards away from the midwife, who has a cot behind them.",
