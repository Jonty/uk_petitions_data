        "additional_details": "The social media (Facebook & Twitter) are taking on governments around the world and no one has taken a stand. The government currently will not be brave and make a law putting the responsibility on the social media companies. \r\n \r\nThey are blameless when crime is done on their sites, people hide anonymously when being racist. \r\n\r\nIt is time to bring the social media sites under a law in United Kingdom they have to abide by. \r\n\r\nIt must cover Racism, Grooming, Online Threats, Stalking, Bullying more",
        "background": "Take a stand against social media sites claiming they are not responsible for content published by people. If I put something racist, or threatening in a  newspaper you would hold both them & me responsible.\r\nAllowing foreign countries to break laws. \r\nFreedom of Speech is not an excuse.",
