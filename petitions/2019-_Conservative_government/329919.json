        "additional_details": "We have noticed as parents, that once our children are diagnosed with ASD it can be hard to find support. This can mean that when they suffer with their mental health there is no service available to support them. These children are passed from pillar to post and unfortunately brushed under the carpet. Access to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) can be limited due to variable provision and the difficulty of diagnosing co-occurring conditions like depression and anxiety. This means they can end up being left to suffer in silence, possibly resulting in suicidal thoughts and feelings. No one should suffer that let alone a child.",
