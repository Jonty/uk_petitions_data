Companies make choices on what materials they choose to produce with and package with. As consumers we demand transparency and auditing by law on the amount and types of plastic (e.g. recyclable and non recyclable) being generated by each business in all aspects to be made public each year.",
        "background": "Just as companies must publish financial audits, an audit of the amount and types of plastic it uses for creation of product and packaging/every day use is of vital public interest and should be made to be published in detail so we consumers can make informed choices on where our money is going.",
