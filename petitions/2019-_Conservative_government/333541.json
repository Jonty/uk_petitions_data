        "additional_details": "Key Workers kept the country running during the pandemic and didn't have any of the benefits of the furlough scheme. They risked their lives for others, but now are losing out compared to others. Those with jobs where they can work from home can go abroad and return being able to quarantine and continue working on full pay. Those who can't work from home, particularly Key Workers, are being forced to take un-paid leave upon return if they need to quarantine. This is not fair.",
        "background": "A scheme similar to furlough should be provided for Key Workers and those who are unable to work from home when they return from a country where quarantine is required. Key Workers should be able to enjoy a holiday abroad or visit family and not be penalised with unpaid leave on return.",
