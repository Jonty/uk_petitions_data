        "additional_details": "The importance of self education is growing with amazing opportunities for self-development online. The government should provide incentives to encourage people to continuously learn new skills and give themselves more life opportunities, regardless of their age. The government could provide tax rebates upon evidencing education expenditure, open grants for those who earn under the average UK salary, or cover a percentage of the cost an individual spends on education such as 25%.",
        "background": "Government support for further educational efforts could help change thousands of lives. Currently our only option is taking on \u00a350,000 worth of debt at University. Many of us cannot afford this so the Government should support alternatives. This could include grants, subsidies, or tax deductions.",
