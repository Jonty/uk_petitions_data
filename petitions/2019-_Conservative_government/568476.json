        "additional_details": "We're not getting to experience society life, which is a major part of doing a degree abroad. We're facing mental health struggles as we can\u2019t return home due to restrictions. UK Government & universities lied by saying COVID-19 was in control in the UK, enforcing lockdowns after, affecting our mental & physical health, trapping us away from our loved ones & with no one to rely on for help. Financial struggles due to expensive fees and conversion rates, which skyrocketed during this pandemic.",
        "background": "We international students want to be treated fairly for the struggles we're facing, therefore, we would like a minimum of 20% discount of our tuition fees. Non-EU International students pay tuition fees which range from around \u00a313,000 up to \u00a337,000 per year depending on the university and course.",
