        "additional_details": "Young people are finding it increasingly hard to live and survive during the cost of living crisis due to being underpaid, why should an 18yr old be paid less for doing the same job as a 30yr old for the same amount of time in a job? In my opinion they shouldn\u2019t. Young people need to be paid fairly and with the current minimum wage age system we have in place they aren\u2019t being and being young has a lot of challenges don\u2019t let one of them be money, help our young people make a decent, fair wage.",
        "background": "I think regardless of your age you should be paid fairly, this would mean that if you are, for example 18 starting the exact same job at the same time as a 30 year old you should both be paid the same minimum wage, this would then increase every year for a number of years due to experience gained.",
