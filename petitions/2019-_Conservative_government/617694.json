Shark finning is already illegal in UK waters, and the UK Government is banning the import and export of shark fin products.\r\n\r\nWe can accept petitions calling for trade sanctions against particular countries, but it would need to be clear what sanctions you wanted to be imposed, and against what countries.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for the Government to increase funding to protect sharks, but we can't accept petitions calling for additional funding for particular charities.\r\n\r\nWe can only accept petitions about things the Government or Parliament are directly responsible for, so can't accept petitions calling for action by international bodies, such as the UN."
