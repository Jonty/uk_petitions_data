I was lucky enough to have \u00a33k spare to pay for this treatment however not everyone has that sort of money in their back pocket. By spreading awareness of this condition, I am hoping it will get more recognition by the NHS - making the botox treament available. The majority of sufferers are born with the condition and do not deserve to live in so much pain and discomfort.",
