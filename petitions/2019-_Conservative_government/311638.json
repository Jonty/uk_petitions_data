        "additional_details": "At a time of national and international crisis, Britain can no longer afford to squander vast sums and scientific resources on a policy designed to counter the remote and improbable threat of nuclear attack. The finance and technology involved is now desperately needed to counter a real and actual threat to the lives of millions. Britain should set an example to the other nuclear powers and urge them to take similar initiatives, but it cannot wait for multilateral action which has not been achieved in fifty years. When the crisis is over there can then be a thorough review of strategic priorities.",
        "background": "Britain should halt its programme of Trident renewal and all work on its nuclear weapon systems, applying the funds, research and technology resources instead to provide vital equipment for the NHS and support the struggle against the coronavirus.",
