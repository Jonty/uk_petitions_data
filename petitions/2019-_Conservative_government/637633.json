Members of The Royal Family are Colonel-in-Chief of many regiments and most importantly on the day I enlisted as a soldier I swore allegiance to the Queen (may she rest in peace), and have a signed document to prove it. We believe it is not acceptable that the UK Government has a policy that excludes Commonwealth veterans in this way given how closely aligned we are.",
