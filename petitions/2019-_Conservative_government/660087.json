        "additional_details": "I have noticed a large number of food delivery motorcycle riders with learner plates on the road. I think they often show poor driving behaviour and often do not abide by traffic rules. I believe that instead of using their provisional status to practise driving, they are taking advantage of the rules to provide food delivery services. I urge the Government to ban the use of provisional licence for commercial purposes, lest the riders pose a danger to other road users.",
