        "additional_details": "As explained above, the BBC provides invaluable services to the people of the UK and the world, and is thus invaluable itself.\r\nIt is not right that the Government should defund and attempt to shut it down when it has been integral to British culture for many decades already, and hopefully many decades to come.\r\nTo quote the Guardian, it 'is one of this country's glittering achievements', and the 'Government\u2019s attack on the BBC is a threat to our democracy'. The Government must support the BBC.",
        "background": "The Government has made deep cuts into the BBC's funding which will forever affect the BBC negatively. Not only does the BBC create amazing shows/movies and give unbiased news reports, but it also educates children of the UK through Bitesize.\r\nThe Government must cease its attacks on the BBC.",
