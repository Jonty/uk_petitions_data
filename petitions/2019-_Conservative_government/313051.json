Some people have now got reduced earnings or have lost their jobs and therefore could struggle to pay the balances and therefore lose their deposits for little reason leaving a great deal of money lost to this industry unnecessarily.",
        "background": "Force holiday companies to relax balance due dates until it is known if holidays are going to go ahead as planned.\r\n\r\nBalances are due for holidays taking place later in the year which could be cancelled if the FCO extend travel restrictions due to coronavirus.",
