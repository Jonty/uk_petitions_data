        "additional_details": "Examinations are stressful for us. Especially when we aren\u2019t even of knowledge of the topic in exams. For example my knowledge on the majority of paper 2s in all sciences is terrible as we learnt the majority of it at home or in the midst of COVID-19. This would create mental health issues by making us still do exams after we were of knowledge they were cancelled.",
        "background": "As GCSEs and A Levels have been cancelled to prevent us doing exams, why should students still have to sit exams and tests at school for their grades? It is on the topics we\u2019ve learnt at home and etc over the last 2 years and won\u2019t do well on because of this. Give us teacher assessed grades please.",
