        "additional_details": "Currently, the Act protects trans people from discrimination on the basis of both sex and \u201cgender reassignment\u201d, regardless of whether they have undergone medical transition or hold a Gender Recognition Certificate. It can allow trans people to access single-sex spaces such as DV shelters, bathrooms and hospital wards.\r\n\r\nThe proposed change would remove a legal protection for trans people and encourage discrimination. We ask the Government to refuse this change to the Equality Act 2010.",
        "background": "It has been reported that the Government may amend the Equality Act to \"make it clear that sex means biological sex rather than gender.\" The Government has previously committed to not remove legal protections for trans people, an already marginalised group, but this change would do so.",
