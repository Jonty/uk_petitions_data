        "action": "Reduce exam content instead of pushing back A-Level/GCSE 2021 exams!",
        "additional_details": "Many students are frustrated with the situation as it is, online lessons aren't as effective and learning new content in these circumstances is very difficult. Year 12's are already behind and struggling to cope with the COVID-19 rules. Reducing content on the exam will then give a still very accurate grade instead of pushing the exam back meaning that the students are under more stress especially with the uncertainty of the Corona Virus situation.",
        "background": "Instead of eating into students holidays because of COVID-19, reducing the content allows the students to perform at their maximum rather than cram revision on subjects that can't be taught properly in a few extra weeks. A lot of students are angry about exams taking up their holiday time.",
