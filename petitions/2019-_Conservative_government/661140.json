        "additional_details": "It is too easy for abusers to subject their victims to emotional abuse without there being any consequences for their actions. Victims not only suffer emotional abuse at the hands of their abuser, but also have to deal with the mental impact after the event. We believe there is a lack of awareness and understanding of emotional abuse in the UK. Emotional abuse is a form of domestic abuse, but we think it is not taken seriously enough as there often are not physical signs of abuse.",
        "background": "Too often abusers get away with emotional abuse, and we believe there is a lack of awareness and support for victims. We want the Government to provide funding to increase awareness of emotional abuse, improve support for victims, and also review the handling of cases of emotional abuse.",
