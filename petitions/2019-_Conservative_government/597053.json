        "action": "Allow father's to have a fair trial in court by getting legal aid.",
        "additional_details": "I want you to bring back legal aid because In a world where we are rightfully fighting for equalities in all walks of life, I fail to understand how mother's have rights over the child and control over access from a father without a father being able to get any legal representation. I personally spoke to a lady that works for the probation service and she told me that I'm the first person she has spoken to in thirty years of doing the job that has managed to successfully obtain a child order",
        "background": "I want you to bring back legal aid so father's can get legal help and advice when being denied access to their children. Too many mother's in this country at some point deny the father access to their children without justable reasoning. I believe this is a big part of young male suicide rates.",
