        "additional_details": "Women are at a significant safety disadvantage in cars. Factors such as seat height and firmness, as well as mostly male crash-test dummies that don\u2019t account for female muscle mass distribution, bone density, and pregnancy play a significant role in this.\r\n \r\nIn a car crash a woman is:\r\n \r\n\u2022 47% more likely to be seriously injured.\r\n\u2022 17% more likely to die.\r\n \r\nIn a society that strives for equality, this is unacceptable.",
        "background": "The car safety standards used in the UK under-represent women. Women are disproportionately more likely to suffer serious injury in car accidents, and we would like the Government to review car safety regulations with gender inequalities in mind.",
