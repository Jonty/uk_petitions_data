        "additional_details": "Herbivores have an innate capacity to hide their suffering. Compassionate societies should not take advantage of any stoical species' essential survival mechanism. In Europe, Canada and the United States this system of housing is not unusual and it would be appropriate that Britain, a nation of animal lovers, leads by example. Mahatma Gandhi described a cow as 'a poem of pity'. If Britain can ban tethered housing systems for cattle it may encourage other nations to follow our example. ",
        "background": "Although uncommon, it is still legal to use tethered housing systems for cattle in the UK. We believe tie-stalls & tie-sheds are unsuitable for intelligent, sensitive and socially complex animals. Farming grant applications can be made if upgrading is necessary to comply with a ban. ",
