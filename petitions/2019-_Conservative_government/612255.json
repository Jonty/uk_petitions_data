        "additional_details": "Pet shops in the UK advertise many rabbit cages which are under 8 sq ft, and we believe do not meet the required size for the well-being of the animals. Cages from as little as 4.6 sq ft are sold as a suitable home.\r\n \r\nMany consumers trust pet shops to be advertising correct care information for the well-being of their pet. It is the law to meet the rabbits welfare needs and by selling these cages, we believe pet shops are failing to ensure that the welfare of rabbits is protected.",
        "background": "Under the Animal Welfare Act 2006, owners of rabbits must make sure they meet their needs, including providing a suitable environment and place to live. Yet pet shops sell numerous cages that we believe are not adequate. This encourages improper care & threatens the animals welfare.",
