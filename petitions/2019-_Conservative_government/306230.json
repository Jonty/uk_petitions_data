        "action": "Shorten the summer school holidays to allow UK children to finish primary school",
        "additional_details": "The final year of primary school is an incredibly formative one, a time to mature socially and educationally in preparation for the scary prospect of secondary school. The Covid-19 pandemic will potentially rob these children of these essential last weeks. During this time businesses will also miss key workers, juggling childcare/home education and work. By shortening the summer break this would allow children to have some normality, create lasting memories and allow parents back to work too.",
        "background": "Allow UK children, the Covid-19 generation, the opportunity to finish their primary education, with their friends and in school should the school closures have to continue for more than 12 weeks, by cutting short the unnecessarily long  6/7 week summer break.",
