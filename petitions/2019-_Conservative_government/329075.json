        "additional_details": "Suspend all arms export licences and transfer weapons that may be used in Yemen; Terminate military assistance to parties of this crisis including Saudi and other partners e.g. USA and UAE; Transfer of \u2018penholder\u2019 responsibility for drawing up in the UN Security Council charter resolutions on Yemen to a MS with greater credibility and no bias; Legislation to suspend of arms to lift the blockade of Yemen to allow for sufficient food, and healthcare to be arranged; Put the highest political pressure on parties to agree on a ceasefire and join peace negotiations leadings to lasting political settlement and economic recovery. Peace talks should be inclusive of establishing women, youth and civil society rights.",
        "background": "The court held the governments granting of licences to sell weapons to Saudi as a breach of export law. As there was a \u2018clear risk\u2019 the weapons would be used in \u2018serious violation of international humanitarian law\u2019. The court froze the issuing new licences. But this does not reduce its production.",
