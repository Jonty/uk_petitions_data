        "additional_details": "It's not just the doctors, but the nurses, paramedics and many more. There are final year students and retired people who are willing to help the country fight this virus. Increased pay for NHS workers is definitely a long-term goal. However, the NHS workers who are risking their lives are not doing it for the money, it is because they are truly passionate about saving lives. This medal would be a recognition of their service, which they can keep with pride.",
        "background": "During world wars, soldiers were deemed the heroes. Now in this pandemic the heroes are those in the NHS. Similar to how soldiers who fought for our country are awarded with medals to honour their service to the country, the NHS workers who are working tirelessly should deserve the same.",
