Various polling through 2020 shows that the public want to Remain in the EU (as of June 56%). Brexit is not right for the UK. It will destroy our economy, lower our living standards, lower our global standing and threaten our territorial integrity and cohesion.  All this chaos and pain for a non-binding opinion poll, is simply wrong.",

Please revoke Article 50.",
