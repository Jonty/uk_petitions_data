        "action": "Modernise the house buying process to protect participants prior to exchange",
        "additional_details": "The way it works at the moment is simply not fair and offers no level of protection to either party, until the exchange has been completed, by which point a lot of money has already been spent! By implementing some protection prior to the exchange it would reduce the likelihood of a person withdrawing from a sale, and would also prevent individuals reducing their offer close to exchange, as the Vendor would be protected by the pre-exchange contract.",
        "background": "The process for how properties are bought and sold in England is outdated and doesn\u2019t protect the Vendor or Buyer should anyone change their mind. There should be a condition in place, that once an offer has been accepted on a property, both parties should enter in to a pre-exchange contract",
