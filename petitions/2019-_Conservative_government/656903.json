        "additional_details": "During the Covid-19 pandemic, advice was not to visit the dentist to curb virus spread. I have now been removed as a patient due to non-attendance as so many have.\r\n\r\nThe British Dental Association (BDA) state at least 4 million are likely to struggling to get an appointment with a dentist.\r\n\r\nNot all will be able to pay the difference between private and the NHS element, however, some will freeing many critical appointments and reducing the financial burden for those who have no choice but to go private.",
        "background": "This petition seeks a change in policy that would allow patients who have been unable to register with or secure an NHS appointment with a dentist to take their element of NHS funding and use it towards private care. We urge policymakers and relevant authorities to consider this proposal seriously.",
