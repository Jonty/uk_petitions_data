        "additional_details": "A lot of people struggle with rent, however rental could be used towards a mortgage repayment history. If someone can say pay \u00a31000 a month rent successfully for say 5 years, then they would definitely be able to pay a mortgage for example of \u00a3500 a month. Which I believe would help our current financial crisis but also allow current landlords to charge up and profit from the scheme also",
        "background": "If a family can show that they have successfully rented for a period of 5 years with no defaulted payments. Allow them a 0% deposit mortgage if the monthly repayment is up to or under their current monthly rental.",
