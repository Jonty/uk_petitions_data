        "action": "Aim to introduce recycling bins to all local parks across the country by 2025.",
        "additional_details": "There are a multitude of reasons behind this petition, but the most prominent is the immediate threat of climate change, which is becoming more and more irreversible by the second. Over 26 million tonnes of recyclable waste ends up in landfills each year from UK homes alone, which costs the government around \u00a32,496,000,000 per year in landfill taxes. Reallocating this money and creating recycling amenities is a must if we are going to stand a chance against climate change.",
        "background": "It was recently brought to my attention that no parks near me currently provide amenities for recycling, meaning many tonnes of waste produced at these locations each year ends up in landfill sites, furthering the ecological damage to this planet. We need to change this as soon as possible!",
