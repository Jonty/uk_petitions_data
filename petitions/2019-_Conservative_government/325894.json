        "additional_details": "The government has already decided that cancelling the 2020 series of exams for current year 11 and 13 students is an appropriate solution given the circumstances and give them grades predicted by their teachers who know them and their abilities. I think that it would only be fair to do the same for year 10 and 12 students as they are going to miss out on the same amount or even more learning as year 11 and 13 students and are therefore equally affected.",
        "background": "Different schools teach courses in different ways and cover topics at different times so students will miss out on the teaching of different topics, putting certain students at a significant disadvantage in their exams as topics they haven't covered may come up in the exam. Exams should be cancelled",
