        "additional_details": "Not only is this extremely unethical, but this is against the Nuremberg Code 1947. Furthermore, The Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 specifically states that members of the public should not be compelled to undergo any mandatory medical treatment, including vaccinations. Forcing anyone to receive a vaccine under duress, under UK law, constitutes an unlawful injury. A vaccination requires an individual\u2019s informed and voluntary consent, which you would not be gaining.",
        "background": "We are urging Government to stop the idea of mandatory Covid vaccines for healthcare workers. It is extremely unethical to make any kind of mandatory laws of uptake in the Covid vaccines as all are still in the trial periods. Where there is a risk, there must be a choice.",
