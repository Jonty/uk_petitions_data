        "action": "Protect the NHS from any possible trade deals both inside and outside the UK",
        "additional_details": "Part of what makes the UK so brilliant is its universally accessible healthcare. The threat of privatisation puts thousands of vulnerable families at risk, as the basic right to healthcare could become entirely unaffordable. The recent defeat of the amendment to the trade bill leaves the NHS wide open to potential privatisation and a loss of autonomy over what happens to the institution. We depend on the NHS now more than ever and we must know that it will remain free and accessible forever.",
        "background": "An amendment to the government's trade deal intended to protect the NHS from any form of control from outside the UK has been recently defeated. Parliament needs to protect the NHS at all costs from any external influence, particularly from any organisation that puts the NHS at risk of privatisation",
