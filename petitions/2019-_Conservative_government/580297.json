        "additional_details": "The government has offered a pay rise of only 1% to NHS nurses, despite their hard work in saving countless lives during the pandemic. Following the UK's departure from the EU single market and EU customs union on 31st December 2020, the UK no longer pays the alleged \u00a3350 million per week to the EU, so it is inexcusable to offer NHS nurses such a low pay rise. The promised benefit of Brexit must now be delivered.\r\n\r\n\u00a3350,000,000 x 52 weeks \u00f7 1,300,000 NHS workers = \u00a314,000 per annum per worker",
        "background": "In 2016, Boris Johnson campaigned from a Vote Leave campaign bus, on which it was stated:\r\n\r\n\"We send the EU \u00a3350 million a week\r\nlet's fund our NHS instead\"\r\n\r\nNow that the UK has left the EU, the government should spend \u00a3350m per week to fund a \u00a314,000 per annum pay rise for each NHS worker.",
