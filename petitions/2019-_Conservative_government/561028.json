        "action": "Test school staff for Covid-19 at least once a month.",
        "additional_details": "As of 27th October, 55% of secondaries and 20% of primaries in England reported having one or more pupils self-isolating due to potential contact with a case of coronavirus in the school. If we do not regularly test school staff, cases will continue to rise undetected; this will disrupt pupils' education and endanger their wellbeing. Regular testing would enable the government to stay up-to-date regarding school transmission rates, which will be crucial in their approach to schools staying open.",
        "background": "School staff are on the front line of this pandemic - if they are asymptomatically Covid positive, they could spread Covid-19 to the hundreds of pupils with whom they are in daily contact. Cases of Covid-19 among school staff and pupils are at a record high, especially in the North of England.",
