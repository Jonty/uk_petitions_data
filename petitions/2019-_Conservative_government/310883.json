There are many construction sites across the country, but not all of them should be considered essential. These workers still travel to work during peak hours and work in groups, risking their lives as well as the lives of many other actual essential workers. They should have the rights to protect themselves and others, and also to help stop the spread of the virus at this critical time.",
