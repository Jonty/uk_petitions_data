        "action": "Stop coercion and intimidation via domestic vaccine passport restrictions.",
        "additional_details": "To show we are not living in a totalitarian state but we still have individual choice. There is no proof of a benefit to society by restricting citizens movements now that the majority have been vaccinated. Creating a two tier society is unethical, many cannot be vaccinated through no fault of their own or have ethical or religious reasons to remain vaccine free.",
        "background": "The Government are currently using the tactic of threatening to restrict freedom of movement and access to education using vaccine passports in order to coerce young people into getting vaccinated. This is undemocratic and contravenes people's rights as well as creating divisions in society.",
