        "additional_details": "Our healthcare heroes, including doctors and nurses, deserve recognition. We urge fee waivers to ease their financial burden. The upcoming 20% hike to \u00a32,885 from \u00a32,404 is a heavy burden amidst rising living costs, which affects some healthcare professionals on visas. These individuals play a crucial role in the NHS and our communities. We believe that supporting them financially is an investment in the future of our healthcare system and the well-being of our nation.",
