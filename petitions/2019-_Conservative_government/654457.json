        "additional_details": "The government must adequately fund and maintain its commitment to defence and the UK's interests abroad. We believe that decommissioning and mothballing of four of the RN's vessels would diminish the UK\u2019s ability to fulfil its commitments abroad and to maintain peace and order in the face of global tensions. We consider it is of paramount importance that the RN is well-funded and recruitment issues are addressed.",
        "background": "Media reports have said that these vessels may be axed from active service. We believe this must not happen and they should be maintained until there are sufficient replacements. It is also important that appropriate funds and personnel are allocated and maintained for the Royal Navy's (RN) upkeep.",
