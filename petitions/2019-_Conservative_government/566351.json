        "additional_details": "I live in Peterborough, where on the date of 24th November it was reported that 'a total of 182 staff and 1,067 pupils in Cambridgeshire are self-isolating as a result of Covid-19 cases, with 90 staff and 1,526 pupils self-isolating in Peterborough.'\r\n\r\nDuring the last school term, schools were struggling with having enough teachers to teach bubbles and had to change to remote learning for some year groups. \r\n\r\nEither switch to remote learning or let us decide if our child should return to school.",
        "background": "We wish for school fines be abolished until after the COVID-19 pandemic is over or until the vaccination has reached at least 50% of the UK Population. \r\n\r\nIf a parent decides they believe schools are not safe enough to risk sending their children to school they should not also have to fear fines.",
