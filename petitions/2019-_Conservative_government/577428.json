        "additional_details": "Many students across the country are enrolled on higher education courses that have switched to exclusively online delivery. Of those who have persisted with this switch, rather than defer, student experiences have varied considerably. Regardless of individual experiences, I believe strongly that for this period, all students should pay no more in fees than what they would have paid had they chosen an online delivery mode, or their institution\u2019s cheapest location at which to enrol.",
        "background": "Where higher education students have continued their courses online during the COVID-19 pandemic, fees for the disrupted period should be capped at that institution\u2019s lowest advertised fee, as if it were an online course, or the institution\u2019s cheapest location that the student had enrolled upon.",
