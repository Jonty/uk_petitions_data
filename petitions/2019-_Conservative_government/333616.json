The daily updates provided information on what was going on and what would happen next. The leaflet that was distributed gave households the info that they needed, and was clear and to the point.\r\n \r\nThe government needs to responsibly deliver essential information and make sure everyone is informed. Every household should receive an updated leaflet, and daily briefings should resume.",
