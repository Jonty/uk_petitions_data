        "additional_details": "People need to be informed in every way possible, not just rely on the internet and hearsay. This is not working. The daily updates provided information on what was going on and what would happen next. The leaflet that was distributed gave households the info that they needed, and was clear and to the point.\r\n \r\nThe government needs to responsibly deliver essential information and make sure everyone is informed. Every household should receive an updated leaflet, and daily briefings should resume.",
        "background": "We need the return of the daily updates, and leaflets like those that were issued at the start of the lockdown. We believe people are not getting the information that they need, and that leaflets to every household would be a good way of distributing up to date information.",
