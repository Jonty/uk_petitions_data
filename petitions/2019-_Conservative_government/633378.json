Therefore, I believe the Government as a whole could act on this issue and should consider safety of our children across every school in the country.",
        "background": "I want action on this as I have seen many near collisions outside my own school, and fear this will only increase with higher traffic congestion. Some analysis found that over 1,200 children are hit by vehicles in 20mph zones each year - and it is my ambition to reduce these concerning figures.",
