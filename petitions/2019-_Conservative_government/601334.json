This would allow the NHS to use the thousands of experienced EU registered nurses work as real nurses in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe current price for the English test represents an important financial ask for pre-registered nurse as it can be between 20 to 25% of their monthly income.",
        "background": "The NHS is currently struggling to recruit nurses and there are thousands of qualified, educated and experienced EU registered nurses, that cannot fully do their job because they are required to pass an English language test, which is currently provided by private suppliers.
