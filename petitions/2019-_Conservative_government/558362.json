        "additional_details": "Baby classes are invaluable to new parents particularly in lockdown when we have no support at all from any family or friends outside our own household. Myself and many other new parents are now dreading losing this lifeline during the next few weeks as it will leave us all incredibly isolated from the outside world.  We have already had to endure restricted pre and post natal care.  New parents now need more support than ever before, yet we seem to be left with nothing.",
        "background": "Currently baby classes are subject to the lockdown proposals, despite being classed as educational. They are COVID secure events with excellent social distancing measures. I strongly believe baby classes should be rated as important as keeping nurseries, schools and universities open.",
