Now the Government has announced plans to ban these dogs, and it has been suggested that owners will have to neuter or spay their dogs to keep them, I want the Government to set up a scheme to pay for neutering/spaying American XL Bully dogs.\r\n \r\nNeutering/spaying a dog can be expensive, and not everyone can afford this, especially with the current cost of living crisis. So if this is to be made a requirement for owners, then the Government must make it accessible and easy for responsible owners to do.\r\n",
