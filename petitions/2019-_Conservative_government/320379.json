Impact directly their chances of success in next year's exams. \r\nY10 and Y12 are old enough and mature enough to ensure they socially distance in school. Unlike many very young children who are being permitted to return to primary school.\r\nSo let them return to school on June 1st as a priority, and get the education  and life chances they deserve",
