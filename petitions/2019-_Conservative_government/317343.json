        "background": "In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, Government has intervened in the economy in an unprecedented way.\r\n\r\nThe recovery must not simply reinstate 'business as usual' \u2013 Parliament must introduce a radical 10-year strategy for public investment to decarbonise the economy and eradicate inequality.",
