We propose granting an additional 30 minutes exam time for female students dealing with period pain. This extra time could help reduce the stress associated with managing menstrual discomfort while focusing on an important examination.\r\n \r\nThis isn't about gaining an unfair advantage; it's about creating a fairer environment where all students can perform at their best despite natural biological processes beyond their control.",
