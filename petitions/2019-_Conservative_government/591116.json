        "additional_details": "I would like to ask the government to make it a legal requirement for indoor establishments/venues to request a vaccination passport(or equivalent) on entry. Because there will be reasons why some people are not able to get vaccinated, a recent negative covid test will also enable entry. The mental health and well-being of a lot of people has suffered from loneliness due to lockdowns and restrictions. Everyone needs human interaction to feel alive again. Let\u2019s find a safe way to achieve this",
        "background": "By the end of the summer everyone will have been offered a Covid vaccine. Those don\u2019t just protect the person that gets the vaccine, but also the community. We would all be safer in indoor places if; only people who are fully vaccinated, or have recently tested negative are allowed entry.",
