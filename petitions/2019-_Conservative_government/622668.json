        "additional_details": "The southern part of Pakistan has been completely devastated by floods and rain, the Government officials are taking tours around the world and wasting all the money instead of helping the poor. People of Sindh, Balochistan & southern Punjab have been left alone with water level continuously on the rise. 10000s of villages have been levelled to the ground due to continuous rains and there is more water coming in. The after effects will be more shocking when due to still water more disease will spread",
        "background": "Send Aid in form of tents, nets, medicines & rations to Pakistan, as Pakistan being the part of former Colony of the British Empire, it is a duty of British Government to send aid in times of need.",
