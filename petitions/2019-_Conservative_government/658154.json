        "additional_details": "The gastric pacemaker is not always provided through the NHS and we believe it should be. The surgery costs approximately \u00a316,000, which is a lot of money for a procedure that I think constitutes basic medical care. Thousands of people live with this condition. Without this surgery many will be on a feeding tube for the rest of their lives, which means they can never eat again, as without that tube they can\u2019t survive.",
        "background": "The gastric pacemaker is a surgical implant which tells the stomach to empty at a certain frequency. This helps those with gastroparesis to be able to digest food and keep it there. Gastroparesis is a condition that causes the stomach to be paralysed.",
