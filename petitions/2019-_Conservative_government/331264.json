        "additional_details": "Currently CICA decides whether to award compensation based on the \u201cbalance of probabilities\u201d, but we believe this results in decisions that are unfair to many survivors of historical child abuse, who deserve recognition, support and compensation. The Government should reform this system to better meet the needs of people who have after bravely come forward in difficult circumstances, reliving the ordeal to seek support and recognition.",
        "background": "The Government should reform how the cases of survivors of historical child abuse are considered by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA), to make it easier for survivors to receive the recognition, support and compensation they so desperately need and deserve.",
