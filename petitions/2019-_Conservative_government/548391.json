The report also examines how well the new proposals protect existing buildings or localities, and provide mechanisms for local engagement in the planning system.\n\u00a0\nFind out more about the Committee's inquiry into the future of the planning system in England: https://committees.parliament.uk/work/634/the-future-of-the-planning-system-in-england/\n\u00a0\nFollow the Committee on Twitter for updates: @CommonsHCLG\n\u00a0\nWhat is the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee?\n\u00a0\nThe Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee is a cross-party group of MPs known as a 'select committee' which scrutinises the policy, administration and spending of the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.
