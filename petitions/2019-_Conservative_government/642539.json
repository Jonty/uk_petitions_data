        "additional_details": "The UK Film and TV industry contributes billions to the economy, and a large proportion of production is based on work from US studios. Current US strikes mean that work has disappeared for many UK freelance crew overnight.\r\n \r\nThere has been no bespoke support for the crew during the strikes. Many are only just recovering financially after Covid and now find themselves again without work. Many are suffering financially and mentally and are having to find work elsewhere. This could have a long-term effect on the entire industry\r\n",
        "background": "We want the Government to do more to support UK TV and Film Crew who are unable to work due to strikes by actors and writers. The UK freelance crew who work on these projects need financial support and reassurance from the Government that they will not abandon the crew during this crisis.",
