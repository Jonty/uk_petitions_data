        "action": "Ban Staffordshire bull terrier breed dogs in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "By allowing people to legally have Staffordshire bull terrier as a pet, is putting vulnerable people at risk, for example young children, disabled people or elderly people. Our responsibility is to take care of these people, and by banning this dog breed, the streets would be safer for them.\r\n\r\nMy other point of concern is that, with the recent increase of gangs in London, teenagers are petting Staffordshire dogs to protect them, which results in having more aggressive dogs on our streets.",
        "background": "Staffordshire bull terrier dogs are responsible for most of the recent dog attacks in UK, sometimes resulting deaths, specially on vulnerable people. \r\nI am from Southeast London, recently just infront of my flat an elderly woman coming back from shopping was attacked and taken to the hospital.",
