        "additional_details": "It's important to consider the potential consequences before implementing a ban on phones. While it may seem like a solution to reduce cyberbullying, it could lead to an increase in real-life bullying. Additionally, parents may need to send urgent messages to their children and not being able to do so quickly could be problematic. It's also important to remember that phones provide a sense of safety and security, as individuals can easily call for help if needed.",
