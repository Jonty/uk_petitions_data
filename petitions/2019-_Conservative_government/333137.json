        "additional_details": "This will be so damaging to people suffering from eating disorders to eat out. The focus on calorie consumption is unhealthy, all foods are healthy in moderation despite calorific value. While 18.2 percent of people living with obesity will pass away as a result of related issues, the mortality rate of anorexia nervosa is 1 in 5. Both issues need to be tackled with utmost care for people\u2019s mental wellbeing. This approach to fight against obesity will damage people trying to recover from an ED.",
        "background": "Prevent the proposed legislation for calories to be published on menus in restaurants coming into force. This will not resolve the obesity crisis and will be greatly damaging for those with an ED orunhealthy relationship with food, a mental health sector which is already underfunded.",
