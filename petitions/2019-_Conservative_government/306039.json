        "action": "Ban banks from hiking interest rates during the coronavirus crisis",
        "additional_details": "While mortgage payments have been stopped, rent and bills have not; evictions have been temporarily banned but rent is still due. Evictions are only banned until the end of the moratorium, and landlords only advised, not required, to cooperate on repayment with tenants afterwards. \r\n\r\nIn order to avoid being evicted as soon as the ban ends, many will have to resort to using their overdrafts; this interest hike dramatically increases the amount of debt incurred by those least able to shoulder it.",
        "background": "HSBC has recently almost doubled its arranged overdraft interest rate; this prevents many people losing work from being able to pay their rent and bills.\r\n\r\nThe government should immediately freeze interest rates, and reverse any made during the crisis, so that those unable to work can survive.",
