It is a well known fact that adopted children and care leaver children are disadvantaged with their education and their emotional wellbeing. This doesn't just stop when the child moves up to sixth form/ college and university and we get left with no extra support or funding to help us with our education.",

I wish for this money to be available to college and sixth form students as well as University students. The need for support and to close the learning gap doesn't just stop when a child leaves high school.",
