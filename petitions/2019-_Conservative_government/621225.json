While there is a shortage of drivers prior to the Covid-19 and Brexit, these 2 events have exacerbated the situation; the pandemic halted driver training & testing for more than 12 months, while an estimated 14,000 EU drivers returned home during the pandemic and following the end of the transition period. \r\nWe do have the workforce as above we just need to get it done & sorted now!",

It will be beneficial to Brazilians with UK residence, to have their licences exchanged for British equivalent driver's Licences. Let's get it done!",
