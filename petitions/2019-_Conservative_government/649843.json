        "additional_details": "Currently it can be difficult for people receiving Carer's Allowance to find part-time work that doesn't lead to them losing their entitlement to Carer's Allowance, because of the \u00a3139 a week earnings limit.\r\n\r\nAllowing people to work up to 16 hours a week would still leave them time to spend at least 35 hours a week providing care.\r\n",
