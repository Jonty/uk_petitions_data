        "additional_details": "The UK Government Petitions system has been successful in allowing citizens to voice their concerns and gather support for various causes. However, it lacks a mechanism for direct citizen participation beyond petitioning.\r\n\r\nDirect Ballot Initiatives, as seen in other democracies, provide an avenue for citizens to propose, amend, or repeal laws through a direct vote.\r\n\r\nBallot Initiatives empower citizens. They will strengthen our democracy, promote transparency, and ensure that citizens are heard.",
