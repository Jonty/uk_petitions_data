        "action": "Require sexual assault and rape cases be heard by multiple judges, with no jury",
        "additional_details": "We think this is necessary because most jury members have not studied the law and we think don't know enough to know it. Juries get briefed on the law however it can be easily forgotten or not understood. We do not think it's right to have people that may not fully understand the law to be in a position of power in the justice system when it comes to sexual assault and rape cases.",
        "background": "I want sexual assault and rape cases to be decided by multiple judges who will then make a group decision, rather than guilt being decided by a jury. This would mean decisions are made by professionals who have studied and understand the law, rather than members of the public.",
