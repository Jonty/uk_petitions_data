        "action": "Non-recyclable packaging must display a prominent Earth Health Warning label",
        "additional_details": "This would address three climate crisis issues. \r\n1. When people recycle, it would be clearer to know not to put the packaging in a recycle bin \u2013 a major issue for recycling centres\r\n2. People who want to only buy products with recyclable packaging will find it easier to avoid packaging with the warning label. \r\n3. Manufacturers will be driven, by otherwise falling sales, to move to better packaging and a year gives them time to make the move.",
        "background": "The label should be similar to those used on cigarette packaging which  would have several benefits in driving the consumer market away from non recyclable packaging.\r\nGovernment should insist this is done by the end of 2022 giving manufacturers time to implement the change.",
