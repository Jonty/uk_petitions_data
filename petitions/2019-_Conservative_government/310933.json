        "additional_details": "Franchisees have legal documents in the form of a contract as proof of when they began trading/became self employed. They will also have a business plan and financial forecast showing earnings which can be compared to real world figures showing how the business has performed since trading started. This should negate the fear that their claim could be fraudulent and give realistic figures to work out a figure for financial help for loss of business due to Covid-19.",
        "background": "Franchisees who have bought a franchise in the last 12 months should be given financial help during the Covid-19 pandemic to prevent them going out of business and being left with massive debts. At present if they have not filed a tax return they are only eligible for Universal Credit.",
