Many children's families simply cannot afford a remote working device (at least a 15 inch PC laptop, with wifi, with an integrated HD web cam & microphone) for all/any of their children & there are many homes which cannot afford to even have broadband. There has been talk of rolling out technology to fix this, but it has not happened. No more delays to education are acceptable!",
