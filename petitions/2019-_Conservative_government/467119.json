        "additional_details": "Many more of us are having c-sections; 29% in the UK compared to the 10-15% WHO recommendations.\r\nIt is very concerning that after major abdominal surgery, many NHS practices send patients home within 24-48hrs post operation with no pain relief and little to no follow up information and care. Most other surgical procedures have 6 week or 3 month check ups and we call to the government to make this a standard post operative c-section care. Pain relief, wound management and exercise advice welcomed",
        "background": "A Caesarean section is a major abdominal operation whereby both your abdominal muscles and uterus are cut. Currently there is no standardized post c-section care amongst NHS practices within the UK. Many patients are sent home with no pain relief, no wound care management advice and no follow up.",
