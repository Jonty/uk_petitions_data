        "additional_details": "According to the crime survey for England and Wales last year March 2020, (an estimated 5.5% of adults aged 16 to 74 years) 2.3 million people last year went through domestic abuse. This is not spoken about enough and government are not doing their part to help these young adults come out of these abusive relationships. I believe it would be helpful for young girls to learn of the signs of an abusive relationship from the start so they are better protected.",
        "background": "I want more action on this issue because many young adults who share an intimate relationship undergo many different types of abuse and violence. This is not taught or brought up to young people from the start of their secondary education, hence why we believe the rate of abuse is high.",

If there are specific changes you would like to be made to the curriculum, you could start a petition about that."
