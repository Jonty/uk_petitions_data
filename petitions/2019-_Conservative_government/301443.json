The use of recoverable, or non stun slaughter is offensive to many on grounds of animal welfare as noted by the British Veterinary Association, RSPCA and many other groups as well as being against the religious rights of other orthordox groups such as some Sikh, Hindu, Buddist and Christian groups",

Germany requires licensing and the matching of volumes produced to actual needs for religious slaughtered products.Britain has no such defined requirement for monitoring or enforcement",
