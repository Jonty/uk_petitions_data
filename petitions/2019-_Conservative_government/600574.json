        "action": "Make being in possession of date-rape drugs a crime of conspiracy to rape",
        "additional_details": "Currently, there are no consequences, relating to sexual assault, to being found in the possession of drugs only used to spike people i.e. flunitrazepam (Rohypnol), gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), gamma-butyrolactone (GBL). Being in possession of these drugs clearly indicates that the person is intending to date-rape someone in order to sexually assault them. We need better legislation to ensure consequences, reduce cases and prevent future incidents.",
        "background": "We need new legislation to protect us from being spiked by making being in possession of date-rate drugs a crime of conspiracy to rape. This conviction should equal time in prison. In turn, they should be added to the sex offenders register.",
