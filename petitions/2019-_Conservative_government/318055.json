They are always there fighting to keep us safe and well.  We fear that once the current pandemic is over NHS Carers efforts will be forgotten and they will be penalised with pay freezes and below inflation pay rises particularly if we face austerity again.  We do not want to forget what NHS workers have done and want to express our thanks with some promises for the future.",
