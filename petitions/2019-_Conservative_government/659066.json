We believe too many children are being allowed to access hormone therapy which we think they should not be receiving. Too many biological women and girls are threatened by biological men entering their safe spaces.",

We believe that this Bill provides the right solutions by defining sex as biological sex and preventing children from accessing irreversible treatment, and would protect women and girls.",
