        "action": "Change the way in which mortgages are calculated.",
        "additional_details": "It is said that as a Conservative belief, ownership of a home is an integral part of \"our\" society. Therefore, I implore the government to review and change the way in which mortgages are calculated, making it more viable and affordable for people to own their own home. \r\nFrom research found, it is not logical for a single person to only be eligible to borrow 4.5 times their yearly salary when house prices are incrementally higher. On extension, this is for previous and existing homeowners only.",
        "background": "Affordability remains the biggest barrier to homeownership and this is due to the disproportionate variation in salary to the borrowing amount. \r\nSince 1996, wages have doubled on average, whilst house prices have almost quadrupled meaning owning a home for many people will be totally out of reach.",
