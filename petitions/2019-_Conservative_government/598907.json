If people choose not to tell their children that they are at risk, this can lead to the gene being passed on unknowingly. \r\n\r\nWith the correct information, people can not only prepare for their own future, if they wish to start a family, they can also choose fertility technologies to prevent them passing on the gene. This could enable HD to be wiped out in a generation.",
