        "additional_details": "What we have to remember is that opening schools to any student or teacher during these times, will cause more problems and do more bad than good. Children may not be at high risk but they are still at risk, and so are teachers. I am asking the government to move the reopening of schools to September and start a fresh and do what everyone needs in these unprecedented times. In the end this will NOT help our NHS, and will NOT save lives, which is supposed to be our main priorities.",
        "background": "Schools are one of the most important parts of children\u2019s development, they are a necessity and are extremely important! However during these unprecedented times schools are an easy way for the virus to spread, so by opening them to ANY student during this time will cause more deaths and more cases.",
