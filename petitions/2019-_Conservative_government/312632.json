        "additional_details": "This should greatly benefit both local planning authorities and developers. In light of the current health crisis, there will likely be a delay in the ability of developers to implement their planning permissions. The consequence of this is that numerous planning permissions will lapse, which could undermine the ability of local planning authorities and developers to get back on track and secure the delivery of much needed development after the current crisis.",

The Government ought to introduce temporary measures to ensure that the time for implementing any permission, discharging conditions or submitting reserved matters is extended by 6 months",
