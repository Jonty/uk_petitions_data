        "additional_details": "I would like to see the use of gelatine capsules stopped and alternative ingredients being used. Many supplement company\u2019s are using vegan capsules, I would like to see this being rolled out to all medications. Each prescription I have collected they have been able to give me a vegetarian alternative so I would like to see the use of gelatine and animal products removed from all medications.",
        "background": "I am a strict vegetarian,one of the main things I have an issue with is the use of gelatine on the capsules of medication, I have a note on my file to say I\u2019m vegetarian,this regularly gets overlooked so I need to check with the pharmacy everytime I collect a prescription to ensure it is vegetarian.",
