        "additional_details": "Legislation should be introduced requiring cats to only be allowed outdoors under the supervision of the owner.\r\n\r\nFree-roaming creates also a huge risk to cats themselves as across the country, they are shot, poisoned, and stolen. There are also cases of them being mutilated, drowned, beaten, set on fire, used in ritual sacrifice and used by dogfighters as \u201cbait.\u201d Cats can live happy lives indoors, and they can be given opportunities to explore the outdoors under supervision therefore, for the mutual benefits of the wildlife, cats and local societies, free-roaming must be legally restricted.",
        "background": "Free-roaming domestic cats let outdoors without supervision are exposed to many dangers, including diseases other cats may have, and they urinate and defecate in uncontrolled way and are a risk to wildlife such as rare birds. ",
