        "additional_details": "The commitment at COP26 that financial institutions would reach net-zero by 2050 is far from enough. BankTrack has said that, in order to have only a 50% chance of limiting global heating to below 1.5 degrees, global carbon emissions must be more than halved by 2030. To be possible, banks must stop financing the fossil fuel industry in this decade. This is not happening. Banks around the world have invested over $3 trillion into fossil fuel in the past five years. The time to legislate is now.",
