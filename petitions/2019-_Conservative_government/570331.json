        "additional_details": "When consumables such as pads and batteries expire or are used in an emergency, additional funds are then urgently required to replace those items to avoid the defibrillator being temporarily decommissioned. This takes away from raising funds for additional defibrillators and could cost lives.\r\n\r\nThis would be easy to set up with the main suppliers as most CPAD`s use products from a relatively small number of manufacturers. It could even be controlled through local Ambulance Trusts.",
