        "additional_details": "Indoor Tennis facilities for those in Tier 2 mean that we aren\u2019t allowed to play tennis with anyone outside our household. Yet, we can have 1:1 coaching indoors allowed and concurrent fitness class activity in leisure clubs and gyms with multiple people up to 25 happening daily in Tier 2 areas. Allow us to play at very least singles which is no different to 1:1 coaching. If we all follow the LTA guidance re. distancing and own balls, there\u2019s minimal risk when you consider total area of courts.",
        "background": "Allow people from different households play indoor tennis in Tier 2 areas. The area of indoor courts both floor and above means it is one of the most socially distanced indoor sports. At very least let us play singles to match the fact we can have coaching 1:1 indoors.",
