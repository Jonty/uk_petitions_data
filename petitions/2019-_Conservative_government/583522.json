        "additional_details": "In light of recent events and the Premier League \"big 6\" threatening to form the Super League, fans must be allowed a greater say in how their local football clubs are run. Football has been at the heart of countless British communities since the late 1800's and they are an integral part of society as a whole. However fans, players, managers and countless more are being ignored in favour of greed. The Super League will cause irreparable damage to the English footballing system and local society.",
        "background": "In Germany, fans must own at least over half of the club and have the biggest say in decisions regarding the club. This same system should be looked at for the UK. Giving fans a prominent voice allows them to shape club decisions that benefit the public and the community. Not corporations.",
