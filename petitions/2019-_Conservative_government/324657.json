        "action": "Run a nationwide campaign to raise awareness and educate people on littering",
        "additional_details": "Recent relaxing of lockdown rules has served to highlight the enormous issues we face with littering. News articles showing beaches, beauty spots, national parks, country parks, local parks, etc. all covered in streams of litter left behind by visitors has brought the issue to national attention. A quick scan of news sites shows this is not a local issue, with examples from as far and wide as Devon, Dorset, Cumbria, Derbyshire, Essex to name but a few. It requires a coordinated government effort",
        "background": "Littering across this beautiful country has reached crisis point and requires urgent and coordinated action to both educate and change the way people in society behave. As a catalyst it requires a Government led national anti-littering campaign across all media designed to reach every demographic.",
