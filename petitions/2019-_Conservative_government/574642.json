        "action": "We the undersigned want Parliament to hold a second EU referendum.",
        "additional_details": "A second referendum is neither anti democratic nor does it make a mockery of democracy..\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, another democratic vote by the British people is essential,  particularly to save the lively hoods of Britain \u2018s coastal fishing industries. And of course, EU nationals continuing to staff and uphold our great National Health Service.",
        "background": "The first referendum was based on lies and misinformation, so now that the consequences of leaving the EU are more widely known, it is essential that a second vote is held so that people can make an \u201cinformed decision\u201d about whether they want to remain part of Europe or not ?",
