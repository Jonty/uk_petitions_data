        "additional_details": "Asking for \u00a32,250 for a 10-day hotel stay is unfair. It cannot be compared to a normal hotel stay where proper house keeping, food choice and room services are provided.  We have all seen horrible food quality and security issues in these hotels. As more countries came out of the red list, it appears as if the govt is penalising the rest by increasing charges so it can make up for the lower occupancy rate. Either make whole costs breakdown public or refund everyone who has ever paid for it",
        "background": "The Govt needs to share the full breakdown of its hotel quarantine costs that have been increased from \u00a31,750 to \u00a32,250. The govt should not view it as a commercial activity to make money. Its a huge financial burden for most, many of who are tax payers in the UK.If not then refund everyone who paid",
