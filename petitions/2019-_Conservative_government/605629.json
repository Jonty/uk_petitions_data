        "additional_details": "I believe the outdated ban of alcohol at seats is destroying the trust and relationship between fans and authority at football matches. By re legislation of the practice, I believe that fans would have greater match day enjoyment as seen in the German leagues, Lower league games in England and other sports in this county. Forcing fans to stay in the concourse to finish a beer instead of heading to their seats can cause frustration and disorder, and this rule needs to be scrapped in 2022.",
        "background": "Allow fans across all leagues in England to enjoy an alcohol drink at their assigned seats with the use of plastic cups. All football fans of age should have a right to consume a beer while watching the match and demonstrate that this doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to an increase in disorderly conduct.",
