        "additional_details": "Many people who are in Spain already and those who are due to travel in the coming days kindly ask for the Government to consider this as not all families have sufficient funds and may not be able to pay rent, bills or mortgages etc if required to self-isolate. All travellers returning to the UK should be offered a free Covid-19 test and not be required to self-isolate if it is negative, or receive financial support for 14 days. Many people I know will now struggle if nothing is done.",
        "background": "Not all travellers returning from Spain will be able to self-Isolate for financial reasons. The Government should offer support for both Employed and Self-Employed for the time in self-isolation, or offer free covid-19 tests so they do not need to self-isolate.",
