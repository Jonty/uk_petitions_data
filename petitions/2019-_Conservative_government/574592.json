After 10 months of massivly reduced income, my payments are still based on figures from 2019. The CMS have still not adjusted payments. If however they would use monthly figures from HMRC, the payments could be adjusted monthly. They should have full access to these figures. This would mean, better payment consistency, less non payment and fairer for both parties.",

This means payments will be based on last months earnings, not earnings that are in some cases 12 to 24 months old.",
