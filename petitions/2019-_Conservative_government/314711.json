We owe them a great deal of gratitude for all that they do\u201d.  Her offer of a 1 year free visa extension to 2,800 staff is derisory and demeaning to them and to the good name and traditions of our nation whose subjects' lives they are saving every day. Granting these vital NHS staff indefinite leave to remain is the very least we can do.",

The government must offer all current overseas NHS staff and their families, irrespective of grade or position, more certainty by granting all ILR.",
