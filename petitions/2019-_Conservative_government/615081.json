        "additional_details": "Only 10 months ago the human rights record of Rwanda was called into question by the UK's own ambassador for human rights. This was over concerns into investigations into multiple human rights violations.\r\nThe UN refugee agency has branded this plan unacceptable and a breach of international law, which should at least make us consider strongly why the government is so keen to press ahead here.",
        "background": "The government has made its intention clear. It therefore must fall on Parliament to consider the implications for this countries international standing and ultimately its ethical and moral position in transporting people fleeing tyranny and terror from around the world to Rwanda.",
