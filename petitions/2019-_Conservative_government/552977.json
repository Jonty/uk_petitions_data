        "additional_details": "On the 15th July, the Government annouced it was reducing VAT from 20% to 5% for food and soft drinks sold at hospitality venues, through until March.\r\n\r\nThis cut is of little benefit to the thousands of wet-led venues, that are not food focused. As such, further action is needed by the Government to ensure they make it through the winter. \r\n\r\nWe implore the Government to extend this VAT cut to alcohol sold for consumption on the premises at the earliest available opportunity.",
        "background": "In addition to reducing VAT to 5% on all food and soft drinks for hospitality and tourism businesses, we ask that the Government extend that cut to alcohol for the same businesses for the same period of time.",
