        "action": "Introduce Unconditional Basic Income for low income workers affected by covid-19",
        "additional_details": "If the financial barrier to self-isolation was removed for low income workers, this would better manage the spread of covid-19. Similarly it would enable travel and hospitality businesses to manage through the restrictions and remain in business ready for when any restrictions are lifted. \r\nGiven the link between the economy and health, without intervention, there will likely be additional health risks from the adverse economic impacts of covid-19 as well as from the virus itself.",
        "background": "Calling on the government to introduce Unconditional Basic Income to the population most likely to be adversely impacted economically due to covid-19, to help reduce the spread and to provide an economic buffer to the most vulnerable.",
