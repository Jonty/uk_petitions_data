        "additional_details": "I am a district nurse who works 12 hour shifts. I work in a team that covers the Streatham area. Me and my team have noticed that there are several cameras and 'no motor vehicle' signs on several roads which makes it very difficult for us to travel between patient to patient. It also causes us to be fined whilst on duty caring for our patients. I believe this will consequently result in more accidents on the roads and confusion. It will also lead to an increase of CO2 emissions.",
