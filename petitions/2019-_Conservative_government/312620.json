        "additional_details": "In times of medical crisis, NHS workers give an inordinate amount of extra time to their jobs. As we are in the midst of the Coronavirus pandemic, those in the NHS are working overdrive and have little option but to do this to avoid huge loss of life.\r\n\r\nCrises are rare, but do happen (pandemics, terrorist attacks). The annual holiday allowance should take this into account.",
        "background": "As compensation for the additional time, stress and risk those in the NHS are sacrificing during the COVID-19 pandemic, they should be given 5 additional days of annual holiday in compensation. Additionally the holiday allowance for key NHS workers should be raised in anticipation of future crises.",
