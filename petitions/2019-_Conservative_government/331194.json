        "action": "To repeal the Sunday Trading Act 1994",
        "additional_details": "Sunday trading laws are outdated and not fit for purpose. In a culture of predominately '9 until 5' working, Sunday trading laws are an obstacle, with many doing their shopping at weekends, rather than evenings.  The issue is exacerbated with many exceptions to the rule (like fast food chains being able to open 24/7) creating a nonsensical inconsistency.  Allowing Sunday trading would potentially provide a helpful boost to our economy, as more are able to shop at times most convenient to them.",
        "background": "To repeal the Sunday Trading Act 1994, but to introduce new legislation providing workers with the right to refuse to work on Sunday.  This change would bring the position in England and Wales in line with Scotland (see the Sunday Working (Scotland) Act 2003) which is much more progressive.",
