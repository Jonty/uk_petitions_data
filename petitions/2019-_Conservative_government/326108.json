        "additional_details": "There has been a huge wave of public anger at the desecration of public monuments including the Cenotaph and Churchill statue in Parliament Square. Lists are now circulating identifying other targets for criminal damage, including memorials to figures held in great esteem by millions such as former Prime Ministers Grey and Peel. But there are also many lesser known statues that may not have the same level of protection and which, if we are not careful, we may simply wake up one day to find gone.",
        "background": "We are currently experiencing a wave of attacks against our public landmarks by a sometimes violent minority. We need to safeguard our collective history and culture for future generations. This history belongs to us all and should not be in the power of local figures to remove without due process.",
