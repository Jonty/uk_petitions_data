        "additional_details": "As a care leaver I have heard of young people being exploited. I believe that regulation by Ofsted could improve the standard of accommodation care leavers are housed in. Every young person should have the right to feel safe and supported where they live. I believe that by enforcing Ofsted regulations could create a safety net and possibly stop young people from being exploited and feeling isolated.",
        "background": "I believe the Government should extend Ofsted's remit to require them to inspect young people's accommodation when they leave care. Our most vulnerable young people are being housed in accommodation that is largely unregulated, and this can present a safeguarding issue.",
