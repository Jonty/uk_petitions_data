        "additional_details": "For years, big companies have used buyback schemes & offshore tax havens to starve their own companies of revenue. This maximised payouts to shareholders, while allowing them to minimise staff wages & payments to HMRC, and now, it's an excuse to deny customers legally entitled refunds.\r\nMeanwhile, thousands of small limited companies that treat customers fairly and pay their UK taxes are being left behind, unable to access affordable loans or government grants.\r\nDon't help billionaires. Help SMEs.",
        "background": "Companies owned by billionaire investors, many of whom pay little or no UK tax, are asking for government bailouts. Conversely, small businesses that pay all their taxes in the UK have received almost no help from government, with owners expected to take out expensive loans to cover bills.",
