        "additional_details": "Small and local businesses are not only essential in our economy, but in our communities, too. Helping them to thrive by allowing them to re-open ahead of larger businesses and corporations will help communities to come together and mend the social wounds of isolation, distancing, and lockdown, as local and small restaurants, shops, and hospitality venues serve a vital role in the spirit and morale of local areas in towns and cities across the whole United Kingdom.",
        "background": "All business has been impacted massively by the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent UK lockdown, but we believe it is vital that small and local businesses in particular be given a 2 week head start ahead of bigger businesses, because they will be at a disadvantage in the economy.",
