I am aware of employers chasing BRP applications with the Home Office, and receiving no response. Some people are homeless because they have not been able to prove their right to rent. People also face difficulties travelling and accessing healthcare.\r\n \r\nThe government should undertake an urgent review of current arrangements for production and delivery of BRPs, to identify how delays can be eliminated.",
