For example, reduced air and cruise travel, working from home where possible, reduced consumption, community-based leisure pursuits and mutual support. We need a smooth transition to a new approach that involves a reduced carbon-footprint which will mitigate the imminent danger of climate breakdown and make the UK a role model for COP26.",
