For example, reduced air and cruise travel, working from home where possible, reduced consumption, community-based leisure pursuits and mutual support. We need a smooth transition to a new approach that involves a reduced carbon-footprint which will mitigate the imminent danger of climate breakdown and make the UK a role model for COP26.",
        "background": "We need an emergency cross-party government to be formed to see us through the ongoing Climate and Ecological Emergency. We recommend that the emergency government use the Citizens Assembly negotiating method to make the difficult decisions that will be required.",
