Many teachers have had to skip vital revision or exam technique lessons in order to cover course content in the remaining time.\r\n \r\nThe amount and timing of strikes varies between state and independent schools and by region, leading to significant inequalities. Special consideration would ensure that no student is disadvantaged by industrial action out of their control.\r\n",
