        "additional_details": "In this situation, delaying the rent for three months is a big debt to the tenant. It makes the tenents need to pay rent + rent which they didn't pay before. \r\n\r\nEven if the tenant starts working right away and gets paid and get paid 80% by the Corona Job Scheme. It doen't mean they have enough income to pay rent.\r\n\r\nGoverment must support all tenants because tenants are way weaker  than their landlords.\r\n\r\nAfter the covid, landlords will still own their properties. \r\nBut tenants will not own anything.",
        "background": "I think the gov should guarantee the rent reduction NOT put off for 3 months. Either way, directly to the tenant or to the owner.\r\n\r\nCovid causes lost jobs or reduced wages. Putting off rent for 3 months doesn't help.\r\n\r\nAfter the corona virus, landlords will still own their properties.",
