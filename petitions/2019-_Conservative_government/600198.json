        "additional_details": "The Government has removed the \u00a320 uplift for Universal Credit that was put in place during the Covid-19 pandemic. This \u00a320/week made a huge difference to people, helping to top up rent where UC does not pay the whole amount or helping pay for food and energy.\r\n\r\nThe autumn budget has decreased the taper rate for UC claimants and increased the work allowance so people who work are slightly better off but disabled claimants who are not well enough to work are left at a disadvantage.",
        "background": "Increase UC by \u00a320/week for people who meet the \u201climited capability to work\u201d & \u201climited capability for work and work related activity\u201d. People who meet these criteria are recognised by the Government as not being able to work due to disability and will not benefit from the taper rate changes.",
