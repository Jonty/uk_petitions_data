The Ukrainian army is considerably less resourced, skilled or supplied than the Russian army especially when it comes to anti missile ammunition and capabilities. Ordinary people have taken up arms to fight for their freedoms but Russia is attacking all cities and residential areas from the air. Ukrainians need our help. They are fighting so we in the UK don\u2019t have to but we must stand up for our values.",
