        "action": "Ban the use of virgin plastics in all packaging sold in the UK before 2023",
        "additional_details": "The UK produces more plastic waste than almost all other countries worldwide. Current schemes for plastic recycling do not work, with most UK waste sent overseas, where it is burnt or dumped in the seas, destroying human, plant and animal habitats. \r\n\r\nBy banning virgin plastics, manufacturers will be forced to use recycled materials, creating a circular economy that increases the value of recycled plastic that in turn should ensure proper recycling, and reduced pollution and petrochemical use.",
        "background": "Parliament should pass legislation banning the use of virgin plastics (plastics made directly from petrochemicals rather than recycled plastic) in all product packaging sold in the UK by the end of 2022.",
