        "action": "Legalize Pepper Spray For Self-Defence",
        "additional_details": "Pepper spray is a widely recognised non-lethal powerful deterrent that can be used for self-defence, reducing the risks of assault.\r\n\r\nEven being legally allowed to carry pepper spray will give people a stronger sense of safety, knowing, if needed, they can use it.\r\n\r\nPepper spray causes immediate closing of the eyes, difficulty breathing, runny nose, and coughing. Using pepper spray against an attacker can drastically increase the victim's chance of getting to safety without causing severe harm.",
        "background": "The British government states that pepper spray is considered to be an offensive weapon, which makes it illegal for the British public to own and/or carry. \r\n\r\nThis petition calls upon the British government to legalise the use of pepper spray for self-defence.",
