        "additional_details": "With menstrual waste from disposable products ever growing, WEN research estimates that 1.5-2 billion menstrual items are flushed down toilets each year at a cost of \u00a388 million a year to unblock the sewers. We want to help reduce this unnecessary waste by updating sex education in schools to highlight eco-friendly options that benefit health, wellbeing, and the planet. In doing this, we can help young people make more informed choices and stop disposable products from ending up in landfill and ultimately saving the planet one reusable product at a time.",
        "background": "The Government should make it mandatory for schools in England to refresh and update their period and sex education programmes to include reusable product information to ensure that young people are more informed about all the options available to them.",
