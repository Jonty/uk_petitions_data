        "action": "Introduce an independent football regulator and stop the creation of the ESL",
        "additional_details": "Clubs throughout the football pyramid are losing significant amounts of money, accumulating debt and not being run in a sustainable manner. The 'elite' club owners are disregarding the traditions of their clubs and supporters. Leveraged debt is being used to purchase clubs and the new owners are able to take huge salaries and consultancy fees. New revenues are ploughed into players salaries which drives the need for additional revenues and ventures such as the ESL.",
        "background": "Raise the necessary legislation to block the creation of non competitive leagues and other competitions including the proposed ESL. Put an independent regulator in place to ensure football clubs are run in a sustainable manner, root out bad practice and represent all stakeholders.",
