        "additional_details": "Proactive strategy to avoid the sudden increase in SEMH difficulties in neurodiverse children and teens who are misunderstood and as such treated as 'undesirables' leading to plummeting self esteem and a need for connection (often found though crime or drugs). A community based approach where everyone is 'understood', strengths and success are the focus and practical 'outside the box' thinking is celebrated and nurtured. Some of our most successful entrepreuneurs have ADHD but the amount of children I see, as SenCo, hit rock bottom through lack of understanding in the educational system is profound.",
        "background": "Create an outside, farmstead type alternative to conventional education with a focus on vocational and life skills. Teaching children to grow, harvest and prepare their own food. Basic English and maths onsite and therapeutic interventions where necessary. Focus on environment and sustainability.",
