        "additional_details": "There are different minimum wages for different age groups, with the highest minimum wage only applying to people aged 23 and over. We believe this is unacceptable. Many people are struggling financially and paying people less because of their age is discriminatory.\r\n \r\nThe cost of living crisis is affecting young people too, so why aren\u2019t they entitled to the same wage as older people? There are so many people under 23 who are in the same situation as older workers, and not everyone is lucky enough to have parents or other family to help them out. We think this needs to change!\r\n",
