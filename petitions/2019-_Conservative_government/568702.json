It is completely unfair to both private and public schools, as children in public schools won\u2019t have the equal opportunity. Cancel them all together to help us manage our stress because we have much more to worry about- may I remind you WE ARE IN A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. So please, as our government, do what is correct and fair to everyone, to keep everyone healthy and happy.",
        "background": "To our parliament. \r\nYou are doing us no favours by keeping iGCSEs. You are creating unnecessary stress for us, and by cancelling them it will help us a lot more. We can focus more on proving ourselves to get the grades we deserve and spend less time revising for only half of our exams.",
