        "action": "Require new large buildings include renewable energy generation",
        "additional_details": "We want the Government to help us make a cleaner future for all in the UK. Starting by tackling one of the biggest users of fossil fuels; larger residential buildings and workplaces. We want this because in 2020, the UK's fossil fuel dependency was 76.5%. This high consumption of damaging resources puts our future in jeopardy. Introducing a legally bound 25% minimum dependence on integrated renewable energy should reduce reliance on fossil fuels and decrease current over consumption.",
        "background": "We want the Government to require new buildings to include renewable power generation, such as solar energy, to ensure that all future commercial and residential building developments accommodating 50 or more people can meet at least 25% of their energy needs for integrated renewable generation.",
