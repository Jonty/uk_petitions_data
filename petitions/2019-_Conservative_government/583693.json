        "additional_details": "We want you to reward or sanction companies who do or do not meet the 25% target after 2026 through the public procurement process. The industry needs 35k new people each year to close the skills gap. Women want to work in construction, companies want to attract them, there is no support and no incentive to do so. The industry needs Government intervention. We want accreditation similar to health and safety, to make it clear to all who are complying and who aren't.",

We call on the Government to mandate a minimum 25% female workforce in construction companies by 2026, with companies who do or do not meet this target sanctioned or rewarded through the public procurement process.",
