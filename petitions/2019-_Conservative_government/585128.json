Their import should be allowed, provided the animals are registered and release into nature is prohibited.\r\n \r\nAcceptance of immigrants without their pets is also a kind of inhuman act. New UK immigrants should be able to bring pets to the UK with them.",

Due to the current situation in Hong Kong, I decided to leave, but the current restrictions on import of invasive species has caused problems.",
