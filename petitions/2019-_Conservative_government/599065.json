        "additional_details": "Many healthy animals are dying from anaesthesia or sadation. Therefore I believe those procedures are sometimes unnecessary for X-rays. Many pets are wrongly diagnosed because owners are afraid their pets won\u2019t wake up after anaesthesia or die after 48 hours. We humans are very often exposed to radiation during X-ray and there are very small risks to non. So I would like to ask to let us decide to keep our loved pets live or to get more advanced gear so the staff are less exposed to radiation.",
        "background": "I would like to let pet owners decide whether it\u2019s possible to hold pet while doing X-ray. Or to get more advanced  gear for the workers so they can hold pet while doing this procedure. Many other countries do the X-ray without anaesthesia or sadation.",
