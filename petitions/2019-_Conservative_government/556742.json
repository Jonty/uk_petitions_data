        "additional_details": "I would like the Government or Parliament to revise the army policy on tattoos. Tattoos have become more acceptable in modern society and should no longer stop people from joining the army. More and more people are getting tattoos everyday as a way to express themselves. It is important that we address this issue or more people will be rejected from the army and soon these policy's will hinder our ability to build an effective army/defence force. In 2014 they changed their policy to allow tattoos on the back of the neck, this needs to be extended to tattoos on all areas of the neck.",
        "background": "To revise the army's policy on tattoos. I was recently rejected from the British army because of my neck tattoo. This has been devastating news for me and many other people who want to join the army to protect our country.",
