        "action": "Require schools allow students to wear PE kit for whole day on PE days",
        "additional_details": "During the covid-19 Pandemic, many schools allowed students to wear their PE kit on days they had PE. This helped make PE more accessible to students who feel too self conscious changing in public.\r\n \r\nNot having to change at school can help lower the risk of bullying and sexual assault. I believe it is archaic to still expect students to have to change at school, in front of their peers. Students should have the right not to change at school if they are not comfortable doing so.\r\n",
        "background": "I want the Government to require schools to allows pupils to decide whether they want to wear a PE Kit to school, or get changed at school, on days they have PE. This would mean students could avoid changing at school, if they do not feel comfortable doing so.",
