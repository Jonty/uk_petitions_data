        "additional_details": "Around 25% of all mid-trimester losses are caused by an Incompetent Cervix.  Current guidance does not allow for routine monitoring meaning that many women lose their children as a result of IC as it is often too late to offer treatment.  The most successful form of treatment is a trans-abdominal cerclage but this should be done pre-pregnancy as the surgery itself can cause miscarriage.  Current guidance does not allow for this to be picked up on pre-pregnancy for many women.",
        "background": "Ensure that women in a high-risk category are offered a pre-pregnancy trans-vaginal scan to measure cervical length and cervical length checks should be performed routinely throughout pregnancy.  Where cervical length falls below 2.5cm a treatment plan should be offered.  This will save babies lives",
