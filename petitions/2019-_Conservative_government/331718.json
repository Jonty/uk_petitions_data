        "additional_details": "Every day we see politicians making baseless claims with no supporting evidence. There seems to be no pressure to evidence said claims. This makes a mockery of the British system of governance and insults the British public. It also leads to mistrust in all political parties and breeds apathy amongst the public. Most importantly it also endangers lives when in the midst of a pandemic.\r\nThis is a cross party issue. Anyone elected by the British public should not use their position to spread lies.",
        "background": "Force politicians to stop making baseless claims, especially when in session in the house of commons. Politicians should be forced to back up any statement proffered as fact. If statements cannot be backed up with fact based evidence the speaker will be punished for lying to the house and the public",
