        "additional_details": "The rise of large and heavy motor vehicles (>1,500kg) has been on the rise in the UK for a decade. These vehicles offer negligible improvements in safety whilst worsening road safety for all road users. These vehicles have been shown by the IEA (International Energy Agency) to be actively working against global carbon reduction goals including the UK's own Net Zero targets. \r\n\r\nWith the advancements in electrification, new modes and services, there is little or no need for these vehicles.",
        "background": "There has been a trend of increasingly large and heavy motor vehicles (over 1,500kg) being purchased and used for private trips. These vehicles are more likely to kill and injure due to their excessive weight, momentum and physical size (reduced sight lines).",
