They enter the UK based on opportunity offered by employer, subject to available sponsor license/CoS\r\n\r\nThese workers contribute to economy similar to those in skilled worker route. Current policies on some routes e.g. ICT do not allow time spent in the UK to be counted for ILR in 5 years\r\n\r\nGovernment should review current policies on ILR after 5 years for all work visa routes and set an example of fair treatment to all foreign workers",

Few of these routes do not offer settlement after 5 years e.g. ICT visa holders, even if workers pay appropriate taxes.
