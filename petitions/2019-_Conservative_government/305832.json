The supermarkets are doing all they can by limiting sales, but this does not stop the panic and queuing which becomes a vicious circle. I have tried contacting the BBC etc but they do not reply. Please help.",
        "background": "To help reduce panic buying, the Government needs to get the media to act more responsibly.  We see excess use of 'empty shelves' footage and still images in the newspapers but more so on national media such as BBC news and the main networks.",
