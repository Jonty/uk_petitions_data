        "additional_details": "We have many crisis\u2019s on this planet and one of the major ones is littering & illegal dumping (fly tipping) \r\n\r\nI would like the government to recognise this as a serious issue that needs more clear and solid solutions into preventing it happening. \r\n\r\nI feel there needs to be regulating and overseeing of the car parks (first and foremost car parks around food outlets) and clear signage of the operating CCTV, the reason they are there & clear instructions that if not obeyed they will be sent fines.",
        "background": "I would like to see (as a starting point) fully working CCTV in car parks specifically around food outlets, an employee that checks daily for people littering & issues fines among those that do. \r\n\r\nMore awareness I.e posters of anti-littering & clear rules that if broken fines will be given.",
