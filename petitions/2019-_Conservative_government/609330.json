The mental health services are stretched to the limit and too often fail to help those who need them most. A common barrier is the need for trained mental health professionals. Educating people across society to recognise and support people with mental health problems such as early stages of depression or anxiety via basic CBT training, could ease the load on NHS and local support groups.",
