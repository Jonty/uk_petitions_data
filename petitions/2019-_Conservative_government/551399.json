        "additional_details": "Many children have suffered during lockdown, both educationally and mentally. Education settings are now up and running again staff and children need to feel confident that long periods of home learning will not become the norm. Routine is important to our young people and having no control over when they will or will not be able to attend school will affect not only the education they receive but also their emotional well-being. Prompt testing of symptomatic children would allow any who test negative to stop self-isolating unnecessarily and quickly return to school.",
