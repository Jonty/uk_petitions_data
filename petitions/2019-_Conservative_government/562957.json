        "action": "Grant all U.K. servicemen and women an automatic right to live in the U.K.",
        "additional_details": "The British Armed Forces currently recruit service personnel from Fiji and Nepal, but do not automatically grant them the right to live in the U.K. with their immediate families on discharge from the services. Applications to remain must be be made within a week of discharge and require legal representation (and funding to pay for it). Reform of the rules is required to allow a reasonable amount of time to prepare such applications and raise the necessary funds. This petition seeks to gain public and parliamentary support for these reforms. Those who are willing to fight and die for this country deserve to live in it thereafter. Anything less is morally reprehensible.",
        "background": "Review the rules regarding the rights of U.K. service personnel who are not British citizens but who serve this country, for a minimum of three years, with a view to granting an automatic right for them, and their immediate families, to a right of residence on discharge from the Service.",
