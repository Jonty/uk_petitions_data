        "additional_details": "These migrant caregivers have left their homelands and families to provide care in the UK, only for some to find themselves ensnared by exorbitant fees imposed by third-party providers who unlawfully sell visa sponsorship without genuine employment opportunities. Upon arrival, despite having secured full-time job offers and contracts, in some instances, they discover no available work.\r\n \r\nMoreover, if the sponsors engaging in these criminal activities end up losing their Home Office sponsor licenses due to non-compliance, this leads to the cancellation of the victims' visas. We believe this situation is exceedingly unjust, subjecting them to immense mental and financial hardships.\r\n",
        "background": "I would like the Government to conduct a review of issues experienced by Health and Care Worker visa holders, including reports of exploitation, and take proactive measures to support any victims, recognising their difficulties.",
