        "additional_details": "The fans are the heart and soul of football, the government should talk to the PL and the FA and work with them to make all top flight clubs compliant in a scheme similar to German football where 51% of clubs are fan owned.\r\n\r\nThis is to ensure English clubs never try such a disgusting move ever again. As these clubs will be about the fans and not self serving business men.",
        "background": "After the owners of the \"big six\" tried to start a coup against the PL, UEFA and the fans, it is time we took their power away, they have proven that the sport is not their interest but lining their own pockets.\r\n\r\nEnough is enough.",
