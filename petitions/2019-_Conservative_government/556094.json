        "additional_details": "Some MPs are not representing their local communities, or even engaging with them at all. It should be entirely possible to have a by-election to allow for the removal of an MP who is deemed to be working against their constituents.\r\nMPs should not have the protection of retaining office until the next general election, regardless of their stance. Constituents elect their MP and therefore, they should have the ability to quickly remove their MP if they are not for for purpose.",
        "background": "Constituents, who elect a Member of Parliament, who subsequently determine that their views are not being represented by their MP, should have the ability to remove them from office, with a recall petition and by-election, and not have to suffer the MP until the next general election.",
