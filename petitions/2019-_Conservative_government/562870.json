        "additional_details": "On 1st may 2020 the welsh government decide it was right to give all NHS workers, some of whom have been put in propelled into the face of covid-19, Often without the adequate P.P.E a \u00a3500 one-off of payment. On 30th November 2020 the Scottish government followed suit in rewarding the NHS and care works the \u00a3500 one-off payment, Stating the new pay deal is likely to take an extend time to get to a deal. These works deserve to feel appreciated now.",
        "background": "We all know that this global pandemic has been hard on all sectors not least the brave fount line staff, who have been busy worked selflessly through out this pandemic. \r\nWe are asking for there to be a slimmer payment in the English NHS as there has been in both Scotland and wales.",
