        "additional_details": "The impact media can have on society is massive: although undoubtedly a positive influence, if  actions are not responsible or are driven by a selfish desire to lead on a developing news story, the impact is alway suffered by the public. Panic food buying at the height of the pandemic and now the petrol crisis are all examples of over reporting. The media must be held to account for this and manage news content responsibly.",
        "background": "The recent fuel crisis was started by media outlets scrabbling for a story. Panicked by overstated reporting, the subsequent public response has led to the fuel shortage. Had  media reporting been balanced, proportionate and responsible this wouldn't have happened.",
