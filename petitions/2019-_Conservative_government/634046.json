        "additional_details": "Huge amounts of empty blister packs are discarded, causing undue harm to the earth. Put in kerbside recycling, this causes pressure on local Council recycling centres, contaminating batches. Many different types of plastic are used in the packaging. Virgin plastic uses fossil fuels which we should eliminate, and most plastic recycled deteriorates in quality. Long-term sustainable packaging is required. Glass & foil are infinitely recyclable.",
        "background": "Require all producers involved in the manufacture of medication/supplements in the form of tablets, to remove all plastic and mixed materials from packaging. This should be replaced with aluminium foil, glass bottles, paperboard. Require items imported from abroad also to conform.",
