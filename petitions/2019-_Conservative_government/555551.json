        "additional_details": "I believe that it\u2019s unfair for women of all ages to have to pay for items they need. We cannot control our periods and can\u2019t chose whether to have them or not. There are many women, such as myself, who struggle to afford them.\r\n \r\nThe cheaper products sold can cause many women with more sensitive bodies rashes and other problems, meaning we have to buy the more expensive ones to ensure we are not irritated and put through more pain whilst it\u2019s our time of the month.",
        "background": "The Government should fund the provision of free female sanitary products, because it\u2019s a natural occurrence that women cannot control or choose not to have, and sanitary products are very expensive and the cheaper ones available can cause many females rashes and other problems.",
