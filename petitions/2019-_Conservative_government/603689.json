Cystic Fibrosis was considered \u201ca children\u2019s illness\u201d due to many people with Cystic Fibrosis not making it to Adult Age. However, medicine has come along a long way since the exemption list was last updated and people with Cystic Fibrosis have an average life expectancy of their late 40s. They should NOT have to pay for their medication to make sure they reach that age.",
