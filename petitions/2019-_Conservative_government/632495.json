Those that flout the law should be fined and habitual offenders do community service with their dogs being seized.  Some of the fee should be allocated to rescue centres.\r\n\r\nThese are my reasons:\r\n\r\nIt will reduce:\r\nIllegal puppy farming\r\nIllegal fox, deer and hare hunting\r\nBadger baiting\r\nDog fighting/dangerous breeds\r\nAbuse and abandonment\r\n\r\nIt will improve:\r\nBetter control of greyhound racing industry",
