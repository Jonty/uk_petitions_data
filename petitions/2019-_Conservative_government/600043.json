        "additional_details": "This would give the general public and the wealthy/ businesses more equal opportunities to support political parties and reduce potential for corruption. The average single political donation (worth over \u00a37,500) between 2015-2020 was \u00a320,028.13, therefore this limit should only impact the extremities. Political donations have led to several high profile controversies and perceptions of corruption in recent years, eroding trust in government.",
        "background": "The Government should limit political donations and gifts from any one individual, organisation or business to political parties, organisations and individuals to a combined annual value equal to the average UK yearly earnings (currently \u00a330,212). ",
