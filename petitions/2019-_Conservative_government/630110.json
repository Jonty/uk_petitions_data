        "action": "Mandate banks and payment processors to make refunds within 2 hours.",
        "additional_details": "The cost of living crisis is hitting everyone hard, particularly those on a low income. You purchase an item with your card and the money is put on authorisation pending immediately, and usually taken within 24 hours. But if a retailer makes a mistake and your order is canceled, it can take up to 7 days to have those funds returned. If your disposable income was \u00a360 and you bought \u00a360 worth of food, a situation like this leaves you with no money and no food for 7 days.",
        "background": "Change primary legislation to mandate banks and payment processors to refund card payments within 2 hours rather than 5-7 days. There is no excuse in the 21st century that companies can take money immediately but customers need to wait up to 7 days for the money to be returned.",
