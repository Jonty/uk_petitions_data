        "additional_details": "We believe there is a lack of road infrastructure that avoids London and surrounding areas, and that levelling up involves creating a road network that does not continue to prioritise London.\r\n\r\nWe think restarting motorway building would bring about the most benefit to the most amount of people. This cross-country extension of the M50 could utilise HS2 funding in a similar way to what it was originally intended for.\r\n \r\nThis plan would utilise the A14 Huntingdon Bypass being built to motorway specification.",
        "background": "We propose that the M50 motorway is extended from its current terminus at M5 J8, eastwards to Norwich, by building a new road between the M5 and the A14 at Buckden, and by upgrading the A14 and A11 to motorway standard to create a non-stop motorway to Norwich, terminating at Thickthorn Interchange.",
