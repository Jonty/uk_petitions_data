        "additional_details": "Often loneliness is a significant root cause of mental health problems experienced by individuals on the margins of society, including worsening depression, anxiety, mood disorders, cognitive decline, and suicide. An increase in funding will allow local groups to connect with marginalised, stigmatised and excluded groups of people in rural communities.\r\nLocal groups need to be made aware of this Strategy and how to access the funding, enabling us to support these vulnerable groups effectively.",
        "background": "Increase the funding for the Loneliness Strategy.\r\nThe Government must:\r\n\u2022\tAdvertise the Strategy and the associated funding widely \r\n\u2022\tLet people know how to access the funding\r\nso that rural communities know that this money is available and can use it to reduce loneliness in our communities.",
