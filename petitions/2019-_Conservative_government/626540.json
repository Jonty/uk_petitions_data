They take in carbon dioxide and produce oxygen that we all need to breathe. They reduce pollution. They also provide homes and food for animals.\r\n A financial incentive for everyone to plant more trees could greatly benefit native wildlife and the air we all need!\r\n Just think of how many more trees would be planted if people were paid at least \u00a35 for every tree they planted!",

Animals are going extinct. People\u2019s health is failing and people are actually dying because of this crisis.",
