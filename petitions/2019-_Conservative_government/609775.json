        "additional_details": "Russia has caused devastation on Ukraine, on civilians, on military bases, on power plants, on airports. They will not stop until they are squeezed so far by international sanctions that they can no longer continue. It is paramount that we step up for Ukraine in the name of international peace, international law and allyship.",
        "background": "Please do all in your power to take Russia off the swift system and impose other of the strictest sanctions possible on Russia, such as sanctioning all 50 of Putin\u2019s richest aides, and cutting gas and oil; also imploring other countries to do the same.",
