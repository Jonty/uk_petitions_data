However I am largely self isolating as a means of reducing the likelihood of spreading the virus. \r\n\r\nIn the past for other reasons I have had a phone call appointment arranged and been able to email documents over. \r\n\r\nI have a benefits meeting next week and it seems absurd to me that the British government continues to send claimants, into meetings at the Jobcentre.",
