        "additional_details": "It would be financially better for the government to allow the elderly to retire at 60. The young are mostly more physically and know the technology of today. By releasing the jobs to them there would be less people on the dole and they will be able to support their families better",
        "background": "The reason I think it should be changed is that people around the age of 60 mostly have something wrong with them physically, hips, knees and other illnesses. The jobs should be free for the young people who can in fact physically perform better and faster",
