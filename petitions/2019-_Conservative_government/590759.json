        "action": "Reconsider the the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions on the 19th of June.",
        "additional_details": "Easing restrictions should be delayed. Face coverings do not impact peoples quality of life, and they prevent transmission which saves lives. The number of cases is increasing daily, & deaths are low due to vaccination successes. As the transmission rate increases more Covid-19 variants will emerge, and our vaccines will have a reduced impact against them. Delaying the easing of restrictions until every adult has received both jabs will save lives, and is less reckless than the current approach.",
        "background": "The incompetence of the government has caused three national lockdowns and >100K deaths. While we recognise the need to return to normality, it is important to be cautious. The government is ignoring scientists' concerns. Scrapping mask wearing & social distancing will increase transmission/deaths.",
