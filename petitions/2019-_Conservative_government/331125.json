        "additional_details": "https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/acmd-cannabis-classification-and-public-health-2008\r\n\r\nAs seen in the document above, the conclusions drawn from the report were that \"cannabis should remain a class C substance\". However, following its publication, the government (at the time) went against the advice of the ACMD and rescheduled cannabis to class B. I am simply advocating that the current government follow the advice as given and revert cannabis to being a class C substance.",
        "background": "Recently, the government responded to the petition: \"Make cannabis legal for recreational use for ages 21+\" by Drej Make. In this response, the government cited various documents from the ACMD. In their citations, I believe the government cherry-picked information to support their stance.",
