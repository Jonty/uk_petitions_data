The current condition of the roads is sufficiently poor with the amount of potholes and ageing tarmac and in addition to that night time driving in the winter months with bad weather can be challenging and very dangerous.",
        "background": "The Government should make it a legal requirement that all A roads have a painted nearside line and reflective studs on all painted lines, and fund local authorities to do this on their roads. This should improve night time visibility of road markings.",
