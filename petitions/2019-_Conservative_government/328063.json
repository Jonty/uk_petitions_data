        "action": "Prevent the merging of DfID with the Foreign Office",
        "additional_details": "It is not in the interests of the British public for DfID to lose it's political independence in delivering humanitarian aid, especially now. For the last 20 years DfID has given the UK a foothold on the world stage and made it safer for millions of people, Britons included. The govt. now intends to paralyse decades of DfID expertise by restructuring, just when we need it to survive COVID19, to use it's aid budget to secure short term trade and security interests. More info at shorturl.at/wITUV",
        "background": "We need a parliamentary debate over why the government believes it is best to do this now, during a global pandemic and Brexit, that goes beyond potential restructuring issues and job losses in Scotland. If parliament does not agree that it is a good idea, it should in the very least be delayed.",
