        "additional_details": "Not only is it morally wrong but it will be costly to implement and likely to end in physical altercation, legally it could end in many lawsuits related to discrimination on basis of status, economically it will eat into companies profits and a study published in the Telegraph shows that among the vaccine hestitant introducing passports would likely reinforce their hesitancy which runs against the governments stated reason of convincing young people to take the vaccine.",
        "background": "The government must backtrack on the idea to introduce mandatory vaccine passports in nightclubs in September, it is morally wrong to bar someone from elements of life because they do not wish to take a vaccine, I strongly urge the Prime Minister to scrap the idea once and for all.",
