        "action": "Ban \"no pet\" clauses from lease agreements",
        "additional_details": "With fewer people being able to afford property due to the poor economy and the difficulty of getting onto the property ladder due to soaring house prices, many people are never going to be able to have a pet while they are renting. As pets can often cause no more noise and damage than small children, it makes no sense to allow these clauses - especially as a pet may be a person's only company if they live alone. Renters pay exorbitant costs and should be allowed to keep at least one pet.",
        "background": "Many rental properties have \"no pet\" clauses that ban tenants from having pets when renting. However, this is unfair and outdated clause which causes many people to have to give up pets or to miss out on the joy of having a pet. Therefore a ban on \"no pet\" clauses should be placed on landlords.",
