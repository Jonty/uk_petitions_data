        "additional_details": "Sickle Cell patients struggle to qualify for benefits as the requirements don't seem to cater to disabilities that the are not immediately visible. Many patients are unable to work. Paying for monthly prescriptions for the sustenance of life, causes an extra financial burden that is stressful and impacts on mental health. Sickle Cell patients were placed on the extremely vulnerable list during the pandemic. This disease is therefore very serious and should be afforded a charge exemption.",
        "background": "We are requesting that the inherited disease Sickle Cell Anaemia, be placed on the prescription charge exemption list as soon as possible. This will contribute to a better quality of life for people who already suffer so greatly.",
