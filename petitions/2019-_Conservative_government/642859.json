        "action": "To amend the 1963 LGA & 1999 GLA Act to remove Outer London from Greater London.",
        "additional_details": "Outer and Inner London are different entities with very different needs. The imposition of ULEZ expansion against the wishes of Outer London residents, the detrimental effect on the financial and mental health of a significant number of residents, even though only negligable improvement in air quality is anticipated, demonstrates that the current GLA is too large and undemocratic and the Mayor too out of touch, in the interests of true local democracy not local dictatorship it must be broken up.",
        "background": "The London Government Act 1963 created the London boroughs, drawing in areas from outside London. The 1999 GLA act brought those boroughs under the authority of the GLA and Mayor. We call upon the Government to amend these and return Outer London to the administration of their respective counties.",
