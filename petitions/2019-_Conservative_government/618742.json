Right now too many schools will not allow pupils to wear shorts.\r\n\r\nThe National Education Union sets out guidelines and precautions that should be put in place in schools in hot weather conditions, ie, wearing appropriate summer clothing like shorts. The Government website also says children should wear \u201cloose, light-coloured clothing\u201d. However some schools will not allow pupils to wear shorts in hot weather conditions. The guidelines and precautions are not being followed, as a parent myself I want nothing but the best for my children and I feel something needs to be done regarding the dress code.",
