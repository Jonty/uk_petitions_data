In times such as the Covid-19 outbreak, schools are closed and teachers can safely isolate themselves but nurses cannot and are infact expected to work more shifts and longer hours. If a school pupil physically or verbally attacks a teacher, the pupil will be removed from school. If a patient or patients relative physically or verbally attacks a nurse, the patient still has the right to treatment.",

As a result NHS nurses should be remunerated at least in line with teachers.",
