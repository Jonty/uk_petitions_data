        "action": "Create a large visa scheme to let Afghans fleeing the Taliban come to Britain",
        "additional_details": "Since the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan, thousands of Afghans have been trying to leave the country in fear of their lives. As the second-largest contributor to the international military force in Afghanistan, Britain should honour its years of pledges to support the Afghan people by providing a safe haven for those who fear reprisals from the Taliban, including journalists, NGO workers, women's rights activists and minority religious groups.",
        "background": "This petition urges the government to create a large settlement programme for Afghans fleeing the Taliban to come to Britain. This would go well beyond the assistance pledged to ex-interpreters and would assist Afghans who fear that their past work or background could prompt Taliban reprisals",
