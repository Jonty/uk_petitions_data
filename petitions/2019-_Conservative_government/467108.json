They can sit exams in october, but this means delaying going to university for another year, and taking another year out, which many are distraught about.",
        "background": "Home-educated children will be left without qualifications this week because only schools can allocate A levels and GCSEs.\r\nthis is most detrimental to those resitting a levels as private candidates as these pupils will have to take another year out to resit, severely affecting their mental health",

These centres have been given guidance on what evidence they can consider, in the absence of exam results, when calculating grades for private candidates.\r\n\r\nYou could start a petition calling for a review of how private candidates' education is assessed and how their university prospects are being affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, if that is something you would like to happen."
