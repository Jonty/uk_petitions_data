        "additional_details": "Dogs can help keep you fit, provide structure to your day, calm you down by offering love and comfort, lower your levels of stress, anxiety and depression and give your life purpose. The mental health benefits of animals are not just limited to dogs either - cats, horses and others can help, too.\r\n  Anyone who gets an ESA should have to prove that they will love and care for their animal properly, and that they will always be kind to them. Where possible, all ESA\u2019s should be rescued animals.",
        "background": "Animals can greatly benefit those with conditions like Autism and mental health issues. In the USA, they have ESA\u2019s that can really help people with mental health issues. We have therapy animals that visit people, so why not ESA\u2019s?",
