        "additional_details": "The Khmer Rouge, led by Pol Pot, wiped out a substantial amount of the Cambodian population and the population is still suffering today. The majority of secondary school students are uneducated about this event, despite the fact that 15-30% of the country\u2019s population died due to either executions, famine, hard labour and other causes as a direct result of the Khmer Rouge's rule. Awareness of this tragedy MUST be spread.",
        "background": "The Cambodian genocide occurred from 1975 to 1979, and in that time period 2 million members of Cambodian minorities were killed. We want this atrocious event in history to be required teaching in schools.",
