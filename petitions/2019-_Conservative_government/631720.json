        "additional_details": "Charges for GP appointments and trips to A+E are targeting those of us who are most vulnerable.  If patients have to pay for a GP appointment they will delay or abandon seeing a doctor for potentially serious, even life-threatening, med conditions. Anybody can end up in A+E for some reason.  The last thing we need is to be asked for a credit card before we get treatment.  The NHS should be free at the point of use. We pay National Insurance for this. Privatisation must be stopped!",
        "background": "Further privatisation of our NHS is not acceptable. Abandon these plans for GP/A+E charges and stop siphoning tax payers' money into the pockets of greedy private health care providers. Give us a fully funded and nationalised health service which serves the needs of the patients, not businesses.",
