        "additional_details": "The Building Safety Act, passed by Parliament, only protects Leaseholders in buildings over 11metres in height. The Government's position is that there is no systemic fire safety issue in blocks below 11m. My building is considered 'at risk'. Without the costly remedial work (or other government guidance) I cannot re-mortgage, banks won't lend & sellers won't buy. I am trapped in my flat that I cannot move on from, in a building with unsafe, high fire-risk defects that I cannot afford to fix.",
        "background": "Leaseholders in buildings below 11m are not protected against extortionate remediation costs for dangerous safety defects as leaseholders in buildings over 11metres are. Ministers insist homes below 11m are safe and work is not necessary, yet there are no restrictions to protect us from such costs.",
