Just because a person can control their asthma, they should not be punished.\r\n\r\nAll asthmatics are given a flu vaccination every year and have yearly check ups at their GP surgery. A person who knows how to take their inhalers/medication & control their asthma still needs to be vaccinated from COVID-19 as a priority.",
