        "action": "Make the divorce process affordable and restore legal aid",
        "additional_details": "The present system of divorce in England and Wales is the most expensive and least predictable in the western world. It encourages dispute between spouses rather than conciliation. Legal representation is unaffordable for most people, yet the present complex, opaque system based on case law is hardly comprehensible even to experienced lawyers. Miscarriages of justice are therefore inevitable. That is immoral and an abuse of human rights. \r\n\r\nDivorce should be moral, transparent and fair.",
        "background": "Set clear criteria for division of assets.\r\nHear only evidence relevant to those criteria.\r\nSettle in a single hearing of up to 2 hours.\r\nMake legal representation compulsory but cap costs at \u00a32500.\r\nReplace adversariality with conciliation.\r\nBan cross-examination of the spouses.\r\nRestore legal aid.",
