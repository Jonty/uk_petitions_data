        "additional_details": "I believe introducing this change could reduce response times for on-call emergency responders responding to station or a scene as green lights would show the importance of the emergency workers journey. It could also allow casualties and emergencies to be tended to in a much quicker manner and could also help if they were the first ones on a scene at a road side and would need to make other drivers aware that there is an ongoing incident and to proceed past the on-call vehicle with caution.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to change legislation regarding lighting for all on-call emergency personnel. All on-call emergency responders should be allowed (with proof they are an on-call emergency worker) to have green warning lights fitted and authorised to use on their personal vehicles. ",
