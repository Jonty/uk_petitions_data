        "additional_details": "I think the Government need to put in place a rule that if a parent has had nothing to do with a child then they are not considered next of kin and cannot inherit any part of the estate.\r\n \r\nAlso there needs to be a rule that if someone has been in a relationship and shares accommodation then they should be classed as next of kin legally and they are eligible to inherit, in the same way as a spouse or civil partner.\r\n",
        "background": "I want the Government to reform the rules of intestacy that apply if someone does not have a will. Parents can inherit if they have had no role in their child's life for many years. The rules also do not recognise partners unless they are married or in civil partnership. We want this to change.",
