And all too often these cases never go to court, therefore a child never gets justice for the abuse they\u2019ve suffered. The perpetrator walks free and the vulnerable child is left feeling let down, losing faith in humanity, police and the legal system.\r\nSometimes reaching a low that in some cases can see them seeking comfort from alcohol and other substances, or worse.",
