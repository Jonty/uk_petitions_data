        "additional_details": "We were not able to utilise the opportunities that the government set out for us in terms of career. Due to economic downfall and lockdown in recent weeks several companies have delayed recruitment. This impacts us, severely as it reduced the limited time and opportunity we had for a job or an internships. We invested a lot in our course and living expenses and we expected a good outcome out of it which was not the case due to COVID-19 and we would like to have it back in the form of PSW visa.",
