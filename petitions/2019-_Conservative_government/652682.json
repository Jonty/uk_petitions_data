        "additional_details": "The salary threshold is already causing serious difficulties for families, to the extent that some are separated for months or years, and some can never live together in the UK. Particularly difficulties face women, pensioners, people with disabilities and some ethnic minorities, whose incomes are lower than average and likely to be less than \u00a338,700 per year.\r\n\r\nWe call on the Government to scrap the proposed increase to the salary threshold, and to move towards removing it completely.",
        "background": "Currently a couple wanting to live together in the UK, where one partner is a UK/Irish citizen and the other is not, have to meet a salary threshold of \u00a318,600 per year. This threshold will reportedly increase to \u00a338,700 per year. We ask the Government not to proceed with this proposed increase.",
