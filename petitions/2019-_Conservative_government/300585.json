I know many people are taking their lives and lashing out in other ways because they\u2019re at war with themselves each day. There is no support given. I feel that this is a major issue that is not addressed. People don\u2019t ask for these disabilities, but because it\u2019s not physical it\u2019s the most unaccepted.",

This needs to be spent on more places to access, and more things to do such as activities and social group days for people to help them understand life and life skills. Also more acceptance in schools.",
