For example, the ingredient \u2018oud\u2019 is particularly expensive and rare with 12ml costing up to \u00a32,000. However, some companies seek to use the reputation of oud to their advantage by naming their product after it despite having less than 0.006% oud present.\r\n\r\nThis practice of naming a fragrance after an ingredient that is barely present is deceptive to the consumer by leading them to believe that they are paying for a product when in reality they aren\u2019t.",
