        "action": "Reduce the working week from 5 to 4 days. Extend the weekend to include Mondays.",
        "additional_details": "The background evidence to support this petition is clear for all to see. Data let\u2019s us know that suicides and attempts to take a persons own life are up in numbers. Mental health has gotten worse for young people and adults alike. My 10 year old son believes that if the weekend were extended to include Mondays, then these issues would decrease in their severity, that stress would lessen, that individual, family and community health would improve and that school and work productivity would rise.",
        "background": "My 10 year old son believes in positive communication, and political process. He believes if he asks our prime minister to change things, then at the least he will be taken seriously and he will be heard. He wants the government to make this change to improve the mental health of the nation.",
