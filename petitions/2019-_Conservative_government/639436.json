        "additional_details": "The swastika is an ancient symbol, but is most associated today with the Nazis and Neo-Nazis groups. Other symbols were and are also used by these groups.\r\n\r\nDisplaying a Nazi symbol in public can cause distress and lead to public disorder, and is deeply disrespectful to the millions of people murdered by the Nazis during the Holocaust and Second World War.\r\n\r\nWe can see the effect of this in the United States, were Neo-Nazi groups can legally use these symbols to intimidate and advertise their hate.\r\n",
        "background": "We call upon the Government to place strict restrictions on the display of the swastika and other symbols associated with the Nazis, such as the lightning bolts symbol of the SS, except when used in legitimate religious contexts, and in movies, games, museums and education.",
