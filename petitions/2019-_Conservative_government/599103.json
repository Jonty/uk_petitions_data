        "additional_details": "The new travel legislation ignores natural immunity and places those who have been previously infected at a counter-logical disadvantage. If current travel legislation remains discriminatory against natural immunity, it can only be seen as a function of a political campaign to incentivise vaccine uptake for reasons which do not primarily reflect the interests of the good health of the public. It insinuates that there is an alternative agenda and a government which is acting in its own interests.",
        "background": "Recognise that the natural immunity gained by previous infection from COVID-19 is at least as effective as the COVID-19 vaccines currently in use in preventing infection and preventing spread. Reflect the scientific evidence supporting this in the new travel legislation as it is domestically.",

For example, it's not clear if you want everyone who has previously had Covid-19 to be treated as though they are fully vaccinated, or only people who have antibodies against Covid-19, or have recovered from Covid-19 in a certain timeframe.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
