        "additional_details": "When our major institutions, many overseas governments and experts, most UK experts and the World Health Authority uniformly denounce and ignore probably the most important UK government strategic plan for more than 70 years the inevitable outcome is a complete loss of trust. This country and it's people cannot afford not to trust the people leading it into such a situation since further policy announcements will inevitably fail to command the requisite amount of authority.",
        "background": "In light of the obvious abject inadequacy of our current leader and his government's plan to keep as many of the public as safe as possible, resulting in a complete loss of public confidence, Parliament should install a cross party government of unity for the foreseeable future.",
