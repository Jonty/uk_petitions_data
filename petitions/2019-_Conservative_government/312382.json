Emergency services can struggle to reach incidents because of blocked lanes. Tired drivers can be forced to continue driving because of no rest areas and people are dying unnecessarily. There is nothing smart about this situation which the government have the power to stop.",
        "background": "Stop all of the smart motorways immediately and then instigate a thorough review of them. Talk to the emergency services, truck companies and victims' \r\nfamilies to gain an insight into real life experiences of using these motorways. Look for other options and solutions.",
