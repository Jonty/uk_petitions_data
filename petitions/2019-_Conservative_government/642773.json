They maim hundreds of pedestrians each year safe in the knowledge that the councils and in particular Sadiq Khan has now interest in tackling this hooligan behaviour.  The decent element of society is at its wits end with this pestilence and the government must act to avoid further unnecessary bloodshed on the pavements.",
