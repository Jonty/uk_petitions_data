I have a small business franchise I pay Insurance year after year and they have stated this: You aren\u2019t covered if you close your store due to Coronavirus. Although COVID-19 is now a notifiable disease, it isn\u2019t covered through your insurance policy because it isn\u2019t listed as one of the notifiable diseases in the policy!?!",
