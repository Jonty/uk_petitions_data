        "additional_details": "Social distancing at weddings can be adhered to, depending on venue size with more than 15 people. \r\nWe want the government to allow weddings at 50% venue capacity, while following social distancing measures as others in the entertainment and sports sector are allowed. \r\nPeople have put their weddings and celebrations on hold long enough. Why is a sporting event priority over these celebrations? \r\nAllow us 50% capacity so we can have our special day while remaining safe and sensible.",
        "background": "The government guidelines allow sporting events and theatres to host their events at 50% capacity along with social distancing measures in place. Yet weddings are still restricted to 15people, this includes the bride and groom. While funerals are restricted to 30 and 15 for a wake.",
