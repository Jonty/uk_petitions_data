        "additional_details": "The timing of the suppression of the Russia report in November 2019 was far too convenient for the present government which won an increased majority in the elections in Dec 2019. Questions were  being asked about why, since it had already been cleared by the Prime Minister, had it not been published before the election. The continuing suppression of the report is doing nothing to raise the confidence of the British people in the integrity of the electoral process.",
        "background": "Lift the restriction on publishing the report on Russia\u2019s spying activities against the UK and its attempts to penetrate the British establishment. This will require the re-establishment of  the Intelligence and Security Committee so that it can be immediately published.",
