Without the money for private egg freezing, an option not viable for many, there are often no options for women with MRKH or DSD. These women are not less deserving of families. The UK Government is responsible for protecting its people\u2019s interests.\r\n",
        "background": "Currently there are is no universal provision for women with Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser (MRKH) Syndrome or Differences in sex development (DSD) to freeze their eggs. Provision is up to individual NHS integrated care boards, and most do not offer egg freezing to people with these conditions.",
