        "additional_details": "The manufacturers of both vaccines, particularly the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, have stated their vaccines were trialled with 3 weeks between the first and second doses, not 12 weeks, as is the Government's current recommended timeline. The manufacturers also stated they do not recommend increasing the time between doses for fear of reduced effectiveness. If vaccine effectiveness falls as a result of the Government extending the gap between doses, it would be an egregious disservice to the public.",
        "background": "The Government must ensure that all Covid vaccinations that are reliant on double doses are delivered according to their manufacturer's specifications. For the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, that means delivering second doses within 3 weeks of first doses.",
