GoHenry research shows that equipping children with financial skills could:\r\n\r\nIncrease job prospects \r\nIncrease personal savings \r\nBoost retirement funds\r\nBoost business formation \r\nReduce unemployment\r\nInject money into the economy\r\n\r\nBy making space for financial education in all schools, the government can help drive levelling up, social mobility, and financial equality. \r\n\r\nThe curriculum doesn\u2019t add up - #makemoneycount",

Financial education is a life skill that, like swimming, is best taught young, and with aids, to ensure that when kids hit adulthood they keep their heads above water.",

For example, we could accept a petition asking for finance to be made a core subject for certain key stages or school years. We could also accept a petition calling for a change to the current finance content, if there's a specific change that you'd like to see. "
