Places at University have been lost, lives are in chaos. Students are made to feel grateful to be awarded their Mock results, which most go on to surpass in final exams. Others have been downgraded beyond previous attainment levels. This cannot be right ! The algorithm is not fit for purpose and grossly distorts representation of student's capabilities. Use Predicted Grades",
        "background": "Treat all students equally. Give them the predicted grades they have earned and been rigorously assessed to achieve by their qualified, professional  teachers. Disregard marking by algorithm - it is unfit for purpose and has been proven to disproportionately advantage those in private education.",
