        "additional_details": "The Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Bill strips Scottish citizens from their right to freedom of speech. This is a manipulation of our own thoughts and words, it simply cannot stand. The Bill will not even prevent hate speech, the government need to find an alternative solution that secures our basic rights, and also helps tackle a pressing issue in today's society. This Bill is not the answer.",
        "background": "Many Scottish citizens and even citizens worldwide have addressed their concerns regarding this Bill, and the implications it has on our freedom of speech. The Bill must be revoked, I speak for myself, my country and the world with this petition.",
