        "additional_details": "The UN has stated that the Russian invasion of Ukraine violates its Charter. Amnesty international has said that Russia's military intervention appears to meet the definition as a crime of aggression under Article 8 bis (1) of the Rome Statute, defined as \"an act of aggression which, by its character, gravity and scale, constitutes a manifest violation of the Charter of the United Nations\".\r\n \r\nBy virtue of being Russian, those fleeing are treated by some as carrying blame for the war. However, they are in fact conscientious objectors to this war and, as such, they should be granted asylum in the UK.",
        "background": "The UK should offer asylum to Russians who are seeking to flee the Russian regime. We, the undersigned call on the UK Government to grant asylum to Russians seeking sanctuary in the UK, because they face persecution or oppose the current regime.",
