        "additional_details": "Too many cats are being abandoned,the shelters are full and are having to turn animals away. Female cats can get pregnant at 4 months old and can die giving birth,they are also more likely to get cancer if they are not spayed.\r\n \r\n Male cats will roam looking for females to mate with so run the risk of getting killed by cars or getting lost,they will fight with other males and can get injured which can lead to infection. Every cat should have a loving home but unfortunately too many cats are being born as a result of people not taking responsibility and getting their cats spayed/neutered. So many cats are suffering and this issue needs addressing as soon as possible.",
