This type of absence is not comparable to other types of repeated or continued absence which may raise genuine safeguarding issues. Parents should have the right to take their children on holiday at anytime without detriment. We are not criminals or harming our children. The education children gain whilst on holiday is equally as important as classroom teachings.",
