        "additional_details": "Kindly review and reform the rules affecting the employment entitlements of international part-time students. There might be a more reasonable solution that would permit them to work a set amount of hours per week while preventing the exploitation of educational institutions for jobs. Not only would such a shift ease financial constraints, it could also help encourage a more accepting and inclusive environment for international students.",
        "background": "We believe International Part-Time Students are being treated unfairly, as they are not permitted to take any employment. Full-Time international students are allowed to work 20 hours per week during term-time, and full- time outside of term-time. We want similar entitlements for part-time students.",
