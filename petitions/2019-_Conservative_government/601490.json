There have been far too many serious incidents.\r\n \r\nI live in Manchester. I have concerns about a major road that connects the M25 to Hastings.(A21)\r\n \r\nYou may ask why I should have concerns?\r\n \r\nThe casualty rate on the A21 is too high and has led to accidents which are surely preventable.",
