        "additional_details": "Policy needs to drive how free-from foods are priced; There is a greater reliance on commercially available GF food now. A study found the high cost and limited availability of GF foods are associated with poorer dietary adherence in people with Coeliac Disease. This, in turn, long term affects health costs. Furthermore, it is unethical to charge premium pricing for free-from food.",
        "background": "2 million people in the UK live with a diagnosed food allergy, and 1 in 100 have coeliac disease (causes gluten-intolerance). However, in the UK if you live with a food allergy, often food in supermarkets is more expensive. Free-from food can be nearly 400% more expensive",
