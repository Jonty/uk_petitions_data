        "action": "Replace the term ethnic minority on all government forms to ethnic heritage.",
        "additional_details": "The government are far outdated. They still use \"ethnic minority\". I am sick of looking at jobs still using this term when other employers use more inclusive terms such as ethnic background. I am sick of hearing news readers refer to me as a minority. \r\n\r\nI have therefore started this petition as I've had enough. On all forms I want there to be a Black British, Asian British, Chinese British category in its own right. If other people agree, please sign the petition. Let's make change happen.",
        "background": "I want the government to change the term of ethnic minority on all their forms to ethnic heritage. \r\n\r\nMinority implies something to be less and just because my heritage line is different does not mean I am less of a person and nor should I be seen that way in today's society.",
