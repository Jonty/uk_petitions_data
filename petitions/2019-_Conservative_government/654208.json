The NHS is on its knees, people can\u2019t afford to heat their homes or feed their families and the train network is crumbling. Meanwhile the PM retains his country home, 40 miles from Downing Street. The value of this house and the cost of running it must run into many millions of pounds. Other venues, perhaps Buckingham Palace, could be used for functions that Chequers is used for.",
