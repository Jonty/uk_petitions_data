        "additional_details": "CV19 has devasted the care sector with deaths causing much lower occupancy. Many care home groups could close due to reduced revenue and increased costs. Having to pay staff SSP to self-isolate from day 1, not day 4, has vastly increased our costs. It is unfair the Government is refunding SSP to most businesses but has excluded employers, including care home groups, with over 250 employees. Providing SSP refunds retrospectively from March should save some care homes from closure.",
        "background": "Include care home groups with 250+ employees in the SSP refund scheme retrospectively from March. SSP costs have increased hugely under the new rules which coupled with large PPE costs and massively reduced occupancy will mean large financial losses and many potential group closures",
