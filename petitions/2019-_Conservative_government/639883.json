        "additional_details": "1. Force all FTSE 100 companies to go fully electric by 2025 (government ev subsidies for lorries etc)\r\n2. Outright ban diesel engines in the inner city\r\n3. Only allow 99 octane fuel to be used for petrol and high grade diesel in order to minimise the impurities burned into the air.\r\n4. Keep increasing the congestion charge for all vehicles which have a high level of pollution.\r\n5. Plant more trees and take advantage of green areas by planting carbon thirsty plants in order to increase carbon sinks!",
        "background": "I want the Government to outright ban diesel cars in our cities, within the inner city. They are disgusting and are making our cities uninhabitable and smelly. It is stopping tourists from having a great time, and it is lowering the iq of the population which will lead to less tax being paid.",
