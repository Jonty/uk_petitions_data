        "additional_details": "With most of the country in Tier 4 and the remainder in tier 3, many services, shops and places are now closed to ensure people are safe. As a primary school teacher in early years with no social distancing possible, I believe ALL adults working with children should have their lives protected by being prioritised amongst other groups to receive the covid vaccine. Teachers want to work but want to be safe and keep their families safe.",
