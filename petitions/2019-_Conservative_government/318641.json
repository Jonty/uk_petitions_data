        "additional_details": "NHS workers are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19 given a high dosage of the virus may be able to overwhelm the immune system of even a healthy person. During removal of current PPE there's a risk disrobing shakes micro droplets of the living virus back into the air, only to be inhaled. However, a Spacesuit can act as a diving suit, with the wearer immersing into liquid disinfectant to kill any virus on the outside of the suit, minutes before stepping out of the liquid and safely disrobing.",
        "background": "Current PPE is designed to be worn once, then thrown away. This is not practical at scale, leading to constant supply shortages. Instead every nurse should be equipped with a PPE Spacesuit. This can be worn, washed and reused hundreds of times. Before disrobing, the whole suit can be disinfected.",
