        "additional_details": "Healthcare workers are our frontline defence against preventing the spread of COVID, yet up to a fifth of healthcare workers still refuse to receive the vaccine. This places people\u2019s lives, and the health and economic recovery of our nation at risk. Other nations (e.g. Australia) have made vaccination against viruses a prerequisite to working in the health sector. Doing this in the UK will help the country begin its path to recovery, and bring us in line with international medical best-practice.",
        "background": "Fast-track a bill (or bills as required) proposing legislative or regulatory amendments, covering all healthcare workers in the UK, which stipulate that to work in the healthcare sector it is mandatory to vaccinate against viruses such as COVID, Influenza etc.",
