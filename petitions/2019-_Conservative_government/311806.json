Pet owner's shouldn't be turned away from rental properties nor penalised through having to pay extra rent for having pets. This needs to stop as can cause further financial hardship, increased homeless pets in shelters etc. There's a deposit there for a reason and more likely than not, rental properties with pets can be looked after better than those without pets.",

Since the deposit scheme came into place, landlords/estate agents are stating they cannot hold a higher deposit for pets so they have to charge rent for pets",
