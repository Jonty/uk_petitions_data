        "additional_details": "There has been a decrease in political participation and engagement. This change has been most notably seen in young people, who may feel uninformed, apathetic or indifferent to politics. \r\n\r\nThis may be a result of little political education during school and simply must be changed. A Politics GCSE could allow more students to access politics at a younger age and would serve well to increase participation and engagement among young people. ",
        "background": "The government should introduce a Politics GCSE by making changes to the current Citizenship GCSE and Politics A-level. The bridge between GCSE and A-level politics is currently too large and can put students off the subject.",
