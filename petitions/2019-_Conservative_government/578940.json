        "additional_details": "Among women aged 18-24, 97% said they had been sexually harassed, while 80% of women of all ages said they had experienced sexual harassment in public spaces.\r\n \r\nMany girls, and their parents, do not feel able to report harassment due to a lack of clarity in the law. There is no specific offence of sexual harassment in UK law, meaning perpetrators can all too often get away with it.",
        "background": "On the 10th March, the Guardian posted the results of a YouGov poll of British women and girls showing that almost all young women in the UK have been sexually harassed.\r\n \r\nOnly by enacting legal change can we end this blight on women\u2019s lives.",
