We believe that our voices, views and experiences are discredited and the crisis continues.\r\n \r\nWe believe rooted social work practice doesn't fit every family. Psychological oversight could ensure critical alignment with central focus in the child's history, current circumstances and through a therapeutic, trauma expert lens. This could specifically benefit families created through adoption, Special Guardian Orders, Kinship care and other families where Adverse Childhood Experiences, are a key element, (including in utero).\r\n",
