They're taught about the glory of Great Britain throughout history, without touching on the atrocities it has committed until students are Further/Higher Education. \r\n\r\nThe aim isn't to vilify Britain, but rather gives pupils a better understanding of where racism originates from and how its attitudes have been passed down through generations to form the racism that occurs today.",
        "background": "Include an unbiased view of history, INCLUDING colonisation of America, the slave trade across the US, the Caribbean, and Africa, to the British curriculum for Year 6 or Year 7 pupils. Students don't have access to this education unless it's attached to a specific subject i.e. History/English.",
