        "additional_details": "As it currently stands, trans people must pay \u00a3140 and seek approval from two medical professionals to identify as their own gender. This is disgraceful! The consultation the govt are ignoring outlined the public support in bettering trans lives via self identification and access to healthcare. This is not a political issue but one of Human Rights.",
        "background": "The Government has recently decided to scrap the overwhelmingly positive response to the Gender Recognition Act Consultation. This is due to the incorrect belief that it was 'skewed' by trans activists. As is democratic, we want them to reverse this decision and carry out the results as promised.",
