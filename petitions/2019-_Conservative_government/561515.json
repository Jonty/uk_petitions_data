        "additional_details": "Many people are now suffering from lack of exercise, which contributes to the mental and emotional strain of lockdown.  It doesn't help to tell these people that they can walk or jog instead, as the physical exercise they take is often a by-product of just having fun. The damage that is being done by keeping golf courses closed affects people from all sicio- economic backgrounds and extends to their families.",
        "background": "During lockdown or higher Covid restrictions, golf courses need to remain open, even if club houses are shut.  Golf can be played in pairs or even alone, if Covid restrictions do not allow more people to mix outside.",
