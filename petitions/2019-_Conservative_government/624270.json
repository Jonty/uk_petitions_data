        "action": "Make anti reflux and comfort baby formula milk available on prescription.",
        "additional_details": "With the rising cost of baby formula and the increase added for anti reflux milk it should be available on prescription. Reflux is a medical condition that is vital for some babies in keeping milk down and thus nutrition. Without it they would become malnutritioned and face extreme pain.",
        "background": "Make anti reflux formula milk available on the prescription or at the least subsidise it so it is the same cost as regular formula. Regular formula can be purchased for as little as \u00a38 whereas anti reflux milk costs around  \u00a316!!",
