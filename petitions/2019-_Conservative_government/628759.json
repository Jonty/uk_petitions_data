        "additional_details": "Teenagers struggle most with mental health issues and is commonly school related. students often feel very overwhelmed with their work and a day off school can do a lot of good whereas another day at school can do a lot of bad. this is a perfect way to track students who are struggling and help them before its too late. some students would also take these days off weather its official or not but this would  help them be tracked, and prevent them from lying which can gather a lot more stress.",
        "background": "i would like the government to allow people in high school and college to take days off school known as a mental health day so they can relax from stress and benefit their mental health. the days will be tracked by the school and if too many are taken, the student will be referred to the counsellor",
