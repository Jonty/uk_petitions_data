        "additional_details": "Government representatives have signed up to this mandate, but their guidance for county councils on setting speed limits makes no mention of it! \r\n\r\nAlthough responsibility for setting local limits rests at local level, the responsibility for setting the lead (having signed up to the Stockholm Agreement) lies with the government.\r\n\r\nThe requirement for 20mph limits unless there is strong evidence that higher speeds are safe is a significant change of emphasis - and should be clearly stated in DfT guidelines.",
        "background": "The government has signed up to 'mandate a maximum road travel speed of 30km/h in areas where vulnerable road users and vehicles mix in a frequent and planned manner, except where strong evidence exists that higher speeds are safe'. \r\n\r\nDfT guidance should state this to signal genuine intention.",
