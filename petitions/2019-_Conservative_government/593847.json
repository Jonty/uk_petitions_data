        "additional_details": "These developments consist of, 3 blocks of flats (10 1-bedroom flats) and the other consists of 5 3-bedroom houses on 2.5 storeys. These are being built on 2 poorly maintained COUNCIL garage sites. Overdeveloping already densely populated areas leads to overcrowding. As shown in scientific surveys and national statistics this leads to potential HIGHER CRIME RATES.  But yet our councils say this will help to combat Crime.  This also adds to already restricted access for emergency services.",
        "background": "Stop the councils from adopting \u201cHigher Density of Residential Development\u201d. This goes against your changes to this approach in 2010. Our council has proposed 2 developments, 1 can fit into a football pitch 13x over the other 26x over, these 2 developments are within 120 to 150m of each other.",
