        "additional_details": "When I buy stamps I pre-pay a service I can use later. This has been true since 1840.  I have invested thousands knowing whatever I bought has the intrinsic value of the service for which I have exchanged payment.\r\n\r\nIt is not ethical - if not legal - for these prepayment tokens to become worthless. Stamps are a promise, almost cash, recognising the value. I challenge Royal Mail's intentions under the universal usage obligations, let alone rules of the UPU of which the UK was a founder in 1874.",
        "background": "I was gob-smacked when Royal Mail announced its proposed demonetising of all unused stamps (aside from its latest bar code inventions).\r\n\r\nThat isn't all about new, improved efficiencies especially as unbar-coded stamps (commemoratives) will continue to be accepted - it is simply profiteering.",
