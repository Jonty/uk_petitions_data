So why not help with school uniform tax/vat to encourage parents to put children back to schools. The cost of a child's school uniform is ridiculous and as families are going through financial crisis due to covid19, redundancy, using food banks etc, they have had to fork out ridiculous ammounts of money for a compulsory uniform they have no choice but to buy. This adds unimaginable pressure financially.",
