        "additional_details": "Pubs, Restaurants, Shops and Gyms are all open. Grassroots cricket can take place but grassroots football can't.\r\n\r\nThe Government wants normality to return -have 'Eat out to help out'.\r\n\r\nA game of football can take place outside but with no fans. That same game can be streamed and shown indoors in a Club House to spectators which defies logic.\r\n\r\nAt a time when The FA are running their Heads Up campaign emphasising the importance of our mental health then they must let grassroots football restart!!",
        "background": "Current rules are killing Non-League football and could cause clubs to fold at a time when communities are desperate for them.\r\n\r\nAt grassroots level, crowds are manageable with all the requirements around hand-washing and social distancing possible and players can play whilst fans can watch safely.",
