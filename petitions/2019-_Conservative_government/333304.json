        "additional_details": "This is a way to reward all keyworkers. One which will benefit public and private sector employees alike in all parts of the country. \r\nThis petition calls on UK govt to shelve a divisive pay award that rewards a handful of groups and harmfully depletes already stretched budgets and replace it with a tax code adjustment that will ensure that meaningful recognition for past and ongoing effort reaches everyone it should.",
        "background": "Create a new tax code specifically for the keyworkers who have kept the UK afloat through the covid crisis, recognising that the fight against pandemic disease is a national multi professional one. Replace the current proposed pay award with this more inclusive and simpler approach.",
