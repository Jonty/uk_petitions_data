        "additional_details": "The national curriculum says that schools should teach students about Christianity and other principal religions, but it is up to schools how to approach this.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of Islamophobia that goes unseen. By teaching students from an early age about Islam, it can help them understand the religion and why people have certain beliefs. It should help children appreciate diversity and recognise that everyone is different and unique.",
        "background": "We want the Government to add 'Islam' to the national curriculum. Islam is an important topic that should be taught in school. We need to educate the younger generation about different religions and culture so they have a wide range of knowledge and understanding for the future.",
