        "action": "Include more foreign literature and in its original language, in bookshops",
        "additional_details": "I decided to look for books written by non French authors as well. In terms of German authors only a couple of novels could be found and only the most popular. Therefore there is a limiting selection of foreign writers.\r\nFurthermore Foreign Literature doesn't have a designated section like that for the British Literary Canon.\r\n\r\nWith Brexit on its cusp, there will be an increase in the demand of Foreign Language Learning. Moreover, it will become harder and more expensive to buy books online.",
        "background": "While looking for books to read for my French University application, it was very hard for me to find any written in French. I felt as if my education was being hindered. I felt limited and enclosed. Therefore I would like it to be more inclusivity in the books offered across bookshops.",
