        "additional_details": "\u2022\tThe Coronavirus Act of 2020 should be repealed immediately, including all laws and mandates related to lockdown enforcement.\r\n\u2022\tThe UK should restore civil liberties and freedoms to its citizens.\r\n\u2022\tThe UK should look to implement a sustainable national strategy like Sweden to combat the virus.\r\n\u2022\tThe UK should continue to protect older people (60 and over), and those who are clinically vulnerable, and allow them to shield themselves should they choose to (i.e. recommended, but not enforced).",
        "background": "The UK has created new legislation (Coronavirus Act 2020) to enforce the lockdown of UK citizens in response to the Covid-19 outbreak in 2020. We believe this legislation and response is infringing on the civil liberties and freedom of UK citizens within our democracy and is highly disproportionate.",
