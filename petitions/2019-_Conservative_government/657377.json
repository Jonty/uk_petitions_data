        "additional_details": "Research shows that shock collars can cause emotional distress in dogs. Animal welfare organisations have advocated for a ban.\r\n \r\nThe ban on shock collars in Wales since 2010 sets a precedent.\r\n \r\nWe believe the use of electric shock collars on dogs is inconsistent with animal welfare laws. Shock collars are banned in many European countries, due to the distress, pain and fear they can cause. Despite the UK Government's intent to ban them in 2018, they remain legal. Research shows the negative impact on dog welfare, and there have been calls from several organisations for a ban. Positive reinforcement methods have been found to be more effective and humane. The focus should be on prioritising dog welfare.\r\n \r\n",
