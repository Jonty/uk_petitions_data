My brother Declan was raped by a paedophile. Before the trial my mum begged CPS, Police & Local Authority to provide support for her children but was told this would  contaminate court evidence. My brother took his own life at 13. His death could have been prevented. \"Declan's Law\" would ensure future CSA victims get the support they deserve",

This is in gov legislation, but the CPS & Police still advise victims to the contrary in order to avoid contamination of evidence. This needs to end.",
