        "action": "Extend the TFL Oyster zone to Woking and Guildford",
        "additional_details": "Traveling from London to Woking or Guildford is tricky as if you touch in with your card then you have to leave the train halfway through to touch out when you remember the Oyster zone ends halfway through. Not only this but buses are far too infrequent in the regions between the Oyster limit and Woking/Guildford. Extending the zone will make public transport easier to use and therefore reduce the number of cars in use helping with climate change and reducing CO2 emissions.",
        "background": "Expand the Oyster zone to Woking and Guildford and all areas between as portions of journeys aren't in the zone and this causes disruption to journeys. Add oyster options to the train stations and use TFL buses throughout the area between where the buses are currently very infrequent and unreliable.",
