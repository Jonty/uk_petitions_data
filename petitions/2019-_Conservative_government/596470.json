National unemployment rates should decrease, and an often overlooked group will have increased prospects in the workplace. If the Government isn't willing to help them, then how can they help themselves?",

These barriers can include homelessness, being on the Autistic spectrum, Mental Health issues and more. These individuals need the most support.",
