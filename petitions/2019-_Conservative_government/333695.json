        "additional_details": "Instead of maybe focusing on calories, the government could be focusing on making nutritional meals more accessible for everyone. Calories don\u2019t mean shit because some \u2018healthy\u2019 foods have more calories than foods that are full of chemicals. I agree that obesity needs to be tackled and people should be aware of what they eat but this is not the way to go about it, instead more education needs to happen around nutrition without making HFSS foods a fear. No one should feel guilty for eating.",
        "background": "There is a new legislation that means that calorie content needs to be shown on menus.. this is unfair and encourages disordered eating. As someone who has struggled with anorexia, I know how damaging this could be.",
