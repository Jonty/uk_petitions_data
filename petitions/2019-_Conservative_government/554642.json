        "additional_details": "A newly proposed route for the Melksham Bypass to go south of the K&A canal would take longer and cost more than the previously tabled options. Other routes already given the \u2018amber light to proceed\u2019 by DfT do not present the same challenges.The new option carries the costs and risks of building over a canal and floodplain. Whereas the existing A350 has already been configured to allow for a dual carriageway. Other options would be less costly and have fewer environmental and social impacts.",
        "background": "There are huge costs/risks associated with building the A350 Bypass south of the K&A canal over a flood plain. It would impact swathes of farmland and beautiful countryside used by local residents. This area is also home to protected species such as otters and bats, and historic buildings.",
