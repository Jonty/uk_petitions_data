        "additional_details": "Many families have children that attend different schools. The risk of the spread in these cases are extremely high. During school hours the children are within bubbles, this is completely irrelevant all the while these children are getting public transport with multiple children from multiple school. This also doesn't stand for anything whilst walking to and from schools they are also mixing with other children in different bubbles and different families. Tier 3 needs to have much more restrictions in order to work.",
        "background": "The spread in schools is getting out of hand, all schools that fall in the areas of tier 3 should be closed to minimise the spread of covid-19. This should be the case until the tier reduces to a tier 2 area. With the exception of single parents or parents that cannot work from home.",
