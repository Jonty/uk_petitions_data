        "additional_details": "Additionally, recycling is a diverse industry and when compared to waste disposal it is much more labour intensive. This means building the recycling industry is also a way to create more jobs. It is said that disposing of 10,000 tons of waste in a landfill creates six jobs, as opposed to recycling the same amount of waste, which creates 36 jobs. Overall, there are many benefits to be derived from recycling and schools and workplaces should be required to contribute to recycling.",
        "background": "Recycling saves energy as it reduces the need for extracting, refining and processing materials all of which create air & water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. Recycling can help tackle climate change, and schools and workplaces should be required to have recycling bins to help with this.",
