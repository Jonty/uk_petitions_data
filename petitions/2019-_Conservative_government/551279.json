        "additional_details": "In England, we feel that the new rule of 6 law unfairly discriminates against large families where there are many children as a family of 6 will be unable to socialise as a unit with anyone from outside their household whilst a single adult can maintain a healthy social life with 5 peers. This new law will cause a negative impact on the nations already vulnerable mental health and well-being as well as impacting on the physical, social and emotional development of babies and young children.",
        "background": "Exclude children under 12 years of age from the Governments rule of six law. \r\nWe call for unity across the UK and for England to follow suit with Scotland and Wales to exclude children from the new restrictions so that large families are not penalised.",
