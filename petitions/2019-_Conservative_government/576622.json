Implementing new fish passes cleaning up the rivers and controlling fishing is just the start. So please help. This issue is not a new issue and more needs doing now.",

Half the quota or even ban salmon and sea trout fishing at sea for 2 years. Bigger fines for poachers. Assess numbers annually.",
