It is disheartening that despite our contributions, we are required to pay additional charges just to access essential healthcare services through the NHS. It is crucial to highlight that individuals with work visas diligently fulfil their tax obligations. Yet they are subjected to policies that demand extra payments for access to the NHS. The Government should not increase these even further.",
