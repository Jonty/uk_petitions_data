        "additional_details": "The line via Ewell East is a popular commuter line which adds a lot of value and appeal to the Cheam and Ewell East area. Reducing the service is detrimental to value of the area and the lifestyle of local commuters into central London. The service had been going on half-hourly basis for many years until Southern Railway suddenly decided to reduce this - we want the previous scheduled reinstated as soon as possible.",
        "background": "There used to be a Southern Railway service from Ewell East to London Victoria every 30 minutes, however, recently the service was reduced to every hour which is causing disruption to the journey of local commuters. We would like the service to be reinstated to every 30 minutes as soon as possible.",
