        "additional_details": "To many accidents are happening on rural roads or near misses. I cant believe that on some of the most dangerous roads people can drive 60mph. How can people think its okay to drive so fast around a bend when they can't see what's coming in the opposite direction. I feel as some people don't use their common sense when driving in such circumstances then they need to be helped to save lives.\r\nConsider the speed maximum of 40 with preffered of 30 through villages.",
        "background": "rural areas there are narrow single track often with passing places. There can be high hedges, blind summits and sharp bends but in nearly all cases the national speed limit of 60 mph applies.lanes are used by walkers, cyclists and horse riders and often there is little refuge from traffic.",
