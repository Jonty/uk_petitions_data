It is discriminatory and unnecessary for the British government to overlook our approved Covishield vaccinations administered by a Commonwealth government and fully documented thereby forcing quarantine on us when we visit the UK.",

British and Bahamian citizens claim the right for our full vaccinations to be recognized alongside those of other Caribbean countries from 4 October 2021.",
