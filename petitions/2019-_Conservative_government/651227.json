        "additional_details": "This is a very important petition as we have seen from reports that it can take over a year to get a practical test even booked in, you may even have to redo your theory if you can't! \r\n \r\nThis could potentially be remedied with more examiners to get the bookings back to normal. The Government could make some money back in Road Tax if there are more drivers on the road, so this proposal could benefit both drivers and the Government. More people working is ultimately better for the economy.\r\n",
