        "additional_details": "Especially in secondary schools, uniform with logos are mandatory but expensive, this causes issues with families that cannot afford these. There shouldn't be consequences if a child is unable to have a piece of uniform without a logo. The consequences with not having correct uniform are quite unfair, as it effects the child's learning. If the school continues to have mandatory logos on uniform, there should be more funding going into helping families to afford it.",
        "background": "Encourage schools to make their uniform policies less strict so it is more affordable.",
