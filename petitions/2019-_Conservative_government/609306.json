This is just not right and has to change.\r\n \r\nRetailers should be charged for the amount of food they waste to encourage them to take action to reduce food waste, either by selling food near its sell by date more cheaply, or donating the food. With increased pressure to household and rising cost of food retailers need to be held to account for the amount the throw away each day. Wasted food increases costs for businesses, and so prices for consumers.\r\n",
