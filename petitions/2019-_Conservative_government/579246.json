Its ownership, carry and use by common citizens is banned under Section 5(1)(b) of the Firearms Act 1968.\r\n\r\nBelieve it or not, in the UK pepper spray / CS Gas is considered a firearm and carries the same legal penalties as carrying a gun does! If you are caught with pepper spray or import it, you will face arrest and a subsequent criminal record. You may even face deportation from the UK.\r\n\r\nWhy should the police be allowed to use it on people but people can't use it for self defence?",
