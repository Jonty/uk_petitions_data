        "action": "Cancel 2022 exams as online learning is a challenge for many",
        "additional_details": "Disadvantaged students will not get the same level of support in their online studies as those, for example, who are privately educated, nor will they have the same resources to work with, whether that's the space they have to work in or the technology they're able to access. Instead of using energy to worry or stress over how the next year and a half will play out for pupils, certainty should be established to re-compose and to re-focus them, so they can be sure of what is going to happen.",
        "background": "In such unprecedented times, pupils want certainty. 2021's exams have been cancelled due to Covid-19 and 2022's should be as well. The quality of online learning varies massively throughout the country, so giving every pupil the same examination is surely wrong. There are many better alternatives.",
