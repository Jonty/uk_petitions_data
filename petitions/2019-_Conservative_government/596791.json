        "additional_details": "There is quantitative data that shows that when a classroom is too hot or too cold it affects the performance of both the teacher and the student and also impacts on memory. Some have concluded this is because the brain is constantly having to instruct the body to regulate its temperature.\r\n\r\nAccording to some research, the optimum temperature range is 20-23 degrees Celsius (68-75f) and this should remain constant without fluctuation.",
        "background": "Many school classrooms have poor ventilation and at time when global temperatures are rising, this is causing excessive heat in classrooms. I am calling for the government to make funding available to retro-fit air conditioning in classrooms that were built without it.",
