        "additional_details": "Families have different circumstances and a loss due to Covid may mean little or huge depending on personal circumstances. Even if the risk is low and even if there are handful of families being impacted, lives could change forever for those impacted.\r\n\r\nUnless Govt takes the responsibility to support the families and their dependents, not only residing in this country but outside too, Govt should give families a choice to homeschool kids during pandemic without loosing place in the school.",
        "background": "Govt should give a choice to parents whether or not they would like to take the risk by sending their children to school and support blended learning for parents opting not to send. The child should retain the place in school and be able to resume once a vaccine is available.",
