        "additional_details": "Almost half of those living in poverty are disabled or live with someone who is. Many carers are unable to work, or only able to work part time due to caring responsibilities. Carer's Allowance is treated as taxable income, and is also deducted from any other benefits you may receive.\r\n\r\nLess than 20% of disabled people are born with a disability, and anyone could end up with a disability, or caring for someone with a disability.",

National Minimum Wage for 18 year olds is currently \u00a36.83 p/h. \r\n\r\nWe want Carer's Allowance to be increased to \u00a3239.05 a week, to reflect the work carers do. ",
