        "additional_details": "The current 5 year term between elections is too long for electorate to have their say on who governs their country. Being a democratic country, I believe that we should be able vote more regularly and more often. So I propose to have General Elections every 4 years. This is commonplace within other countries such as USA, Germany and Netherlands. Countries such as Australia and New Zealand have elections every 3 years. This is why change is needed.",
        "background": "Reduce the maximum 5 year term before a UK general election to a 4 year term. This would mean the next election will be on Thursday 4th May 2023. With future elections being 4 years after the previous one unless an Early Parliamentary General Election is called.",
