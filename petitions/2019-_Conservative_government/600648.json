        "additional_details": "Fireworks cause severe distress and anxiety to many people and animals, sometimes resulting in death. They can also cause damage, sometimes wilful, to property and can be very dangerous in the wrong hands. Those who enjoy them would still be able to attend organised displays. Banning the sale of fireworks to the general public would considerably decrease the stress and anxiety caused to many people and animals and in some cases prevent fatalities.",
