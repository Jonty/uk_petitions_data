        "additional_details": "The NHS is the single greatest achievement in the UK in modern times. We should all recognise and celebrate this. During the Covid crisis NHS staff have taken risks daily to save others. We should celebrate this too, by making the NHS birthday a public holiday. Many leading countries already have more public holidays than the UK, so this move would also redress the balance.",
        "background": "The NHS was launched on 5th July 1948. In honour of the lives saved by NHS staff and the role the NHS plays in British life, 'NHS Day' should become a public holiday, to be held on the nearest suitable day to this momentous anniversary. Starting on Monday 5th July 2021 let us all celebrate NHS Day.",
