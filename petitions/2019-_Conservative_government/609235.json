        "additional_details": "Free LFTs allow people to safely attend events, distinguish between Covid-19 and other viruses, and detect Covid-19 when they are asymptomatic.\r\n\r\nCharging for these will reduce testing, leading to more transmission and higher Covid-19 rates. This puts everyone at risk - and if testing isn\u2019t widespread, providing free LFTs to at-risk groups does not make it less likely they\u2019ll be exposed to Covid-19. This will disproportionately impact lower-income families, with living costs already skyrocketing.",
        "background": "Under current proposals, free Lateral Flow Tests (LFTs) are due to be scrapped in England from 1st April 2022. They will be replaced with paid-for tests.\r\n\r\nThere are currently ~45k new Covid-19 cases reported each day: on-par with previous peaks. Covid-19 is still a threat to the UK population.",
