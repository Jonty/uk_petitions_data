        "additional_details": "This year, I spent a lot of time on my allotment and it definitely helped me deal with the challenges of COVID. Along with keeping myself in fresh fruit and vegetables, I helped supply my daughter's family.\r\n \r\nI belong to a thriving allotment community with people of all ages and backgrounds. There are many families involved and the children really enjoy growing vegetables with their parents.\r\n \r\nIf the government helps local councils to establish and promote the use of allotments, more people will enjoy these benefits.",
        "background": "I think the government should fund local councils to provide more allotment sites and encourage people to grow their own food. With our withdrawal from the EU and the challenges of COVID, it would be a great way for people to save money, eat healthy, pesticide free food, be outdoors and get fitter!",
