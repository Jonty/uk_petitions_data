        "additional_details": "Due to the ongoing pandemic university students have been significantly impacted. The move to remote teaching has affected the quality of teaching for all students in particular those who undertake practical courses. Essential material has been missed for some students and some have not been provided with the usual resources. For some they will not be able to achieve the required grades / experience to assist them in their future career. The option for additional teaching can help resolve this.",
