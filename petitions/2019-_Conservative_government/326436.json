        "additional_details": "In a modern day Britain, we have a fundamental principle of freedom of speech. This principle is at threat with recent events whereby the BBC and YouTube have taken to censorship of popular British Comedies such as Little Britain and The Inbetweeners due to concern they cause offence. At the very centre of comedy is the right to cause offence. We must not allow organisations to begin to censor media. Censorship has no place in modern day Britain and should be stopped by Government.",
        "background": "The Government must take suitable steps to stop organisation such as the BBC and YouTube from\r\ncensoring and removing popular British Comedies from the public. This may be via introducing legislation or by introducing guidelines for organisations to follow when considering removal of media.",
