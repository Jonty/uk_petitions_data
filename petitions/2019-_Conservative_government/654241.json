        "additional_details": "The UK has a shortage of veterinary surgeons and nurses, with consequences for costs and access to care, yet it is difficult for students to go into veterinary if they have a previous university education as they are asked to find approximately \u00a340,000. Allied Health Professional courses are given tuition fee loans even if they have a previous degree, due to the importance of their course. We believe Veterinary Medicine is just as important and should have the same rules.",
        "background": "We want the Government to disregard previous degrees and student loans for students studying veterinary medicine, allowing them to receive loans to cover their tuition fees. This should match the rules used for Allied Health Professional (AHP) courses such as Nursing and Midwifery.",
