        "additional_details": "We cannot allow former PMs (of which there have been 5 in the last 6 years) to claim allowances (up to \u00a3115k) worth exponentially more than most tax payers earn every year, if they have not served their country for even 1 year.\r\n \r\nMost companies have a minimum probation period of 6 months, after which most substantial benefits kick in. The same principles should apply to the Prime Minister. Some former PMs have cost the country billions, with less than 7 weeks in post. This allowance should only be available after one year's service to provide the correct incentive to aim for the most powerful job in the country.",
        "background": "Former prime ministers should only be able to draw on the Public Duty Cost Allowance after having a minimum 1-year service. Currently they are entitled to claim up to \u00a3115k per year, no minimum service required. Some may have cost the country billions & be in post only 6 weeks, it's immoral.",
