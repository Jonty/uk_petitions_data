        "additional_details": "According to pet plan, 630 cats are runover EVERY DAY. This figure alone is shocking, and many drivers are reckless knowing there are no consequence for their actions if they were to run over a cat. If there was a law in place that stated that running over a cat would result in some form of punishment eg a fine, then this figure would not be as high and would also encourage safer driving overall. Appropriate signage regarding this issue is also nowhere to be seen. Cats are not being protected.",
        "background": "Currently in the UK, there is no law stating that if you are to hit/runover a cat, then you must stop at the scene & report it. This means that some cats that may have a chance of survival if reported, do not survive as they are left to suffer and ultimately die in the road. This needs to change.",
