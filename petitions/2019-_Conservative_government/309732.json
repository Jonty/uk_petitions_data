        "action": "Urge student accommodation landlords to waive rent payments from March 2020.",
        "additional_details": "Student accommodation, especially PBSA, is expensive to rent for students. Most have moved home during the coronavirus crisis. This means that most will be bound by Assured Shorthold tenancy agreements. Since students are no longer able to stay in their accommodation for reasons outside of their control, final rent payments from March 2020 onwards should be scrapped unless students decide to stay in the accommodation. The remainder of the student loan can then be spent on essential living costs.",
        "background": "It would be reasonable to urge the student accommodation landlords to waive the final rent payments during these troubling times. Many students no longer have their part time jobs to fund their living costs, and have to rely on their limited maintenance loan.",
