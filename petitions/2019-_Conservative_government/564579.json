        "additional_details": "Non-medical people such as beauticians can inject prescription only neuro-toxins and dermal fillers to the public.\r\n \r\nThese procedures can result in complications including vascular occlusion, tissue necrosis and blindness; resulting in permanent injury/disfigurement.\r\n \r\nComplications can require advanced clinical skills and prescription medication to be resolved. Lay practitioners without these skills often turn to A&E, putting pressure on the NHS and with no recourse.",

This would ensure such procedures are only conducted in regulated settings as Medical Professionals are bound by clinical and ethical standards set by regulatory bodies.",
