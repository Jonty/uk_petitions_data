        "additional_details": "Worship is not a luxury or an inessential practice for many people from a wide range of different faiths. Without the opportunity to worship people feel bereft and that a huge hole is left in their lives. Covid-19 safety procedures have operated successfully in 1000s of places of worship in the last few months; HMG has provided no evidence to show that places of worship are unsafe. Mental health, personal resilience and personal values will be helped considerably by permitting public worship.",
