Landlords should be required to include this information in all listings.\r\n\r\nLooking for rented properties in the UK is incredibly time consuming, and can cause additional stress impacting on people\u2019s work lives. The task of finding the right property is made significantly more difficult when key pieces of information, such as the floorplan, are missing.\r\n \r\nWithout the floorplan, renters are often required to visit the property just to get an understanding of its size. This wastes both the renter and landlords time, and should not be acceptable.",
