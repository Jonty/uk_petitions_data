It could detract from important cycling and walking routes. Public concerns exist with more than 2,800 objections, including from local councils. We believe E.Yorkshire has sufficient prisons with over 1,500 Cat C places but N.Yorkshire have none. For extra details see: https://stamfordbridgebypass.wordpress.com/blog/",
        "background": "A review is needed to consider issues including; site suitability for a large prison, transport issues, previous agreement concerning the site and environmental issues. We believe environmental and other impacts have not been adequately assessed, and plans have been defended using unreliable claims.",
