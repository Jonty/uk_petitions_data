        "additional_details": "Schools need infrastructural support and framework to ensure no child is left behind. some schools are benefitting from live online classes whilst others are left to documents loaded onto google classroom. this is insufficient and will adversely affect children and their parents for years to come. please help us ask the government to employ a nationwide policy and structure to help teachers deliver the education our kids so desperately need.",
        "background": "With the second lockdown that has resulted in the closure of all schools, we need the government to assist schools in setting up a comprehensive online live schooling curriculum that delivers a real time support network for children. tools like zoom etc are the perfect platform for such delivery.",
