        "additional_details": "I want the Government to take some action as recently I watched as a delivery driver run over my seven month old kitten. The delivery driver looked at me and drove off and I was left to watch my kitten suffer in pain with a shattered pelvis and after a long wait the vets said there was nothing they could do and he had to be put down. It was very traumatic and we are all heartbroken. There is no action i can take as it is not illegal to drive off however I believe this is wrong.",
