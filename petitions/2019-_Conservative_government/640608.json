        "additional_details": "With the rising cost of living more households and businesses are feeling the pinch. Taxation of UK cannabis would bring in new revenue that would help lessen the effects of the UK's current financial situation. Colorado made over $67 Million in tax revenue during its first year of legalisation. In our current financial climate the potential for millions in additional tax cannot be ignored. It was originally banned throughout the UK in accordance with the 1925 opium convention, a law which is almost 100 years old.",
        "background": "We want the Government to legalise and tax cannabis, following similar models in other countries. Tax revenue to be used directly towards struggling public sectors and other areas in need of funding. Full legalisation could also benefit people with specific and unique medical needs.",
