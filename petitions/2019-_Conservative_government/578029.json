        "additional_details": "In this term alone, GLA has approved 20 planning applications against the wishes of local boroughs. In all 20 of them, GLA's final report makes over 100 references to the New London Plan to justify approval, but reverts back to the old version of the plan when deciding whether a tall building is suitable for the respective area so as to bypass the local boroughs' requirements. This undermines the principle of local government and represents an abuse of power from GLA's part.",
        "background": "The New London Plan indicates that GLA can only approve the construction of tall buildings in areas that local boroughs have deemed suitable for such. However, GLA currently combines clauses from the old and the new London Plan so as to bypass this requirement. GLA should respect borough's criteria",
