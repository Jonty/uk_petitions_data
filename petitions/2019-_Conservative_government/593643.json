Pupils are likely to be around their peers more than a teacher so the obvious solution would be teach all pupils to recognise the signs & know what to do it could save a life.\r\n \r\nEducation into recognising the signs & symptoms of anaphylaxis & knowing how to administer an adrenaline auto-injector could help save lives.",
