        "additional_details": "In the Philippines, it is a legal requirement for all graduating students from elementary school to college, to plant 10 trees each. The bill, \"Graduation Legacy For the Environment Act,\" is estimated to plant 525 billion trees over the course of one generation. Our environment is at a tipping point, and we urgently need innovative solutions like this to not only combat the crisis, but also to encourage local communities to care and protect for their own patches of local nature.",
        "background": "It is vitally important to protect our environment, and tree planting is one way of helping to do so. Planting your own tree is very rewarding and has the potential to inspire and encourage local communities to protect and look after their own patches of nature.",
