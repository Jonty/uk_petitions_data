        "additional_details": "Once sanctions are removed, sufficient aid can be sent to Syria, as is being sent to Turkey, at the moment Syria is receiving minimal help and it is due to the sanctions placed from Western countries. The civilians deserve better and they aren\u2019t going to get better with sanctions that beat them down in times like this, with possibly thousands still buried under the rubble.",
        "background": "This doesn\u2019t even need an explanation, Syria has had sanctions since the start of the civil war, and the only people to have suffered are the innocent civilians, who are continuing to suffer as a result of the recent earthquake. It is ridiculous at this point and Syrians deserve better aid and help.",
