        "additional_details": "Society likes to see beauty as frivolous, but many beauty treatments are key for women's mental health (think of the stigma surrounding female body hair). It is unacceptable that the mostly male politicians making COVID-laws can get haircuts whilst women are unable to get waxes, eyebrow treatments etc. \r\nWhy is a leg wax / eyebrow treatment where you can wear a mask/nail treatment behind a screen more dangerous than a haircut? \r\nBeauty salons are struggling and should not have to wait any longer.",
        "background": "Open beauty salons on July 4th. Beauty salons have always followed strict hygiene rules and salons have spent months readying themselves for operating under new COVID-safe rules from July 4th. \r\n\r\nThe government has now suddenly changed its mind. This is unacceptable. Beauty salons are ready to open",
