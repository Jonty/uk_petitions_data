        "action": "Reduce exam stress on students within the education system lowering anxiety",
        "additional_details": "There are multiple studies showing how exam stress often leads to anxiety. Students that are under pressure from education develop anxiety. A major symptom of anxiety can be avoidance which in turn leads to mounting work load and further pressure, decreasing the likelihood of overcoming anxiety. Arnold (2000) explained anxiety inhibits performance and reduces self esteem. Xang et al (2015) demonstrated higher levels of cortisol leads to life long, irreversible physiological changes to the brain.",
        "background": "As a mum with children in both primary and secondary education I can see a very real issue connecting stress from educators passed onto students surrounding testing and exams and a decline with mental health.",
