        "additional_details": "Once you are done with CAMHs, there isn\u2019t much support available for you. There is adult services but not everyone is accepted and the wait list for those that are is ridiculous. Also, statistics speak for themselves. In the UK, the highest suicide rate is among men aged 45-49. Anorexia is the deadliest mental illness, and it doesn\u2019t just go away when you become an adult. Adults are expected to just have everything \u2018together\u2019 but mental illnesses don\u2019t just become non-existent when you reach 18.",
        "background": "The NHS is severely underfunded, with the mental health sector being impacted massively due to this. Adult mental health services are few and far between, and more support is needed for adults suffering with mental illnesses.",
