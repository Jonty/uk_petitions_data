It influences our immune system, and is thought to help inflammatory pathways run properly.\r\n\r\nDeficiency has been linked to obesity, high blood pressure, psoriasis, osteoporosis, chronic fatigue, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes.\r\n\r\nAction could save lives and help protect the NHS.",

Vitamin D therapies should be freely provided to bring people to optimum levels. Supplements should then be available for free/subsidized to maintain optimum levels.",
