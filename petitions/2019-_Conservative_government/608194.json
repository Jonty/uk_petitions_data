        "action": "Replace the Energy Bills Rebate with a fairer alternative",
        "additional_details": "What is proposed, is to solve the cost of living crisis by increasing every household\u2019s energy bills for 5 years. \r\nThe \u00a3200 suggested will go unnoticed by most, and many providers will allow more than this in debit, so there is no need for government intervention. In the longer term this will adversely affect the worst off with very little upfront benefit. This is essentially, a forced debt on every household, which is baffling and will only exacerbate the cost of living problem in future.",
        "background": "I urge the government to scrap the Energy Bills Rebate to be replaced with an optional arrangement or something else entirely. This is a policy which appears will have the complete opposite effect of what is intended and I believe it needs to be more thoroughly considered or withdrawn completely.",
