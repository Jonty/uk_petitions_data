        "additional_details": "We seem to love to complain about our Police forces being financially stretched and not enough emergency services being present. With this being said why are we not looking for a solution such as allowing them to deal with more pressing matters other than small amounts of cannabis on the streets. Legalisation would allow more police to be actively effective and would take profit from criminal organisations and gang-related activity. If the Government could see there are more pros than cons.",
        "background": "I want the Government to re-evaluate these archaic laws from as far back as 1928 which was an addition to the 1920 Dangerous Drugs Act. Cannabis is not a dangerous drug and has been proven by vast scientific experiments. Our Atlantic cousins have seemed to realise Cannabis is not harmful.",
