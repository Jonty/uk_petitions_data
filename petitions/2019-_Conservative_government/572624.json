        "additional_details": "It is democratic - It is people's democratic right to choose their leaders and they cannot do this in an informed way if their access to information is restricted. \r\nIt is non-biased - Smaller political parties do not have the same budgets as larger parties to pay for literature to be delivered by a third party as the Government has suggested. \r\nIt is safe - If masks and sanitiser are used, it should not increase the risk of Covid transmission.\r\nIt is reasonable - Royal Mail are still delivering. \r\nIt is consistent - Volunteering and daily exercise are allowed. \r\nIt helps tackle isolation - Some people cannot access relevant help, support, advice and services on the internet.",
