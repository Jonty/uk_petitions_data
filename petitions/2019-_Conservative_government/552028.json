        "additional_details": "Appealing to each separate business would be time-consuming, impracticable and most likely inconsequential, as we're asking them to turn away business. This business is not worth having if it endangers someone else's life. Those that are opposed to face coverings are free to not wear them when they are not endangering others lives. There are many home delivery options available fo those that do not wish to shop in person wearing a mask, there really is now excuse for it.",
        "background": "By law, you must wear a face covering when shopping. Despite this, many businesses do not enforce this rule and therefore no consequence. By forcing businesses to refuse service, we can ensure all individuals are abiding by this law and not endangering those around them.",
