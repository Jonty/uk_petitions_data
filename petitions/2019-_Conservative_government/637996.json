        "additional_details": "Right now 91% of the plastic we use isn't recycled, and every minute another truckloads-worth is dumped into the ocean, suffocating sea life and spreading pollutants across shores. Humans are not immune to this problem, every day we consume them in the form of microplastics and governments spend millions to clean pollution caused by plastic. These fungi could help break down a significant proportion of plastic waste that is currently being dumped in the ocean.",
        "background": "Scientists have found that certain fungi are able to break down some hard to recycle plastic waste. We want the Government to provide funding to pursue groundbreaking research in this area, and supporting the rollout of this method at scale.",
