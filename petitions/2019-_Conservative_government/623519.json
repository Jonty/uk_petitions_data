This country has many overseas qualified dentists with a Clinical postgraduate from a UK university however they cannot work as dentists without the registration exam which is difficult to get a seat.\r\nI want the Government to look into this and exempt overqualified overseas dentists in UK from giving the ORE/LDS because they have been trained under UK professors and taught UK dental guidelines; so why do we still have to give exam",
        "background": "The Government should look into exempting overseas qualified dentists with a clinical postgraduate from a UK University from giving the dental registration exam e.g ORE/LDS. Some work as therapists and teach in universities but can\u2019t practice dentistry.",
