We know Asbestos is dangerous and can cause serious life threatening health problems later in life and yet it is present in most buildings. People are dying and the sad thing is, we know about it and aren\u2019t doing what is necessary to stop this from happening. Asbestos needs to be removed in order for the building to be safe for use, not just highlighted. Everyone is at risk!! Save your country and do what is right.",

Every year, approximately 5000 people die from asbestos related diseases, the majority of these people work in the trade and infrastructure sectors. There is not enough help for individuals to assess if asbestos is present in a building.",
