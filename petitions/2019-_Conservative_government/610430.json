        "additional_details": "Liz Truss has been vocal for her support in Britons joining the conflict in the Ukraine, despite the FCDO advising against all travel to Ukraine and NATOs strong stance in not joining the conflict. This has lead to not only causing further unnecessary tension, but concern within the UK. We need to help de-escalate, not add fuel to the fire.\r\nThis conflict is the largest conventional military attack seen since WWII yet Liz Truss does not seem outwardly concerned about the safety of her own country",
