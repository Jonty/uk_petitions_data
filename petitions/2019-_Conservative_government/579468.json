        "action": "Make self defence training mandatory for girls in school/ education",
        "additional_details": "I want the government to do it because it should be open for every girl in the country for free. Women should not have to be scared after hearing devastating news the minute the wake up. They should not have to worry about paying large sums just so they can protect themselves when really and truly they are not the problem. A lot of attacks could have been prevented if women were taught how to properly protect themselves and if this was openly spoken about. This should be for ALL women.",
        "background": "I would like the government to fund and provide self defence training to girls/ women in education for free because women need to be able to protect themselves and have the confidence to be able to walk home alone or even to school without having to worry about being attacked.",
