        "additional_details": "The reason I want the Government to restore funding to these Project's is simple.\r\n\r\nBetween 2002 - 2007 when I was in Seniors School I was Bullied pretty consistently for being Gay.\r\n\r\nWith the repeal of \"Section 28\" at the time I could very fortunately go to my Teachers for help with this type of Bullying.\r\n\r\nThe Government must continue to Fund these Project's that help fight this Type of Bullying in schools...\r\n\r\nThey could save a Student's Life in the Process.",
        "background": "As recently reported by the BBC, the Government has pulled funding in 2,250 Schools in England that directly go towards LGBT-Projects that tackle Bullying aimed at LGBT School Children such as:\r\n\r\nHomophobia.\r\nBiphobia.\r\nTransphobia.",
