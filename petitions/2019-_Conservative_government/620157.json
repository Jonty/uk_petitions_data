        "additional_details": "There is bluey, green algae in the  lake that is fatal for dogs and very dangerous for humans. It would also increase popularity as more people would feel safe to swim in the lake. I have seen dogs run into the lake and if anything happens to the dogs then the owners may try to get something out of it. It may make the news. Then people will be scared of taking their dogs and the lido will loose popularity.",
