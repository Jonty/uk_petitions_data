        "additional_details": "The government have not been able to offer a pay increase that keeps up with the cost of living. We are seeing NHS staff using food banks and not being able to afford to travel to work. This change will put more money in the pockets of those who keep the NHS alive\r\nEvery year we see our talented staff leave the NHS to work in the private sector, leave to work abroad or change professions all together. \r\nThe introduction of lower tax bands for NHS staff will surely make working in the NHS more attractive.",
        "background": "We want the income tax rate for those employed by the NHS to be reduced to 10% for those on basic rate tax, 30% for those on the higher rate and 35% for those on the additional rate so all those keeping the NHS running see more of what they earn in their take home pay.",
