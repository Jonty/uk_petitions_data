You can find out more about these arrangements here:\r\n\r\n15 hours free childcare for 3 and 4-year-olds: https://www.gov.uk/help-with-childcare-costs/free-childcare-and-education-for-2-to-4-year-olds\r\n\r\n30 hours free childcare: https://www.gov.uk/30-hours-free-childcare\r\n\r\nYou can also get up to \u00a3500 every 3 months (up to \u00a32,000 a year) for each of your children to help with the costs of childcare: https://www.gov.uk/tax-free-childcare\r\n\r\nWe can accept petitions calling for changes to any of the above schemes, or for a new scheme, but it would need to be clear what changes or new support you want the Government to offer.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petition, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nIncrease free childcare for working parents with children under school age: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/618895"
