For example Students who want to get into Oxford or Cambridge can really stretch themselves in higher tier papers whereas those who find the subject difficult can enter intermediate or foundation depending on there ability.",
        "background": "GCSE maths is a very hard subject and yes it\u2019s not supposed to be easy but it could be made slightly less difficult. Many students in my school agree that higher tier maths is hard but foundation tier is not challenging enough therefore the government should agree to bring back intermediate maths.",
