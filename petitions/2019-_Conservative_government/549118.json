        "additional_details": "We believe this is a reasonable consideration for relatives of victims, especially in cases where victim impact statements are read out at sentence hearings, otherwise what is the point? There is a public expectation that defendants should \u2018face the music\u2019. Closure for relatives, a wholly proportionate measure when balanced against the seriousness of the offence to insist on the defendant\u2019s appearance. Victims should also be able to see the defendant\u2019s face when sentence is passed down.",
        "background": "The courts should be given the discretion in cases of serious crime, such as terrorism charges, to require the defendant\u2019s appearance at sentencing hearings. It\u2019s unfair for victims and relatives and a denial of natural justice for defendants not to be present for sentencing.",
