They recieve a higher wage for bank holidays so why not now they are putting their lives on the line? They could be self isolating/ social distancing but they are working, and very hard too! You say you want to look after your nation and people, I think this is a little start to that!",

Supermarket workers, delivery drivers, milk men, bin men. Probably loads more people who willingly put their lives at risk!",
