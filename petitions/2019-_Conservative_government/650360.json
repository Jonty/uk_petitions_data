        "additional_details": "Trust in politicians and politics is very low. A key reason is the widely held view that commitments, pledges and promises are made far too easily and/or not delivered on. The CIR is a deceptively simple idea. It would be relatively easy to implement, and the benefits would far outweigh the costs. The CIR would result in better politics and better public engagement, along with restored trust. Arguably, it is needed now more than ever.\r\n\r\nThere is an accompanying Background Briefing Paper.",
        "background": "The Register (CIR) would record and track progress (short, medium and longer term) on the significant commitments parties make to the public. Pre-agreed measures of delivery of commitments would be used (i.e. agreed between parties). The CIR would be available via a parliamentary website.",
