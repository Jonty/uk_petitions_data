If you have an issue there may be some recourse but not in the instance where they offer you less than market value for your vehicle.\r\n\r\nIn these cases the Insurance Company coerce you into an unfair settlement by keeping your claim open which cripples your ability to get insured on another vehicle.\r\n\r\nUsed car values are up 30% on previous years and this is not being reflected in total loss valuations",
        "background": "Create a legal framework around fair valuations of total loss vehicles.\r\nMake it illegal for an insurance company to keep a claim open in cases where settlements are not agreed so the driver is unable to get other insurance.\r\nMake it illegal to affect alternative insurance in non-fault claims",
