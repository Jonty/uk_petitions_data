        "action": "Remove the current \u00a32,000 per year limit for tax free childcare.",
        "additional_details": "The incentive for parents to work for very little take home pay after deducting living costs, taxes and nursery fees, whilst also missing out on spending time with their children, has never been so low. I would like the government to consider removing the \u00a32,000 per year limit to support families who are working hard at mid-range salaries for very little reward to themselves or their families. As a family we both worked through Covid with no furlough therefore contributed to taxes throughout.",
        "background": "With huge increases in the cost of living (fuel, energy, food, train fares, NI etc.) including a daily increase in our nursery fees of \u00a38 per day, it may be more cost effective not to be a working parent, which means a knock on effect to the government receiving less Tax & NI from those workers.",
