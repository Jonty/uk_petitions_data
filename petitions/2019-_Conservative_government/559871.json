        "additional_details": "Lack of funding means wards can be understaffed, over capacity and do not provide the service patients need.\r\n \r\nThe number of NHS mental health beds has fallen by 73% from 67,100 in 1987-88 to just 18,400, and many patients have an unacceptable wait for urgent mental health care and can end up having to sleep on sofas while they wait for care and a bed.\r\n \r\nWhen patients do get a bed it can be far from home. Not only is this expensive, it can increase distress, separate families and set back recovery.",
        "background": "Crisis and acute mental health services need funding for thousands more psychiatric beds, recruitment and training of staff. The Government should increase funding for crisis and acute mental health services so that mental health patients can access the support they need.",
