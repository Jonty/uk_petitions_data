        "additional_details": "Lack of funding means wards can be understaffed, over capacity and do not provide the service patients need.\r\n \r\nThe number of NHS mental health beds has fallen by 73% from 67,100 in 1987-88 to just 18,400, and many patients have an unacceptable wait for urgent mental health care and can end up having to sleep on sofas while they wait for care and a bed.\r\n \r\nWhen patients do get a bed it can be far from home. Not only is this expensive, it can increase distress, separate families and set back recovery.",
