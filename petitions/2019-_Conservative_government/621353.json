        "additional_details": "Our government should urge the Vietnamese government to prohibit dog meat consumption legally. Every country has the responsibility to cooperate for the sake of dogs. \r\n\r\nTo accelerate the global legislative process, the World Dog Alliance (WDA)  proposed the International Agreement to Prohibit the Eating of Dogs and Cats in 2019. Over 200 legislators in US, Japan, UK, Norway and Sweden have signed joint letters to their heads of government to show support for this cause.",
        "background": "In Vietnam, dog meat consumption is a barbaric culture which is still common in the country nowadays. The city of H\u1ed9i An has pledged to stop dog meat consumption in 2021, yet the government takes no actions to date.",
