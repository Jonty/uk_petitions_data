        "additional_details": "The Government should support students who are sons of daughters of immigrant NHS staff to attend university by allowing them to pay reduced tuition fees, or by providing a bursary for these students, and extending the right to student finance. This group of students are often very ambitious and want to join higher education, but the international fees are a hurdle for them to have equal education opportunities.",
        "background": "Students may have one or two parents working in the NHS, but may not have indefinite leave to remain or British citizenships themselves. Those families may not be able to afford paying international students university fees, which are significantly higher than those for UK/EU nationals.",
