There is no valid reason why those standards, which led the way in the EU while we were members, should now be abandoned in order to obtain a trade deal. Food hygiene matters to the public, we do not want to be in a position where, through lack of information, we purchase sub standard meats which are either chlorinated due to the lack of original farm hygiene standards or are filled with artificial growth hormones",
        "background": "Currently, food sold in the UK shows it\u2019s country of origin. Before Brexit negotiations are completed, consumers should have the legal right to know where their food comes from; in the case of chicken whether it has been chlorine treated; for beef, whether the animal has been hormone treated",
