        "additional_details": "Using the toilet is a basic human need and whilst staying on a campsite I am not sure where we are expected to relieve ourselves. If a pub can open with toilets in use, what is the logic behind campsites not being able to? I am aware that public toilets also remain open which are sometimes less hygienic than those on campsites that are regularly cleaned. Please can this be reconsidered as it means that some campsite businesses cannot open on April 12th which is another blow to their revenue.",
        "background": "It is fantastic that campsites can open on April 12th and start bringing in revenue for the hospitality sector once again. However, it seems very bizarre that campsites can open from April 12th but without toilet facilities. Please consider allowing these facilities to open from 12th April 2021.",
