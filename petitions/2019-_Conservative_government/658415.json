        "additional_details": "Lifeguards and rescue workers already have a difficult task when searching for a person or child in water. Dark, blue, grey and white swimsuits can act as a camouflage and make locating a person under water even more difficult. Bright swimsuits in reds, oranges, neon and rainbow make swimmers easy to spot and can be the difference between life and death.",
