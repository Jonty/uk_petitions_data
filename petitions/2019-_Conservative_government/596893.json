Very few retailers do same cost as a pair schemes, and only a few do a discounted second pair scheme. Most retailers charge full price for two pairs, so that we can make a single pair to use. Amputees who require only one shoe still have to pay for a full pair for their use. ",

This should ensure that disabled people including amputees are not financially penalised.",
