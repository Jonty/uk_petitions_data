        "additional_details": "We run a community transport scheme. At present our volunteers, who give their time free of charge, are able to ask for 'donations' of 45p per mile to cover the cost of running their vehicles. Due to poor public transport in our rural area we carry out approx 400 trips to hospital and other medical trips per month. With the increase in fuel and other car running costs we are in danger of volunteers being unable to continue providing assistance. We are therefore asking the govt to increase the tax free allowance to 55/60p per mile.",
