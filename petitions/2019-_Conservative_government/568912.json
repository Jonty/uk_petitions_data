        "additional_details": "VAT on essential meds for pets adds to  anguish, stress, & financial hardship, at already stressful times. Added tax burdens can tip the balance, meaning many beloved pets are no longer affordable;- given up for adoption (at best), left to suffer, abandoned, or likely, put down.\r\nSome people cut back on food, heating to help pay for pet meds. Elderly, single isolated pet owners & most vulnerable are hit hardest.\r\nTax, is preying on the vulnerabilty \r\nSurely the antithesis of our society.",
        "background": "Abolish the 20% VAT on medications for pets, with consideration given to the financial situation of most vulnerable, whose pets are often their only companions. Being able to keep, or to loose their pets, due to financial limitations.  The detriment of physical and mental well-being.",
