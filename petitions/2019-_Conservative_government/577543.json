        "additional_details": "Aid to Yemen will be cut in 2021, with the UK government blaming the financial challengers of the pandemic \r\n\r\nThe UK donated \u00a3214 million in aid to Yemen in 2020, including an emergency donation in Dec 2020. The accompanying press release (available here https://tinyurl.com/ccf9fvck) highlighted the ongoing risk of famine in Yemen. Cutting donations when Yemen is vulnerable to famine and struggling to manage covid-19 is inhumane.\r\n\r\nThis BBC article provides more info: https://tinyurl.com/34zyur9y",
        "background": "We want the government to reverse the cut in aid to Yemen. Last year the UK donated \u00a3212 million to support vulnerable Yemeni people, this year the figure will be \"at least\" \u00a387 million. We would like the amount donated in 2021 to be in the same order of magnitude as that donated in 2020.",
