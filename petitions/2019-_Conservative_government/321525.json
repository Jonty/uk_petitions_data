        "action": "The Government should amend the student finance system to an interest-free loan",
        "additional_details": "The government should try to amend the student finance system so it helps Muslims wanting to pursue HE. An interest-free loan would help Muslims who want to go to university and this can be both beneficial to the individual and also to society. Forming a large community of 2.7m, there are only 329,694 Muslim full-time students, despite the youth making up most of the Muslim population in the UK. As a result, if most Muslims are not pursuing HE, this has a negative impact on the economy as well.",
        "background": "In the UK, the student loan system for students wanting to pursue Higher Education (HE) is based on loan + interest. This kind of loan is known as Riba in Islam and is deemed impermissible to take. It becomes conflicting for Muslim students since it clashes with their religious beliefs.",
