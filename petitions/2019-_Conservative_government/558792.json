        "action": "Allow driving lessons and test to continue during the second lockdown.",
        "additional_details": "Due to driving being suspended in the previous lockdown, it has affected many individuals. A significant amount of people booked driving lesson/ test which their money and time have now gone to waste as their tests are getting cancelled. Due to the blockage of previous months, the queue is outrageous. It is simply unfair for those that have put their efforts. \r\nAlso, to add the government are keeping various other things open which allow more social interactions than driving test/lessons.",
        "background": "I want the government to allow driving lessons and test during the second lockdown. Although only for people who have already booked their test. Nevertheless, safely, this can involve in wearing masks, properly cleaning the car before and after and keeping windows open a bit for ventilation.",
