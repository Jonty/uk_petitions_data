They are therefore undeserving of any assistance and should be heavily taxed instead.\r\n\r\nMany public services are in urgent need of additional funds, such as the NHS. Ordinary citizens are set to lose huge amounts of money due to social distancing.\r\n\r\nThe government's regard for public safety is already in question. Spend that money on the people, not on destroying the environment.",
