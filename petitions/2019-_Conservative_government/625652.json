These powers were granted by the Government to allow flexibility to timetables during the pandemic, but are now being abused by train companies looking to impose cuts to services.\r\n\r\nThe Government must acknowledge that these powers are being used beyond their intended purpose and act immediately to stop them being used to cut services.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to end rules allowing Southeastern and other train companies to change train timetables without consulting passengers. The Government must step in to stop cuts on the Bexleyheath, Sidcup and Woolwich lines and ensure future changes are subject to a binding consultation.",
