        "additional_details": "Wearing nose piercings in secondary school doesn't impact learning. It's all about expressing personal style and identity/culture while still focusing on their academics. Nose piercings don't interfere with a student's ability to listen, participate, or understand the material. As long as students are respectful and maintain good hygiene, they should be able to wear their nose piercings and excel in their studies at the same time.",
        "background": "It shouldn\u2019t affect anyone\u2019s learning, it also irritates their noses. I believe this is discriminating the right of personal freedom and individual rights. Teachers shouldn\u2019t have a reason to pick children who have spent their own money for their nose piercings as it is not affecting anyone.",
