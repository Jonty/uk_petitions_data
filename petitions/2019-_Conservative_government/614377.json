        "additional_details": "Care workers have been hailed as heroes during the pandemic, but they are required to stay away from work if a routine tests shows they are positive for Covid. Now that grants have ended, most will only receive SSP. This is cruel, unfair and risks forcing them into poverty. \r\nIf they must continue to test themselves, new infection prevention & control grants are needed so they don't have to chose between protecting the people they care for and being able to meet basic living costs.",
        "background": "Social care workers are still required to take routine Covid tests, and cannot work if they test positive, but grants that funded isolation pay stopped on 31st March. We are calling for those grants to be extended so that staff can receive full pay if they catch Covid19 and are not able to work.",
