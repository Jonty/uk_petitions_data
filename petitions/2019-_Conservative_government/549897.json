        "action": "Reduce 20/21 university tuition fees to fairly match online course costs.",
        "additional_details": "In 19/20 university education has already been negatively affected by two rounds of strikes and Covid-19. The average cost of tuition fees (full-time) are \u00a39250 where-as online courses are around \u00a36192. The majority of courses in 20/21 will have a large element of being online which could affect the quality of education and student's grades. Moreover, not every student will thrive as much under virtual learning and many students are taking out a loan for an education they won't be receiving.",
        "background": "Encourage uni's to reduce tuition fees for studies that are mostly online due to Covid-19, as this isn't the method of education that students have applied for/agreed to pay for. Costs should match the average of an online course. Or Gov should subsidise/write off student loans for this time period.",
