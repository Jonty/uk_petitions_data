        "action": "Allow a referendum on devolving powers to a Yorkshire Regional Parliament",
        "additional_details": "A powerful, properly funded Yorkshire Regional Parliament can help to even up the UK by rebuilding Yorkshire\u2019s transport and infrastructure, empowering education and healthcare, building greener homes and driving economic recovery. A divided Yorkshire with powerless, underfunded mayors cannot. \r\n\r\nThis decision about Yorkshire should be made directly by the people of Yorkshire, not London. Please sign to give Yorkshire its democratic right to choose a prosperous future with powerful devolution.",
        "background": "The people of Yorkshire deserve the choice of a Regional Parliament, rather than having a mayoral system forced upon them. Yorkshire needs powers and funding similar to Scotland and Wales, directly accountable to Yorkshire people, to create a thriving region within a stronger, fairer UK.",
