Having easy access to the records may help them to better understand their loved ones and the war they served in.\r\n \r\nThere are very few WW2 veterans left - being in their 90s and 100s. Publishing the records could answer many questions for certain individuals and might help to reunite lost comrades.\r\n \r\nA final goodwill gesture to those who saved the nation and the planet, so that they may rest in peace.\r\n",

This petition is asking for an exception to the Data Protection Act, and changes to MOD policy, so that all WW2 service records are published. We believe this would be in the public interest.",
