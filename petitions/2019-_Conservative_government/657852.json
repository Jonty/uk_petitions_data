        "additional_details": "We believe eligibility for this support shouldn't be about income. I was turned down for Sure Start Maternity Grant which is for people expecting their first child, but because I'm not on benefits I can't get it. If I lived on my own I wouldn't be able to pay bills and feed me and my son. And because my partner earns we can't get help but all his money goes on bills so we struggle for food. It's about time the Government provided more help to working families and working mums who struggle to get by.",
        "background": "I am a new mum to a 4-month old I have gone from full-time wage to maternity pay. We believe it is wrong that many working mums don't qualify for these because they don't get benefits or their household income is too high.",
