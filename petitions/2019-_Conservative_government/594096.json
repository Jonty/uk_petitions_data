        "additional_details": "Introducing a recycling scheme like this nationwide could help to prevent the more than 4 million plastic bottles, cans and glass bottles a week that litter our streets and marine environments by providing an incentive to recycle. This type of scheme is proven to work extremely well in places like Finland where they have some of the cleanest streets in the world largely as a result of this scheme.",
        "background": "Introduce a Finnish-style recycling money-back scheme whereby a 50 pence deposit is placed on each purchase of plastic bottles, glass bottles and cans and returning the items to bottle banks or any establishment partaking in the scheme will allow you to get your deposit back, incentivising recycling",
