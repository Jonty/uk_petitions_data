        "additional_details": "There are a lot of families who have been separated for extended periods of time due to the pandemic. Many of these families have either a mother or father working abroad in countries currently on the red list, and due to the high cost of Hotel Quarantine, and the limited number of vacation days available to the family member employed abroad, they are often unable to return home to visit their spouses/children. This is having a negative impact on both the parents and children's mental health.",
        "background": "We are asking that UK Citizens/Residents who legitimately work abroad in Red List countries be allowed to complete their 10 day quarantine at home so that they can be reunited with their families. We understand that this would need be closely monitored and anyone breaching the rules would be fined.",
