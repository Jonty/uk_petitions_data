        "additional_details": "We believe this vote of confidence is necessary to avoid a new Prime Minister being appointed in the middle of a parliamentary term, who does not have the support of the House of Commons. This should prevent Prime Ministers who do not represent the interests of the people being able to hold the office of Prime Minister without a democratic mandate. The interests of the people are represented in the House of Commons by the MPs they elected to the House of Commons.",
        "background": "On appointment, there should be a vote of confidence in a new Prime Minister in the House of Commons, and if lost a General Election should be triggered. This will ensure that when Prime Ministers are changed mid-term, their appointment is endorsed by elected representatives.",
