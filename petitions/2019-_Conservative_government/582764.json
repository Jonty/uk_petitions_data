Animals are losing their habitats and very little is being done to combat the carbon which will be absorbed by these trees/ fields which are being dug up. Builders should be made responsible for combating the additional carbon which will be released into the environment. The increase in new houses is also linked to the increase in quarries and mining which also increases carbon emission.",
