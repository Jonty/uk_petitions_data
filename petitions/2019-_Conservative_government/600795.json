        "additional_details": "The current laws on the sale of fireworks is out dated. By bringing in silent fireworks you are benefitting the environment and bringing communities together. With silent fireworks you wouldn't need heavy restrictions as currently used. More enncouragement for local businesses to invest. However, children and adults with ASN/PTSD can be included in attending events. Pet owners will not lose their pets is horrific circumstances. The benefits are evident.",
        "background": "Instead of an all out ban affecting retail business. Support them to sell silent fireworks for 2022. Thousands of animals die each year; pet and wildlife. Impact is felt by children and adults with ASN/PTSD. UK should lead this change.",
