        "additional_details": "Too much time has elapsed with the spring/summer terms missed and now disruption created by regular 2 week isolation away from school in order to manage covid. Relying on home schooling and online teaching is in no way a substitute for regular attendance, being taught in person by a qualified teacher. Also the ability to identify those that may need additional support to achieve their potential is being missed. It is unfair to think exams can be taken when so much of the academic year and curriculum has been missed. There is not enough time to to play catch up.",
