        "additional_details": "We are in the midst of a pandemic, witnessing an extinction of plant and animal species on an unprecedented scale and heading towards a climate catastrophe. Saving lives, protecting and regenerating natural habitats, supporting local economies \u2013 all are a matter of urgency and must be given priority over hugely expensive, long term infrastructure projects that are bound to fail the test of time. Further costs, destruction and CO2 emissions needed to complete HS2 works cannot be justified.",
        "background": "This wildlife belt - a 330 mile long stretch of woodlands, hedgerows, wetlands, orchards and meadows - would be the UK's longest nature reserve and have a massive impact on nature recovery across the UK, serving as a conservation area, a critical link between distant habitats and a living seed bank.",
