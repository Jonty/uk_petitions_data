        "additional_details": "Since the Cov-19 pandemic commenced, there has been a consistent nepotistic bias in awarding government outsourcing contracts, for example supplying PPE, supplying and carrying out diagnostic testing and contact tracing to companies and individuals who are either Tory donors or individuals who are either friends or relatives of the Prime Minister or who have attended the same university. This has resulted in serial incompetence for example logistics failures to supply PPE and Cov-19 tests, poor value for money and has led to failures to meet demands for cov-19 testing, failure in reporting test results within 48 hours and failing to carry out effective contact tracing. A public inquiry into nepotism within government is therefore urgently needed to restore public trust.",
