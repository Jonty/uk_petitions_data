        "action": "Make Zero Hours Contracts Illegal",
        "additional_details": "Zero hours contracts are inherently unstable work and is a model of employment contributory to living in in-work poverty; is a huge stress factor causing anxiety / depression; places extra barriers on obtaining credit; and denies employees basic rights to sick pay. The Covid-19 crisis has left thousands of people without sick pay because their contracts don't allow for it, exposing two major issues: 1. People went to work sick with Covid-19 symptoms, 2. Vast majority now unemployed.",
        "background": "Ban zero hours contracts and declare them illegal by creating legislation to reflect the same laws established in Ireland in March 2019, including workers' rights to compensation in specific circumstances; and workers' rights to guaranteed hours reflective of patterns.",
