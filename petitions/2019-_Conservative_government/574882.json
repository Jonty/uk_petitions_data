        "additional_details": "University students that study health care course and attend clinical placements during the COVID-19 pandemic are being frequently overworked, overwhelmed and exposed to COVID-19 positive patients. Clinical placements commonly require students to work unpaid for 37+ hours each week and tuition fees remain at an average of \u00a39250 for most courses. As students are being used to increase staffing levels in some areas, tuition fees should be reduced to compensate them.",
