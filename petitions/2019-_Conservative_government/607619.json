        "additional_details": "Currently, four disabled bays in Montague Place have been taken out of action to allow for 'social distancing', and even opening four was a fight. Even though social distancing has ended, the remaining bays are closed and a consultation has been had to close the whole of Montague Pl and move the spaces to a dangerous location just around the corner and on a busy road. WAV will no longer be able to unload even with alterations to the suggested bay making the town centre non-accessible to many.",
