        "additional_details": "Zero hour contracts can be incredibly unreliable for people who are struggling to make ends meet, and we believe this is more an issue in this current economic climate. There can be days, weeks and possibly months where people on these contracts are not given any work whatsoever. We think too many businesses hire on this contract and it can hurt people financially. This is why we want it to be enforced on businesses to scrap zero hour contracts.",
