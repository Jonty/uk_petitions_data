As a new self employed I can't claim anything else rather than Universal Credit and that doesn't cover not even one third of my expenses. It's three of us from the same house currently in the same situation, leaving only one person from house being able to work as a key worker and trying to support everyone else. I believe we aren't the only ones across the UK.",
