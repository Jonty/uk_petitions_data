        "additional_details": "As published on the government's own website, a full Council Tax bill is based on at least 2 adults living in a home. As such, a single person discount for adults living alone should only logically be 50%, as one adult is half of two adults as a minimum - no increase is made to Council Tax for additional adults over and above the two adult minimum therefore single adult occupants are being overcharged and unfairly penalised for not having another adult in the household to help pay the bill.",
