        "additional_details": "Year12s have felt isolated and are trepidated; this has been evident through the cries on social media. Me and many others found it difficult to study the enduring content alone; taking into account that many students don\u2019t see the home as a suitable place of study; many being subject to domestic abuse, some have more responsibilities such as caring for a sick or disabled family member and has made it difficult for us to take advantage of the situation without libraries or face to face support.",
        "background": "This pandemic has disadvantaged those who have their A level exams next year, especially for those who may\u2019ve suffered from in-house problems which has greatly affected our motivation and mindset to work. Parliament should make it a choice for A level students to sit their year 1 Or year 2 content",
