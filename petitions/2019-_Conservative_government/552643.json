        "additional_details": "Creating attractive public transport that is well managed and regulated is vital in reducing our CO2 impact and reducing congestion on our roads. The aim of the bus industry needs to be to provide appealing connections for every demographic that everyone can use and afford. We believe the current privatisation of the bus industry makes achieving this aim impossible. Operating companies are having to prioritise the most profitable routes, which can lead to vital links for the poorest and most vulnerable being cut.",
        "background": "Make all public bus services in England public owned, funded by the tax payer, with regulated bus networks within each town that keep a balance between services to suburbs and villages to reduce our CO2 impact, and intercity services to reduce congestion on roads.",
