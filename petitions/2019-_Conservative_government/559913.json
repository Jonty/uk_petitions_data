        "additional_details": "Over 1.5 million Armenian lives were systematically exterminated during this mass murder between 1914 and 1923. It is time to recognise the atrocity for what it is - a genocide. A failure to acknowledge the murder and persecution of the Armenian people over 100 years ago only paves the way for the manifestation of such horrific ideologies.",
        "background": "This petition calls for the UK Government to recognise the Armenian Genocide. The devolved legislators of Scotland, Wales & N. Ireland recognise the genocide. It is long overdue that the central government formally extends this recognition of the horrific events committed by the Ottoman government.",
