Yet, EU citizens were able to vote in the recent local election, but not non-EU citizens. This is inherently discriminatory. Issues in local elections affect non-EU citizens living in England as well. Many pay taxes and contribute to the economy, but receives no representation. Also, non-EU citizens cannot register to vote in any election thus affecting credit scores.",
