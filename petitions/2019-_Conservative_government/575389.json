        "additional_details": "According to the RSPCA, last year around 81,146 cruelty investigations were conducted regarding abuse towards dogs and double that amount regarding abuse towards cats. This abuse can lead to horrific deaths/injuries. If we investigate potential pet owners, we can prevent millions of cases reported each year as pets will be placed into the care of loving owners. If we do not act now, animal shelters will continue to overcrowd, unfortunately leading to many animals being unnecessarily euthanised.",
        "background": "Pets must be properly cared for. We must make sure that potential owners are checked for a history of violence/neglect and have the capability, care, and patience to look after pets. We can do this by having background checks/interviews conducted by independent parties to avoid bias.",
