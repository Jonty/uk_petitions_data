        "additional_details": "The fact that VAR (and particularly the new handball) rule has so radically changed our national game, demonstrates that the decision making process has been flawed. Supporters (including those that regularly attend matches), should have a far greater voice in the decisions being taken in the game that. As empty stadiums have amply demonstrated, football is not the same game without emotion and crowds. We want the government to intervene to ensure that the voice of fans is truly heard.",
        "background": "The government should bring together all interested stakeholders in football, from the games governing bodies, Premier League, TV companies and most importantly of all, supporters groups, to find a solution to the damage VAR is doing to our national game.",
