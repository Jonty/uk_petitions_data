        "additional_details": "We recognise the financial challenges the Chancellor has, however at this time more than ever we need to maintain, and lead in the sphere of international aid. Without the nececessary economic and medical infrastructure, 100 million people are expected to be pushed into extreme poverty because of the pandemic.\r\nIt is long recognised that this aid, or 'Soft Power', brings great political, economic and moral benefits.\r\nWe urge the Government to keep keep the present commitment of aid to 0.7% of GDP.",
        "background": "The Chancellor is considering reducing Overseas Aid in the Government's annual budget, days after the Foreign Secretary praised the scheme to Joe Biden's aides.\r\nAs GDP has fallen this year, aid will fall well below last year's \u00a315.2 billion, while annual Defence spending increases from \u00a341b to \u00a347b",
