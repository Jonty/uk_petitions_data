Many of us have invested thousands of pounds & thousands of hours into making our facilities secure. \r\nLet us show this, let us prove this & reward our efforts by allowing passing grade facilities to remain open & gain financial aid for the proof of financial efforts put in place to ensure we can at least remain viable. Many of us our family run & need help desperately.",
