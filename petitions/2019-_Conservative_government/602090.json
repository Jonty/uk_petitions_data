We believe it is cruel & unnecessary to keep families with young children in a hotel room.\r\n \r\nNo one wants to spread the new variant but no one, especially children, should have to suffer due to hastily implemented travel bans. \r\n \r\nWe live in the UK, our home is there. We shouldn\u2019t be punished for visiting our family for the first time in 2 years.",
        "background": "Hundreds of families are split between the UK and South Africa after already enduring 2 years apart. Families who travelled during the brief time SA was off the red list now are left having to hotel quarantine at an exorbitant cost, and to ask require of families with young children is unacceptable.",
