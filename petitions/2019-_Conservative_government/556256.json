A lot of talented young people in State Schools are not developing their full potential, because the OfSTED Framework does nor require it of them, unlike the ISI  Framework for Inspection. \r\nThe potential impact on democracy and all state educated young people in the country is clear. The North East needs more skilled leaders to end child poverty. ALL young people need opportunities to develop leadership skills and leadership of learning.",
        "background": "In the OfSTED Framework there is no specific reference to leadership and leadership of learning, as opposed to the Independent School Framework for Inspection which expects ALL young people to develop those skills. We want equality of expectation from the OfSTED Framework for ALL young people.",
