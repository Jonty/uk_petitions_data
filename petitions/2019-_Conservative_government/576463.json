        "additional_details": "The glorification and presence of rape, incest and paedophilia on mainstream porn sites in the UK has resulted in sexual crimes becoming normalised and more prevalent in society. This is putting vulnerable people in danger, especially children, and is influencing the kind of sexual relationships young people think are acceptable. People shouldn't and can't be stopped from watching porn, but the porn that can be accessed by anyone, including children, on mainstream porn sites should be regulated.",
        "background": "Mainstream porn sites in the UK host millions of videos that glorify or include rape, incest and paedophilia. We want the government to regulate the porn industry so that mainstream porn sites in the UK are forced to implement a process by which these damaging videos can be flagged up and removed.",
