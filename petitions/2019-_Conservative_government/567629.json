        "additional_details": "All students planned to go home for Christmas and be back for their second semester. Following the new restrictions the majority of us can\u2019t move back. It\u2019s easy for accommodations that are directly connected to the university\u2019s, but students who are in private accommodations need help. Private accommodations are usually cheaper and more affordable to people who get the minimum loan, or students who attend a theatre/drama school who do not get offered accommodation through their university.",
        "background": "We have signed a contract for our university accommodations, but over Christmas we were placed in a national lockdown. There are lots of students who can not move back to their accommodations, due to COVID-19, but are paying rent to live in flats/houses, when we are stuck at our permanent homes.",
