If you can not advertise or use sites like Amazon to sell your items, then you are swimming against the tide. \r\n\r\nParliament need to review this rule and relax regulations on Adult/Sex Toys.",

This means you can\u2019t sell on certain sites, use certain payment methods or advertise on social media platforms. These items are being put in the same category as gambling, drugs & alcohol, escort services.",
