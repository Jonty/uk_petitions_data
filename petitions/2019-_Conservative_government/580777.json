        "action": "Stop the brutal murder of all male chicks",
        "additional_details": "Every year, the egg industry kills about 4-6 billion male chicks simply because they're, in fact, male. Male chicks will never age to get eggs and that they don\u2019t grow fast enough to lift them for meat (virtually all the chicken meat we eat comes from female birds). \r\n\r\n scientists in Germany have discovered an answer that stands to end that practice. a patented test that\u2019s appropriately called \u201cSeleggt,\u201d the sex of a chick will be determined before it ever hatches.",
        "background": "I would like the government to force the egg industry to invest in alternatives dispose of the requirement of male chick culling to avoid the pain and suffering chicks face with current killing methods.\r\nTechnologies like hormone level analysis of egg fluid should be used instead.",
