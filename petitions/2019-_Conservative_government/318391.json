Each family member should be assessed individually in a safe neutral environment to prevent parents who threaten or coerce a child not to tell the truth. Assessments should only end when the mental health professional is satisfied that there is no abuse. The Safeguarding Hub should not be allowed to close a case until the assessments are complete.",
        "background": "Currently, The Multi Agency Safeguarding Hub do not perform psychological well-being assessments for all reported cases of physical & psychological abuse against children. They can simply choose to close the case simply after a phone call without even looking at the evidence.",
