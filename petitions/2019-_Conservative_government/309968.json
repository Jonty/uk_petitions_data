        "additional_details": "Introducing a fine for inappropriate phone calls could deter people from dialling 999 when it is not an emergency. Emergencies are when a person is or people are in immediate danger of injury, a crime is being committed, there is a fire or there is another emergency that needs immediate attention. And yet, people still ring 999 to report things such as Facebook posts or to ask questions about Coronavirus.",
        "background": "I want the government to introduce fines for people who waste the time of 999 responders. Responders would decide which calls were inappropriate, and automated systems could be put in place to enable them to fine callers and direct them elsewhere.",
