        "additional_details": "British Business Bank is not a bank. It cannot directly help UK small businesses that are not able to even apply for a current account at commercial banks. Currently, many high street UK banks are refusing to accept applications for small business accounts (let alone open business current accounts). The British Business Bank is 100% Government owned so only the Government has the power to reform how it operates.",
        "background": "The Government should reform how the British Business Bank operates to that of a fully operational bank that can manage and offer small business current accounts and lend funds so that every UK small business can access the banking system.",
