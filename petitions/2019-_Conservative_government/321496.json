        "additional_details": "Rationale is as follows: \r\nThe gap between the August Bank Holiday and Christmas is very long. \r\nA break in between would prove beneficial in terms of wellbeing and mental health.\r\nAn additional bank holiday would help improve quality of life for UK citizens and their families.\r\nAn additional October bank holiday will have a positive benefit for the travel and tourism industry.\r\nAny loss of economic output may be rectified by a corresponding boost in having a more productive and engaged workforce.",
        "background": "Pass a law bringing into effect an additional bank holiday to be taken in October each year.  Name and timings of day to be decided by Parliament. The most logical day would be the Monday of the schools half term week.",
