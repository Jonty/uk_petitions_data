        "additional_details": "A major british organisation like the BBC is in need of organisational, thought and image leardship. They need someone who will help them cast off the scandalous last few years of Boris-Johnsonite Alt-Right-Toryism, and reestablish themselves as a credible and independent public facing organisation.\r\nA british icon, and senior BBC employee, who has demonstrated so aptly the true purpose of the BBC in recent years and months, would be a strong appointment to this position.",
        "background": "Following the resignation-in-disgrace of Richard Sharp; the BBC needs a new chairman, or at least an interim one whilst a indepth search for a permanent replacement is found. Simultaneously the BBC also needs to restore its credibility, and who better to help on both of those than Gary Lineker, OBE.",
