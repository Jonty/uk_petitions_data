        "additional_details": "Considering the incubation period of COVID-19, the achievable goal of amassing two weeks of supplies, the clearly defined duration of this lockdown, and insufficient effectiveness of current measures, this plan has potential for true \"circuit-breaking\", allowing the UK to recover, and preventing a winter spike. The inconvenience of two weeks of sub-optimal nutrition, education and lack of exercise, and no shops or businesses, are a comparatively small price to pay. Also halt all travel.",
        "background": "Consider enforcing an extreme lockdown for a fortnight, with ample warning to amass two weeks' worth of supplies. Allow no-one but truly critical healthcare workers, skeleton crews for power plants & water works and a reduced police and emergency service outdoors, preferring the previously infected.",
