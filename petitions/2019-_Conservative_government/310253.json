        "additional_details": "During the COVID-19 crisis, many key workers are keeping this country going. Currently, many non-essential workers are earning 80% of their wage without the need to do any work, whilst our key workers are on the front line earning much less. Without these key workers, our country would grind to a halt, and they\u2019re working without any assistance from the government. VAT relief would help these workers to continue the essential work they are doing.",
        "background": "I believe the government should offer VAT relief to all key worker during the pandemic. This should include all necessities including: bills, petrol / diesel and all essential items from supermarkets.",
