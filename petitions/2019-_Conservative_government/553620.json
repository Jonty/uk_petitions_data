        "additional_details": "A school bus scheme could significantly help in reducing CO2 emissions, promote sale of alternative powered vehicles, create employment in automotive sector, promote the idea of public transport amongst children from a young age, reduce commute time for parents, improve the image of public transport, ease traffic congestion at peak hours, ease traffic/parking around schools during pick-up/drop-off times, and help with social distancing due to less parents congregating at school gate at peak times.",
        "background": "Please introduce national funding for an alternative fuel powered school bus scheme offering door pick-up/drop-off. School bus is a popular and often the only form of transport for many million children around the world. Request Govt to introduce a scheme to promote school bus use in the UK.",
