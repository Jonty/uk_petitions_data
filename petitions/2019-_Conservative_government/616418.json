They use a live wild decoy bird to attract/trap others.  Close to the ground it is terrorised by predators and these intelligent birds see its fellow birds brutally killed in front of it. A number end up being found dead through neglect. These traps should be banned  in the United Kingdom and anyone found using them to be prosecuted.",
