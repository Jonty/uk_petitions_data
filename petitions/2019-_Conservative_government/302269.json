Parliament must allow 'the people' the final decision on their favoured alliance with the two main trading Blocs of the EU and the US, and hold a referendum to determine which Bloc to align UK standards with, via referendum, and this referendum must be held before the end of the Transition Period, even if it means extending the transition period.",
