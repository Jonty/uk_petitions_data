If there is a law in place that will hold senior leaders to account when they use recognised tactics to force teachers out of their schools (because they\u2019re deemed too expensive or too influential) then more teachers will stay in the profession and young people\u2019s education will not suffer.",
        "background": "4/5 teachers have recently reported to have been bullied in their workplace. Many are leaving the profession and there is a recruiting crisis. Senior leaders should be held accountable if they use tactics to push out more expensive, experienced staff to make way for NQTs.",
