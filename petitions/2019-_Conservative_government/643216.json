        "additional_details": "Almost half (49%) of a panel of 100 UK fruit and veg farmers fear they will have to give up their farm within the next 12 months, and many raised concerns about the behaviour of supermarkets, with 69% agreeing that tougher regulations are required to redress the imbalance of power between farmers, processors and the supermarkets.\r\n\r\nThe current GSCP contains provisions that are meant to protect suppliers, but allows supply agreements to be varied in certain circumstances. We believe a stronger, clearer code of practice is needed to make sure that all supermarkets stick to fair practices when dealing with farmers.",
        "background": "We want the Government to amend the Grocery Supply Code of Practice (GSCP) to require retailers, without exception, to:\r\n\r\n- Buy what they agreed to buy\r\n- Pay what they agreed to pay\r\n- Pay on time\r\n\r\nWe believe the current GSCP is inadequate and doesn't protect farmers from unfair behaviour.",
