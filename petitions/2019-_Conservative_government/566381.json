We can no longer be left in the dark compared to other industries.\r\n\r\nFunding rapid testing would save hundreds to thousands of events in the UK.\r\n\r\nThere should be clarity of the scale of possible events for this summer.",

Organisers are in a living nightmare of not knowing whether they can commit to their plans or not.",
