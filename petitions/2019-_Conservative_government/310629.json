Debate in Parliament what really matters to us as a country and who we show appreciation too. Two groups that have had to deal with austerity and pain in recent times. Two professions that have been maligned in the press and looked down upon for far too long. Care givers and educators. People entrusted to look after the most vulnerable of us. With the new Chancellor in place I believe this is a real possibility now.",

Nurses in our hour of need, caring for us selflessly with the knowledge they may not survive this. Teachers, whom every parent and carer will have realised, work far harder than given credit for.",
