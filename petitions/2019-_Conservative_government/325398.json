        "additional_details": "Currently the only psychometric testing for recruitment into the Police Force is numerical and verbal reasoning. There needs to be independent and rigorous character testing of anyone who wants to 'serve the community'. The most insidious form of racism is the hidden one, and, the most dangerous form of hidden racism lies within the judiciary system and police force. It is no longer good enough for people to 'talk the talk'. Institutional racism needs to be eradicated once and for all.",
