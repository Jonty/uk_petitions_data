        "additional_details": "Women living with debilitating symptoms say they are suffering with poor mental health as more than 1 in 20 people in England face a year long wait for treatment. More than half a million women face prolonged waits for gynaecology care (Royal College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists reference). Due to such wait times, women end up having to undergo major surgery to treat the condition(s). A pelvic examination could speed up the process of diagnosis, thus being able to put in place early treatment methods rather than severe operations.",
        "background": "A pelvic examination is a simple examination that can be carried out when a woman complains of irregular, painful, heavy periods, or lower abdominal pain; such complaints are linked to chronic womb conditions such as fibroids, endometriosis, adenomyosis and pcos. Such needs to be offered routinely.",
