        "additional_details": "Construction sites with more than 50 workers are very dangerous as the hygiene on construction sites can be very poor. There are construction sites with more than 50 workers that are using same welfare facilities, having lunch breaks together in a crowded canteen, all gathering to daily briefings, site meetings, men taking the same lift/hoist. Being self-employed will not encourage anyone to self-isolate at the first Covid-19 symptoms as they risk to be unable to provide for their families.",
        "background": "All construction sites with more than 50 workers should be shut down in order to avoid quickly spreading Covid-19 and find a solution to help the workers managing paying their bills as most of them are self-employed and they will not be paid while they are off work.",
