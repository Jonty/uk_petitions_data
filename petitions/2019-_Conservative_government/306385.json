        "additional_details": "During the Covid-19 pandemic it seems likely that schools are to remain open through the usual Easter holiday, the half-term break and possibly into summer,therefore all school staff working those times should be paid time-and-a-half wages.\r\nThis should be done as compensation for the extra strain on them and their own families and in recognition of their dedication to our nations children.",
        "background": "Teaching is hard work. Unlike most jobs there is no 'slack time round the water cooler', it takes 100% focus all day, every day. Teachers and their support staff are mentally and physically exhausted by the end of every term. They need their scheduled holidays to recover and plan for the term ahead.",
