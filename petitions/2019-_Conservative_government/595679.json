One petition was asking for redeployment of troops. The other was \u2018help the people of Afghanistan\u2019 (aid related). They are not the same thing. In a democracy we deserve our voices to be heard on important issues. The petition criteria needs to be changed to allow similar, but different, petitions to run. Specifics matter. Review and widen the criteria.",

We want the right to have our voices heard and for there to be more scope in the petitions criteria.",

This is because having multiple petitions open making similar requests can split support and make it less likely any petition on the subject will secure the signatures necessary to receive a response from the Government, or be considered for debate.\r\n\r\nHowever, if someone wants to pursue a petition making a similar but different request they can email us at petitionscommittee@parliament.uk and we can try and help them open their own petition."
