        "additional_details": "This legislation would allow for a greater cross section of society to have the opportunity to train in these key worker roles. It would allow and encourage those who have child care or other caring responsibilities, to have the same opportunity to train as a police officer, fire fighter or paramedic. The present system precludes many citizens from training in these roles. This change in recruitment law would make the system fairer for all.",

This offer would have to be made alongside the full time option.",
