        "additional_details": "In 2005, Part P statutory guidance was introduced for domestic electrical installation work. Nearly 20 years later, and we believe part P appears to have had little effect and that enforcement appears to be minimal.\r\n \r\nWith the introduction of the Electrical Safety Standards in the Private Rented Sector (England) Regulations in 2020, one would have hoped that lessons would have been learnt, but this appears not to be the case. We believe that there are still issues related to enforcement, following standards, documentation, competency checks, and the oversight of work conducted.",
