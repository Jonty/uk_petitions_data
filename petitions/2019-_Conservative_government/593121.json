Protected learning is a matter for course providers and placement provider. You could have a petition about cancelling student debt for nurses, and ensuring all student nurses are paid while on placement if that is something you would like to see happen. An example of such a petition is below:\r\n\r\nPay health care students basic living wage when on placement.\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/305774"
