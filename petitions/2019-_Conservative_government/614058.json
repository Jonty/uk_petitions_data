        "additional_details": "As the government are not issuing schools with free lateral flow tests anymore, schools must therefore have the right to draw up their own covid mitigation policies, that parents \r\nwould acknowledge and abide by. Individual schools are best placed to ensure the safety of their pupils, staff and the school community and the government should work with schools rather than issue guidance that will inevitably see more unnecessary pupil and staff absences, which will cause further disruption.",
        "background": "Throughout the pandemic schools have been subjected to untenable guidelines.The new isolation guidelines( 1st April 2022) allowing pupils to return to school from Covid isolation after just three days (no scientific evidence offered), is one guideline that schools should be able to overrule.",
