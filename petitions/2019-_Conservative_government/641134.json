It can also cause you to become addicted to certain foods, in a similar way to nicotine products.    \r\n \r\nThe rate of obesity in the UK is increasing and UPFs are contributing to this increase. Some people may not be fully aware of the link between UPFs and obesity or that some of the ingredients can contribute towards other illnesses and diseases. We believe requiring health warnings on ultra-processed foods will help people to understand the risks of eating these foods.\r\n",
