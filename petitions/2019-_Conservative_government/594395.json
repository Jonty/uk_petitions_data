        "additional_details": "Polystyrene is not recyclable and the amount of takeaway boxes that get littered around the streets and countryside is disgusting. I own a food business and I pay almost twice the price for my bagasse paper packaging compared to the polystyrene food packaging. If someone litters my packaging (I hope that they wouldn\u2019t) it will disintegrate and be gone within a few weeks after it rains, or it can be recycled. Polystyrene packaging from other businesses will be there forever if littered.",
        "background": "Ban polystyrene packaging for takeaways and consumer goods. Encourage takeaways and businesses to use recyclable or compostable paper packaging. Maybe put an extortionate tax on that kind of packaging to encourage businesses not to use it.",
