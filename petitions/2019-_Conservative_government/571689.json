        "additional_details": "The main rationale for scrapping Clause 17 seems to be \"The NHS is not and never will be for sale\" and therefore any such protection is not needed.\r\n\r\nIf you never intend to sell it, then what harm is there in affording the NHS legal protection against being included in the Trade Bill?\r\n\r\nTo offer no more than the government's word that it will not be sold, does a disservice to all those working in the NHS, and all who use and rely on it, when it can easily be protected with a single vote.",
        "background": "Reconsider the recent vote to remove Clause 17 from the trade bill, that would protect the NHS legally from trade agreements, and would not allow patient details to be sold to outside interests.\r\n\r\nReinstating Clause 17 would give public confidence the the NHS is safe in the hands of government",
