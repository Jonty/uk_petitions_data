My self am only on 12K salary. With the furloughed system I'd get as little as \u00a3800 per month gross. Where as normally we would earn between \u00a31500 and \u00a34000 per month (gross)  and more even. Allow us to have our commission taken into account so that we can get a fair pay or at least a chance to pay our bills each month.",
