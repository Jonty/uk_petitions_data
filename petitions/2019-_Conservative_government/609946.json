        "additional_details": "Currently, Russia seems under the idea that there will be no consequence if it violates international law, we should, hopefully in agreement with NATO partners, seek to enforce these laws that threaten to further destabilise the global situation. Without real military threats, Moscow can feel confident in its ability to continue to violate these laws. We, as a nation with a real voice, should use it to send one clear message. There are lines even Putin cannot cross.",
        "background": "The Government should seek to take direct military intervention in Ukraine in the event that Thermobaric weapons or other WMDs are used in Ukraine, or in the event that a nuclear plant is sabotaged. The use of these weapons is a declaration of war on humanity and should be treated as one.",
