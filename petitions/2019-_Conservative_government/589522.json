Further cuts to the service will not only have a devastating impact on children and families today but will affect all of our futures. It is incomprehensible. Health visitors need to be delivering a service universally in order to identify those in need and offer support to families at the earliest opportunity. Government should give local authorities additional funding to ensure this can happen.",

This will result in a service that can no longer effectively deliver the Healthy Child Programme and present a significant risk to babies, young children and their families.",
