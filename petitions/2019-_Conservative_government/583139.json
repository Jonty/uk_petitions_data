Worryingly, after 6 years they may then be able to find employment working with the vulnerable.\r\n\r\nAs a nurse working with vulnerable people, I would like DBS to disclose the same depth of information as Clare\u2019s Law to employers in healthcare or schools.",

The Disclosure and Barring Service filters some cautions, warnings and arrests from the record after 6 years. As legislation and facilities improve for victims of DV, it's time to ensure the safety of our vulnerable.",
