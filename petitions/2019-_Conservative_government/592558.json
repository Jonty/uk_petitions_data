        "additional_details": "It is so discriminatory that only people vaccinated by the NHS are allowed to come back from their holidays in the amber-listed countries without self-isolation, while the very same British citizens who got their vaccines in Europe still have to isolate. What is the difference between the vaccine administered by the NHS and the one administered in France? We have our vaccination certificate, we have our families in the UK and would like to be treated equally like all Brits.",
