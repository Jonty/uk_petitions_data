        "action": "Make pension income exempt from income tax",
        "additional_details": "With the State pension at roughly \u00a39,500 pa, a person only needs an additional \u00a33,000 pa from a private pension before they start being taxed on the additional income. This is something they have contributed to throughout their working life to allow them a comfortable retirement. I would like to suggest that pension income is exempted from income tax. Alternatively, the personal tax allowance for people in receipt of state pension could be increased.",
        "background": "The Government is, quite rightly, encouraging people to contribute to private pension schemes so they are not relying solely on the State pension when they stop working. However, once a combined pension income reaches the \u00a312,500 personal allowance, they are being taxed on their pension income.",
