        "additional_details": "Due to the XL Bully Ban, many families have no choice but to rehome their beloved dogs, as they cannot afford the fees. As it stands the exemption is \u00a392, insurance is \u00a325 a year and neutering has been quoted as high as \u00a3500. On top of that, they will have to pay for a muzzle which can range between \u00a310 - \u00a325. The costs add up, especially if you have more than one. Owners will have no choice but to put down their healthy dogs, abandon them or as we've seen end the dogs lives themselves.",
        "background": "We would like the government to put in place a voucher system, discounts or funding towards exempting and neutering their XL Bullies for people on low incomes or owners with more than 1 XL Bully.",
