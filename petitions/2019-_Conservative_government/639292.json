This isn't so bad for fixed-term subscriptions but for ongoing ones this can be quite a barrier.\r\n \r\nMaking phone calls can be difficult for disabled, ill or neurodivergent people, and can cause unwanted anxiety at difficult times, including when having financial difficulties.\r\n \r\nWhen cancelling by phone customer service staff often try to convince customers not to leave, which can add to anxiety.\r\n",
