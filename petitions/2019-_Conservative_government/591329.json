        "additional_details": "Since Medical Cannabis Oil being legalised in 2018 there has only been a handful of children prescribed it in the Uk, with hundreds having to go private and self fund.\r\nThis isnt some \"recreational drug\" its a life saving treatment that parents are using to control and reduce their childs seizure activity.\r\nAs someone who has had Epilepsy for 36 years I know the effect of living with the condition,so anything more natural that gives a better quality of life is never a bad thing",
        "background": "We want the government or Parliament to make more Medical Cannabis Oils available , and on the NHS, not just from a specialist doctor or panel so that they can provide a better quality of life and reduce and/or control seizures where many prescription anti epileptic drugs (AEDs) fail",
