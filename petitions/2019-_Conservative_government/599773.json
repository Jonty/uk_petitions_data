        "action": "Abolish income tax Not national insurance contributions",
        "additional_details": "We pay tax through a lot of means which includes VAT and customs declaration. This income tax was abolished in 1816 but it was brought back in 1842. This income tax is harming families and can discourage people from working. I believe if we carry on our economy will collapse due to people not working and less production. So that's why I request Government to abolish income tax but not national contributions.",
        "background": "The Government should abolish income tax but not national insurance contributions. We pay tax through VAT, tariff, fuel duty, national insurance, road tax, car insurance, we pretty much pay tax through everything. On top of that they are also increasing national insurance.",
