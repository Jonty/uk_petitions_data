        "additional_details": "Our NHS is struggling to cope, however down in Cornwall our locals hospitals are being closed and our major hospitals have A&E waiting times of over 7 hours! During out of hours we have very little options to receive medical care and now towns which are around an hour from the major hospitals are having their local MIU's and hospitals closed, yet more and more houses are being built in these towns! We are subject to health inequality compared to the rest of the country and now we've had enough!",
        "background": "Increase our NHS funding in Cornwall and Plymouth to open up more of our local hospitals, MIU's, walk in centres and reduce A&E wait times at our two major hospitals, Treliske and Derriford. Also to consider the journey times from rural towns to their nearest place to receive medical treatment.",
