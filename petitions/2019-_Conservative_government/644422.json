        "additional_details": "I think the way animals are kept in cages or enclosures in zoos within the UK and the rest of the world is inhumane and unnecessary. The natural habitat for animals is in the wild where they have the freedom to roam around and pick up the skills needed to survive on their own. We should focus more on sustaining their habitats.\r\n",
        "background": "I would like the Government to ban zoos. I believe that the captivity of animals is harmful, and that it is better to leave them in the natural habitats in the wild, whilst working harder to find more reasonable ways of maintaining these habitats.",
