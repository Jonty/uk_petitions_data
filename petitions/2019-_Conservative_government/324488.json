        "additional_details": "Fly tipping and casual littering has blighted both urban and rural areas of the UK for many years and the problem has now reached epidemic proportions nationally. It is evident that beaches, and other beauty spots, visited by tourists are being subjected to excessive levels of littering and ecological damage. This should be a matter of shame for the UK when countries, such as Germany, and many others, have tackled it very successfully. It is time that the UK Government took action as well.",
        "background": "Consider methods to address the national problems of casual littering and organised fly-tipping that are creating a significant financial and environmental burden on the UK. Consider increased enforcement, punitive measures, and educational approaches to minimise the problem.",
