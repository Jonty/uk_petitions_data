Commuters depend on trains for daily transportation, and strikes can lead to chaos. We believe a ban would prioritise public welfare, and ensure reliable and consistent service.

We think the Government's intervention is crucial to maintain a stable and efficient public transportation system. #BanTrainStrikes #PublicServicePriority",
