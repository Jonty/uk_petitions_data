        "additional_details": "1 in 125 babies are born with a heart defect or multiple heart defects. Some research suggests only up to 50% of heart defects are picked up antenatally. Babies can sent home and become unwell or die due to a heart defect going undetected. A simple pulse oximetry test soon after birth can help identify any issues. Many heart defects are operable and have positive long term outcomes for babies. We believe babies are needlessly dying because this test is not carried out.",
