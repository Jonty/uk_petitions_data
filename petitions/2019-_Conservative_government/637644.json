        "additional_details": "The CAA have developed regulations to address illegal chartering, but we are concerned that these might unreasonably restrict cost sharing platforms that are being used by 98,000+ passengers and 6,000+ pilots.\r\n \r\nCost sharing platforms contribute to aviation safety by enabling pilots to fly more hours per year and so maintain a higher level of experience. The UK's general aviation community could lose a valuable service they have been using for the past 8 years, which will still be available in the rest of Europe.\r\n",
