If they are able to join the military, join trade unions and get married, why are their voting rights prohibited until the age of 18. Many of the issues that the public are allowed to vote on directly affect the younger generation. By not allowing 16 and 17 year olds to vote, they are unable to have their say on topics that could potentially decide their futures.",
