        "additional_details": "North Africans have a large community in the United Kingdom, and as a diverse country, NA should have the option to specify this as they are neither black, white, Asian nor Arab. Considering the large population of North Africans within the uk, it deserves more than \u201cother\u201d The UN subregion of North Africa consists of 7 countries at the northernmost part of the continent -Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, Western Africa generating one-third of Africa's total GDP.",
        "background": "The UK is an ethnically diverse society, and having census forms to specify races/ethnicities allows recognition, understanding and in turn opportunity. It seems unfair that a large group of people within our community are not recognised as an ethnic group when it cannot fit into any other category",
