        "additional_details": "There is a risk the ban on puppy imports could lead to an increase in puppy farming within the UK itself.  We don\u2019t want to swap one evil for another. Puppy farming is abhorrent wherever it takes place. Puppy farming continue if puppies  can be bred in one location then transported without their mother for sale at another location. Puppies should only be sold from the premises where they were born, this will safeguard animal welfare and help to make the sector more resilient to crime.",
        "background": "Estimated annual puppy sales in the U.K. are 400,000 to 700,000.We welcome the ban puppy imports but failing to plan now means the welfare benefits of the ban will be limited. The government must set out plans for meeting demand for puppies after the ban is implemented.",
