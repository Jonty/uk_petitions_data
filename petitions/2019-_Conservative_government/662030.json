        "additional_details": "Pets are family. Many countries allow pet to travel with passengers in cabin (<8kg) and in hold (>8kg), without being registered as cargo. However, in the UK pet owners need to register them as \u201cmanifest cargo\". This can lead to significant costs, and we believe is unnecessary. We plead for the Government to follow the example from EU countries and simplify the process of pet importation, while still maintaining the highest standards of animal welfare.",
        "background": "Although UK has one of the highest number of pets, rules for air travel for pets are strict. You aren't allowed to travel with 'an accompanied pet', neither in cabin or hold. Pets have to be registered as manifest cargo. We want this requirement to be removed.",
