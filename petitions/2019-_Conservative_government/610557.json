        "additional_details": "Student nurses normally work 37.5 hours a week when on placement. For many, this leaves no time to make any money from work, which can make it unaffordable for many people to undertake a nursing degree. Student nurses complete 2,300 hours of placement and contribute hugely to nursing teams across our national health services. Despite this, we are still regarded as supernumerary.",
        "background": "The Government should require that student nurses be paid while on placement as part of their training. This should be at least the minimum wage for apprentices.",
