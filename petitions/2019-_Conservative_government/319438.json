        "additional_details": "The UK's withdrawal from the EU is incredibly complex due to decades of treaties needing to be discussed. One year was barely enough time to negotiation anything but a basic deal and now given all countries have been focusing on the corona crisis, this mean even less time will be spent on creating a sensible and worthwhile trade deal with our closest neighbours and biggest trade partners. \r\n\r\nIt is in everyone's interest to have a thorough and extensive withdrawal agreement, which needs more time.",
        "background": "Given that all governments have been focusing on COVID-19, talks about the UK's withdrawal from the EU have stalled. With the July deadline fast approaching to extend these talks, we need to act now and enable this country to negotiate the best possible terms in leaving the EU.",
