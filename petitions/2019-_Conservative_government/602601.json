        "action": "Exempt travellers, especially the fully vaccinated, from quarantine hotel fees",
        "additional_details": "UK nationals and residents will abruptly have to pay unforeseen extortionate hotel fees -minimum of \u00a35k for an average family. A lot of citizens/residents have complied including being fully vaccinated. Why comply and still be subject to unrealistic fees in view of tackling Covid? Yet shopping centres are packed. The fees effectively deter travel. However many travellers, who are already in red list countries would not have made plans with the knowledge of this new restriction",
        "background": "If travellers from red list countries need to isolate, let them isolate at home or get rid of the extortionate hotel fees. The average person does not possess such amounts. This is an abrupt restriction that has been imposed on many who have travelled/made plans to travel way before it was announced",
