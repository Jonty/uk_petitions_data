        "additional_details": "Given that most students have by this point missed many months of proper in person teaching, in their GCSE years, and because GCSE exams have already been cancelled, it is only right that iGCSE exams are also cancelled, to provide students with certainty, remove complications for students who take both types of exams, and ensure state school students are not negatively disadvantaged by not being able to sit exams while their privately educated counterparts can.",
        "background": "Force iGCSE exam boards to use teacher assessed grades as opposed to forcing students to sit exams, to provide equality to both state and private school students sitting exams, and to provide much needed certainty to students currently in their second school lockdown",
