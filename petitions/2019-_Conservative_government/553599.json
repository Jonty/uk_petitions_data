However, if they don\u2019t go in they\u2019re marked absent and it takes a toll on their attendance for something that isn\u2019t their fault. People with TS should have the option to do online learning from home where they feel comfortable and still be marked as if they\u2019re in school/college as long as they send their work to their teachers.",
