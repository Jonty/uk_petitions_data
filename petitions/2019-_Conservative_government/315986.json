        "additional_details": "The government should do this as it is a huge humanitarian crisis. The corona virus has put people in complete lock down, but water has been cut off by certain terrorist organisations. On top of this missiles are bombarding the main city everyday. They target hospitals which have infected corona patients quarantined. This could potentially lead to a huge outbreak that Libya simply does not have the resources to stop. Targeting hospitals is a known war crime as per the law. A resolution is needed",
        "background": "The government should get involved and review what is going on in Libya. The situation Is currently critical and millions of peoples lives are in extreme danger. Terrorism at a large scale is being committed and many war crimes are occurring every day. Justice has to be served.",
