Many other upper chambers of legislatures in the world are wholly elected. A wider variety of people could be able to access politics if the upper house of Parliament was wholly elected, dependent upon any potential disqualifications.",
        "background": "I want the Government to hold a referendum on whether to replace the undemocratic House of Lords with an elected Senate. A vast majority of the House of Lords are appointed, predominantly on the recommendation of successive Prime Ministers. The public should be allowed to vote what they believe.",
