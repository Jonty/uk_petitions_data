        "additional_details": "A study by the NHS found that Type 1 diabetics are 3.5 times more likely to die in hospital and a 3rd of all deaths in hospital have been diabetic. Another report found those who are key workers are more likely to contract the virus due to increased exposure to the public. Current shielding arrangements only protect those who are at extremely high risk, and not essential workers. This needs to change.",
        "background": "The Government must take action to protect those, including diabetics, who are at high risk from Covid-19. This should enable them to self-isolate without being penalised, even if they are a key worker, and ensuring that those who choose to remain at home do not lose their jobs.",
