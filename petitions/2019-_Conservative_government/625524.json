        "additional_details": "We want these reforms to be reversed, as promised.\r\n \r\nWe believe IR35 rules are unfair and mean that many people who had previously worked on a self-employed basis are treated as employees. This creates new costs for workers, and is also expensive for businesses to ensure compliance and creates new barriers to people taking on certain work.\r\n \r\nIt is unacceptable that the Government has reversed it's decision to repeal these reforms. We want the repeal upheld.\r\n",
        "background": "The Government had announced that reforms to the off-payroll working rules (also known as IR35) would be repealed from 6 April 2023, but this decision has been reversed by the new Chancellor.",
