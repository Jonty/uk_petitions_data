The World Health Organisation recommend babies are breastfed exclusively for the first six months and can continue to be breastfeed to two and beyond. How can mums be expected to carry on breastfeeding if they aren\u2019t guaranteed a break to allow them to express milk. I believe it should be illegal to refuse a breastfeeding mum a break to express.",

Currently employers must meet certain health and safety regulations to protect mothers who wish to breastfeed or express, however they are not obliged to grant breaks for mums to do so.",
