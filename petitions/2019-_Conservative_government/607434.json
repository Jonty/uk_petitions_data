        "additional_details": "The Government should ensure that budgets for the education of each pupil with SEN who has an EHCP are spent on support for that child.\r\n \r\nWhen children with SEN don't have their special educational needs met they can end up excluded, traumatised, even ill-treated due to behaviours arising from them not coping. This can have consequences across their lives, and affect their whole families.\r\n",

Currently schools have discretion about funding allocations, even though there are obligations to deliver EHCPs. This can mean pupils with EHCP don't receive the support they need.",
