        "additional_details": "Social distancing or delaying exams allows students to continue working towards their grades. As most students are at the same disadvantage with only 49 days left until the first exams, our current situation wouldn't give an advantage to other pupils. Some students may have missed previous assessments or may not have had the time to revise for these exams in order for them to be an accurate portrayal of their grades so it would be unfair to deny students the chance to show their true potential.",
        "background": "As this years examinations have been scrapped and the government is looking for alternative assessment options, if would be unfair to use previous assessments as a measure of students progress when they may have significantly improved their grades as most students prepared for their 'real' exams.",
