(22/23)\r\nIf you delay taking it, it increases by 1% (\u00a31.85) p.w. for every 9 weeks, equal to 5.4% (\u00a310) p.w. increase for a year\u2019s delay. \r\nThe same could be applied in reverse so if the S.P. was taken a year early (66) it would reduce to about \u00a3175p.w. or \u00a3165p.w if taken 2 years early etc.\r\nThere should be proof that a private work pension exists before a reduced S.P. could be authorised. \r\nAny S.P. would still be covered by the Triple Lock but based on your lower sum.",
