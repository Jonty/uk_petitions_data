Research into miscarriage risk, foetal and maternal safety is extremely limited and lacks insight into the long term developmental implications.",
        "background": "Legally mandate home working or paid leave for pregnant workers during the Covid-19 pandemic. Many businesses are following Government guidelines, but the NHS and other frontline organisations are still forcing pregnant women to work in clinical areas, despite a lack of evidence regarding safety.",
