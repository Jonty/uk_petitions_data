        "additional_details": "Seeing the chaos on days like black friday or when we get day or two of snow, a few days of bad weather and even virus problems. the chaos of people literally panic buying and braking into chaos and riots in store is well beyond illogical and delving into the depths of sheer madness. \r\nTo help stop or just lessen this, I feel a law is needed to force stores across the UK to automatically to put into force an item limit per person  in times of crisis to make sure everyone gets a fair share.",
        "background": "I would like to ask Parliament to consider a times of crisis law. During bad weather and now with this coronavirus people are panic buying and even fighting over items in stores. I would therefore like for there to be a law put in place to get shops to make stores put reasonable limits on items.",
