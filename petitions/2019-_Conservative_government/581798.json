        "additional_details": "Those struggling to pay for fuel, often use pre-payment meters which can cost up to \u00a3378 more per year than households using a credit meter. Research shows that those on prepayment meters are more likely to be low-income or vulnerable households. As a result, they are not able to commit to a credit meter or simply cannot get their credit approved. They, therefore, do not have access to the cheaper credit meter tariffs when they are the people that need these the most.",
        "background": "The Government should support fuel poor households that use prepayment meters by making it illegal for energy providers to charge more for prepaid energy, so customers on prepayment tariffs can access fair rates.",
