        "additional_details": "Inhalers are crucial for the day to day function of an asthmatic person. Without inhalers, asthmatic people are at risk of having an asthma attack. An asthma attack is caused by the tightening of the lung muscles. This means less air movement in the lungs. An asthma attack means less oxygen in the blood. If not treated, a person can become unconscious and eventually die. Inhalers loosen lung muscles to prevent asthma symptoms. Inhalers prevent asthma attacks and saves lives.",
        "background": "Currently, people are being charged for inhaler prescriptions. The government should make inhalers and inhaler equipment free.",
