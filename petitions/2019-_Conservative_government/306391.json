        "additional_details": "GCSEs should be cancelled for students in year 9 or year 10 in the academic year 2019-2020 as due to the closure of schools they would be missing a large amount of their content especially those that are doing up to 12 GCSEs where even starting in year 9 is not enough time to complete all content. By cancelling GCSEs for these years they will not have to worry about missing such a large amount of content for their examinations and the stress will be taken off them for not doing well in them.",
        "background": "For all years that have started their GCSE courses in the school year of 2019-2020, GCSEs should be cancelled for them.This would be year 9/10 depending on schools.Their predicted grades should be given as their results as this portrays their level of ability without them having to do the tests.",
