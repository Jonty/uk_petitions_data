So, a child may be told by their parents that they \u201cneed to lose weight\u201d, opening up more possibility for children to develop eating disorders/disordered eating.\r\nSomething being considered is children being weighed when they go back to school in September, reinforcing all of this!\r\nInstead, maybe teach children about nutrition, without telling them they\u2019re X due to their size/weight?\r\nAround 1.25m people in the UK have an eating disorder, and although most develop during adolescence, there are cases in children as young as 6. (beateatingdisorders)\r\nI\u2019ve spoken to many who\u2019re upset by this, many of whom have suffered since being weighed.\r\n\r\nChildren deserve more than to be taught that weight is the most important thing!",

And, since 2010, parents/carers receive mandatory feedback on their children\u2019s results. This is being used as evidence for the need of the UK\u2019s \u201cObesity Strategy\u201d.
