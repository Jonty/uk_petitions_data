        "additional_details": "Using this system is time consuming and unreliable should a system error or internet problems occur, also inconvenient for those who do not have access to a smart phone such as elderly. Also this settled status not recognised and known in all countries, hence already creating issues at border control / airports for settled EU citizens when returning to the UK especially during this current pandemic. Understand the government intention is going digital but the people's best interest may differ.",
        "background": "The government currently only provide digital proof that EU citizens have settled status and right to live in the UK. A simple card format similar to a driving licence should be issued which would eliminate potential issues when applying for jobs, benefits and travelling back to the UK.",
