        "additional_details": "SCBs are the mainstay of busy people and energetic children. They are part of a balanced diet and are eaten as a snack in the middle of a long and tiring day. They should therefore not contain information about calories, as chocolate and calorie-counting do not go together.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of SCBs over 'healthy snacks' is that people appreciate that SCBs should be eaten in moderation. Healthy snacks are more likely to be eaten in larger amounts due to a misconception that they are less fattening.",
        "background": "Remove all information regarding calorific content from small chocolate bars (referred to as SCBs hereinafter) whether sold singly or in multipacks. Examples of SCBs include Freddo, Dairy Milk and Flake. They are distinct from chocolate-based products such as chocolate fingers, Crunchie and Twix.",
