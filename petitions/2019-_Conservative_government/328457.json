        "action": "Immediately end all arms sales to Saudi Arabia by British companies",
        "additional_details": "British weapons have been used in unlawful airstrikes that have killed thousands of Yemeni civilians. Additionally the destruction of essential infrastructure for clean water, healthcare and housing, as well as the blockade of aid by SA means the country is facing famine and a deadly cholera outbreak. It is estimated around 24 million Yemeni citizens are urgently at risk and the UK is complicit. Policy is in clear violation UK's own guidelines on arms sales, and European and international law.",
        "background": "Yemen is facing the worst humanitarian crisis in the world as a result of the Saudi led airstrikes, which the UK has been supporting with sales of arms since 2015. These sales have continued despite the fact that SA breached international humanitarian law and committed war crimes in their attacks.",
