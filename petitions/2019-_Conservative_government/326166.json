        "additional_details": "The Government should work with other countries to put pesticide use on an ecological footing. This should include influence through trade deals, to agree world standards to create a healthier and more sustainable economy. Some pesticides increase the risks of cancers and foetal abnormalities. Crop pollinating is worth up to $600 billion globally and insects are important to our gardens and natural spaces. Our human needs are met by natural resources. We need others to accept this.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to work internationally to seek to reduce and remedy use of harmful pesticides globally. Some pesticides can be bad for our health, the environment and economy - they affect wildlife and cause health issues. The UK and its partners can start to improve practices.",
