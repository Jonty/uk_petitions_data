The rules for bringing animals from \"not listed\" countries are time consuming, costly and cause stress for both us pet owners and our beloved pets. The government must allow us to fly directly into the UK after making us wait 4 months before we can travel. The change in this rule will mean that families will be able to travel directly without having to travel via other countries or pay extortionate agency fees",
