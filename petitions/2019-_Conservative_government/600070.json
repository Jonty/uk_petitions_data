        "additional_details": "The government & NHS can save money by banning the practise and making it law to prevent agencies charging the tax payer excessive fee's to provide nurses and healthcare staff. As a country we should be looking at NHS flexible working to keep existing staff. Many nurses go to agencies to have flexibility in working hours but agencies in most cases, make around \u00a340 per hour as profit which is sickening - this profit could pay another nurse. The government need to ban such sickening profiteering.",
        "background": "Recruitment agencies are charging private healthcare and the NHS up to \u00a385 per hour for a nurse for a day. This sickening fee is being accepted by the NHS. The nurse gets flexibility on working hours but retains a similar salary to NHS direct pay - the agency retain the bulk of tax payers money",
