        "additional_details": "It is clear that the Covid-19 rules are not being followed by a significant proportion of the population. Reported issues go unchecked and are so frequent that even reporting them all is a task most have given up on. The minimum fine is \u00a360 reduced to \u00a330 for early payment. This is clearly not dissuading people\u2019s behaviour. Other European countries have fines starting at \u20ac1000 and far greater compliance. Fines can go towards the NHS . Non-payers can repay their debt via Community Service.",
