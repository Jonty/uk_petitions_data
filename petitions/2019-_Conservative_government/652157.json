        "additional_details": "The use of vapes amongst children has risen to its highest since records began with a quarter of young people admitting to trying it. Not only is this illegal, but it is also unproductive and, potentially, life-threatening. \r\n\r\nVaping amongst children during school time has led schools to focus more attention than they would have liked to stop the epidemic of e-liquid-using teens, flooding out of lessons to put their health at risk.\r\n\r\nWe must enforce the law for the benefit of all young people.",
        "background": "The British people are asking the UK Government to fine or give warnings to stores being found selling vaping products to people under the age of 18. We are also asking for vapes to be confiscated from those vaping under the legal age limit.",
