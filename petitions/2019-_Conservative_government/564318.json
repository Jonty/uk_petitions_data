This is causing a spike in cases and is putting vulnerable groups at severe risk. Countless students in tier 3/4 areas are at home isolating whilst others are at educational sites, causing a vast majority to miss out on classroom teaching, putting teachers and students alike in an awkward position. Online teaching temporarily is far more reasonable, as parents are equally as concerned.",
