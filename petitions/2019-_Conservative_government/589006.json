        "additional_details": "The UK's current electoral System is very unfair, and favours some political parties while completely under representing others. The Additional Member System is already used in Scotland and Wales where it has proven to produce far more representative election results as opposed to the current First Past the Post electoral system used for General Elections.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to hold a referendum, to give the British public the Chance to change the way we vote in UK general elections. The option would be to adopt an Additional Member System (AMS) such as the one used in Scottish and Welsh elections.",
