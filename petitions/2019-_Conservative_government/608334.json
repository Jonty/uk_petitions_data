We are in their country, not the other way around!\r\n  Rabbits, cats and dogs are also hit.\r\n Please also make it a legal offence to hit an animal on the road unless it is absolutely unavoidable and necessary. Please require drivers to drive slowly through animal habitat. Please also don\u2019t build new roads through natural habitat.",

Many more are orphaned.\r\n These animals matter, just like we do. If humans were being killed in those numbers on the roads, more action would be taken to protect their lives.",
