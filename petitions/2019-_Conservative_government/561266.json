        "action": "Stop work on HS2 immediately and hold a new vote to repeal the legislation",
        "additional_details": "Our environment and economy are in peril. HS2 is destroying nature and inflicting suffering on businesses and property owners. Government is investing in an inept and recklessly run project, offering poor value for money. HS2 will not reach Net Zero by 2050 nor help us level up the North. The pandemic has changed how we work forever and invalidated the business case. Given the climate emergencies we face, and now the economic and pandemic crises - Parliament must vote to repeal the legislation.",
        "background": "We ask Parliament to repeal the High Speed Rail Bills, 2016 and 2019, as MPs voted on misleading environmental, financial and timetable information provided by the Dept. of Transport and HS2 Ltd. It fails to address the conditions of the Paris Accord as costs have risen from \u00a356bn to over \u00a3100bn.",
