        "additional_details": "Veterinary Practices are in a uniquely vulnerable situation in the current crisis. They must continue to operate to maintain the food supply chain and provide vital care and treatment to animals, while simultaneously adopting strict social distancing measures. This has created a dramatic loss of income to practices which leaves them struggling to cover overheads. They have been unjustly excluded from Business Rates Relief scheme announced by the government, putting their survival at risk.",
        "background": "Veterinary practices in the UK have been excluded from the UK Government's support packages during the current COVID19 pandemic crisis. Retail, leisure and hospitality businesses have been granted Business Rates Relief. The UK Government has unfairly excluded veterinary practices from this scheme.",
