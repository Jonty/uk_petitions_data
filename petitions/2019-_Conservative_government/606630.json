        "additional_details": "Government should increase NHS workers wage as they deserve more and shouldn\u2019t be disregarded for their efforts. I recently spoke to an NHS nurse, who works in a school, and she explained that many of her NHS nurse friends were single mums and had to go to food banks in order to provide for her children. She also stated that if her husband didn\u2019t earn the amount that he does then she wouldn\u2019t have become part of the NHS. The salary is one of the main factors that put people off of becoming part of the NHS, by increasing their wages the NHS will become stronger and more populated.",
        "background": "We want the government to pay NHS workers a more suitable salary for their efforts and skills. Despite the recent pay rise given to NHS workers, many believe that the plan was flawed and are left unsatisfied. They feel undervalued and lied to by the government and prime minister.",
