I, therefore, expect recipes to be the same each time I buy that product afterward.\r\n\r\nHowever, when a store changes the recipe, there is often no acknowledgement of this, meaning that, people with allergies and intolerance like me, may buy and eat something harmful to them without realising. A \"New Recipe\" label would alert us the ingredient changes.\r\n",
