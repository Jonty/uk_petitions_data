        "additional_details": "The blight of fly tipping in our towns and countryside is affecting our environment and endangering our wildlife and waterways. We believe the fixed penalty notices limits are too low and penalties handed down by the courts are far too lenient, in many cases actually costing local authorities more than the penalty awarded with no recompense for the costs of cleaning up the fly tip, costs that are sometimes not even awarded and therefore cost local taxpayers.",
        "background": "Increase the penalty for anyone caught fly tipping. Set the minimum fine to \u00a31,000, plus full legal costs to the authority, plus the cost of clearing up, plus seize any vehicle involved to sell at auction, the proceeds to go to the local authority or if of little value, send it for destruction.",
