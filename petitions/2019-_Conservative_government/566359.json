        "action": "BBC to use existing network for National school syllabus educational programs.",
        "additional_details": "The BBC was created to keep the Country informed and has the widest reach of any global network. With a % of homes still not having Internet or appropriate equipment, TV provides a consistent and far reaching solution. With a National educational syllabus broadcast a much smaller pool of educators would be required to reach a maximum number of children and young adults. Recently voters have questioned the BBCs validity and a program such as this would add new relevance to an aging corporation.",
        "background": "We suggest the nationally funded BBC to use their massive network infrastructure to initiate a national school syllabus series, which would cover all primary and secondary level education to every home in the country free of additional cost. Using TV would reach an estimated 98% of households.",
