        "additional_details": "In Yemen 14 million people remain at risk of starvation and death,this is the largest humanitarian crisis in the world, the death toll is nearing 100,000 whilst 12 million children live in hell. A clear prelude to a genocide of a whole nation, covid-19 has left a seal of suffering on the Yemeni people. The UK should value the respective lives of a suffering nation over our economy, in light of recent preformative activism by the government we see history being cyclical and far from progressive.",
        "background": "Immediately ceasing all trade of weapons to the Saudi Regime. With blatant violations of human rights within Yemen and throughout the region it is vital that us within the UK, refuse to play a part in the bloodshed of others and condemn such amoral behaviours.",
