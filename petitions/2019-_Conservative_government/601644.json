My hours have been cut down due to the fact that fibromyalgia has greatly affected my mobility and I\u2019ve had a lot of time off work due to my illness. \r\n\r\nThere is currently no cure or treatments for fibromyalgia, so nothing helps to manage living a normal life daily, especially during a flare up. \r\n\r\nFibromyalgia should be recognised as a major disability by the DWP.",
