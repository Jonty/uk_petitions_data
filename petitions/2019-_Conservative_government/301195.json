        "additional_details": "On certain online escort review discussion boards, such as UK Punting & PunterNet, users can submit aggressive & potentially defamatory posts about women. Some of the reviews suggest sexual activity with unconsenting adults and underage girls. These websites ask for reviews to contain a link, contact details or address of the escort, which can put them at risk.  On UK Punting pictures of the escorts can be posted without consent. Such sites are dangerous to ALL women, not just escorts.",
