        "additional_details": "It is the government's responsibility to provide educational equality. Offering the vaccine to 16 and not 15 year olds could create a situation of educational inequality. This year group is taking GCSEs. All fall and winter birthdays will be offered vaccination and none of the slightly younger students. They will be more likely to get covid19 and miss school during the year. Their chances to do as well in their GCSEs as their peers may be affected. That is not fair nor equitable.",
