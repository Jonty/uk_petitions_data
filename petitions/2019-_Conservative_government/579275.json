        "additional_details": "As I understand laws to be at present, members of the public cannot lawfully carry anything other than a harmless dye marker spray & panic alarm with which to try & ward off a physical attack outside their homes/in public spaces...this leaves the vast majority of us totally defenceless, as very few people possess the skills, fitness & confidence to fight off even an unarmed aggressor bare handed. A small pepper spray is non lethal but effective way to temporarily incapacitate would be attacker",
        "background": "To please amend the current laws on offensive weapons/self defence outside the home, to permit civilians to purchase & carry small low concentrate pepper spray for personal self defence against violent attackers, possibly by allowing the addition of low pepper concentrate to existing dye sprays.",
