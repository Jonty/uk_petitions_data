The proposed Turing scheme must address these losses if it is to replicate or even improve upon the opportunities that the Erasmus programme provided for UK students.  The Turing Scheme should not be more expensive than Erasmus and it should offer as wide a range of location choice on where to be placed as Erasmus previously was able to.",
