Kirklees consists of numerous areas e.g. Holme Valley, Colne Valley, Huddersfield, Dearne Valley, Cleckheaton and North Kirklees. There is a difference in Covid figures between these areas but we are all been associated with an overall figure as Kirklees rather than the individual locations which is how it should be reported. By breaking it down to region it gives greater awareness of problem areas and keeps the public accurately informed.",
