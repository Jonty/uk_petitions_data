        "additional_details": "The importance of black history and culture is ignored largely by the UK curriculum. Teaching children of the suffering and struggles of POC caused by the British would help them understand our input and would help in taking responsibility for the actions of our ancestors. Just as the Holocaust is taught in German curriculum, by teaching this we encourage solidarity amongst all people. By acknowledging our responsibility, we will discourage institutionalised racism.",
        "background": "The UK history curriculum needs to teach students of the suffering we caused during colonisation and the slave trade, as examples. History lessons should be have perspective and not focus solely on the triumphs of the British. British input in genocide and slavery needs to be accounted for.",
