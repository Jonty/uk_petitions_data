Same time off in total but spread out better through the year. \r\n\r\nAll state schools have to comply with the holiday weeks. But allow some freedom in counties to provide consistency but adhere to traditions as required.",
        "background": "Allow parents more freedom to manage work and home lives. Focus on children during holidays and enjoy more quality time. Six weeks is too long and requires childcare or holiday clubs which are expensive and exclusive. This then Overburdens and adds pressure to parents holiday allowances.",
