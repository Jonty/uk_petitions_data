        "additional_details": "I support the government\u2019s plan to tackle obesity, but this is potentially a damaging approach. Educating consumers on moderation, healthy lifestyle choices and physical exercise is more helpful than merely focusing on just calories. Forcing consumers to read the calorific content of meals in isolation could lead to an unhealthy association between food and guilt. This negative association of guilt and food could be a powerful trigger for causing an eating disorder",
        "background": "To amend the law so consumers have the choice between using a menu with published calories or one without. Consumers should have the option of being unaware of the calorific content of food as the nutritional value of the meal is not simply reflected by the calorific content.",
