        "action": "Introduce an optional philosophy GCSE into the current Key Stage 4 curriculum",
        "additional_details": "Philosophy will enable students to become reflective and considerate thinkers, furnish their ability to think logically and creatively and help them argue for a case. It will pose questions on philosophical topics such as ethics, the mind and aesthetics. \r\n\r\nPhilosophy relates to many subjects and is a methodology as much as a subject. The skills that students are taught can be used in everyday settings, so the impact of a philosophy GCSE will survive long after the qualification is achieved.",
        "background": "GCSE Philosophy would encourage students to reflect upon themselves and question what they believe. It is an attractive subject concerning everyday life. It would teach skills that are useful in and outside the classroom, touching upon aspects of A-Level Philosophy but much more engaging for KS4.",
