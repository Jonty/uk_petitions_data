It is no secret that the Home Secretary does not support the freedom to protest after her labelling of the 2020 BLM protests as \u2018dreadful\u2019. The Government is seeking to suppress the freedom to protest by increasing police powers to stop them, even for non-violent protests of just one person. We demand that the Bill be rejected.",

Hidden in this bill are details of the Government seeking power to restrict any non-violent protects on the grounds of \u2018noise or nuisance\u2019 and make protests at Parliament Square illegal.",
