        "additional_details": "The Government should allow applications from anywhere, remove the IELTS requirement, and allow TB screening to take place on arrival to the UK.\r\n \r\nThe current process of applying for a Skilled Worker/Global Talent visa can take up to 6 months and require applicants to apply from inside their country of residence.\r\n \r\nDue to the current conflict in Russia, many skilled Russian workers have already left their country and, therefore, cannot apply. Allowing these people to apply from outside of Russia, and simplifying the application process, should bring benefits to UK businesses and the UK economy.",
        "background": "We want the Government to make it easier for Russian citizens and their families to apply for visas, as many such people are fleeing Russia.",
