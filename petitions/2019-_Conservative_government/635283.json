        "additional_details": "Research has found children who learn to swim earlier are found to reach major cognitive development milestones including speech, literacy, numeracy and visual motor skills earlier. Learning to swim at an early age should also help reduce the risk of drowning. Swimming is also a social activity, can help reduce obesity, benefit mental health and help promote independence and self-care. This is particularly important for families for those who cannot afford lessons.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to mandate and provide funding to schools across England for weekly swimming lessons weekly for children over the age of 5, to improve children's knowledge and understanding of the dangers of water and to promote good health.",
