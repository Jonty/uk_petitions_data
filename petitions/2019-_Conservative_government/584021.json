The sole company of felines throughout recent lockdowns has saved many people from severe depression and loneliness, one reason I have read is that dogs are included because they are classed as working animals? What about the working felines on farms protecting from rodents etc, My cat was seriously injured in a hit & run left for dead and is still fighting for his life because no one stopped!",
