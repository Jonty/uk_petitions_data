        "additional_details": "It is clear and obvious what the physical & mental benefits of exercise provide. Namely, being able to visit an indoor gym and use their facilities. No matter how much outdoor exercise you offer it does not always equate to the benefits of safely being able to visit a gym indoors, especially during the cold winter months. Gyms are a vital part of improving public health, in the short term and long term. Gyms are also a savior of people suffering with mental health issues. Please keep them open.",
        "background": "We would like for gyms to be classed as essential and remain open during any local or national lockdown scenario. Gyms have continuously followed strict guidelines on social distancing and cleanliness and remain one of the safest places for people to visit.",
