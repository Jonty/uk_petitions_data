        "action": "Extend the current smoking ban to cover outdoor public places.",
        "additional_details": "Other developed countries such as Japan have long banned smoking in outdoor public places and instead have designated smoking areas/boxes on some streets. We have long known the harmful effects of passive smoking, even outside, and we must protect children and non-smokers from the carcinogenic toxins. Currently at restaurants, cafes and indeed any outdoor space, members of the public have no control over their exposure and proximity to second hand smoke and can do little to protect themselves.",
        "background": "We call on the UK government to extend the current smoking ban to cover outdoor public places, particularly venues such as restaurants and cafes where children and non-smokers may be in close proximity to smokers and have no means to shelter themselves from second hand smoke.",
