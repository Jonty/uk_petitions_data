        "additional_details": "Staff in early years settings are catching the virus despite following to the letter every bit of local and national guidance that exists relating to preventing its spread. It may appear to be safe because children don\u2019t display symptoms, but this is the main problem - we don\u2019t know who is infected. Early years staff are putting themselves and their families at risk and some are becoming extremely ill. If we are forced to continue remaining open to all children it\u2019s vital that they are protected",
        "background": "Nurseries and Preschools have to stay open to all. We have been told that it\u2019s safe because of the low transmission rate of Covid amongst children. We have seen first hand that this is no longer the case, especially with the new strain of the virus. Vaccinations are vital for all early years workers",
