We are being asked return to the office, shop on our high streets etc.  We were promised a testing system where everyone who needed a test would get one. \r\n\r\nA system which prioritises certain groups falls way short and will allow the virus to spread.

Deliver on the promise to ensure everyone who needs a test, gets a test, now.",
