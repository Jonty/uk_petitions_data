Whilst book glorified the World War 1, Great Fire of London, a lot of important history was missed out!\r\n\r\nThis has now led to individuals being misinformed and ignorant as a result of not understanding important factors such as White Privilege and Systemic Racism.  Therefore, we as a society must take it upon us to educate individuals in order for them to be well informed and tackle these issues.",
