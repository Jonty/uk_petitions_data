It is not evidence based and is against the manufacturers advice.\r\n\r\nIt has also thrown all the plans for administration and appointments made into chaos, causing great disruption and possible delay in vaccine administration with no evidence of a benefit.",
        "background": "The Pfizer Covid-19 vaccination is 95% effective when a second dose is given at 21 days. There is no evidence for delaying the second dose for 12 weeks, but this is what the government has decided to do. This move has been criticised by the vaccine manufacturers.",
