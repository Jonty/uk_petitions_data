        "additional_details": "Nurses, Care Assistants and Junior Doctors have not been included in the payrise. The government's argument to support this is that these groups agreed new contracts recently. These contracts hardly address the stagnation in pay in the past 10 years and many members of those groups do not agree with the terms. They argue that the contracts do not appropriately pay for antisocial hours. It is a kick in the teeth to not increase pay for all front line workers.",
        "background": "1000s of staff have not been included in the public health sector pay rise. The pay rise should be uniform and include all members of staff in the NHS. This is only right and fair in light of their huge contribution to the COVID pandemic response.",
