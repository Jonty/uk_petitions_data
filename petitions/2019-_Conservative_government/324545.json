        "additional_details": "It is incredibly damaging for black youth to grow up thinking they are the underclass, which is reinforced when the most black history they are taught is slavery & MLK, which hardly scrapes the surface of all the positive influences/events in black history. Furthermore, it reinforces the institutional racism throughout society if white students are brought up in an environment which devalues black people, & ignores their existence. Black students need to feel liberated & this is the way forward.",
        "background": "Change the curriculum to include prominent black figures in history, praise all races from an early age, teach literature from written by black authors, educate on black led movements & successes, teach black students where they came from, & show white students what they\u2019ve gained from BAME efforts.",
