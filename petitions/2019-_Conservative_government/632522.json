        "additional_details": "Pubs and drinking establishments have been at the heart of Britain's culture for centuries. The pandemic and rise of online and supermarket beer sales has made pubs less competitive for alcohol and yet this undervalues and erodes their social value; their great part in our communities and culture.\r\n \r\nIt is time the Government supported our pubs and brewing heritage and recognised their economic and societal importance with a 20% draught drink relief to help this industry recover and thrive.",
        "background": "The Government is planning a welcome but inadequate 5% draught drink relief. It is marginal (2-3p a pint). Introducing a 20% discount (8-11p a pint) should help boost the brewing and pub industry amidst the cost of living crisis and recovery from the pandemic, reversing needless decline.",
