        "additional_details": "After an exam, many students might want to relax or spend time in nature, and study in their own time. If they are forced to stay in school, this can be stressful. On the other hand, some students find that they work better when they are at school, as they concentrate more. People all work in different ways, so students should be given the option of study leave, to allow them to study in the best way possible, and achieve the best grades that they can.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to require schools to let students decide for themselves how they would best be able to prepare for their GCSEs. Being in school during the exam period can be tiring, noisy, stressful and affect mental health.",
