My idea should reduce the motivation for people to commit these crimes in the first place as it will be impossible to legally sell stolen items without serial numbers or checking the national database to check to see if these items are stolen.",

It should also be illegal not to check it against a database, where all such items should be registered, before sale, to ensure it is being sold legally.",
