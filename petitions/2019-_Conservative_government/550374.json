        "additional_details": "The Government should delay 2021 exams to allow students to catch up after months of not having proper teaching. \r\nIf students do not have this catch up time, it will result in pupils receiving lower grade results. This will have an impact on their future employment and any future education. \r\nA study by UCL Institute of Education has found that one in five students have done no homeschooling, or managed less than half an hour a day.\r\nTherefore, the Government should delay 2021 exams.",
        "background": "The Government should delay the 2021 GCSE and A-level exams until July 2021 to allow students to catch up after the disruption caused by COVID-19. \r\nThe closure of schools as a result of Coronavirus has caused millions of students across the UK to be behind on their studies.",
