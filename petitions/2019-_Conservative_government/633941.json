        "additional_details": "Real-time access to smart meter data on a phone app would tell us which activities use the most electricity, gas and water. This would help us cut electricity, gas and water use - saving money and helping to save the planet.\r\n\r\nApps and platforms such as Home Assistant can provide more intelligence to consumers than a stand-alone smart meter display. They can illustrate history, trends and spikes and tie the data in with other sources such as solar panel generation and variable tariff prices.",
        "background": "Make a free app for consumers to look at their real-time energy and water usage on their phones.\r\n\r\nMake an API available so that platforms such as Home Assistant can integrate this data.\r\n\r\nAllow users to authenticate with the MPAN plus a recent meter reading / date of reading.",
