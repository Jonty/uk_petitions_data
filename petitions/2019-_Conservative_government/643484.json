        "additional_details": "I have been refused a referral due to my weight and have now been told my only option is weight loss surgery, which I think is something that shouldn't be encouraged.\r\n \r\nMy GP agrees with me that I have done everything possible, but the rules state my BMI is too high. This has had an adverse impact on my mental health, which I have already struggled with due to constantly being told I need to lose weight. I have been dieting since I was 18, I have tried exercising but due to disability I struggle to do this, I have been through the weight management and have seen dieticians they all say I'm doing everything I should.\r\n",
