        "additional_details": "I have been refused a referral due to my weight and have now been told my only option is weight loss surgery, which I think is something that shouldn't be encouraged.\r\n \r\nMy GP agrees with me that I have done everything possible, but the rules state my BMI is too high. This has had an adverse impact on my mental health, which I have already struggled with due to constantly being told I need to lose weight. I have been dieting since I was 18, I have tried exercising but due to disability I struggle to do this, I have been through the weight management and have seen dieticians they all say I'm doing everything I should.\r\n",
        "background": "I believe that the criteria for accessing fertility treatment on the NHS are unfair and don't take into account health problems. Most Integrated Care Boards require body mass index (BMI) to be below a certain level in order to have IVF.\r\n",
