        "additional_details": "Students have already suffered, detrimentally, with the 3 lockdowns imposed on us. The lack of formal content learnt and the inability to learn more in such a short period of time means we cannot sit formal papers. Students cannot withstand another U-Turn regarding exams. The impacts to our mental health feel irreversible. The major differences between content covered across schools means we may not have the correct knowledge for exams. The government must trust teacher predicted grades.",
        "background": "2021 students were assured that exams would be cancelled. Now, Gavin Williamson and Ofqual are in the process of establishing \u201cmini exams\u201d, created externally, to inform teacher grades. Stop this from happening and use fair teacher predictions!",
