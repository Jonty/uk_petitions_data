        "additional_details": "We want the government to take action and steps in order to give the British figure of Gyles Brandreth a knighthood to reward his services to the country. He deserves this honour because he has given the public loads in many ways, such as his sense of humour on any television show he appears on and his extensive jumper collection. He has brightened our lives and deserves for the government to recognise his notability.",

He has made an impact to our lives by his services as Member of Parliament of City of Chester and politics plus his services of entertainment for the public.
