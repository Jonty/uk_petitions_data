The Victims Charter and Victims Law were introduced after talking to hundreds of victims as part of Victims Voice but as long as our lenient sentences continue it does not give us justice or peace. The Government should build more prisons if necessary to accommodate longer sentences especially now our population has grown.",
        "background": "Current sentences are not justice for people who have lost loved ones to violent crime, neither is 12 to 15 years being classed as a life sentence, or people being released after serving half their sentence. It\u2019s appalling.",
