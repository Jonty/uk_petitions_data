They think that large numbers signing a petition will cause the Government to consider changing their policy and that if it is placed before what they see as Parliament, i.e the House of Commons, MPs will debate the proposal which may be then subject to a vote. \r\nThe Westmister Debates are seen as a sham because rarely are there more than two MPs present and no vote is taken. The petitioners believe they are being ignored.",
