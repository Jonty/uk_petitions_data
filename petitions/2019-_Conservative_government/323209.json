There is no requirement under the UN Refugee Convention for asylum seekers to claim in the first country they arrive in.\r\n\r\nThere is currently a mechanism in place under the Dublin Regulation to apply for a transfer in some cases, if someone makes an asylum claim but has already passed through an EU country, although these arrangements will cease to apply to the UK after the transition period.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
