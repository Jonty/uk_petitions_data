        "additional_details": "Number 10's spokesperson has argued that the \u00a3900,000 paint job represents 'value for money'.\r\n\r\nSpending nearly \u00a31 million on branding an RAF plane for the Prime Minister in the hope that this will help Great Britain's standing overseas, cannot be justified.\r\n\r\nWhen people in the UK are losing their jobs to coronavirus, it's immoral.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, painting the plane red, white and blue, rather than grey, will make it more difficult for the Voyager to be used by the RAF during emergencies.",
        "background": "The government is repainting the prime ministerial plane in Union Jack colours, at a cost to the taxpayer of \u00a3900,000.\r\n\r\nThere are hundreds of better things that nearly \u00a31 million could be spent on - such as giving nurses a pay rise.",
