        "additional_details": "In the UK about 2 in 100 children and about 1 in 200 adults have an allergy to nuts. \r\n\r\nThis means that any time they pick up a shampoo, or moisturiser without allergens being highlighted, there is a significantly increased risk of severe allergic reaction and anaphylaxis due to a trigger ingredient being missed. This is dangerous and needs to be addressed. \r\n\r\nCosmetic and toiletries should be considered the same when it comes to highlighting allergens as any food product.",
        "background": "Current legislation means that it is necessary to bold all allergens on food labels to show potential risks to any allergy sufferers. \r\n\r\nHowever this does not extend to toiletries and cosmetics. \r\n\r\nAs many toiletries use these ingredients such as nuts, it is important that these to are prominent.",
