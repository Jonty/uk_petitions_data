        "additional_details": "Discrimination against individuals based on sexual orientation is homophobia, it has no place in our society. The restrictions currently in place which exclude gay/bi men from donating are outdated, they were introduced at a time where homosexuality was criminalised and frowned upon. We have made considerable progress and a society to embrace and accept the LGBTQ+ Community. However, restrictions like this reflect denigration toward the community. We call on you to remove these restrictions.",
        "background": "Gay and Bisexual men are being excluded from donating plasma or blood if they have had intercourse with a man within the past 3 months. We call on you to introduce individualised risk assessments, based on people of all sexualities and their individual circumstances, lifestyles and behaviours.",
