        "additional_details": "Charities, especially small, struggle with generating stable and regular sources of income at the best of times.  Very few will have the resilience to deal with the loss of income which COVID19 will cause.  Help will need to be given to trustees to make difficult decisions about cutting activity but one way to improve the situation would be to allow charities to claim Gift Aid on all income during the crisis period.  Please investigate how engineering this is possible and, if not, alternatives.",
