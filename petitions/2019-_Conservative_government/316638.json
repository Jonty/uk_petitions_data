        "additional_details": "The total number of non-UK students studying in the UK in 2018-19 was 485,645 and was expected to increase further in September 2019. The UK has always been one of the benchmark countries for all international students to pursue their Higher Education. A lot of international students look for jobs during this time of the year, to fulfil their future careers, following the competition of their education and subsequently benefiting companies in the UK.",
        "background": "Due to Covid-19 many companies will not be able to continue with their recruitment processes. This disadvantages current international students in the job market as their visas expire during and after lockdown. The government should implement the PSW visa extension for current international students",
