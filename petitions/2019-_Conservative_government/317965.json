The process can take months, be expensive and emotionally draining.\r\n\r\nGiving police power to enforce breaches should reduce the number of people breaching these orders, and allow what the court has already decided as right and safe for the child, to be enforced. Breaching the orders should be subject to an instant deterrent which can be issued by the police, such as the issuing an on the spot fine, with the amount increased after further breaches.",
