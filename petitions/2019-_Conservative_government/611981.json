        "additional_details": "Removing all safeguards is unfair to clinically vulnerable people trying to live their lives having survived two horrendous years with COVID-19. Free LFTs for those of us who want to see vulnerable friends and family is a must, e.g. vulnerable grandparents who have grandchildren at school where cases are rife. It is inequitable to expect us to pay so we can give them peace of mind. Please make LFTs free to all those who have close contact with clinically vulnerable friends or family.",
        "background": "While the vaccination programme has been a great success, clinically vulnerable people are more likely to become seriously ill if infected. It isn\u2019t fair to expect them to shield now cases are high. LFTs should be made free to people wishing to see their clinically vulnerable relatives and friends.",
