        "additional_details": "The support throughout the UK is nothing far from shocking, some areas having NO support what so ever.\r\n\r\nNot getting a diagnosis and not getting the correct support at such an important age can lead to life long behavioural and mental health issues, which can be alleviated by having the right support from the start!\r\n\r\nIf more funding was given to create more specialist Tourettes centres this would help many families who are currently struggling. \r\n\r\nMore research would ultimately give more answers!",
        "background": "Tourettes affects 1 in 100 children, yet the support provided is minimal and very patchy across the UK, some areas have NO support.\r\n\r\nTheres only a handful of specialist Tourettes centres in the whole of the UK - we need more of these to provide care for EVERYONE! More research leads to more help!",
