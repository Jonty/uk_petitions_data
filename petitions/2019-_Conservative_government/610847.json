        "action": "Introduce mandatory registration & licensing of anyone who breeds/sells animals",
        "additional_details": "The high demand for pets is not met in full by licensed breeders, leading many people to search elsewhere. Estimates suggest that 88% of puppies born in Britain are from unlicensed breeders, and tens of thousands are imported from the EU to meet demand. They are often separated from their mothers early, or kept in poor conditions, which can cause long-term suffering.\r\n \r\nI believe that introducing mandatory registration and licensing will be an effective way to improve animal welfare, as it would lead to more visibility & traceability of the sellers/breeders, making it easier to ensure the welfare of animals and consumers is protected.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to create a mandatory system of registration and licensing for all people who breed and sell animals, and a centralised database of all licensed breeders/sellers (including sellers on social media), for transparency and to help with enforcement.",
