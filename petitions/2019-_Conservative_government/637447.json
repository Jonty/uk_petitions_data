        "additional_details": "There is currently a huge problem within the e-cigarettes and that is that too many retailers are willing to sell e-cigarette products to under 18s. E-cigarettes can contain 2% nicotine, and a 600 puff disposable can be equivalent to around 45-50 cigarettes worth.\r\n \r\nThe Government should restrict sales of e-cigarettes to licensed e-cigarettes shops, to ensure that sales are made by specialist businesses that are licensed and understand these products. E-cigarettes are harmful to under 18s, and banning the sale from any shops but vape shops should help ensure safe sales.\r\n",
        "background": "I would like to see all e-cigarette products banned from any retailer, like corner shops and supermarkets, that isn't a licensed e-cigarette shop. I believe this could help dramatically cut down on the misuse of nicotine amongst under 18s and help ensure that the products are sold correctly.",
