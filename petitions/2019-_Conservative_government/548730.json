        "additional_details": "Due to Covid 19, funding for animal shelters have taken a drastic hit resulting in several organisations to close as well as some branches for bigger organisations. This mandatory test encourages individuals not to purchase pets on impulse and understand the requirements of owning pets. This should help ease the strain on shelters for unwanted pets and circumvent pets going into abusive households. Furthermore many people have dated ideologies such as dominance theory in relation to dogs.",
