I was failed by the educational system, I was labelled the \u201c naughty child\u201d, I was just struggling and believe Not enough teachers have the right training to be able to deal with the complex needs that ADHD carries. Many teachers would much prefer to send students with ADHD out of lesson for being disrespectful. This can ruin the chances of those with ADHD from getting a great education. I believe the government need to help raise awareness in schools. Having more awareness will benefit Our mental health.",
