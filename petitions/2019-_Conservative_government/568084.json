We are still trying to work with our clients, yet we\u2019re not specifically included in the list of critical workers, despite being an essential support to our clients. The inability to send our children into school as critical worker children means that we don\u2019t have privacy for our sessions and we\u2019re unable to meet work and home schooling demands, resulting in us withdrawing from our clients when they need us the most.",
