        "additional_details": "We understand that the changes to the Freedom Pass and 60+ Oyster card pass during morning peak travel were temporarily introduced to help reduce the risk of crowding and allow people travelling into work to maintain social distancing.\r\n\r\nHowever, in light of the Government's shift in attitude towards COVID-19 and it outlining its plan for \"Living with COVID-19\", there is no plausible reason for retaining the temporary changes which should be reversed immediately.",
        "background": "We want Parliament to require Transport for London to restore free travel on all London transport during morning peak times for people over 60 as was the case prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
