        "action": "Make the use of Bee killing pesticides in the UK illegal.",
        "additional_details": "The decision to allow farmers to use this pesticide must be reversed as a matter of urgency to protect fragile biodiversity in the UK. The government should be doing everything in its power to protect bees as a result of the biodiversity crisis which states that half the planets insects have disappeared. We are in the midst of a climate emergency and the use of this pesticide will make all efforts to protect wildlife so far futile.   Protecting Bees guarantees the future of our planet.",
        "background": "A bee-killing poisonous pesticide that it is banned for use in the EU has now been permitted by the UK government to be used by farmers in England.
