        "additional_details": "Medical & toxicology experiments have been conducted on dogs for over 100 years. We are better than this. We won\u2019t stop until this cruel, outdated and inaccurate practice is banned. Thousands of dogs are bred and tested on each year in the UK before being destroyed. There is enough evidence to show there are better, more accurate and humane methods. But until we make a stand, these corporations have no motivation to change. We should not treat these innocent animals this way it is wrong.",
        "background": "Testing on dogs is totally unacceptable. We are a nation of dog lovers, force our government to take notice, enforce a ban & be a compassionate example to the rest of the world. We will not stand by & nothing while puppies are bred in cold, dark conditions & sent to laboratories at just 16 weeks.",
