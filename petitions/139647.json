Following this, on 24th June David Cameron announced that he would step down as Prime Minister and invited his Conservative Party to elect a new Leader to take over from him as Prime Minister by October and thereafter lead Brexit negotiations.\r\n\r\nThe decision of who leads these negotiations should not be left to Conservatives alone. We should all decide who forms the Government which negotiates Brexit.",
