        "additional_details": "Increased population in Fairfield has also made a fair impact and this again causes issues as the children attend school the bad placement of crossings only add to the congestion. I believe that a combination of bypass and skywalk/overpass will decrease traffic, lower RTA and make safer travel for children. http://buxtontownteam.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Buxton-on-the-Move-conference-report.pdf\r\n",
        "background": "Buxton in the high peak has suffered unneeded congestion for many years now. A6, A53, A515,all meet in Buxton. The greatly increased traffic has got steadily worse, creating accidents along the A6 where people are trying to u-turn. The damage to the Peak District environment must also be highlighted",
