In addition, increasing examples of \"fake news/facts\" are now also being seen, some with significant implications. Online media owners created the tools being used to disseminate this content and benefit from the revenues such broadcast generates. As such, they must become legally responsible for whatever they publish.",

However, unlike more traditional media outlets, including television and radio stations and the traditional printed press, there is an almost total lack of editorial oversight.\r\n",
