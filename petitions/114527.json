        "additional_details": "Although play centres often designate areas and display maximum age/height stipulations, there are rarely any minimum ones. In adventure playgrounds/parks there's minimum height/age guidelines but not always at soft play areas; often it's at the parent/carer's discretion despite the drops between platforms/steps being too dangerous for infants/toddlers to natigate. Nothing guides adults regarding minimum age/height, even a broken bone can be a life-threatening situation as it was for our Zara.",
        "background": "As 1year old Zara played in a soft play area, no one anticipated the critical fall. Zara fell almost her height backwards resulting in serious injury. As soft play areas become more popular all infants/toddlers are at risk of harm because there are no displayed minimum height/age restrictions.",
