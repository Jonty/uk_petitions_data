        "additional_details": "As examples: Gwen Ellis sentenced to death for witchcraft in 1594; Helen Duncan, the last person to be convicted (in 1944) of witchcraft under the 1735 act, was imprisoned for nine months; John William Gott imprisoned for blasphemy on December 9, 1921 for nine months with hard labour; The Gay News and Denis Lemon convicted of blasphemous libel in 1977...",
        "background": "In light of today's posthumous pardons for all gay and bisexual men convicted of decades old sexual offences (convictions which like many others I found deeply upsetting) it is patently unfair that others in history are still regarded as \"guilty\" of things we would no longer consider as crimes.",
