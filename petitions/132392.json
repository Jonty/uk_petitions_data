        "additional_details": "The problem\r\nElectric shock collars (ESCs) are worn around a dog's neck and deliver an electric shock either via a remote control or an automatic trigger, for example, a dog's bark.\r\nElectric shock collars train dogs through a fear of further punishment, having received the shock when it does not perform what is asked of it, rather than from a natural willingness to obey.",
        "background": "Key Statistics from Research into Electric Shock Collars\r\n1 in 4 dogs showed signs of stress compared to less than 5% of dogs in the non-electric shock collar control group.\r\n1 in 3 dogs yelp at the first use of electric shock collar and 1 in 4 yelp at subsequent uses.",
