        "additional_details": "Rabbits are as intelligent, loving and playful, as dogs or cats are. They need regular vet care and a healthy diet. They love to run and jump and they need companions whether human, or rabbit to enrich their lives so that they are happy. Their traditional housing/cages are far too small. Pet shops should either not be allowed to sell them or it should be the law that they would educate people on rabbits' living conditions, diet (hay based) and vet care (spay/neuter and yearly vaccinations). ",
        "background": "Rabbits are the third most popular pet in the UK. Yet they are the most neglected and abandoned pet. Tens of thousands are dumped at rescues each year. Many more live in small cages/hutches with no space to run and play as they would want to live.They need MORE protection to prevent this travesty. ",
