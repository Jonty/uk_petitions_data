        "additional_details": "Creating a train line along M25 with train stations near each junction would ease the traffic on M25 and reduce vehicular pollution. This outer circle can then connect to all major train line that go into the Central London areas or going to other areas of the Country. Ample parking in these train stations will allow commuters to drive into the nearest station and hop onto trains. Local businesses around the train station will also benefit from the new investment.",
        "background": "M25 is a nightmare for commuters especially during peak hours. Commuters waste precious time sitting in long traffic queues around the  junctions such as J27, J21, J16, J15, J12 and Dartford crossing. Traffic on M25 is also adding to vehicular pollution.",
