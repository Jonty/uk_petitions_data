        "additional_details": "Trauma to the brain can occur as a result of an impact. It can cause concussion, skull fracture, permanent disability, behavioral and cognitive problems, memory loss, sleep disorders and in some cases, death. Studies have shown that wearing a helmet can reduce the risk of a serious brain injury and death because during a fall or collision, most of the impact is absorbed by the helmet, rather than your head and brain. \r\nhttps://beyondthekerb.wordpress.com/reference/uk-cycling-fatalities-2015/",
        "background": "Shockingly, there is NO British law to compel cyclists of any age, to wear helmets when cycling, even though the Highway Code suggests cyclists should wear a cycle helmet \u201cwhich conforms to current regulations, is the correct size and securely fastened.\u201d A change in the law could help save lives.",
