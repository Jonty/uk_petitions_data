        "additional_details": "Please sign this petition 1) to get the Jade Goody Effect back, 2) so Jade didn't die for nothing and 3) to get somebody to listen that if a girl younger than 25 walks into a GP surgery requesting a smear because she's worried that something isn't right GIVE HER THE SMEAR surely the price of the smear is cheaper than the price of the cancer treatment? Thank you for taking the time to read this petition xx\r\n",
        "background": "#TheJadeGoodyEffect\r\nI run The Jade Goody Memorial Page on Facebook. Jade died at the young age of 27 after being diagnosed with cervical cancer. Jade publicised her illness to make girls listen and to go for smears to stop other families going through what she did. Let's get the JadeEffect back.\r\n",
