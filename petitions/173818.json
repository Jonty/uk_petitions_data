        "action": "change the rape law stating a women can rape a man instead of sexual assault",
        "additional_details": "UK law has defined rape as forced penetration, not forced to penetrate. Forced to penetrate is classified as sexual assault. Hence, the very low statistics on the rape of men. Research has shown that if forced to penetrate was classified as rape, and men were encouraged to come forward about the rape in the same way women are, then statistics for female on male rape would be just as high as male on female rape. Rape is classified as a victim being unable or unwilling to consent to sex",
        "background": "The current UK law states that a women can not be charged with rape if she rapes a man, she will get charged with sexual assault. I believe this law is out dated and is unfair. A lot has changed over the years, some women are just as or even more worse than what a man can be.",
