        "action": "Parliament make a full and unequivocal apology for UK's part in invading Iraq",
        "additional_details": "USA simply went to war with an aim of \"bomb back to the stone age\" countries with things they wanted. Senior US spokes persons have admitted that the motive for invasion was because Saddam was seeking to raise the price of oil. Parliament used a lie to disguise its reasons. It is time to be somewhat sceptical about what USA expects of UK. \r\n\r\nNow is time to apologies.\r\n",
        "background": "There is a case for parliament to make a full unequivocal apology for going to war with USA on Iraqi, killing so many of their people and our soldiers following the outcome of Chilcot Inquiry. Be sceptical about Trident submarine replacement and other military things USA may try to pull UK into.\r\n",
