        "additional_details": "The Union states if the Union no longer works for Scotland then we can demand to move away from Westminster (London) governance and take on our own governance. 96% of our MPs didn't want this war neither did 72% of scots. Westminster have taken Scotland for a ride. We demand independence without the referendum. Our money should be going to build our country not bomb another.",
        "background": "The Union was meant to be a fair and equal from the start of the Union. Our MPs and people are over ruled on every thing due to a unfair system in Westminster. Scotland can only be equal in Westminster if Scotland England Wales and Northern Ireland have the same amount of MPs. ",
