        "additional_details": "After loosing twins at 21+6 weeks, I'm left wondering if someone had helped they would still be here today. Babies have been saved at 21 weeks before but my hospital refused to help. My babies measured the same as a 24 week pregnancy even though were twins as babies all grow at different rates. My babies were left to die with me holding them like they didn't matter. Yet they cried and breathed. I believe if born alive or early labour happens at 21 weeks plus things should be done to prevent it. ",
        "background": "If a lady goes into preterm labour before 24 weeks they're refused steroids, magnesium etc which can help their babies lungs, and could stop labour. \r\nI lost twins at 21w 6d, I was refused help in the days leading to their birth. They were alive nearly an hour and I was refused any help for them. ",
