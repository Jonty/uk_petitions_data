        "additional_details": "As a result many are being refused the opportunity to be assessed if an assessment is missed due to cognitive factors of the disorder ,when being assessed they are not full trained /knowledgable that  fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder that can fluctuate and that someone could be able to walk with a stick one day and be bedridden the next. All of which impacts on ability to sustain work.  Also i.e if in the support group of ESA they dont consider this within PIP, they don't share information. ",
        "background": "Currently DWP processes do not consider nor understand the chronicity of fibromyalgia on daily living and in turn the impact on ability to sustain work. At present cases are not being assessed by professionals that are fully trained and knowledgable of how fibromyalgia affects daily living",
