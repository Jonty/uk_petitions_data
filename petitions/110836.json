        "action": "Stop travel companies profiteering with prices during school holidays",
        "additional_details": "One example I saw recently was at a centre Parc where half term week prices were \u00a31099 but the week either side of half term was less than \u00a3500 this means many families cannot afford to take their children on holiday outside of term time and risk fines taking them out of school during term. I feel the government should put rules in place to stop such extreme price changes",
        "background": "The government have made it a point to ensure all children attend school and do not have time off for holidays and fine parents if they do so travel companies increase their prices by 100% or more in these times which is profiteering and leading to parents removing children during term time",
