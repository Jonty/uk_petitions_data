        "additional_details": "Around 7,000 people in the UK are currently waiting for a medical donation, of which around 1,000 people will die before one is found.  The number of living donations has been decreasing over the last two years, this is not helped by the government and employers seeing donors as people making themselves ill.  Donors should be treated equally as if the donor had become ill themselves, as such they should be entitled to statutory sick pay and an employee should receive their sickness package.",
        "background": "When donors make a living donation the government and many employers see this as an employee optionally making themselves ill, and as such the individual is required to take any time off from their holiday entitlement or take time off unpaid and are not entitled to any sick pay.",
