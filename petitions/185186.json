        "additional_details": "When the National lottery first started it had a jackpot of \u00a38million every Saturday and even the Wednesday draw generated a \u00a36million prize. Now it is less than 1/2 of this because people have lost interest/faith in the current set up. They doubled the ticket cost and that put even more people off, then reduced the chance of winning even a small prize. Now the only way it generate interest is with roll-overs created because not enough people play to win the prize",
        "background": "Camelot is not a British company. The profits go to its owners in Canada. Since taking possession of Camelot they have changed the odds and made it harder to win and invented the useless 'FREE LUCKY DIP' Prize. The whole game needs an overhall with more smaller prizes to keep in interesting.",
