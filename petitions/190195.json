        "additional_details": "Those granted refugee status here should be able to settle in the UK permanently. A policy of review and possible deportation removes refugees\u2019 security and in practice endangers people. It is also bad for British society as it forcibly uproots people from British communities of which they are part.\r\nHere, \u2018refugees\u2019 includes those granted humanitarian protection.\r\nFor 'safe return review' policy see documents Asylum Policy Instruction Settlement Protection 4.0, 02.16; Refugee Leave 4.0, 03.17.",
        "background": "Refugees, recognised as needing protection, are granted 5 years\u2019 leave to remain. They can then apply for permanent residence \u2013 previously typically straightforward. New policy by default deports refugees at this stage if the home office deems it safe, removing their chance to rebuild their lives.",
