Taking into account the opinion of 3M EU citizens residing in UK, and most under-age British people who work, the result would be overturned. In the spirit of John Hampden, whose statue is in Westminster, since these people have no voice over state politics, they should not pay state taxes.",
        "background": "No taxation without representation. There are millions of people living, working, and paying taxes in the UK, but with no right to participate to politics at state level. Thus, they should not pay taxes at state level. Council taxes and National Insurance should still be paid.",
