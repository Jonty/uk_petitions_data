        "additional_details": "See the failed BT Superfast Roll Out \r\nSee BBC 3 (as its officially gone off-air to an online platform) \r\nLook at the statistics many families who do not have access to internet still have to pay a TV License fee which goes to the BBC\r\n\r\nIf the TV License fee was reduced that would free up capital for citizens to spend on other commodities and so could free up much needed money for the vunerable individuals and allow people to spend in other areas of the Economy and give the UK greater independance",
        "background": "BBC announced that BBC 3 will be taken offline due to restructuring, as a result this means everyone will be paying for a channel that is only available online. Now until superfast broadband is all over that leaves a large proportion of people unable to watch online tv and overpaying for a service",
