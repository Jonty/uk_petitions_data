        "additional_details": "After all of this, Britain is an ally of Israel but in reality it's just the government who supports Israel and not its people! After Britain supported Israel in the bloody 51 day war in the summer of 2014, the British were justifying it by saying the Palestinians were terrorists! Since then Israel has started a horrific blockade meaning resources to rebuild the region can't get into the Gaza Strip! I am calling on the UK government to change its stance on Israel and condemn its actions. ",
        "background": "Israel has pounded Gaza with airstrikes and artillery fire. We all saw the images of people fleeing for their lives as their homes and lives were ruined. Many lost loved ones. Over 2000 people died- more Palestinian children than Israeli soldiers. The war lasted just 51 days causing pain to many",
