        "additional_details": "I believe the UK Government should review & amend their terms as outlined in the Immigration Health Surcharge, to reimburse annual NHS contributions to working migrants.\r\nAs an NHS employee, I endorse the IHS but deem it unfair & dishonest towards legally working migrants who consequently pay their NHS tax two-fold. Reimbursements can be calculated p/a through HMRC via an individuals' NI number.\r\nThis petition has been started to prevent hard working, tax-paying migrants from feeling undervalued.",
