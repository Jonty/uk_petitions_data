That's why we allow petitions asking for a vote of no confidence in the Government or in individual Ministers. But the same wouldn't apply to all political parties.\r\n\r\nIf you are concerned about foreign aid, you might like to sign one of the petitions already open on the site on this subject.\r\n"
