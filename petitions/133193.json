        "action": "Make it an illegal offence for women to smoke/drink/use drugs whilst pregnant.",
        "additional_details": "Just like smoking and drinking, drugs have a major effect on a baby, the least of which is giving birth to a baby who is addicted to the drug. The consequences of using cocaine, for example, include heart attack, respiratory failure, strokes, and seizures, and all these life-threatening health problems can also be passed to an unborn baby.\r\n\r\nAll these products increase the risk of miscarriage, low birth weight, health complications and risks later in life, including mental health problems.",
        "background": "People know the risks of tobacco, alcohol and drugs, we all know the risks and dangers we're exposed to, we wouldn't dream of giving these to children, never mind newborn babies. So why do so many women continue to use these whilst pregnant? They are knowingly harming their unborn child.",
