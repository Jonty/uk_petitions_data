        "additional_details": "I have been on the kadcyla drug for over a year and have been very lucky too have it. As of november my oncologist will have to justify that the drug helps me to continue funding. What about all the men and women out there who have not had the opportunity to be given the life prolonging drugs they need and simply cant afford to go private. Do they derserve a death sentence or a shorter life when there are options here . I cant stand by and do nothing, I have to at least try. ",
        "background": "i have had an extra 3 years due to vital life prolonging drugs and made many memories with my children who at the time were 5 and 6. And now the cdf are  cutting life prolonging drugs, so for anyone newly diagnosed they will not be accessible and anyone already on the drugs have to prove there worth",
