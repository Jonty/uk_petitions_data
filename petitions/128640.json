        "action": "Ensure Knowsley students have the opportunity to take A-Levels",
        "additional_details": "The last school to offer A Levels in Knowsley, Halewood Academy, announced in April that they would not be offering A-Levels in the coming year. Knowsley is one of the most deprived boroughs in the country, and many families cannot afford to send children out of the borough to schools or sixth forms that offer A-Levels. This effectively bars children from going to top universities and studying certain subjects which require A-Levels, harming social mobility and hampering the dreams of many.",
        "background": "No school in the entire borough of Knowsley offers A-Levels, which are often required for top universities or courses such as Medicine, limiting opportunities for children in Knowsley. Most schools in the borough are academies, so change requires direct intervention by the Department of Education.",
