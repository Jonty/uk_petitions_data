        "action": "Greater devolution of powers to Greater London - like Scotland, NI and Wales",
        "additional_details": "Greater London is economically and socially distinct from England. We know this from recent polls and elections.\r\n\r\nAreas with smaller populations and economies (London's being larger than many European nations) have gained powers through devolution, e.g. the Northern Ireland Assembly, Scottish Parliament and National Assembly of Wales. They are responsible for areas such as infrastructure, health and education as these countries are best suited to make their own decisions within their borders.",
        "background": "Considering the size of London's population and the unique challenges it faces, London should have a similar say in these matters, with further powers devolved to the London Assembly and London given more control over its finances to focus on its own priorities. ",
