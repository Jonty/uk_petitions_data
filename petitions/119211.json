        "additional_details": "For example, on Monday my train was twenty five minutes late with no explanation as to why. Yesterday I was delayed by one hour forty minutes because of a fault at two different stations. This morning I was fifteen minutes late, again with no explanation as to  why. I have also experienced a number of occasions where trains no longer stop at the usual stations in an attempt to get themselves running back on time because they were delayed which hugely inconveniences the majority of customers.",
        "background": "I get the train into London everyday and experience delays every single day. Regardless of the daily inconveniences I see the train prices increase so that I know pay just under \u00a35,200 per year for my ticket. ",
