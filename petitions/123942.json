        "additional_details": "We think this is unfair as it goes against the body positive views that should be promoted towards teenaged girls. Are we supposed to believe that we are sexual objects therefore must cover up? This wouldn't be an issue discussed in a boys school for example if they were to wear shorts. Furthermore the female teachers at our school show their knees whilst telling us that we are not allowed to.",
        "background": "I attend a girls school and our skirts are required to cover our knees. We follow these rules in school but many people out of school roll their skirts.Teachers wait in town and take names of pupils who rolled their skirts which encourages us to believe that we will only be respected if we cover up.",
