It is unacceptable for taxpayers' money to be sent abroad whilst our own people suffer and the social infrastructure is on life-support. It is wrong, immoral and nothing less than a scandal. We know the spurious arguments for continuing with this obscenity but those arguments no longer stand up to scrutiny.",
