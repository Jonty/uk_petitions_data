        "additional_details": "On the 23rd of June 2016, the UK went to the polls to ask the most important question in a lifetime - should the UK leave or remain in the EU. \r\n\r\nThe result which came from this, was that we leave.  That is the will of the people and the Prime Minister has made it quite clear that the will of the people is to be respected.\r\n\r\nOthers are trying now to call for a 2nd referendum, to send us back to the polls.  This is not the right way to disagree with the result.  ",
