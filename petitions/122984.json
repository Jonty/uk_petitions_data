Moving parliament out of London would spread opportunity and enterprise. This would make Parliament feel more representative of all the nations and regions of the U.K.",
        "background": "Parliament needs more than \u00a35 billion of repairs. Rather than spend this money the building should be sold and parliament relocated to more suitable buildings in a city further north. There is plenty of good value brownfield land and greatbuildings too. ",
