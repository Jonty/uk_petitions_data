        "additional_details": "E.g. - Ravi Rajani on ITV's Lorraine (11/8/16) \r\nHe did not warn of the financial risk when booking travel separately. This is irresponsible coming so soon after the collapse of a holiday company with inadequate financial cover. A consumer champion should advise that the protection offered by the Package Travel, Package Holidays and Package Tours Regulations 1992 and Atol is far more important than saving pennies on the booking. ",
        "background": "Advice given by travel consumer experts in the media is always minimal. So much information is omitted that if anyone follows the advice they may suffer financial losses. The CPA 1987 should be amended to force these experts to explain what risks are involved in following their suggestions. ",
