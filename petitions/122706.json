        "action": "Introduce payment of the living wage to student nurses on placements.",
        "additional_details": "Current students are finding it difficult to cope financially, and the hours worked while on placement prohibit many from earning whilst studying. This financial issue is also a major problem in recruiting mature students into the profession. With the advent of the living wage, more mature students will be attracted to study, knowing that they can provide for themselves whilst doing so, and all students can focus their attention on their studies. ",
        "background": "Students nurses are working long hours and being used as free labour whilst our government has announced plans to scrap their bursary. Irrespective of the fate of the bursary (and with absolute certainty in the event of its loss), student nurses should be paid the living wage while studying. ",
