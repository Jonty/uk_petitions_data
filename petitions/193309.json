        "background": "Electrification of all UK rail infrastructure would allow diesel trains to be phased out. \r\nElectrification will reduce emissions in UK cities; huge diesel's run whilst sat in stations & emit whilst travelling. \r\ndiesel stock doesn't have effective  emission control and emits NOx and particles. \r\n",
