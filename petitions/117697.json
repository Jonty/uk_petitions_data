        "additional_details": "All criminals should be banned from ever claiming any compensation whilst behind bars.\r\nLaw firms are abusing their position by helping criminals through legal aid, just to line their own pockets. \r\nIf a criminal claims \u00a320k compensation from the tax payer the lawyer is claiming 4 times that amount, so it is not peanuts. A minor case could eventually cost in excess of \u00a3200,000 with court costs and legal fees.\r\nMiscarriages of Justice to be excluded.",
        "background": "Criminals who are behind bars for criminal offences, claiming compensation. This has to stop, so too does the legal aid system that allows this.\r\nThis should affect all criminals that are currently or previously being incarcerated. \r\n",
