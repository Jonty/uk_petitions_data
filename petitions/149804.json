If the remain campaign win two-thirds to one-third that ends it.\u201d\r\n\r\nAll the main claims of the Leave campaign have been shown to be false/misleading (see resources like the BBC 'More or Less' program) to a far greater extent than those of Remain.\r\n\r\nParliament should act responsibly and disregard a marginal referendum result caused by misinformation.",
