        "additional_details": "The Article 50 (Lisbon Treaty) notification is of prime importance. Once that has been issued a 2 year period commences. If at the end of that 2 year period no agreement has been reached with the other EU members the UK leaves the EU with no deal for access to the EU market. \r\n\r\nIt is therefore important that the people of the UK have a clear understanding and give approval in a General Election before this trigger event occurs. ",
        "background": "The recent referendum has decided that the UK should leave the EU. However, the terms upon which we leave and enter into a new relationship with the EU are not known. Accordingly, it is vital that the new Government seek a genuine mandate from the people prior to issuing the Article 50 notifiction. ",
