        "additional_details": "In the last 72 hours, Ed Sheeran has released tickets for his UK tour. These were sold as a pre-sale on Tuesday 31st January and Wednesday 1st February, followed by general release on Thursday 2nd February.\r\n\r\nMy wife tried on all three occasions to get tickets and was unsuccessful - that's par for the course.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are a number of sellers on eBay who are selling tickets for Ed's shows at four times face value. This is unacceptable and morally wrong.",
        "background": "In past years, there has been an increased demand for online ticketing for mainstream events. In a lot of instances - mostly music concerts - this has led to people buying multiple tickets to re-sell for profit. Thus depriving people genuinely looking to attend the event from getting tickets.",
