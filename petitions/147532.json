        "action": "Don't serve Article 50 notice to leave the EU until UK public vote on settlement",
        "additional_details": "During the referendum campaign voters were presented with various possible outcomes of leaving the EU. These included free trade agreements, border controls (restrictions on free movement) and increased spending on the NHS. Until negotiations with the EU are concluded it is not known which, if any, of these will be delivered. Support for independence from the EU may alter greatly depending upon which of the proposals can be delivered.  ",
        "background": "The UK public voted in favour of leaving the EU on the basis of conjecture rather than fact. Before such a significant change is made the UK public must have the opportunity to vote on the negotiated agreements with the EU. As notice under Article 50 is binding, such notice must not yet be served.",
