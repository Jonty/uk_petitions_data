        "additional_details": "Too many conflicts of interest surround MPs and their interest to privatize the NHS, The Royal Mail was sold at less than its worth, almost our entire infrastructure has been sold off like some crack addict looking for their next HIT, the list spanning 40 years is shameful and it must stop and stop NOW, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_privatizations#United_Kingdom\r\nPlease support this petition and fight to hold onto whats left of OUR infrastructure paid for from OUR taxes, Thank you.",
        "background": "As 4 year \"custodians\" of the UK they have no right to sell what is not theirs to sell, their job is to govern the UK for 4 years, if the governments only solution to fixing the UK is to sell it to the highest bidder, they are not fit for purpose, a window cleaner dosnt sell his ladders!",
