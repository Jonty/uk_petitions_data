        "additional_details": "A key issue for many who voted to leave the EU is unlimited migration of EU citizens into the UK. The issue of migration within the EU impacts countries beyond the UK and must be addressed by the EU as a whole to prevent further countries voting to leave.\r\n\r\nIf the UK were to leave the EU around half the UK population would still be left dissatisfied. By contrast, we believe that the UK remaining in a reformed EU could satisfy a significantly larger majority of the UK population.\r\n",
        "background": "We the undersigned call upon HM Government to refrain from invoking Article 50. Instead we call upon you to work with the other 27 EU members to find a solution to the issues associated with the free movement of people throughout the EU and, if necessary, to subsequently hold a second EU referendum.",
