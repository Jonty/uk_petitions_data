        "additional_details": "A new independent regulator is needed to ensure that higher minimum standards of truth are met in political advertising, with the power to ban misleading adverts and to ensure the facts and stats are true, correct and appropriate.\r\n\r\nIt should be considered that willfully misleading voters become a criminal offence and carry greater punishment than a petty fine. There must be more accountability for people in control of the messages that are given to the electorate.\r\n\r\nWe must do better for Britain.",
        "background": "We the undersigned call upon HM Government to create an independent authority to uphold standards of political advertising; make willfully misleading in political advertising a criminal offence; and investigate the Leave and Remain campaigns in the EU Referendum according to these standards.",
