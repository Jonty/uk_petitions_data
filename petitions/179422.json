        "additional_details": "I had to spend a week in hospital and nearly missed my babies 1st Christmas. \r\nI was told that in needed a D&C but they couldn't fit me in until the new year ...\r\nHowever the same day I'd seen the dr I began to hemorage and was taken to hospital via ambulance.  Had a D&C and blood transfusion - All because I had retained some placenta from the birth. This is so dangerous! We need to make a change - & also make women aware as so many don't have a clue & just go on & on bleeding with no real help. ",
        "background": "After having my baby I bled for 6 weeks. I was told \"it's normal for some people\". \r\nWELL it wasn't normal for me & I had a post partum hemorage. Which was terrifying!\r\nAll they need to do is offer women a scan at 3 or 4 weeks postpartum if the bleeding doesn't stop! It happens to too many women\r\n",
