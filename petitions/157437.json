        "action": "Make the Scottish Government responsible for Scottish immigration policy",
        "additional_details": "The immigration needs of Scotland are different to the demands of England. Enforcing the same immigration policy in both countries is illogical.\r\n\r\nIt will help Scotland's slow economic and population growth, and also some Tier 2 skilled workers who will otherwise be forced to leave the UK by the \u00a335k settlement threshold. Tier 2 workers unwanted by England will have the option to live, and be valued, in a nearby nation, where they can visit their loved ones regularly.\r\n",
        "background": "Scotland must develop and enact its own policy on non-EU migration. This may also enable Scotland to determine its own migration relationship with the EU.\r\n\r\nThe Scotland Act 1998 must be amended with an act of Parliament. Scottish Government must then create a responsible ministerial department.\r\n",
