        "action": "Repeal the VED legislation Changes coming into force in April 2017",
        "additional_details": "The new changes introduce the same basic charge on each subsequent year of ownership after the first year of ownership meaning if someone bought a 1 year old high polluting car they would pay the same tax as a 1 year old low polluting car removing the incentive to buy the economical car.\r\n\r\nA much fairer system would be to move all of the band thresholds down so the emissions target for \u00a30 VED is now 80g/km for example. And the 100g/km band now pays \u00a330 a year and so on. ",
        "background": "The proposed VED changes coming into force in April 2017 mean it is no longer an incentive to buy a low polluting car. ",
