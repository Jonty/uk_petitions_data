        "additional_details": "Thousands of railway stations and lines across the country were closed in 1965. A lot has changed since then. Anyone who's been on a train in rush hour knows they might not even get to sit down. There are already new train stations being built and those only cost \u00a310 million so we could build thousands of trains, stations and lines for less than the cost of HS-2.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/10249815/High-speed-rail-scheme-cost-to-double-to-80bn-economists-warn.html",
        "background": "HS-2 (High Speed 2) is going to cost \u00a380 billion, that's \u00a31248 per person, only 0.1% of us will use it and it won't be until 2033. It's meant to \"boost the North\" but there are much better ways of doing that.\r\n\r\nScrap HS-2. Instead get more trains running, open more stations and re-open old lines.",
