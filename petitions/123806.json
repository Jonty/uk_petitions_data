        "action": "Save the jobs of British Seafarers",
        "additional_details": "Yet another example of companies making unethical choices at the expense of their employees. Many countries such as Australia and Canada insist that shipping companies based within their country employ mainly local crew. Surely the British Government can follow this example by protecting British Seafarers and the British Merchant Navy, which are considered to be some of the best mariners in the world. We cannot allow yet another proud British industry to be destroyed just to save \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3s.",
        "background": "Over the last couple of years, and especially during the current oil crisis, a large number of British seafarers have been made redundant by British based companies, and replaced with cheaper, foreign crew. How does this support the UK economy?",
