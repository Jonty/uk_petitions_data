        "additional_details": "The UK is a free nation, and should stand up for what is right. Our government is failing us by refusing to object to Donald Trump's abhorrent actions. We must not let division, injustice, and prejudice go unopposed. I believe that we must challenge these actions for the safety and dignity of our country.",
        "background": "Within his first week, Donald Trump has turned the back of the world's richest country on these fleeing unimaginable horrors; has outright lied to the media of the world; and in an astonishing declaration, happily condoned torture. The UK Government should immediately condemn his presidency.",
