        "additional_details": "Recently two MPs resigned to take up other work: Tristram Hunt to become director of the Victoria and Albert Museum; and Jamie Reed to take up a post at Sellafield. With the news that George Osborne, serving MP for Tatton, has become editor of the Evening Standard yet has not resigned, the public needs clarity on which sectors outside parliament, if any, it is acceptable for serving MPs to work in, and what creates a conflict of interest between MPs' work for constituents and another employer?",
        "background": "Public confidence in politicians is threatened by MPs taking second jobs, especially where a clear conflict of interests exists, such as editing a newspaper. How can a serving MP adequately and objectively represent their constituents while they have a commitment to other work? We need clarity.",
