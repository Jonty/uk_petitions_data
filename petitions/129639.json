        "action": "Ban \"haul route\" traffic lights on the A21 between Tunbridge Wells and Tonbridge",
        "additional_details": "With these traffic lights in place a journey that normally takes 20 minutes can sometimes take over an hour. The constant cuing that results from these lights causes inconvenience, lateness, and in some cases car crashes. We feel that traffic conditions caused by these lights are dangerous and that having to get up almost an hour earlier for work/school (especially in the fast exam season), or getting home unessasarily late is unreasonable. ",
        "background": "Anyone who uses the A21 between Tonbridge and Tunbridge Wells knows that the road works to widen it are essential. However the \"haul route\" traffic light system is not, especially in rush hour times. The undersigned feel that the use of these temporary traffic lights should be banned in rush hour.",
