        "additional_details": "Former Prime Minister James Callaghan, when Home Secretary, closed this loophole in 1969 but the next Labour Home Secretary, Roy Jenkins, repealed the law in 1975. The Conservatives promised to end this concession in their 1979 election manifesto, but Mrs. Thatcher's Government did not keep its promise.",
        "background": "The obvious way to get round visa constraints of time and work is to find someone to marry. There is nothing to prevent a couple in a transnational marriage living in the husband's country. England is overcrowded and the UK has more young men than young women. This petition is for the common good.",
