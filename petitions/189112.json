The law accuses you of an offence which you haven't committed. Innocent until proven guilty is what we thought the law was supposed to be but in this case it is \"guilty until proven innocent\".Just think of the future implications of this law. What's next? Research this subject, this is an attack on human rights!",

This is a pre-crime prediction law which basically punishes people before they commit a crime! It's an insult to human rights!\r\n\r\n",
