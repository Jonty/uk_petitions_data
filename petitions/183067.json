        "additional_details": "The Government claim the backing of 65 million people in triggering  Article 50, which is an insult to all those that voted against, those not bothered either way, those ruled too young to participate, those that were disenfranchised because they were explicitly European, those that never vote because 'politicians are all the same', and those that voted for but have since changed their minds. If the WOTP can send us on an unknown future they can approve the final, concrete terms to leave the EU.",
        "background": "Article 50 has been triggered on the basis it is the will of the people after a campaign of lies, threats, inaccuracies and misunderstandings. In the interest of uniting a divided country, the will of the people should be sought through a referendum on the final concrete deal to leave the EU.",
