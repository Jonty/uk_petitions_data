        "action": "Transfer SouthEastern and Southern services to TfL from 2018 onwards",
        "additional_details": "Chris Grayling MP has rejected the Mayor of London's proposal to allow TfL to take full control over the failing Southern and SouthEastern franchises when they expire. The London Overground unit has a proven track record of improving punctuality, cleanliness, staffing levels and frequency. Profits are reinvested into the network meaning that services are run for the benefit of passengers. Chris Grayling made a mess of our prisons - we need to stop him doing the same to our transport.",
        "background": "This petition demands that management and accountability for London's failing Metro services is handed over to TfL and operated under London Overground. Starting with 2018 SouthEastern services to and from Dartford followed by Southern services and others as and when current franchises expire.",
