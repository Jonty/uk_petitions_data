        "additional_details": "Most people don't receive any effective help until they reach rock bottom and even then they are only offered 6 one hour longs sessions through the NHS. Six sessions is nowhere near enough to make any considerable difference to a serious mental health disorder. It is a very serious problem which needs to be addressed in a much more significant way.",
        "background": "1 in 3 people suffer from some sort of treatable mental health difficulty in their lives, yet it continues to be swept under the carpet. Therapy through GPs are so underfunded that the majority of patients aren't given anywhere near the amount of time needed to make a recovery.",
