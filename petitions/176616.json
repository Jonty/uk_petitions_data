        "additional_details": "I can provide photographs of cars parking outside on school markings, double yellows. I could even take video of road rage that happens every afternoon. The cars not stopping due to unmanned crossing. All around Heston there is so much development in progress from flats to another school but no infrastructure to go with it. We residents are not seeing any CCTV or proper timed crossings being put in place. Now council even wants to stop crossing patrols and wants to add further pressure on schools which are already struggling with budget cuts. These services are vital and should be council 's remit that's what we pay council tax for and should remain with them. Why should our kids education suffer any further. ",
        "background": "The consultation has been put into place and Local authorities are suggesting that it should be the responsibility of schools to fund and manage crossing patrols which is not acceptable, this is a vital service. ",
