Currently, a third of all mammal species in Indonesia are considered to be critically endangered as a consequence. Over 90% of orangutan habitat has been destroyed in the last 20 years and is considered \u201ca conservation emergency\u201d by the UN. An estimated 1000-5000 orangutans are killed each year for this development. More information can be found online. ",

As a start, we request \"Palm Oil Kills\" warnings (text & picture) covering 13% of front & back of packaging for products using unsustainable palm oil. ",
