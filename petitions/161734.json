How much longer can businesses carry on paying its drivers to sit on the port with no revenue coming in. How much longer can the owner operator continue to keep his head above water when he is sitting around for 4 or 5 hours a day. The port of Felixstowe management need to take their heads out of the sand and work with us not against us. Shipping lines can move, the Port Cannot",

It is a frequent event for drivers to find themselves sat in the port waiting to get a container for 3/4 hours,\r\n. ",
