        "additional_details": "Certain bureaucrats in Brussels have stated they want to \"punish\" Britain for voting to leave the EU, to deter other EU member countries from doing exactly the same. The idea of Britain agreeing to make any kind of \"punishment\" payment for leaving the EU is just ridiculous. We have no such agreement with them. There is no requirement, legal or otherwise, on Britain to pay them one penny to leave the EU. We are not giving them any more.",
        "background": "There is no requirement in any Treaty with the EU for Britain to pay anything to leave the bloc. Since 2000 alone, we have paid into the EU 100 billion euros MORE than we have received. Our Government must refuse to pay anything to the EU when Brexit is triggered or when Britain leaves the bloc.",
