        "additional_details": "It is NOT YET too late. However when clause 50 is invoked, it WILL be too late. Many of those who voted to leave the EU now regret their decision. Many used the referendum as a vehicle to register their protest against the political system, not really believing that the result we got was possible. The result was NOT \u201cclear\u201d: a two per cent swing would have changed the outcome. Many were mis-informed by those pursuing agendas which did not coincide with the best interests of the Country.",
        "background": "There is ample evidence that many who voted to leave the EU now regret their decision. The electorate were mis-informed and now they understand the consequences of a leave vote, they will wish to revise their decision. If we leave, it is forever. If we remain, there is the option to leave later.",
