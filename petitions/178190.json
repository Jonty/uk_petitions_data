On top of London\u2019s 1986 Big Bang deregulation, its repeal in 1999 led to the formation of the Too-Big-To-Fail banks. Restoring Glass-Steagall is non-partisan: 445 UK MPs and Lords from all parties voted for it in 2013; Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump campaigned for it in the 2016 US election. Pass Glass-Steagall, now!",
