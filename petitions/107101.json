        "additional_details": "There have been many stories in the newspapers and other media outlets of tragedies occurring in UK grooming salons. This is set to rise with the increase in popularity of the poodle mix breeds. These dogs take a huge amount of grooming and since their introduction there have been more and more unqualified and untrained groomers setting up shop, potentially putting our pets lives at risk. Most consumers don't know it's unregulated and don't know to ask for relevant experience or qualifications.",
        "background": "Pet grooming is a highly skilled profession. There are many dangerous tools in our trade that need proper training to use safely. Our pets don't have their own voice and most need regular trips to the groomers, whilst there, they deserve to be treated safely and with dignity and respect. ",
