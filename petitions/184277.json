        "action": "Employers to have mandatory training on hearing impairment & its implications",
        "additional_details": "Employers don't seem to fully understand the difficulties that people born hearing impaired have when it comes to processing information. Some comments I have received have shown naivety bordering on ignorance. It shocks me how uneducated employers seem to be on a impairment which affects more than 11 million people in the UK. That's one in six of the population. By 2035, it is estimated there will be 15.6 million people with hearing loss in the UK. That's one in five.",
        "background": "Most people assume people hearing impaired from birth are fine when they have a hearing aid/s. A hearing aid does not improve someones ability when it comes to processing information. I believe that specific training would be useful to employers in explaining the cognitive process that is required.",
