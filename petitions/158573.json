        "additional_details": "An article can change public opinion or misdirect understanding entirely.  Errors can be made innocently, however they can create equally as damaging results as dishonest statements.  Retractions may currently have too little effect, allowed to be published with minute size and not on the original page.  If you potentially sell a paper with a page 1 article you must equally account for that article if it is false or erroneous, avoiding potential abuse of power, or avoidance of due responsibility",
        "background": "Make it law that press retractions of articles on or listed from page 1 be published on page 1, proportional to the original article. This is to avoid misleading statements being made without sizeable, proportional accountability but is also to avoid simple errors not being corrected responsibly.",
