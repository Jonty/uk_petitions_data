        "action": "Regulate political campaign material and communications",
        "additional_details": "The Electoral Commission regulates a lot of the process around elections & voting, but there is currently no regulation from any body on political campaign materials and messages. I propose that the EC's remit is extended to regulate this as well. This would enable the voting public to execute their democratic right in a fully informed way. As to ask people to make an important choice on anything other than independently-verified facts & information runs the risk of destabilising our democracy.",
        "background": "In the most recent UK referendum on membership of the EU, campaign materials & messages on both sides contained gross mistruths, irregularities and exaggeration.\r\n\r\nCitizens must be able to rely on campaign messages which are clear, factual and informative so that we can submit fully informed votes",
