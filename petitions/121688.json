The averge earner would be out of a job. It is scandalous that we witness such perverse incentives! When Joleon Lescott is part of a relegated team losing 6-0 and posts Tweets of his new \u00a3125,000+ vehicle to his \"fans\" it is despicable. Social responsibility is long lost with selfish attitudes.",

Something needs to change and the government should consider caps on wages or a super tax.",
