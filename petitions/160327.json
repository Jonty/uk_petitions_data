        "action": "Allow London to remain in the EU. We didn't vote leave, we shouldn't be forced",
        "additional_details": "There's many examples as you may know, for example one is that London is the capital where many businesses run. If borders are put up it means companies will invest more money in things like trading and it could further decrease the amount of jobs available (and it is already expensive to live in London). London is the land of opportunity, diversity and youth. We voted for what's right for our future, which will be very different for others living in different areas. We know what's right for us.",
        "background": "It was almost 50/50 for us to leave the EU and we are already seeing the effect of leaving. It is unfair to remove London from the EU if we have voted to stay. London did not want to leave therefore it is fair to allow us to stay & our future lives shouldn't be determined by those who don't know us.",
