        "action": "Force the Government to trigger Article 50 as David Cameron promised.",
        "additional_details": "The triggering of Article 50 appears to be on hold to ensure the markets remain jittery so that the remain side can claim everything they predicted would happen, has happened, thereby hoping to justify calling another Referendum. The scare tactics failed to deliver the result the remain side wanted so until Article 50 is triggered, the debate goes on hoping that in the event of another Referendum the 17,410,742 people who voted leave can now be scared into voting remain.",
        "background": "David Cameron promised that he would trigger article 50 the day after the Referendum if the British public voted to leave the EU. Why has he not done it. Could it be that he is hoping that by leaving it for as long as possible the markets will collapse then he can say \"I told you so\"?",
