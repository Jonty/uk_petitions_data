It does not matter how much we spend trying to stop use of drugs it does not ease the problem it just makes it worse. Canada had a massive drug problem until they opened up safe centres for people to use and to get help. Portugal have stopped making drugs illegal and again the problems are being tackled, less death and crime. More Compassion4Progression",
        "background": "It is a fact the war on drugs is not working. People are dying without help or a chance to get help.  Glasgow has just  opened its doors on a Drug crisis centre. It helps people to handle and control their substance abuse, offers help guidance and rehabilitation to those who would like to get better",
