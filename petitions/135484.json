If the EU referendum had resulted in a remain vote coming out as the majority then the leave campaign would not get a 2nd referendum. Whatever the result for the referendum, the goalposts should not be moved because one side has lost.",

Calling a second EU referendum will further damage the government proving does not listen to the will of this country.
