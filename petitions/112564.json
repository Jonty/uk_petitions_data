        "action": "Liscenced civilians to carry stun guns for the protection of others in an attack",
        "additional_details": "Being in an attack situation where the attacker is armed with a weapon in a public place can be life threatening to all the victims involved. If a percentage of the population were trained and liscenced to use a stun gun in the event of an attack, the potential to save lives is massively increased. Stun guns dont kill, so do not bear the same dangers as a firearm which could even further endanger civilians. To sign this petition could one day save the lives of your loved ones or freinds.",
        "background": "There would be a stronger chance of minimising casualties in an attack situation if there was a liscencing system which involved a criminal background check, similar to that of a firearms certificate for civilians to carry a stun gun in public. Temporarily immobilising an attacker could save lives.",
