        "additional_details": "The conduct of an MP should be exemplary, and they should be accountable to the public they serve. An MP should also display competence within their role and command the confidence of the general public. By using her platform to publish such a thoughtless message undermines her role as Shadow Home Secretary. Her public display of ignorance of the dangers in Policing and equipment to mitigate everyday risks is akin to being unaware of the importance of a scalpel to a surgeon. ",
        "background": "On Thursday 09TH February 2017 at 14:52 hours Diane Abbott MP used her Twitter account to publish the following message \"No evidence that spit hoods are necessary or useful\" in response to an article regarding Police use of spit hoods. This message caused outrage that Ms Abbott failed to address. ",
