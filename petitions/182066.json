        "additional_details": "A recent documentary highlighted three cases, a woman from the Philipines who needed a quadruple heart bypass, a Turkish man in a similar situation and a woman who had fertility treatment abroad and after being refused entry to the USA, came to the U.K. and ran up a bill of over \u00a3300,000 at a London hospital. Three cases, almost \u00a31,000,000 which will never be repaid and could be better spent on staff, services and equipment to treat people who qualify.",
        "background": "The NHS is in danger of collapse. It cannot afford to treat people who come to the U.K. for healthcare and then refuse to pay for their treatment which often runs into hundreds of thousands of pounds. I believe that the country of origin should be held responsible and be made to pay.",
