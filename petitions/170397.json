        "additional_details": "A petition has recently been started to remove Scotland from the UK. I would like to personally apologise to the English people on behalf of Scotland. The SNP are trouble makers who will not rest until they have destroyed our United Kingdom. This petition asks that the UK government remove all powers from Scottish Parliament until a suitable leader can be elected who truly has the best interests of Scotland and the UK at heart. ",
        "background": "As a Scottish/British citizen I stand with the majority of Scottish voters who do not support another independence referendum. Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP are creating a huge divide in Scotland and casting Scottish/English relations back 700 years. ",
