        "additional_details": "The UK Government must make this a statutory requirement.\r\n\r\nExample case: \r\nMARY has building work done by JOHN. JOHN's email is compromised by fraudsters who send MARY payment request to be paid into an account who they say is under JOHNS name. MARY makes a bank transfer to the account and puts JOHN SMITH as Payee. Because the account number is correct the payment is accepted by the receiving bank. The actual account holder is JOE BLOG. Money is immediately withdrawn. The banks do not reimburse Mary.",
        "background": "Currently UK banks only check if the sort code and account number is correct before a transaction is authorised. This opens vulnerabilities for fraudsters to exploit the system. In some other countries, if the name does not match the account then the transaction is rejected. ",
