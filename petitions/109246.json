        "additional_details": "The heart attack victim during there stay in hospital can go and get a full English fried breakfast. The obese patient can walk into the hospital cafe and buy hot chocolate, crisps and a chocolate bar. These patients are fully allowed to do this, bit surely not in a hospital. We pay thousands for patients to get better but then counter act that by offering Unhealthy food in the very place we are trying to make them better. Sign the petition to help change this ever so obvious flaw. ",
        "background": "A hospital is where people go to get better or at least try to get better. When you think of hospitals the word \"health\" is always associated with them. So why would a hospital canteen/cafe/shop and dispensers  in Hospitals serve unhealthy food and beverages? It makes no sense. ",
