        "additional_details": "A Plebiscite is the mechanism by which Government seeks to consult with the electorate on a non constitutional matter. It is advisory and non binding. A Referendum must be the mechanism by which Government seeks a decision from the electorate on a constitutional matter and the result must be binding. It cannot be overturned based on turnout percentages or the number of votes by which the referendum is won.",
        "background": "Following the recent UK referendum and the attempts to overturn the result, it is vital that we make future referendums binding on the Government. Once this is adopted, any future changes to referendum rules that are passed cannot be applied retrospectively to earlier referendums.",
