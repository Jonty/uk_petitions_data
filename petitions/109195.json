        "action": "England should adopt a new national anthem, leaving the existing one for the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Since devolution, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales have all strengthened their individual national identities especially where anthems are concerned. At the present time England retains the UK's national anthem as its own and this is confusing given that God Save the Queen applies equally to the other nations. At the time of the next referendum, the English should be questioned as to whether they seek an alternative national anthem, such as the multi-denominational Jerusalem or another.",
        "background": "The nations of the UK all have their own anthems with the exception of England, which uses the UK / Royal anthem, God Save the Queen. This is divisive and creates issues when England meets other UK nations at events and fixtures. ",
