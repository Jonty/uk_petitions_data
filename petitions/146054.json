        "additional_details": "The British people were told, in the run up to the 'Brexit' referendum, that a key reason to leave the European Union was the undemocratic process by which the leaders of the EU are elected. Following the news of David Cameron's impending resignation, the new Prime Minister stands to be elected by a Conservative Party vote, the hypocrisy of which, I am sure, does not escape the populace. We demand the right to a general election, to practice the democracy which has apparently been reinstated.",
        "background": "Following Britain's referendum on EU membership, David Cameron has elected to stand down as party leader and Prime Minister. Without our fair say on the new leader of the country, the Leave campaign within the Conservative Party has led us to no more a democratic process than that which we had.",
