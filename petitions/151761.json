        "additional_details": "A second independence referendum is likely to cause more argument in Scotland and an even further split down the country, not just in Scotland, but between all the countries of the UK. This is a time of trying to bring us all together and so for the sake of peace around the island, don't allow a second independence referendum. Nicola must learn to accept when things don't go her way.",
        "background": "Scotland voted to remain in the UK in 2014 and by doing so, they agreed to accept the decisions made as the United Kingdom of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We are a union and one bloc. ",
