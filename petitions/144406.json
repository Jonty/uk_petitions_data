        "action": "We the undersigned want a referendum on exit and new trading terms with the EU.",
        "additional_details": "People voted to leave because:\r\n- Told \u00a3350m a week to go into the NHS from EU savings. If we have to pay for trading terms with the EU then this will not be the case\r\n\r\n- They wanted to stop free movement of people from EU. If this is not in the new terms, people who voted for leave on this basis will not be getting what they voted for\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n- The Scots are highly likely to want a referendum on being part of the UK and may leave. This would cause the break up of the UK. Not part of the vote!\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The exit and new trading terms must be put to a referendum, before Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon is implemented.\r\n\r\nThe referendum was so close (4%), no one knew what the terms of exit and new trade with the EU would be and we must have a vote on these before we formally activate leaving",
