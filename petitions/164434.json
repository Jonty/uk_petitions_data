Policy Editor, Oliver Wright wrote:\r\n\r\n\"The Tories are on course to win a 90 seat majority at the next General Election, aided by boundary changes that favour the party.\"\r\n\r\nResearch Electoral Calculus found \"planned alteration to the size and make up of constituencies would increase the Conservative majority from the current 12 seats to a comfortable 48 seat lead.\"\r\n\r\nThese boundary changes must not be implemented as they are politically disproportionate.",
        "background": "The proposed changes give an even greater advantage to the Conservatives. Had they been implemented for #GE2015 the Conservative majority would have been 48 seats and not just 12. Any change that affects one party so disproportionately must be rejected and the issue reworked. ",
