        "additional_details": "As a smoker trying to cut down I've found menthol cigarettes to be a stepping stone to cut down to around 5 cigarettes a day from around 30. With the withdrawal of menthol cigarettes people will turn to illegal ways to get hold of them. Crime and costs for the government will rocket. Also people won't have an effective way to stop so problems will get worse. Also cigarettes will be no longer sold in packs of ten so this will encourage harsher smoking and will cost more on the NHS. STOP THE BAN ",
        "background": "\r\nMenthol cigarettes are about to become illegal.\r\n\r\nUnder new tobacco laws, menthol flavour in cigarettes will be phased out over the next four years \u2013 ready for a complete ban on May 20, 2020.",
