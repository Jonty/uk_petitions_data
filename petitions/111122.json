        "action": "Reform the electoral system to achieve a more representative system.",
        "additional_details": "Two such options for a better system are mixed member proportional (MMP) or the single transferable vote (STV). Both still have local elections but would provide proportional representation.\r\n\r\nMany people support the alternative vote, which, although better than first past the post, would not necessarily give proportional representation due to discounting the votes of smaller parties. If we are to reform the electoral system it must be to a truly proportional system such as MMP or STV.",
        "background": "Our current electoral system uses first past the post (historical and unrepresentative) on the local level which determines the governing body on a state level.\r\n\r\nAs seen with our previous election this leads to disproportionate representation and as such should be amended by using a better system.",
