        "additional_details": "Motorway speed limits were originally designed in the days when vehicles could not break in time. We advocate raising the motorway limit to 80mph. Drivers travelling under 50mph impede the flow of traffic, cause a nuisance to other drivers and can cause vehicles to have to brake hard increasing the chance of an accident. ",
        "background": "We advocate raising the speed limit on motorways and dual carriage-ways from 70mph to 80mph and setting a minimum speed of 55mph to reduce impeding the flow of traffic and cause of sudden braking. ",
