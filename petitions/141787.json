        "additional_details": "The leave campaigners clearly mis lead and lied to the public. Mr Farage campaigned that we send \u00a3350 million a week to the EU. When actually we do not as we get weekly rebates and actually pay significantly less. It's purely hyperthetical as reported by Professor Ian Begg from the London School of Economics, and equates to approx \u00a3136 million a week 40% less than the leave campaign claimed! Clearly the British public have been lied to and given false facts.",
        "background": "Following the referendum I am utterly shocked at the way the British people have been lied/mis lead deliberately. If all the information that is now being shared was available for the voter to understand then maybe a different outcome would have been seen.",
