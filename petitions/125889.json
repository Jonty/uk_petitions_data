        "action": "Ban supermarkets from packaging fruits and vegetables",
        "additional_details": "Such a ban would:\r\n- Reduce pollution (lower packaging production, less resources spent on recycling, reduced methane emissions from landfill sites)\r\n- Reduce strain on recycling facilities thus stop the export of waste (67% of British plastic waste is exported to the far east)\r\n- Increase consumer choice by avoiding bundling and decrease food waste (15m tonnes in the UK)\r\n- Lower prices of food\r\n- Contribute to a long-term vision of a zero waste society",
        "background": "Climate change is the single biggest threat to society. In addition, contamination by plastics has become a major issue with research saying that by 2050 there could be more plastics in the ocean than fish. A small, positive step would be to stop supermarkets from packaging fruits and vegetables.",
