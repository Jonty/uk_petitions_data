        "additional_details": "The Prize?\r\nThe opportunity to have a direct say in the political process on a frequent basis.\r\nFrequency?\r\nQuarterly.\r\nContent?\r\nIssues of obvious current national importance and, potentially, issues gaining a sufficient number of petition signatures (>1m?)\r\nProcess?\r\nUse of existing polling stations. Ideally also via a secure online portal which was able to verify identity.\r\nOutcome?\r\nVotes would be legally binding as long as voter turnout was greater than 60%. A majority vote would carry.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Let's keep up momentum following reinvigorated voter turnout for the EU referendum and increase the electorate's involvement in the big decisions facing the UK. Direct Democracy would involve frequent referendums (quarterly?) on major national issues. Referendum outcomes would be legally binding.",
