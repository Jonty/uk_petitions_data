        "additional_details": "Evidence of a British-made bomb has been discovered in the aftermath of a bombing of a Yemeni ceramics factory, an attack that violates international humanitarian law. The UK should not support this through arms sales. By stopping the arms sales, we would be reducing deaths of Yemeni and Saudi Arabian people. ",
        "background": "The sale of arms to Saudi Arabia is a threat to our national security as it is an indirect way of supplying terrorist groups such as Islamic State. The Saudi Arabian government also use these arms in the bloody conflict in Yemen which we should not support. Stopping the sales would save many lives.",
