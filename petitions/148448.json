        "background": "We get it, Cameron messed up, Darling is *somewhere* and Labour are infighting (again).\r\n\r\nAs the EU want a quick exit, surely it makes sense to organise ASAP and get the best deal you can trade-wise and a special deal for Gibraltar, using speed and predictability as leverage?",
