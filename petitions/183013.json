        "additional_details": "Every year local councils spend an increasing amount of money implementing cycle paths and mixed used footpaths for the benefit of cyclists but still cyclists choose not to use them which puts themselves and others at significant risk of injury and or death.\r\nThis can be through either the narrowing of roads making passing more dangerous or impatient drivers becoming frustrated with being unable to safely pass a cyclist or following a cyclist up a hill on the road when a cycle path is provided.",
        "background": "With an increasing push for use of cycles in town paired with an increased number of schemes and road changes (funded by the taxpayer)  to make places more cycle friendly to the detriment of motor vehicle users it should be a legal requirement for cyclists to use cycle paths where provided.",
