        "additional_details": "There is a lot of information on the internet about products that use PMU  (pregnant mare's urine) and the overwhelming majority of articles say the PMU is not good for the human body and research into these products has discovered products containing PMU can cause dangerous side effects. Lots of articles have also highlighted the terrible living conditions, and cruelty, the mares are subjected to in order to obtain the urine. ",
        "background": "There are products in the UK that use pregnant mare's urine. One product is a brand of HRT that is being prescribed to women without them being informed that it uses urine. Alternatives to these products, predominantly using plants, have been developed so the use of urine is not necessary. ",
