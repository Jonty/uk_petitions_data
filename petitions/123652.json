        "additional_details": "All attempts to reduce cyclists injuries revolve around driver awareness - new cab design etc - nothing is done to improve cyclists' awareness. Often the first time cyclists realise they are in danger is when a vehicle hits them. Most drivers signal long before they turn however the signal lights are often out of the cyclists' field of view or they are distracted by hazards such as pedestrians and poor road surfaces. The line of shoulder level lights would attract the cyclists' attention.",
        "background": "Long vehicles play a disproportionate part in injuries to cyclists. Linking the subsidiary lights already along the length of long vehicles to its signalling system would give cyclists vital seconds warning to take avoiding action, so help save their own lives instead of having to rely on drivers.",
