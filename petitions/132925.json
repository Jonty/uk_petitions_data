        "additional_details": "Over \u00a3120bn of British properties are owned by offshore companies, who don't pay the same taxes as us to the government, and often don't occupy the housing they own. The Standard revealed investors had bought at least \u00a3100 billion of property in the capital using overseas companies. The Land Registry figures also show that in just one deal signed off by Boris Johnson in 2011, at Riverlight Quay in the Nine Elms regeneration area, 15% of the homes sold so far have been bought by foreign firms.",
        "background": " In a time that overpopulation and immigration are hot topics, we need to use the space we have to accommodate the people that make Britain great. In order for this to happen, we need to stop properties being able to be bought by anonymous foreign investors for their own economic gain.",
