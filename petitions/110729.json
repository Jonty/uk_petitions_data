        "action": "Allow more refugees and migrants from worldwide into the UK",
        "additional_details": "So many people have suffered. For example, the 5,800 who died on the Mediterranean Sea, travelling to Italy. The 2 Greek ferries in which rescued 61 people in the middle of the sea. The migrant who walked the 30 mile euro tunnel from Calais, France to Folkestone, England just to get arrested at the end. Lots of other countries have already started to accept migrants and refugees, even football teams are getting involved. My group and I think that everyone should also be getting involved.",
        "background": "My group at school believe that the UK should accept more refugees and migrants. We think this because we think it's unfair that so many people have to suffer when they've done nothing wrong. We also think that the UK is the perfect place to relocate these people and welcome them with open arms.",
