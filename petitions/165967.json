Civilian gallantry awards recognise bravery by people who have attempted to or saved the life of a British citizen who isn\u2019t a family member or close friend. Nominations are judged on:\r\n\r\nDegree of risk \r\nHow aware the nominee was of the danger \r\nPersistence\r\n\r\nWhether someone gets an honour - and the honour they get - is decided by an honours committee. The committee\u2019s decisions go to the Prime Minister and then to the Queen, who awards the honour. \r\n\r\nYou can find out more about the honours system here: https://www.gov.uk/honours\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about honours committees here: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/honours-committees \r\n\r\nWe only reject petitions that don\u2019t meet the petition standards."
