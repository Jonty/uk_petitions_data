This will cost the tax payer in year one at least \u00a351,870,000 ( https://www.mi5.gov.uk/careers/graduate-careers/benefits-for-graduates.aspx ) on salaries alone (no food, travel, computer costs included).\r\n\r\nIn 2010 the cost of handling a poll was \u00a384,600,000 ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24842147 ). The money should be spent on a vote in the first instance.",
