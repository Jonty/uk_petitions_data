        "action": "Abolish the UK Parliament online petition process and system.",
        "additional_details": "For example: MPs are now obliged to debate two petitions. One to prevent a state visit of the President of the USA, and one to support it. One of these got intense support on BBC News and Sky News on both 30th and 31st January 2017. Both have exceeded the 100,000 threshold but the implication that one view is more popular than the other is entirely media driven. The prevent petition has been 'advertised' on every loop for two days. This risks manipulation and abuse of parliamentary process. ",
        "background": "Online petitions are self selecting and give no scientific indication of popular support. Media will often take one side of an argument and promote a petition in line with their editorial view. They serve no democratic purpose and waste Parliament's time & money. MPs already represent our concerns.",
