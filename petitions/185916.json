        "action": "Ban the Operation of one person operated Trains (I.e. without a Guard/Conductor)",
        "additional_details": "Trains have had a Guard and Ticket Inspector for many years, the reason for this has been one of safety and general public well being. Many incidents and disputes happen on public transport and the public need someone to oversee this and someone to call upon for help.\r\nWould you hold a major league football match with only one security guard?\r\nOr an airplane with only the captain?\r\nThen why do this to our trains? It is a security risk. Please ban the practice and help settle the dispute.",
        "background": "There is currently a dispute between railway unions and operators over the proposal to operate trains single manned (without a guard/conductor)\r\nThis practice is not safe for the public, if a fight or assault happens there is no one to call on, likewise if there is a problem when departing a station",
