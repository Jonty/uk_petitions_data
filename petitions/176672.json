        "action": "Honour pension protections for nuclear workers.",
        "additional_details": "Pension protections were negotiated for workers in the nuclear sector to ensure privatisation succeeded. Employees kept to their commitment, Government should not renege on its part.\r\n\r\nIn arguing that pensions for nuclear workers should follow the same reforms as public sector workers, Government is guilty of cherry picking the detrimental changes it wants to apply while ignoring the improvements that those reforms would entail.\r\n\r\nGovernment has already achieved enough savings from these schemes.",
        "background": "When companies in the nuclear sector were privatised, employees were granted statutory pension protections. Now, after many years, the Government is using spurious excuses to justify proposals to override the protections and impose detrimental changes. \r\nThese proposals must be completely withdrawn.",
