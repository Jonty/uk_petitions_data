        "action": "Retract the invitation to Donald Trump to make an official visit to the UK",
        "additional_details": "A suspension on immigrants and refugees entering the USA from 7 predominantly Muslim countries has been brought into force. Mr Trump has verbally confirmed that Christians will be given priority in the USA's future immigration policies, thus emphasising that the new administration deems it acceptable to discriminate on the basis of religion. \r\nWithin living memory we have seen the greatest loss of life ever caused by any conflict instigated by a regime which implemented such policies.",
        "background": "Mr Trump has put into practice a policy that discriminates against Muslims living and wishing to travel and live within the USA. \r\nTheresa May is endorsing this policy and the view that it is acceptable to discriminate on the basis of religion by inviting Mr Trump to make a state visit to the UK.",
