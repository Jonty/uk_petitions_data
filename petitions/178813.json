        "additional_details": "The government is acting in a totally discriminating way. They are not charging this levy to academies or church 'Aided' schools but all church 'controlled' schools will have to pay. In two small villages next to each other this means one schools loses \u00a310,000 and the other doesn't. How fair is this when budgets are already tight? Fair funding has been an issue for years now and this is just making it worse. ",
        "background": "Schools which all fall under the Church of England umbrella are now being divided with some being charged the levy (5% of staffing budget) and some not; for no other reason than being either 'Aided' or 'Controlled'. Pure discrimination from a government who tells us to teach equality for all",
