        "additional_details": "We - the petition signers have grave concern in the use of certain medications which produce terrible side affects (some debilitating) which are not recognised by some GPs. Many hop from one med to the next. \r\n\r\nFor example the packaging of Cymbalta provides a lack of info on its safety and the difficulty of discontinuing the drug. Many have and do suffer severe withdrawal symptoms like 'brain zaps'. \r\n\r\nPlease review the use of these medications. \r\n\r\nBy doing so you will prevent further distress.",
        "background": "Adults and children are prescribed medication with a lack of follow up appointments and advice. \r\n\r\nChildren are slipping through the gaps and this compromises their recovery into adult life. \r\n\r\nThe use of medications have many withdrawal issues which need to be concidered for debate.",
