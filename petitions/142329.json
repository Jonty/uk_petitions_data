        "additional_details": "On 27 May 2016, the Treasury Select Committee concluded that voters were being provided with \u201cmisleading\u201d figures and \u201cimplausible assumptions\u201d (BBC). Nonetheless, misinformation continued throughout the campaign, including the repetition of claims that the Committee had criticised. After the referendum many voters have said they would have voted differently had they been presented with the facts and now feel they were deceived. Given the narrow result, the outcome may have been different.",
        "background": "Establish an independent inquiry to investigate the extent of misinformation during the EU referendum campaign and its impact on the outcome. \r\nThe crucial decision to remain in or to leave the EU placed a heavy responsibility on voters, who should have been provided with accurate information.",
