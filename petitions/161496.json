        "additional_details": "Please note that is not \"overriding\" democracy, but reasserting it. The legality of remaining is in no doubt as the referendum was advisory.\r\n\r\nI must regretfully, but logically, ask with all the kindness in the world that if you were ineligible to vote in the original referendum due to your lack of British citizenship that you please refrain from signing this petition. This is so that this petition may have the same mandate as the original referendum.\r\n17,410,743 or more signatories is the goal.",
        "background": "Should 17,410,743 or more people sign this petition, this will be a clear indication that, upon reflection, there is more public desire to remain in the EU than leave.",
