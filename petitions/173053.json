        "action": "Increase teachers' PPA time to 1 day per week to promote teachers' wellbeing.",
        "additional_details": "The HSE's Labour force survey, listed teaching with one of the highest rates of work-related stress, anxiety or depression. With the unmanageable workload and unsustainable lifestyle as contributing factors to teachers 'burning out' due to a non existent work/life balance. \r\n\r\nThe 2014-15 figures from the DfE show that teachers on average each took 7.6 days off for sickness. A total of 2.22 million days were lost to teachers\u2019 sickness absence. \r\n\r\nA full Friday of 'non-contact' PPA time would help teachers to manage workload prior to the weekend, so they could mentally and physically rest prior to the forthcoming week.\r\n",
        "background": "The DfE Teachers\u2019 workload survey 2013 shows Primary school teachers work almost 60 hrs a week. \r\n\r\nFull time teachers are contracted to 32.5 hours a week. Therefore, the U.K. education system is surviving only because of the additional 'goodwill' work teachers do!\r\n",
