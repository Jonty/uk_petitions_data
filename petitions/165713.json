        "additional_details": "From a social justice perspective, this particularly affects British people who are less likely to be from the upper, upper middle or ruling classes in the UK, more likely to teach English in South Korea, and therefore less likely to have any company pension in Korea. This places these particular British people, who often leave university with huge debts, at a further monetary disadvantage. Any loss to pension contributions will cause significant financial stress on them and their dependents. ",
        "background": "If a person works in South Korea for less than 10 years, their pensions contributions can never be cashed in. Thus, many years of contributions are lost. Also, the Korean government do not  consider  private teachers pension contributions as a part of the 10 years needed for a pension pay out. ",
