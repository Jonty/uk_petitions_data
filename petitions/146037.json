        "additional_details": "Quoted from ASA's website:\r\n\r\n\"The absence of consensus between the Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat Parties to bring political advertising wholly within the scope of the Code played its part in [...] the decision to exclude all of it.\"\r\n\r\nBecause politicians couldn't agree on advertising standards, there are no standards.\r\n\r\nWe deserve better.\r\n\r\nPolitical advertising is far more important than a misleading ad for cheap flights. \r\n\r\nWe believe politicians need to be held to account.",
        "background": "The EU Referendum featured misleading, and often untruthful, advertising. This led to both Remain and Leave sides obfuscating facts and truth. It became a propaganda battle, not political discourse. \r\n\r\nPolitical advertising should be held to the same standards as private advertising.",
