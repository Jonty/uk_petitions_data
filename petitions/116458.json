        "additional_details": "He has travelled in most places and there are no incidents of him. The Rihanna assault was dealt with earlier this year as his probation has finished and Rihanna lifted the restraining order years ago after the incident. She has even forgave him since then and him not being allowed in the UK is upsetting to him and his fans, especially since he hasn't performed here since 2009. He also has a young daughter who has truly changed the man and the way he thinks, therefore should be allowed entry.",
        "background": "Chris Brown has been banned since 2009 from entering the UK, him and his fans want his ban lifted as he then cannot perform any concerts here. He isn't a 'threat' to the public and since 2009 his reason of ban has been sorted and he has had a child. He has a right to come to the U.K.",
