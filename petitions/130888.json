        "action": "Turn Luton into the cannabis capital of the world.",
        "additional_details": "This was we can use the huge amounts of profits we will see from Luton to further benefit our poorer parts of the country. Rest assured that the majority of people will still be able to stay away from the drug as it would be confined to coffee shops in Luton. This will be a haven for pot smokers knowing that our government is keeping up with the times and wont have to travel to another country to better their economy with our hard earned cash. A big tourist market for a city with an airport.",
        "background": "Cannabis, hardly even worth being called a drug. Its ridiculous to find that possesion of a plant can land you jail time or at least a trip to the police station. My proposition is that we turn Luton into a city similar to Amsterdam while keeping the drug illegal for sale in the rest of the country.",
