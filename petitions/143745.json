        "additional_details": "On June the 23rd the democratic decision was made to leave the EU, leave marginally won with 51.9% to 48.1% majority vote. \r\n\r\nRegardless of your personal opinion on this issue, it was a massive win for democracy.  \r\n\r\nNow it looks like that democracy is under threat with petitions of re-referendums and government scaremongering in support. \r\n\r\nI would like to firmly propose that if our ANY democratic decisions are NOT upheld for a period of 2 years we will reform our government anyway necessary.",
        "background": "We the undersigned declare that if the democratic decision to leave the EU is not respected and a second referendum is held, that we will use our democratic powers to reform our government any way necessary.\r\n\r\nThe United Kingdom is a democracy and whether right or wrong the people have spoken.",
