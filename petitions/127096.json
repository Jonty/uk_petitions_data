The Act states that it is sex discrimination to treat a woman less favourably because she is breastfeeding. The Act applies to anyone providing services, benefits, facilities and premises to the public.\r\n\r\nIf you would like Parliament to change to the law, to provide additional protection for women who are breastfeeding, you could start a new petition calling clearly for the specific change you want. You'll need to give your full name to start a petition."
