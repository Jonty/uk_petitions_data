        "additional_details": "Program trials in Durham and Newham from 2009 to 2011 saw significant results with a big fall in consumption of unhealthy foods and a big increase in consumption of fruit and vegetables.\r\n\r\nThe academic results were astonishing with children in the pilot areas moving ahead of their peers by almost a term.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the program was rolled out across the country and is having continued excellent results.\r\n\r\nOver the longer term scrapping the scheme will prove to be financially counter-productive.",
        "background": "The government is considering scrapping the free school meal program.\r\n\r\nPositive benefits from this program include significant academic & behavioural improvements along with a big increase in consumption of healthy food with better behaviour, cohesion, and school moral helping all pupils.",
