        "additional_details": "In January 2016 Parliament debated a petition calling for Donald Trump to be banned from visiting the UK. Many inside and outside Parliament did not support such a total ban, on grounds of free speech. We recognise that the UK needs to maintain a working relationship with President Trump as head of the US government, but that relationship should not be dignified with a State Visit.",
        "background": "In January 2016 586,930 people petitioned that Donald Trump should be banned from entry to the UK. Now President Donald Trump has been invited for a State Visit. This invitation should be withdrawn to show this racist, misogynist man that he does not enjoy the friendship of the British people.",
