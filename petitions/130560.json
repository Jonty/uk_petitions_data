        "action": "Establish that a child has a default right to equal contact with both parents.",
        "additional_details": "Right now there are people deliberately denying their ex-partners from having contact with their children, simply to be vindictive, or to be manipulative, or in order to establish a 'status quo'.\r\nCourt orders take too long to acquire; and without them, a Non Resident Parent is powerless. \r\nThis petition asks that the government prevents harm, by determining that every child, who is not at risk, has the automatic right to equal contact with both parents at the point of a relationship breakdown.\r\n",
        "background": "Where there is no evidence to suggest that a child should be subject to a protection enquiry in accordance with s47 (1) of the Children Act 1989, the law should detail and confirm that every child has an automatic right to 50/50 contact with both their mother and father.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
