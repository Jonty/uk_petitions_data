This is a once in a generation, and potentially a once in a lifetime decision. \r\nThe BBC states that the minimum amount of time it would take for the UK to remove itself from the EU  \"would be two years\". If the decision is to leave, by the time Britain has actually left, 16 year olds will be 18, but will have had no say in the outcome of the vote. \r\nThese people will have to deal with the outcome of staying or leaving; why should they not have a say.",
