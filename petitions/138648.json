        "additional_details": "On 23rd June 2016 the British public voted to leave the EU with a 4% majority. The people had their chance to vote. Those who do not like the decision made are seeking to upturn the decision through another referendum. Does this mean that if the Remain vote was to win next time that we would have to have a third referendum (best out of three) ?\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "In light of the fact that a petition has been started to seek a second referendum, despite the mandate of the masses voting to leave the EU. I wish to counter this move. The Prime Minister stated there would be no going back. A second referendum would be a waste of public money and time.",
