        "action": "Provide much needed Truck Stops across the UK with modern facilities.",
        "additional_details": "Already there is inadequate space for HGV's to park up on their rest times.With the volume of vehicles forever increasing on all roads across the UK, this situation will only get worse.Many HGV drivers experience theft of cargo and fuel, even at well known Service Stations.Current services have not grown with the increase of freight on the road, and often have very poor and neglected facilities.Truck drivers are on the road for many days at a time ,they deserve to have decent working facilities.",
        "background": "The Haulage Industry carries valuable cargo. The UK in general needs more dedicated Truck Stops with advanced facilities e.g CCTV, shower blocks, healthy food outlets.Laybys have no facilities and are a last resort. Without HGV's our shops would be empty. Drivers deserve a safe secure resting place.",
