        "action": "Remove all subsidies for fossil fuels, use them to subsidise renewable energy.",
        "additional_details": "Subsidies for fossil fuels which approach \u00a36 billion a year are being given to companies which generate profits in the hundreds of millions. That money is far better used to subsidies to production and implementation of renewable energies or to subsidies the household energy bills. There is an estimated 26.7 million households in the UK, the money could be used to decrease the annual energy bill by \u00a3224. Stop giving to the rich, start giving to the people.",
        "background": "It's impossible for the government to simultaneously state their commitment to combating climate change and subsidise fossil fuels to the extent that they do. The amount of money spent on renewable energy is meanwhile decreasing. Spending more on renewable's is the only way to show real commitment. ",
