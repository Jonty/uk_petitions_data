        "action": "Re-evaluate the laws surrounding dog attacks on horses and their riders",
        "additional_details": "The police informed the riders that no criminal offence had been committed, as it was deemed that the dog was not behaving dangerously before it attacked, and that there was no way of knowing if the dog intended to bite the rider - making it impossible to determine if this was an animal on animal attack or an animal on human attack. This petition aims to bring attention to the need to tighten the laws surrounding dog attacks on horses to lessen the ambiguity surrounding animal on animal attacks\r\n",
        "background": "On the 15th of February 2017 two horses and a rider were viciously attacked by a Staffordshire Bull Terrier, causing one of the horses to undergo 6.5 hours of veterinary attention due to the severity of its wounds. \r\nOne rider was also bitten, casing deep muscle damage to her right calf.
