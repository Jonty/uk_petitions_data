Nigel Farage was on the programme and the question was addressed to Mr Farage by TV Presenter (Tom Bradby) \"Did you get an invite to the debate?\"\r\nMr Farage replied to the question with a NO! \r\nI would expect (Tony Hall) General Director for the BBC to invite MR NIGEL FARAGE to all the EU referendum Debates live on BBC.",
