        "additional_details": "These adverts are not forcing anyone to do anything against their own free will and there has been a complete double standards with the 'Big is  Beautiful' campaigns. Just as they do not promote obesity, these fitness models do not promote 'unrealistic' bodies of women and men at an unhealthily underweight physique. It seems that there is a greater acceptance to promote a heavier physique rather than attempting to curb the increasingly growing overweight population. This is ultimately wrong.",
        "background": "The upcoming ban on adverts depicting women and men in a healthy shape sets a dangerous precedent for the future for free rights of advertising. The women on the Tube is not of an unhealthy weight, the agency is simply using it as a way of promoting their product.",
