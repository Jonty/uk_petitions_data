I had to arrange for a GP to come (during his afternoon off) to teach the primary school staff about anaphylactic shock. Schools, children's clubs, colleges, universities and other public places should have EpiPens (or the equivalent) as they have defibrillators. The lack of knowledge about what anaphylaxis is and how to save a life is frightening. The availability of EpiPens (or the equivalent) WILL save lives. ",
