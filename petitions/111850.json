        "action": "Ban the sale of loud fireworks to the public",
        "additional_details": "Fireworks that create a loud bang are entirely unnecessary. This petition does not call for the complete ban on fireworks, but for on any that cause loud noises, and especially of those sold to the general public.\r\nWhen I was younger, my family set off fireworks in our own back garden: however, we used ground based fountains, Catherine wheels and sparklers. This did not diminish my enjoyment of Bonfire night.",
        "background": "For the last two weeks, my area has been inundated with people setting off loud fireworks. As a dog owner I have to completely alter my daily routine in order to support my pet.\r\nNot only this, I have reports from friends who work in the care system how loud 'banger' fire workers terrify the elderly",
