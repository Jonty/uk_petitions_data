        "additional_details": "Many Leave voters are worried that they will not get what was promised. Some campaign pledges, notably \u00a3350 million a week being given to the NHS have now been dropped. The deal could keep free movement, which many Leave voters thought would end.\r\n\r\nMany Remain voters can't accept the result as they worry voters weren't properly informed, \r\n\r\nA vote on the final deal will help both sides accept the decision. The choice should be to accept or reject the deal. If rejected, the UK would stay in the EU",
        "background": "The UK voted to leave the European Union, but voters chose without knowing all the details. The government has a mandate to negotiate a Brexit deal. The British people should have the final say on what the government and EU agree.",
