This meant little then, but, subsequent life experience has lead one to conclude that our characteristics are incompatible - nature does not fit in with nurture.\r\nAdoption like Marriage be an entirely artificial construction, but, unlike Marriage - Adoption cannot be cancelled (annuled) by law - this is an unacceptable legal oversight.\r\n",
