        "additional_details": "There have been many examples during this current parliament where MP's have jeered at each other.  There have also been examples where members private bills have not been given the opportunity for discussion and voting due to filibustering, this has impacted on the lives of people who expect their MP's to represent their needs i.e. hospital car parking fees.",
        "background": "Members of Parliament are representative of their constituents.  In any other line of work, the behaviour (i.e. jeering, filibustering) seen in the house of commons would be considered unprofessional and discourteous.  Filibustering in particular is undemocratic and undermines democracy.",
