        "additional_details": "Mr Farage's highly publicised role in Mr Trump's campaign and his subsequent audience with the president elect is very strong evidence of a potentially close working relationship between the Uk and the US at a time that the Uk needs very quickly additional trade deals to counter the threats coming from a wounded EU.",
        "background": "Nigel Farages' pivotal role in \"EU vote leave\" has brought him worldwide recognition and respect. His wealth of experience in Uk politics and the inner workings of the EU together with his close relationship with the president elect make him a perfect choice for the role of Ambassador to the US",
