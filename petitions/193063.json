        "additional_details": "Elected representatives should vote according to the wishes of their constituents and not party policy dictats nor their consciences. Neither should their careers suffer as a result. The use of force to achieve the aim of a few is a corruption of true democracy. It is my belief that HS2 is an example of this where I have reasonable anecdotal evidence of this. It is my belief that if parties or governments need whipping to secure policies then the policy probably runs against the people's wishes.",
