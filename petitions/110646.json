        "additional_details": "NCBI reports that over 50% of traffic deaths occur after dark (despite less driving at this time). Govt stats show that 60% of road casualties are on country roads often where the national speed limit is in place. Reduced visibility when driving in the dark & extra hazards like animals are two big causes. We can reduce the impact on human lives in terms of injuries, deaths & financial/emotional cost if we simply drive more slowly, and in doing so, show greater respect to wildlife too. ",
        "background": "No-one likes to be driving & find animals sprawled dead, often in a gruesome way, along the road. When it's dark, we should all reduce our driving speed significantly. We are told this when learning to drive. The law needs to send this message. This will reduce human casualties & costs too.",
