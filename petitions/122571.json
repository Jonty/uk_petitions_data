        "additional_details": "http://bit.ly/1RtqB4L\r\nAlmost every child goes to school, it is a place where professionals can share awareness and prevention education that will not only gently encourage the hundreds of thousands of children suffering in silence to receive vital intervention but also make children aware of the dangers of being groomed.\r\nA different strategy needs to be adopted to ensure a different outcome. It is shocking that in 2016 children are still vulnerable in this way.\r\n",
        "background": "Only 1 in 8 children who are sexually abused in the UK are identified by professionals.  It is estimated that as many as 450,000 children were abused over the same period of this study, but only 1 in 8 received the vital intervention needed to keep them safe and help to overcome their experiences\r\n",
