        "additional_details": "Children can be taken away on school-organised holidays, during term time; so why can parents not do then same?\r\n\r\nThe government needs to understand that parents take their children out of school for holidays not because they want too; it's because they cannot afford the drastically increased costs of out-of-term breaks.\r\n\r\nSupport should be provided because of this; by either authorising a reasonable absence percentage, or preventing travel companies from abusing the system for their own profits.",
        "background": "The cost of taking a holiday out-of-term time is considerably more expensive than during the school-term itself.\r\n\r\nOur government insists that education is vital to a child's development, but is happy to allow travel companies to profit by utilising this requirement to their financial advantage.",
