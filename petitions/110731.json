        "additional_details": "One example of this would be the resale of tickets to see 5 Seconds of Summer at the O2 in April, for 1 floor standing ticket, the price asked was \u00a3990.\r\nAnother example is to see One Direction in Sheffield on the 31st October, for 2 tickets, the prices reached a disgusting price of \u00a32750.",
        "background": "Recently it has come to my attention that resale tickets to concerts have been reaching extraordinary prices and not everyone has the money to spare, I would like to put a stop to this as it is morally wrong to charge someone \u00a3400-\u00a3900 for a \u00a330-\u00a360 ticket.
