        "additional_details": "Under his reign we have lost confidence in the system, been sent into war, had our education put on hold and have had major economic stalls. He does not listen and he seems to not care.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.greenbenchesuk.com/2015/01/100-biggest-failures-of-david-camerons.html\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence\r\n\r\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/spending-review-2015-government-betrays-a-generation-of-students-by-secretly-backtracking-on-a-2012-a6748801.html",
        "background": "David Cameron is leading britain to a national mockery and creating an image of parliament to the public which is: untrusting, uncaring and liars. \r\n\r\nHe is therefore a danger to parliament and also the UK population and should be removed by a 'motion of no confidence' to prevent further harm.",
