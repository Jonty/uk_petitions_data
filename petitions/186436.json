        "action": "Do not increase taxes on schools and establishments fitted with solar panels.",
        "additional_details": "If schools and other establishments are to be punished for using solar panels while huge tax breaks and tax exemptions are afforded to the super rich and polluting industries, then the government is failing in its duty to work for the benefit of society as a whole. I cannot see how we could arrive at any other conclusion. Such a stance renders a government unfit for purpose.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Tax increases on certain industries serve to both raise revenue and limit consumption. This is justified in industries that can harm society such as tobacco and alcohol and gambling etc. There  is no such justification for increases in taxes on the use of solar panels.\r\n\r\n",
