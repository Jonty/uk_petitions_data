Reg 4 of CAR 2012\r\n\r\nYet many reports 'go missing', are unavailable or do NOT exist. They should be lodged like EPC's. This would ensure safety at all levels of work; that asbestos found IS being managed by providing an easier, faster way of checking. Ensuring instant access to the most up to date report.\r\n",

Twice as many than killed on our roads.",
