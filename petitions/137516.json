        "additional_details": "After a mock referendum at school, there was a landslide vote for remain- 71% vs 29% (despite living in a leave borough). My fellow students clearly knew their own minds on the matter! Around 8% of the population is aged 13-17, if half of these voted, that would add an extra 2.5 million votes! Based on my schools referendum, around 70% would vote remain, that's an extra 1.75 million votes for remain. These extra votes could be enough for the country to stay as part of the EU",
        "background": "After the result of the EU referendum, many young people are very disappointed with the outcome. The majority of those aged 65+ have made a decision that will only affect them for on average 16 years. For those under the legal voting age, we have to live with a decision made for us for over 75 years",
