If the mother removes the fathers time with his children the onus is on the father to take the mother to court to have his time reinstated which is often a long and expensive process. The law should change to protect the child's time with their father. The mother should have to file court papers within 48 hours of removing access or face a minimum penalty. \r\n\r\n",
