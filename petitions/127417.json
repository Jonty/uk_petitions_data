        "additional_details": "Kidbrooke Village Major Redevelopment, vast increase in residential density, no modern transport links. Lewisham undergoing massive regeneration with high density residential towers and new shopping areas. South East London has been neglected by TFL for many years and focus needs to be given on improving public transport services and delivering fast high capacity travel to major business and financial zones in the city. This will encourage more growth and housing development in SE London. ",
        "background": "Proposal to extend the Jubilee Line from North Greenwich O2 to Kidbrooke Village to Lewisham to Greenwich then to Canada Square and Canary Wharf. This will link all the major new residential high density developments to key business districts reducing travel times, traffic and pollution. ",
