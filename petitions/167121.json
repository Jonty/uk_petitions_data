        "additional_details": "The parents who want their child to study in grammar schools need to go through lot of struggles now.  House prices in grammar school catchment area is very high. As the population grows, demand for grammar schools among low and middle class families increased many folds. Allowing more grammar schools would only provide more choices to the parents and help social mobility. A blanket ban would cause more pressure to many hard working parents who wants to provide quality education.\r\n \r\n",

But there are only about 300 to 400 places in the grammar schools in Warwickshire.  Please allow more and do not ban outright on the grounds of social mobility. ",
