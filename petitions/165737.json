        "action": "Create legislation for the compulsory micro-chipping of domestic pet cats",
        "additional_details": "In April 2016, legislation came into force which states all domestic dogs must be chipped. Cats are at far greater risk of becoming lost or injured on the road.\r\nIt is imperative that something is done for the thousands of stray & feral cats on the streets of the UK. Micro-chipping is the first step. Any cat found that is not chipped and un-neutered can then be taken to be neutered, and put up for re-homing, or if feral, returned to a managed colony.\r\n",
        "background": "As a cat rescuer I been called out to rescue 15 cats and kittens from a single street in Crewe in 2 months. The cats have no microchips, are severely malnourished, are diseased and un-neutered. Without a microchip, there is little to no chance of ever reuniting these animals with their owners.  \r\n",
