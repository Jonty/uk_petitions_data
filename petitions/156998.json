        "additional_details": "We feel betrayed by the numerous lies told by Gove and Johnson during the referendum campaign, which were used to win votes for the betterment of their own personal agendas. We are pleased Johnson has now withdrawn from the leadership race - removing the need to add his name to this public vote of no confidence petition.\r\n\r\nWe call upon HM Government to carry out a debate, with the aim of carrying forward the will of the British people, who believe their positions in parliament to be untenable.",
        "background": "We the undersigned want to present a public vote of no confidence in Michael Gove as a conservative leadership candidate. We feel this candidate lacks the credibility and ministerial qualities that will be necessary for taking on the role of PM of the U.K.",
