Firstly, I would like to see it made a legal requirement for buildings with parking spaces to provide disabled slots.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I would like to see it made an offence to park in a disabled space without the appropriate authority - e.g. a blue badge for instance.",
        "background": "While there are disabled bays provided at most buildings with parking, there is no legal requirement to provide them. The spaces are often abused; disabled drivers can very often not get parked in a bay with the space they need to get in and out, and which is close to the entrance.",
