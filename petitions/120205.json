        "additional_details": "People addicted to the medication do not cause problems for society, they do not steal property, mug people or cause the police service any problems at all. This is because the medication is very cheap, easy to get hold of and legal to have. People caught in the grip of addiction live on a day to day basis always needing to know they are able to get their fix, their lives are lived under dark clouds with often no help being offered to get away from it as it is not seen as a problem. ",
        "background": "In the last few years there has been an increase in the number of people becoming addicted to OTC pain medication. This medication is a legal form of morphine and causes as many problems for people addicted to it as illegal class a and b drugs. ",
