        "additional_details": "Failing to take the opportunity to investigate UK bridge heights in light of the evidence produced by Transport for London is tantamount to turning a blind eye to the health and safety of HGV/PSV/Network Rail drivers and any member of the general public unfortunate to be involved. The UK Government must implement an \u201cImmediate nationwide pro-active investigation of all bridges under 5.03m\u201d. Waiting or hoping vehicles will not strike a bridge is placing lives at risk, plain and simple.\r\n",
        "background": "Avoidable Bridge Strikes are putting HGV/PSV drivers lives and livelihoods and that of their passengers and employers at risk every day, retrospective investigations of bridge strikes by TfL identified 3 Network Rail bridges in London displaying signage that overstated the height of the bridge.",
