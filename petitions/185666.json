The Equality Act 2010 states that it is illegal to discriminate against anyone because they belong to a religion or hold a particular belief. In addition, under the European Convention on Human Rights, everyone has a right to manifest their religion or belief, which includes the right to wear clothing or symbols associated with their religion or belief unless doing so interferes with their work.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more at: \r\nhttps://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/advice-and-guidance/religion-or-belief-discrimination"
