        "additional_details": "Currently a years permit is \u00a3540, which is already seen as a high price, and as of next year will be \u00a3630. The price to pay daily is currently \u00a32.40 and as of next year will be \u00a32.80. This is a substantial amount for both full time workers and part time workers and will become a struggle for many to pay which is why it needs to be reduced. ",
        "background": "Over the recent years the price of employee permits have risen, despite the rise in price the council has nothing to show by this i.e. Still not enough available spaces, no improvements on the roads, derelict spaces etc.",
