        "action": "Allow blood transfusion recipients to donate blood and bone marrow",
        "additional_details": "At the time of the ban, 1 transfusion recipient was suspected, not proved,  of developing vCJD due to donor blood contamination. An estimated 52,000 people were prevented from donating by the ban. At a time when blood and bone marrow donors are dangerously low, it is patently ridiculous to deny life-saving supplies based on the tiny chance of recipients developing CJD decades later. Either the ban should be lifted, or at risk donors should  assessed on a case by case basis.",
        "background": "Currently, those who have received a blood transfusion since January 1980 are not permitted to donate blood or bone marrow, due to fears of vCJD transmission.",
