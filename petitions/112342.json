        "additional_details": "Since 2010, more than 10,000 jobs have been cut from the department and 250 offices have closed, plus the network of 281 walk-in tax enquiry centres. The public accounts committee criticised HMRC's \"woefully inadequate\" efforts to tackle tax evasione and said they feared the telephone helpline service was so bad it was \"having an adverse impact on the collection of tax revenues\". With so few sites planned to remain, the livelihoods of thousands of employees are being needlessly put at risk.",
        "background": "HM Revenue & Customs has announced its intent to close all 170 offices around the country and replace them with 13 regional centres and 4 specialist sites. The office closures will leave hundreds of staff facing redundancy and decimate local communities where HMRC is the major employer.",
