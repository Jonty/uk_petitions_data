        "additional_details": "The acquisition will in fact be paid for by Tesco/Booker combined Supplier base. Supply contracts will be re-negotiated, suppliers will have no choice but to reduce their margins (or lose their contracts). Margin cuts will be made by reducing head-counts, potentially reducing product ingredient quality, pack sizes and potentially the quality of food produced in the UK will suffer. New food products will find it harder to achieve a route-to-market. In the end, there will be less choice. ",
        "background": "Tesco's acquisition of Booker will remove thousands of jobs from the UK food supply chain. No company will be unaffected; Tesco and Booker themselves; suppliers of food, logistics, and suppliers to these suppliers; packaging, food ingredient, transport. Supplier margins will erode, jobs will go.",
