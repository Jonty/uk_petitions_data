        "action": "Include school trips within 'childcare,' allowing payment by childcare vouchers",
        "additional_details": "Whilst childcare - under the 2006 childcare act - excludes care given during the school hours. I argue that residential trips, domestic or international, are beyond the remit of school care so should be categorised as 'qualifying care' and eligible for payment via voucher.",
        "background": "Childcare vouchers save working parents up to \u00a3935 each. At present, vouchers can be used for anything deemed as 'qualifying care,' however school trips do not currently fit within that criteria. Making it easier for parents to afford these expenses will allow more children access to these trips.",
