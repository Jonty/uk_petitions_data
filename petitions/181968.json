        "additional_details": "He is to jazz and soul what the late, great John Peel was to punk rock and electronica. \r\n\r\nSince deciding to stop recording the series, his fans have been lost in the musical wilderness with no shepherd to guide us.\r\n\r\nWith the terror of Brexit uncertainty and the rise of fascist nationalism rearing its ugly head across the pond, now more than ever we need a hero to remind us that the world is also full of magic, wonder, beauty and hope and we need to unite under positive, healing music to fight it",
        "background": "Kev Beadle has been one of the UK's finest musical selectors and collectors for decades. His weekly Mind Fluid show and podcast became a reference point for music fans the length and breadth of these islands as well as much further afield.",
