I find this worrying that a company 1) has my number to call 2) can ring my number whenever they like claiming they have data protected information about me 3) could cause distress to people in a vulnerable situation. I realise they are chancing the percentage game but goes beyond cold-calling potential customers and instead uses lies or false statements to win compensation to earn money. These calls or messages need stopping.",

I have not had any accidents so I know, in my case, their statement is false. ",
