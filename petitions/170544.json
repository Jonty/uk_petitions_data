        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call upon parliament to hold a vote of no confidence in Rt Hon Jeremy Hunt. Arguably, Jeremy Hunt is in breach of The National Health Service Act (S1) (1a). It states 'The Secretary of State must continue the promotion in England of a comprehensive health service designed to secure improvement in the physical and mental health of the people of England'. By cutting the budget of mental health trusts Jeremy Hunt is, potentially putting patients lives at risk; not promoting the NHS.",
        "background": "The budget for mental health trusts fell by 2% from 2013/14 to 2014/15. Also, in the year April 2016 the budget for mental health trusts was projected to rise by a dismal 0.3%. Jeremy Hunt is ruining our NHS, which was created after WW2 to assist people regardless of their socioeconomic background.",
