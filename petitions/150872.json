        "additional_details": "We now have a huge number of voters claiming that they regret their choice in the referendum and many more feeling they have been let down by the 'side' for which they voted, as subsequent announcements have apparently gone against campaign pledges.  Much of this will be down to the lack of transparent information made available from official sources.  To make such a once-in-a-lifetime decision based on a lack of informed opinion is duplicitous and undemocratic.",
        "background": "Both Leave and Remain voters have been misled by exaggerated, weak or erroneous information provided by the Stronger in Europe and Vote Leave campaigns - for example, the \u00a3350 million figure used by the Leave campaign.  To make an informed choice, voters must have clear and honest information.",
