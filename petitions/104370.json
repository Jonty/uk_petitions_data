        "background": "Many cyclists are dying on the streets of London because there is too little space and too many HGVs on the road. A compromise needs to be reached and the cyclists cannot go anywhere. Delaying the deliveries by HGVs between 7:30 and 9:30 in the morning will significantly reduce the London death rate",
