Since then there has been an increase in population from within and also an influx of migrant community from Eastern Europe. Planning permission for new houses is being granted and yet the healthcare infrastructure is being eroded and a doctor led MIU in Goole is being downgraded to a nurse led UCC. Three other MIUs in rural communities in ERY are being threatened with closure. Finally CHCP a private company has been given the tender.",
