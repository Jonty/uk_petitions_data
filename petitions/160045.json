        "additional_details": "The electorate was not able to understand or predict the political and economic impact that came with this momentous decision. If 70% of MPs think we should remain and with post referendum knowledge that Scotland and NI look likely to stay in EU causing the break up of the UK as we know it. A second vote is justified on the basis that the above outcome was unknown so not able to be considered by the electorate when casting their vote. The electorate is in an impossible and unfair position. ",
        "background": "In light of evidence that over one million 'leave' voters now regret their decision and that so much dubious and confusing information was given to voters pre Brexit. We the undersigned feel that a second referendum with clear information is the ONLY fair way to determine the UKs future in Europe.",
