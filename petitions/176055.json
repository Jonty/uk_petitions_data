        "additional_details": "A debt is \u201ca sum of money owed\u201d and should be referred to as such. There is no logical reason why Government should compare our National Debt to GDP (or anything else) other than to keep the truth from us of their out of control spending and borrowing (\u00a3619 ml every single day). It can only be done to deceive us once more. ",
        "background": "Since 1947 our Debt increased from \u00a325 bn to \u00a31,547 bn but when comparing it to GDP Gov can claim it dropped 65% and they are able to conceal from us their borrowing of more than \u00a32 bn every week for 10 years. See www.mrms.uk for many more alarming facts about the way Gov is running our Country.",
