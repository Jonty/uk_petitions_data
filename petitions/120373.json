As parents is exhausting and distressing seeing your child in constant pain and struggling with simple everyday tasks, other normal kids don't have to even think about doing. Having to fight for a benefit for your child and prove their eligibility is unfair when you have the medication, professional diagnosis and substantial photographic and video evidence to support our claim.",

DLA helps to help ease some of the everyday pressures faced as a family.With recent cuts DLA have been taken away even though no there has been no change in the child condition ",
