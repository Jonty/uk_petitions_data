And when our operations do lead to civilian death, we want information of what went wrong i.e bad Intel. \r\n\r\nWe want a break down of how much money we have spent in the process, broken down and itemised. I.e. how much each missile/bomb cost, wages of those taking part in action, fighter jet running costs. \r\n\r\nIf our operations are 100% honourable, then there is no reason for our actions to not be transparent for the world to see. \r\n",

Then we the people should have the right to be constantly updated on our operations. \r\n\r\nWe want weekly updates on how many bombs have been dropped.
