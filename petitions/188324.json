        "additional_details": "The Government should therefore introduce a new 'Social care tax' on share and stake holders, hedge funds, and companies who use automation. The Government must only use this income for social care.  It would help county councils tackle shortages in their social care budgets without making cuts elsewhere, including council tax rises. This tax would also help the NHS with their budget sort falls.",
        "background": "Share/stake holders who receive over \u00a350,000 in dividends, hedge funds, and companies that replace workers with automation often fail to reinvest their profits in the workforce and payrates. As the workforce pays taxes, these companies are also depriving the Government of taxes and NI contributions.",
