        "action": "Introduce a mandatory one month driving ban, for mobile phone use whilst driving",
        "additional_details": "From the window of my home I have an ideal vantage point to observe traffic as it comes to a halt at a nearby junction and, from the amount of people that I observe using their mobile phones, whilst they are driving it's very clear that the message is simply not getting across !\r\n\r\nThe introduction of a mandatory one month driving ban, for a first offence in addition to the proposed penalties would in my opinion be a more effective deterrent than what is currently on the table !",
        "background": "The Governments latest proposals, to crack down on mobile phone use whilst driving simply do not go far enough in my honest opinion and I say this not as someone whose life has been affected by this issue, rather that I hope that my friends or myself never will be !\r\n",
