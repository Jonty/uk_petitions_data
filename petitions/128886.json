        "action": "Restrict the maximum working hours of NHS staff to avoid mistakes being made.",
        "additional_details": "Working long hours can lead to tiredness, which in turn can lead to dangerous mistakes being made. This is the reason for the existence of both GB domestic and EU legislation which restricts the number of hours drivers can work for in a week, how long they can drive for without a break and how long their breaks must be.\r\n\r\nAs NHS staff are often in situations at work where making a mistake can have extremely serious affects on patients health, a safe legal limit to working hours should apply.",
        "background": "This petition calls for the creation of legislation which limits the working hours of health care professionals who make decisions which affect patient safety, with the aim of preventing mistakes due to tiredness. It should be similar to GB and EU rules which restrict working hours for drivers.",
