        "additional_details": "Voting on whether the UK remains in, or leaves, the EU was probably one of the most crucial things a British citizen was expected to do. The outcome of the referendum effects nations and lives beyond that of the UK and its population.\r\nIt is only right that the voters are given the correct information upon which to base their decision.\r\nIt is our opinion that the current result be treated as invalid based on the above argument and a fresh referendum be offered.",
        "background": "It has now come to light that the campaign leading up to the first referendum gave misleading information to voters. Had this misinformation not been put before the voters, the outcome could well have been different.",
