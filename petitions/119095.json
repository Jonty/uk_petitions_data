        "additional_details": "the prime minister must be directly elected by the citizens of Britain if this individual is any good at all for the job then the mps in his party will be obviously elected. at present there are too many regions across Britain voting merely based on tradition for a party irrespective of actual candidate. however when it comes to the leader of Britain the best person for that job should be elected as voted for by the citizens of Britain.",
        "background": ". currently no prime minister is directly elected and this situation does not bring justice to the people of Britain no game should be played of I got more part time mps than you elected so a direct appointment. this is wrong this is not democracy. ",
