Work within the European Council to try to ensure that all such treaties require ratification by members states.\r\n\r\nb. Ensure that no such treaty will be ratified by the UK without an affirmative vote of both Houses of Parliament.\u201d\r\n",
        "background": "The government makes too many decisions in the Queen's name without the need for Parliamentary approval. Ratification of treaties is one example.
