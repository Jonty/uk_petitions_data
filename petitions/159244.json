        "action": "Pressure NICE to approve nivolumab to treat advanced Kidney Cancer",
        "additional_details": "In 2013, more than 11,800 people were diagnosed with kidney cancer; that's about 33 people each day.  It is now the seventh most common cancer in the UK:  the fifth most common cancer in men and the tenth in women.  Since the late 1970s, kidney cancer incidence rates have more than doubled in Great Britain. With rising numbers each year, Nivolumab could make a huge difference to many people's lives.",
        "background": "Nivolumab has shown great promise in the treatment of kidney cancer. Following the 1st meeting to review the clinical trial evidence & cost-effectiveness of Nivolumab in treating kidney cancer, NICE has said it's unlikely they'll recommend the drug for this area. This stance needs reversing.",
