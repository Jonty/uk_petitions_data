This facility featured in a BBC documentary about puppy farming.  In the programme, footage inside the kennels showed dozens of dogs huddled together in disused trailers.  The reporter claimed she found hundreds of breeding bitches in battery-farmed and \u201cfreezing\u201d conditions at the Irish premises. \r\n\r\nPlease sign to stop breeding.
