        "additional_details": "We would like Parliament to pass legislation making it illegal to target ANY group of people with hate messages, whether spoken, written or pictorial, so that politicians, pressure groups and newspapers can no longer use sensationalist headlines that scapegoat specific groups in society and make them a target for racism, xenophobia and other forms of hatred and abuse. ",
        "background": "Racism and xenophobia have been legitimised in post-Brexit campaign Britain. We need to prevent extremist politicians, pressure groups and newspapers from inciting the hatred that has led to children being called 'vermin' and told to 'go home', and offensive slogans appearing in our cities. \r\n",
