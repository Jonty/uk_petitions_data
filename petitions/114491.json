        "additional_details": "The evidence put forward by Russia has been largely ignored by the UK and the U.S. just because it is from Russia, not because it is false. The evidence put forward should be looked at thoroughly. The UK's involvement in Iraq and Syria in the fight against ISIS/Daesh makes investigation into Turkey necessary, otherwise we are fighting a group funded by a fellow NATO member. If found to be true, disciplinary action should be taken and their application to the EU put aside. ",
        "background": "For weeks Russia has been putting forward evidence of Turkey's involvement in buying oil from ISIS/Daesh. Because of our involvement in Iraq and now Syria, it is in our political interest to investigate and take disciplinary action if necessary. ",
