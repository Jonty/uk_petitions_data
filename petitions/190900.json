        "additional_details": "The new proposed ADI part 3 will allow driving instructor trainees to structure the test in such a way that a pass will be easily achieved without a broad spectrum of knowledge and experiance that is currently required to pass the ADI part 3.\r\n\r\nWhilst change is needed it is imperative that the test is reflective of the standards that are currently required.",
        "background": "Currently anyone wishing to become a Driving Instructor will take three tests including the ADI part 3 instructional ability test.  In October 2017 there will be changes to the ADI part 3 which have the potential to lower the standards of driving instruction potentially endangering learner drivers.",
