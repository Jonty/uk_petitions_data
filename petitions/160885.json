        "action": "The Government  inaugurates a system to record all entry and exit to Britain.",
        "additional_details": "All new British Passports issued have a 'chip' embedded and many other Countries too have biometric information which is essential for proper registration of those entering and leaving Britain.  It has been used to great effect in the US and Britain must have the same security measures.  Such a requirement should not be seen as discriminatory by the EU as British Citizens are required to have the same information.  Mrs May has failed to install a system as Home Secretary and must rectify as PM.",
        "background": "It is becoming obvious that it is only fair to allow existing migrants to stay provided they are contributing but this must NOT include new migrants since Brexit has been decided upon.  The Government must insist that all subsequent visitors/migrants have passports with biometric information within.",
