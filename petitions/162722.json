        "additional_details": "Kashmiris have been facing violence and suppression on a constant basis since the creation of India and Pakistan in August 1947. There is a growing feeling of horror all over the world, witnessing said atrocities, increasingly so since the onset of social media. Instead of helping those suffering brutalities, they are being silenced and the perpetrators effectively protected through unbalanced censorship of criticism by Facebook authorities. We hope that the UK will do all it can in this regard.",
        "background": "Facebook has been suspending and blocking users posting content criticizing Indian atrocities against civilians in Kashmir, killing, maiming and arresting thousands in the last few weeks. Said posts are consequently being deleted by Facebook. This amounts to wrongful censorship and must be stopped.",
