        "action": "Reform the IR35 Tax Regulations.",
        "additional_details": "If applicable, IR35 means that a self-employed contractor invoicing under a limited company is treated as a \"disguised employee\" despite having no employee rights or benefits packages.  Moreover, the IR35 calculations for PAYE Income Tax and NI applies to the Contractor's total annual turnover less just 5% for expenses. The Contractor is also liable for ENICs unlike an employee.  It is not even possible to determine IR35 applicability before a contract is signed thus impairing fee deliberations.",
        "background": "The IR35 Regulations, introduced in 2000 to address the differences in liabilities due to HMRC between an employee and a self-employed freelance contractor providing services under a limited company, is a highly subjective, unclear and disproportionate piece of legislation that should be amended.",
