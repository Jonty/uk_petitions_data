        "additional_details": "There are hundreds or even thousands of women who are homeless and struggle every month through their menstruation without luxury items like these because they simply can not afford it, and this is not their fault. It is something that can not be helped. Other items such as condoms are given out for free to men because their ejaculation can not be helped. A woman's monthly menstruation can be a horrible thing for most women and these items should be free for us.",
        "background": "Women are paying and are being taxed on luxury items that they need every month like pads and tampons for something they can not help. Why should we pay for something that we were born with and that is natural?",
