        "additional_details": "The public were not asked to give reasons for their voting decision in the EU referendum, and therefore no conclusions should be drawn from the result of the vote as to the public's opinion on other matters. The government now has a responsibility to provide financial stability for the country, which can be best achieved by retaining existing trade agreements with our European partners - as advised by numerous financial institutions, including the Bank of England.",
        "background": "In the EU referendum, the public were asked only to vote on withdrawal from the EU, and were not consulted on withdrawal from the European Economic Area / Single Market. Withdrawal from the latter would therefore be unconstitutional without a further referendum to agree this.",
