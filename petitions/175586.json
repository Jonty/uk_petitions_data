        "additional_details": "In 2013, the UN confirmed that the Syrian Government had used chemical weapons against the Syrian people. In recent days there have been increased concerns that the Syrian army and their military supporters are committing both humanitarian and war crimes, including the massacring of families in cold blood. We urge Parliament to approve military action, in order to help in relieving Syrian civilians of their plight, and to deter the Syrian Government from committing such crimes against them.\r\n",
        "background": "3 years ago, Parliament rejected a Gov. motion to take action against the Syrian Gov., after receiving evidence of the use of Chemical weapons against the Syrian people. We ask Parliament to reconsider its position following more recent reports of war crimes, including summary killings of civilians.",
