        "action": "Introduce Helen\u2019s Law where hiding a body becomes a criminal offence",
        "additional_details": "The case made legal history as only the third ever UK murder trial without a body and was one of the first in the UK to use DNA fingerprinting.\r\n\r\nAs it currently stands, the English legal system does not require a convicted murderer to admit guilt or reveal the location of a victim\u2019s remains before being released. \r\n\r\nWe hereby ask the government to acknowledge the pain and distress caused to the families of missing murder victims by:\r\n1. Denying parole to murderers for as long as they refuse to disclose the whereabouts of their victim\u2019s remains\r\n2. Passing a full life tariff (denying parole or release) until the murderer discloses the location (and enables the recovery) of their victim\u2019s remains\r\n\r\nDenying a funeral is, surely, an infringement of basic human rights. ",
        "background": "To lose a loved one to murder is horrific. To be denied their funeral causes unimaginable suffering. Ian Simms is serving a life sentence for the murder of  Helen McCourt, aged 22, on 9 February 1988, in Billinge, Lancs. Simms has always refused to reveal the whereabouts of Helen\u2019s body.",
