        "additional_details": "Energy drinks are loaded with sugar and caffeine (sometimes more than twice the caffeine that's in a can of cola) so they\u2019ll certainly give you a temporary energy jolt. However, the boost is short-lived and may be accompanied by other problems.\r\nThe caffeine in energy drinks can make you feel irritable and restless. It can increase your blood pressure, while the sugar can contribute to weight gain, especially if you don\u2019t exercise regularly. http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/tiredness-and-fatigue/Pages/energy-mythbuster.aspx",
        "background": "Energy drinks are full of caffeine and other ingredients that can lead to serious health issues. I, along with many other people, feel that all energy drinks should be sold under the age restriction law. I feel that the ingredients in energy drinks are not suitable for children younger than 16 years",
