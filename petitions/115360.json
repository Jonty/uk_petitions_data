It will lead to people having to fight a battle every 2 to 5 years to stay in their own home.\r\n\r\nAbove all, it's counterproductive to it's own aim, it's supposed to help people get better jobs why does it deprive them of their own home as a reward for doing so?",

Housing is more than just accommodation or a place to live.",
