        "additional_details": "We feel it is not fair that the British people who are against taking in anymore people have no outlet to express their opinion and be heard. Instead they have to contend with biased media putting out the message that we are in full support, when this is not true.\r\n\r\nWe are asking for a fair outlet, so both sides of the public can have their say in the form of a poll. The resulting votes should then be used in any decision making in regards to accepting more 'refugees' in to Britain.",
        "background": "Main stream media are only showing one side of the public's opinion, projecting that the British public want 'refugees'  here. Newspapers only advertise petitions in favor of accepting more 'refugees' ultimately gaining more exposure and signatures. ",
