        "action": "Place all trans prisoners in safe & gender appropriate housing",
        "additional_details": "Placing trans women and men into the prison estate opposite to the gender role they live in is illogical & cruel, causing severe fear and great distress. The practice disregards HMP\u2019s obligations under the Human Rights Act 1998, the Equality Act 2010 and its commitment to safeguard all prisoners. \r\nWe call upon the Ministry of Justice to ensure that all trans prisoners who have transitioned and are living permanently in their preferred gender role are placed in safe, gender-appropriate housing.",
        "background": "Recent press stories highlight serious problems arising from the practice of placing trans women in the men's prison estate. We ask Government to revisit PSI 07/2011 & place a legal responsibility on Prison governors to ensure safe housing for trans people. Stop the double punishment.",
