        "additional_details": "There are potential savings to be made in adopting the 'Cornwall' model, as there are many management positions duplicated across counties with District Councils, also some current local government buildings would be freed up for potential residential development.\r\nProperly implememented it would also mean locally elected people would be responsible for what happens at a local level.\r\nThere are already some local authorities who are sharing services and this would be a progression of this.",
        "background": "Cornwall, Co. Durham, Isle of Wight, Northumberland, Shropshire & Wiltshire are all Unitary Authorites with no District Councils.\r\nThe duties of former district councils is either devolved down to Town & Parish Councils, or where this is impractical (eg: roads) it is taken on at county level.",
