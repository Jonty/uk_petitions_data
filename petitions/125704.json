        "additional_details": "The programme will cost \u00a37 million pounds to run. The dietary advice will be the same as that currently being followed.  We have a diabetes epidemic so the old advice is not working.\r\nDr Maureen Baker, of the Royal College of GPs, welcomed the scheme but she warned \"The long-term behaviour changes we need to see is hard to inspire\".  However, there are forums for the Blood Sugar Diet which offer the support and inspiration needed which will also ease the burden on GP surgeries.",
        "background": "Professor Taylor has shown that Type 2 diabetes can be reversed using a low carbohydrate, low calorie diet.  The NHS has announced it is rolling out a programme to give pre-diabetics lifestyle help. There is no mention of the blood sugar diet which pre-diabetics and diabetics should be following.",
