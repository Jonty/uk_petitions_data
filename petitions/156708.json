        "action": "Make Cameron uphold the democratic result of the EU ref by triggering art. 50.",
        "additional_details": "The vote to leave the European Union was the biggest democratic mandate in British political history. 17.5m Leave votes represent a decisive, democratic choice that outstripped the turn out of any general election of the 21stC. It is deeply insulting and anti-democratic for Parliament to dismiss the result as due to public ignorance or xenophobia. Article 50 must be triggered before either Cameron leaves office or a general election is called so the decision and democracy itself is safeguarded.\r\n",
        "background": "We call on the UK government to uphold the will of the people by triggering Article 50. In waiting, the government is deliberately buying time to compromise the democratic decision. This must be done before Cameron leaves office and before a general election so the govt can be held accountable.\r\n\r\n",
