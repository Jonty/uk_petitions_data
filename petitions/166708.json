Social housing with long term tenancies will help to create a better community where people can call their house a home. Private letting creates a transient community of people leaving and moving every few months and destabilises peoples lives for work, health care and general community cohesion.   ",

This money should be spent on building social housing where low income persons can feel secure in a long term tenancy.",
