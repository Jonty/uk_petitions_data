This is because approximately 70% of the population in Norway know basic life support. For every minute CPR is not performed in a cardiac arrest the persons chances of survival decrease by 10%. \r\nIf first aid skills were added to the National Curriculum this would help reduce pressure on ambulance crews which are in a deficit.
