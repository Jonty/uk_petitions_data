        "additional_details": "Many victims  need this compensation to help them rebuild their lives, pay for counselling or cover the gap in their income as working full time whilst recovering from their ordeal.\r\n\r\nThe faceless decision makers who have probably never experienced abuse of any kind simply throw these cases out with no regard to victim.  Decisions made with no empathy could impact these claimants lives further and make them victims again.\r\n\r\nShould victims have to worry about claiming during a stressful period?",

Sex abuse cases take years to get to trial. Victims struggle to deal with their abuse and the ordeal of attending court is a further burden on their minds. ",
