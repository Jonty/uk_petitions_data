If you want an investigation into the impact of chemtrails on health, you could, for example, start a petition asking for a public inquiry into the impact of chemtrails on the health of people in Liverpool or the UK.\r\n \r\nPlease be aware that if you do start a new petition that we cannot accept petitions which are created using the name of an organisation.
