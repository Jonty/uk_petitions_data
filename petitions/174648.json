        "additional_details": "According to the NUS website an average student living outside of London pays \u00a34'834 a year for rent. This is more than half of the maximum maintainance loan you can apply for. Not forgetting a lot of students get much less then this. \r\n\r\nThe average student in London pays \u00a36'143 for accommodation. \r\n\r\nWe propose that the government takes action to help protect the next generation of academics by regulating the amount student landlords can charge for rent.",
        "background": "In the U.K. Student housing in unaffordable. \r\n\r\nIt's clear that Landlords of student houses are taking advantage of students and over charging for their properties. \r\n\r\nMany students within the UK struggle to survive with the remainder of their loan after rent. ",
