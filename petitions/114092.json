        "additional_details": "No additional work is needed other than ONE SENTENCE BEING AMENDED/REMOVED. There are thousands of tenants who not only face properties with higher rents, but with a deposit that will be much higher because of this. When a tenant has fulfilled all their obligations (not being in arrears & having the dwelling in good condition), they should be able to be protected under this law. It is essential to look after people who have done everything that is asked of them. Please help us by signing! ",
        "background": "The Amend the Retaliatory Eviction & Deregulation Act of 2015 protects tenants from evictions after asking landlords for repairs. It only covers tenancies after October 2015. It will not protect anybody in a property today. Some families if evicted for no good reason will not have means for deposit",
