        "additional_details": "An MP is the representative of the voters to a parliament, and as such if the categorized person(s) truly cared about the position of the people within this country, a high wage would not be necessary. \r\n\r\nAs such I and all that follow this petition believe that the members of parliament are subject to the same cuts as all other areas of government, and all MP's and the Prime ministers wage should be halved.",
        "background": "I believe that any \"civil servant\" of which any member of government is, should see the same cuts. I will start of with the basics:\r\nThe Prime ministers Salary is \u00a3142500, An MP's annual salary averages from April 2014 \u00a367,060 and over 172 civil servants are paid more than the prime minister.\r\n",
