        "action": "Stop the total smoking ban in psychiatric hospitals.",
        "additional_details": "I have a relative who is on her 3rd \"episode\", hence another lengthy stay on a mental health ward.  New arrivals to a ward are already under stress.  I am not a smoker myself but I see many patients desperate for the next smoking break to help them relax.  Who will have to deal with this extra agitation?  Staff who are already under pressure.  The legislation may be well intentioned but I think it is totally wrong to impose a smoking ban on patients who are locked up and whose \"home\" is the ward",
        "background": "Legislation comes into force in NHS psychiatric hospitals on 1st October 2016.  Smoking is already limited to certain areas and at certain times so those who do not smoke are not adversely affected.  The last thing distressed people need is to have their de-stressing mechanism denied them.",
