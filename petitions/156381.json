        "action": "Conscientious objection to military taxation",
        "additional_details": "Conscientious objection to military tax is thought to be an extension to objection to military service. A person with a religious or ethical scruple against taking part in killing people during war is likely to feel no less scruple about paying somebody else to do the killing or about purchasing the mechanism of killing. If a government can respect the right of a person not to participate directly in making war, can it also respect the right of the person to avoid this indirect participation.",
        "background": "I no longer want to pay the percentage of taxes that are used to fund military budget. I feel that I am indirectly funding the killing of others. I am morally against this and no longer want to contribute to it through conscientious objection to military taxation.",
