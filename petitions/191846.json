        "action": "The Government should publicly condemn Osborne as editor of Evening Standard",
        "additional_details": "George Osborne epitomises the revolving door in British politics that is becoming increasingly corrupt and harming true democracy, only increasing inequality.\r\n\r\nBut this is a step too far. What does the elevation of another White, wealthy male in the media (who failed even to get onto the Times trainee scheme) say to aspiring journalists and indeed the country? It stifles ambitions and fuels further political disengagement. This appointment undermines a free press, a pillar of democracy.\r\n  ",
        "background": "The appointment by Lebedev of George Osborne as editor of the Evening Standard is, in a word, scandalous. This is not a case of Osborne choosing between editorship and MP; he is entirely unqualified for editor, and this creates a concrete (not glass) ceiling for all aspiring journalists.",
