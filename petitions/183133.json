        "additional_details": "- There are around 30,000 internship in the UK, of which half are unpaid. \r\n- The use of unpaid internships as an entry system means that it is only available to young people who can either support themselves or who have parents who can provide for them while they are working without pay.\r\n- Work experience has become an important starting point for many jobs and there are concerns that this could freeze out young people without family connections in the professions.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Unpaid internships should be against the law, it is unfair for anyone to have to work for free in order to get experience and pursue their future career. Let's change this and make sure companies pay the minimum wage for interns. ",
