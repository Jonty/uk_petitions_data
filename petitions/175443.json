        "additional_details": "We are currently in a health and social care funding crisis. Local government has the responsibility but not the funds and in some case, the inclination, to support social care adequately. NHS trusts may be administratively inefficient and that has to be corrected but funding for the \"sharp end\" is inadequate and has to be corrected, and not by short term injections of funds.",
        "background": "The main political parties are nervous of raising taxes for any purpose because of a possible election backlash. By holding a referendum, and assuming the answer is \"yes\", the party in government will have a mandate to raise taxation for this particular purpose.",
