        "additional_details": "I really think this law needs changing as my question is - What is that other 20% actually gaining for my children? Who is the main benefactor in this? Is it the children, or is it the adults? On a house with profit with or without kids should be 50/50 split. That way then both adults can create homes, instead of the man struggling. ",
        "background": "I recently went through a divorce and when when me and my ex wife separated it was me who left the house as my children x2 needed a home, so therefore it was better for me to leave. Once we got to court the judge awarded a 70/30 split in the house profits in favour of my ex wife. It seems unfair.",
