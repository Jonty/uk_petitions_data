        "action": "Build HS2 up to an expanded Doncaster Sheffield Airport (DSA)",
        "additional_details": "Currently a train journey from London Kings Cross to London Heathrow takes 51 mins. The fastest train from Kings Cross to Doncaster is 95 mins using existing lines and railway stock, this could be vastly reduced if HS2 were to be built in this direction noting that DSA is also 6 miles South of Doncaster station, giving an extra reduction in transfer time.\r\n\r\nExpansion can then be progressed in the North via HS3 and the proposed road route across the Pennines to Manchester.",
        "background": "DSA is soon to be linked to the M18 a new dual carriageway, the A1 being one junction along the M18 and the M1 only three junctions away.  There is a \"lot\" of room available for an extra runway, new train station/terminal/parking. DSA has one of the longest runways in the UK.",
