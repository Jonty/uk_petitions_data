        "action": "Pass a law that does what the Children & Young Persons Act 1933 is meant to do.",
        "additional_details": "Hundreds of thousands of children younger than 13 are employed in the UK in commercial research, testing, marketing and consultancy (ISBN1845298802). Child Employment Officers do not give them the protection they give children in performance work such as modelling & acting. Irrespective of the above Act the Officers do not regard them as being employed (NNCEE). This, and the lack of protection, undermines their rights as workers, and can result in them being mistreated & deprived of pay (ACAS).",
        "background": "The Children & Young Persons Act 1933 says it is illegal for a child who is younger than 13, to assist in a non-performance trade or occupation carried on for profit. In many cases such as in research this law is not enforced. Therefore a fully enforceable law is needed.",
