        "additional_details": "As a personal story, I always feel awkward going to use the female bathrooms in public places because it's uncomfortable feeling as if I'm not supposed to be there. And I know others will feel that way too. \r\nIf we opened up the bathrooms, there would be less nervous people going into the bathrooms that they are not feeling assigned to.",
        "background": "I would like for you to open up Transgender toilets around the UK so that people like me can go to the bathroom in public without having to feel awkward about who we are. It should be for both male and female trans people to use.",
