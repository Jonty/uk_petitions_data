        "action": "Abolish NHS referral system that controls access to private medical treatment.",
        "additional_details": "Long waiting time for GP appointment. Hospital A&E won't see me as it is not an emergency, however painful. Can't reach specialist doctor privately, without GP referral. Walk-in clinic can't refer. As patient, I suffer until it turns into an emergency. I was willing to pay for my treatment; I had medical insurance. Then why such situation? Sounds familiar? Sign the petition.",
        "background": "The control is costly & unnecessary. Individuals should be given freedom to choose to go to specialists, privately, straightaway if wished.\r\n\r\nBenefits: 1. Options to patients; 2. Lesser queue. 3. Free up time & cost from referral mgmt. 4. Promotes healthy competition among private & NHS.",
