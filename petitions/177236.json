        "additional_details": "As community size shrinks Sikhs&Hindus are finding themselves vulnerable to exploitation against which they have no defence. Dr Guiztozzi states that the reported attacks and harassment amount to a very serious threat thus 99.99% of the Minority group have opted to abandon their property and flee. Therefore, considering the small size (0.01% from 32m people) of the community prevalent & the sample episodes of abuse & harassment indicates high level of pressure on the Sikh and Hindu Community",
        "background": "While the 2004 constitution of Afghanistan allows for religions other than Islam to freely exercise their faith within the limits of the law in reality Afghan Sikhs and Hindu\u2019s continue to face harassment and violence. on 29/12/2016 an Afghan Sikh head was shot five times, also previously targeted.",
