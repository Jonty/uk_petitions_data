        "additional_details": "Following David Cameron's announcement to resign in October, any new Conservative leader would not have a public mandate to lead the United Kingdom to make the most important decisions since the Second World War. All major parties supported Remain and must redefine their platforms to address major issues resulting from the referendum.  Article 50 should only be invoked when a democratically elected government receives a clear public mandate for their new strategy to deal with Europe.",
        "background": "A new Prime Minister cannot be forced on the country following the referendum result to leave the European Union.  A General Election provides the only means for the public to shape the future of the United Kingdom and our new relationship with Europe.",
