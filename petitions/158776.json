The lack of leadership and political in-fighting is having a major effect on the economy short term and who knows what effects long term. Let's resolve it Democratically",
        "background": "Devisiveness caused by the Referendum is tearing the country and political parties apart. We need a definitive vote backed up by Party Action Manifestos including IN or OUT of EU so we can re-unite the country and end the long term effects and ensure our Democracy is preserved.",
