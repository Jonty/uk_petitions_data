        "additional_details": "Boris Johnson, Gisela Stuart and Priti Patel - high profile Leave campaigners - have championed messages such as \u201cLet\u2019s give the NHS the \u00a3350 million the EU takes every week\u201d. Now, leave campaigners are distancing themselves from the claim.\r\n\r\nMany (particularly older) British people will have been swayed by the promise of a better NHS. With the ongoing NHS funding issues (for example the junior doctor contract dispute), this money (roughly 15% of the healthcare budget) will be very useful.",
        "background": "The UK has voted to Leave the European Union. A core Leave campaign promise was that the \u00a3350m per week (\u00a318.2bn per year) saved would go to our NHS. This may have been the basis on which millions of Brits voted Leave.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned are seeking assurance that Parliament will keep this promise.",
