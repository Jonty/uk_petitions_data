        "action": "Amend Housing Act 1988 to stop care home owners banning restricting and evicting",
        "additional_details": "The Care Act 2014 alleges residents fully or partially funded and placed by L.A.'s are protected under the Human Rights Act 1998, unlike self-funders. CQC guidelines (2/11/16) purport that residents are protected under Article 8 BUT the Housing Act 1988 provides ultimate powers for providers to ban, restrict and evict; some instigate malicious falsehood and staff will support as fearful of reprisals. For this reason The Housing Act 1988 needs amending. www.yourvoicematters.org.uk",
        "background": "Your Voice Matters was set up after I was unfairly banned from a care home http://www.yourvoicematters.org.uk/rights2speakup4care  Providers possess the powers of a landlord. They can ban, restrict loved ones (or any professional) and evict residents; PRIVATE paying residents have no protection.",
