        "additional_details": "Currently a father (or mother) who is the non resident parent can have their maintenance payments reduced if they choose to move in with a new partner, and that partner has children. Those children then become his dependants too and money is reduced. This is unfair on his own child, he has chosen to take on someone else's children but it should not be at the financial detriment of his own child. Especially where those children are financially supported by their own father. ",
        "background": "I am calling for non-resident parents maintenance payments to be determined based solely on their own children, not their partners children whom they have decided to take on, especially where those children are supported by their own fathers seperately and/or have their mothers income too.
