        "action": "Lower the tax on tampons to 1%",
        "additional_details": "In a patriarchal society, the tampon tax is usury, and would not happen if society was matriarchal, or men were blessed with the luxury of periods. The fact of the matter is, if men had periods, there would not be a tax on sanitary items. Please sign this petition to get equality for both genders.",
        "background": "Countless petitions are rejected, but this petition is different. While the UK is part of the EU, sanitary products cannot be zero rated (no tax). Due to this, we are asking for the tax to be lowered to 1%. This petition should have support from both genders since it will affect someone you know. ",
