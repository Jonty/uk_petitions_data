        "action": "Call for Reform to Stop Local Authorities from withholding records in complaints",
        "additional_details": "By withholding records and evidence this allows those who work in our public services and local authorities to obstruct existing laws such as equality, discrimination and disability laws, stopping individuals seeking further assistance to pursue their complaint.  Authorities must fully comply with requests for all records and not only part of the records. Each of us is entitled to receive a full disclosure of our records in order to pursue complaints further. Stop councils abusing public money\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Local Authorities obstruct complaints by withholding records to stop individuals taking complaints further by using Section 14(1) of the Freedom of Information Act. This provides that a public authority is not obliged to comply with a request it considers vexatious and helps them to withhold records",
