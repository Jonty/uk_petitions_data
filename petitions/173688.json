        "action": "A second EU referendum for all including UK citizens living anywhere in the EU.",
        "additional_details": "I came to work and live in Denmark, thanks to our two countries long association and their being in the EEC (later EU) together.\r\n\r\nThe recent UK referendum on EU membership did not allow the UK citizens in the EU outside of the UK and the  citizens of the Channel Islands and Isle of Man a vote. This is grossly unfair and undemocratic. It surely renders the recent referendum morally invalid.",
        "background": "I along with about 4 million other UK citizens living in the EU outside the UK and the people of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man were not consulted in the recent In/Out EU referendum. Also many lies were told by the \"Brexit\" camp. I understand that Oxford's word of the year is \"post-truth\".",
