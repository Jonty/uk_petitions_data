        "action": "Stop parents who maliciously deny the other parent access to their children",
        "additional_details": "When this happens there can be a long wait for resolution through mediation and/or courts of months. Before any formal hearings take place, it should be illegal for parents to do this and revision of the children and families act is required to give police greater powers of discretion to enforce equal contact where malicious behaviour is proven. Currently there is no support for alienated parents in the interim period before formal proceedings. This must change and made criminal.",
        "background": "There are many examples of one parent who stops the other parent from having access to their own children for no good reason other than their own gain and take no consideration of the best interests of their children as often the children will have a strong relationship with the alienated parent",
