        "action": "Condemn the execution of Nimr Al-Nimr and all human rights abuses of the KSA",
        "additional_details": "Nimr Al-Nimr was a man of peace, the only thing he was guilty of was to represent the shia minority in his country. Surely this is not something we would ever stand for.\r\n\r\nThe KSA has some shocking records on human rights as documented by Amnesty International, which are not in line with our British values. We should therefore look to reevaluate who we associate ourselves with and impose appropriate trade sanctions too.",
        "background": "The execution of Nimr Al-Nimr in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) must be recognised as a grave violation of the UN human rights charter. As a result the signatories of this petition call on Her Majesty's government for a much stronger condemnation of his execution and appropriate sanctions.",
