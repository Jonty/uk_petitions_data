With Proportional Representation in place  we can have more balanced debates reflecting a wider spectrum of society.\r\nIf leaving the EU was a vote for democracy then let's improve our system so more voices are heard in parliament.\r\nThere should not be a general election without changing our system first!",
        "background": "If we want a stronger democracy it is time to change our voting system to PR. We need fairer representation in a parliament that reflects our society. PR means parties win seats in accordance to the votes received. Votes = seats = fairer representation in parliament for the people!",
