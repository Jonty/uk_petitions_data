        "action": "Apply more stringent restrictions on night flights at Gatwick.",
        "additional_details": "The Davies Commission has recognised the detrimental impact - \" Night flights are considered particularly disruptive by local residents around both Heathrow and Gatwick. They can contribute to sleep disturbance, which may lead to both health impacts (such as an increased risk of hypertension) and lost productivity for people who have suffered from lack of sleep\".\r\n\r\nPeople living under the Gatwick flight path have been suffering increasingly from excessive noise disturbance from night aircraft, made worse in recent years with an increase in the number of flights. ",
        "background": "The Davies Commission recommends banning all scheduled night flights in an expanded Heathrow during the period 11:30pm to 6:00am. It is logical that the same ban should apply to Gatwick.\r\n",
