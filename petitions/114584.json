There should be no economic incentive for these multi billion pound contracts to aggressive nations. By changing the way we calculate GDP our government won't have a political or economic purpose for selling deadly weapons.\r\nThese weapons are not designed to be detterent but to cause death and destruction and we as a nation want our government to make the correct moral and responsible decisions on behalf of us the people.",
