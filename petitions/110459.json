        "additional_details": "It seems incredibly unfair and wrong that a household with just one working parent or single parent family earning \u00a350k - \u00a360k have to pay a tax charge, anything over that the tax charge outweighs the child benefit so there is no point in claiming it. But if two parents with a joint income of \u00a398k do not have to pay a penny and are entitled to the full amount of child benefit. ",
        "background": "Currently if a single person earns over \u00a350k a year they have to pay a tax charge on child benefit, earn over \u00a360k and you have to pay more tax than child benefit so there is no point claiming it.  If two people living in the same house earn \u00a349k each a year they do not have to pay the tax charge. ",
