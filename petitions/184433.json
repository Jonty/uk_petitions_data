        "action": "Raise Income Tax by 2p. Dedicate the \u00a39bn raised annually to increase NHS beds",
        "additional_details": "This petition does not seek to prescribe HOW the number of beds is increased, as different NHS Trusts have different population profiles.  In some areas it this may mean new hospitals, or extending existing facilities/wards. \r\nNHS England 'may' choose to increase the  minimum standards of 'Beds per 100,000 population' for each Trust, and a formula could be worked out to vary this according to the age profile of the area population.\r\nSource:   BBC NHS programmes w/e 11 February 2017.\r\n",
        "background": "Our National Health Service attempts to manage a Bed Occupancy level of 95%. This is impossible to achieve. Other countries in Europe work with targets between 75% and 85%\r\nIncreasing the number of beds, reduces pressures on A&E, Intensive Care, and Social Care resulting in better care.",
