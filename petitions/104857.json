        "action": "Elected Government & Parliament members should provide a 24 hour, 7 day service.",
        "additional_details": "We suspect that a major barrier to seven day services is an old contractual right in officials\u2019 contracts that allows them to opt out of out of hours work. Other senior public sector professionals who work in services required to keep the public safe, such as police officers, firemen and prison governors, do not have this ability to opt out.\r\nElected officials will still receive a significant salary & there will be a contractual limit (not expectation) of working a maximum of 13 weekends a year.",
        "background": "Many people do not realise that if you wish to raise an important matter with elected officials on a weekend, you have a 100% chance of failure. We want to change this so that everyone can be confident that they will receive the same level of attention from officials, whatever the day of the week.",
