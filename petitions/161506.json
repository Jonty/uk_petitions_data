        "additional_details": "Since 1990, there has been a 36% reduction in CO2 emissions in the UK. In December 2015, at COP21, 195 countries agreed to combat climate change together. This will be easier to achieve if we have a department which is set up to reduce our emissions and converse with other governmental departments to keep global temperature rise below the 2\u00b0C target. The scrapping of the DECC has already been criticised by Ed Miliband (former secretary of energy and climate change) who called it \u201cplain stupid\u201d.",
        "background": "The DECC according to its website (14th July 2016) \u2018works to make sure the UK has secure, clean, affordable energy supplies and promote international action to mitigate climate change.\u2019 The UK needs to find ways of reducing emissions and creating sustainable ways of producing energy for the future.",
