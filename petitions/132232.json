        "additional_details": "I propose we limit the amount of time the HGV drivers are allowed to drive on the road. \r\nI'm a HGV driver myself but I'm also in the military and must commute to work through Leicester every morning and for a reasonably small city, the traffic is ridiculous and its usually because an HGV is sat at the lights, takes 9-10 seconds to select a gear and pull away, in which time the lights are red again. \r\n\r\nLimiting the HGV to an off peak travel would free up our roads and limit congestion.",
        "background": "Our lives are busy. Getting the kids ready for school, working hard all day, paying our tax.\r\nThe last thing we need is to be stuck behind a lorry or in a huge queue because of a number of HGV's at the traffic lights ahead. \r\nImagine how easier the commute would be without any HGV's on the road.",
