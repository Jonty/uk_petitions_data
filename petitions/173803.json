        "action": "Improve Rural Broadband by making ISP's more accountable for poor Download Speed",
        "additional_details": "In many rural areas (I live in Aldeby, Norfolk), rural business, farms, pubs, shops and private homes endure download speeds of less than >1mbps.  In this day and age in our digital world this is disadvantaging rural business and communities.  Our children are set school homework on-line and cannot access broadband to research it.  Our businesses cannot operate efficiently and trade effectively, farming business need to operate on-line to embrace new technology - we demand swift action from MP's",
        "background": "Rural Broadband speeds in Rural areas (especially in East Anglia) are unacceptable.  There is no incentive for Internet Service Providers to improve performance - (they get paid the full monthly fee whatever the download speed) - they are not accountable and need government intervention to improve.",
