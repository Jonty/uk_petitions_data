        "action": "Invest in a single nuclear deterrent with USA, France & Europe and stop Trident",
        "additional_details": "This arises from an idea in the book Diagonal Lengths: Rethinking our world, (page 121) of a common body taking on the role to defend against Nuclear aggression, thereby saving individual countries from each having to invest in and develop their own nuclear deterrents.\r\n\r\nWith Trident due to cost \u00a330 Bn, why don't we invest \u00a310Bn into a common shared project with the US, France and rest of Europe to build a single nuclear deterrent and use the \u00a320 Bn we save on other uses -NHS, Education, Research",
        "background": "A nuclear deterrent is an insurance policy or safety net you hope will never be used. The world just needs one safety net. We should join the Americans, French and Europeans and invest in a common nuclear deterrent for the democratic world saving billions and not build our own exclusive safety net.",
