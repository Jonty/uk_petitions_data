What we ultimately need from the EU is a deal on the free movement of labour rather than people, something that will benefit all 28 members, and this may be endorsed through a second referendum. ",

The majority (approx. 70%) of the elected members of Parliament are against us leaving the EU and such a significant event should command a Commons majority.",
