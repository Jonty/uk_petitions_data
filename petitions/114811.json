        "additional_details": "These are the current rules on door to door trading:\r\nhttp://www.tradingstandards.uk/navless/cedric/cedric.asp?itemID=181582\r\nIn my experience, no signs, stickers or even rows on the pavement deter them. I have a relative who was conned out of \u00a3400  for pressure washing by a rogue tradesman knocking on the off chance, and have many similar anecdotes from householders countrywide. Making it illegal to call unbidden to sell or canvass will protect householders - especially the old & vulnerable. ",
        "background": "Unsolicited door-knockers, from double-glazing salespeople to rogue traders, are not only a nuisance, but can result in elderly and vulnerable people being ripped off. Let's have legislation to ban this kind of trading and sales canvassing/appointment making entirely.",
