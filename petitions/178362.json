        "action": "Make final UK Brexit deal subject to binding, minimum 10% majority, referendum.",
        "additional_details": "The EU non-binding referendum in June 2016 gave options to stay in / out. 29m citizens did not vote Leave. The 4% majority: Leave vs Remain actual voters is an iniquitous outcome for the majority of citizens. Many failed to understand Leave implications fully. The issue is highly political and self serving for some individuals. Our EU membership is an economic - trade issue. Key are the Single Market and Customs Union, NOT immigration. Other options exist, but unquantified, thus risky.",
        "background": "Current Brexit discussions are largely uninformed and confused. There's no reason to think that they will not remain post Article 50 triggering. Lies, half-truths were expounded, later admitted false. EU is UK's biggest market, we need to maintain our relationship and work to reform it from inside.",
