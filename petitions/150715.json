        "action": "Give the British a further opportunity to vote in a second EU referendum",
        "additional_details": "It appears that a significant number of people who have voted 'Brexit' have not actually made an informed decision, as became evident when the day after the referendum many people googled what the EU was, and a further number of people have declared that they regret their decision to vote 'leave'.\r\nFurthermore, there was a <70% turnout in this referendum, with the possibility that since the results have become known, many more people may opt to vote.",
        "background": "Since it has come to light that the petition 'EU Referendum Rules triggering a 2nd EU Referendum' will NOT result in a second referendum due to the fact that it would prerequisite 'retrospective legislation' (D Cameron), we want to start a new petition for a repeat of the referendum.",
