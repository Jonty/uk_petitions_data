        "additional_details": "It's a struggle to start a family these days, especially for working couples. The Statutory Maternity Pay is too low to cover the basic living costs, not to mention a new baby. There are child benefits and tax credits that you can claim but these don't equate to much  if you're both working full time bringing home anything above minimum wage.\r\n\r\nI'd like to add - all of these figures are before Tax and NI deductions.\r\n\r\nYou are better off not working if you want to start a family, and that is wrong!",
        "background": "The Statutory Maternity Pay is currently 90% of your wages for the first 6 weeks and then \u00a3139.58 or 90% of your wages (whichever is LOWEST) for the next 33 weeks. This equates to roughly \u00a3558.32 per 4 weeks for full time workers.\r\nThis is less than HALF of what you would get on minimum wage.",
