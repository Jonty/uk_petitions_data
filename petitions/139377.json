        "action": "Reject the EU referendum result as it is advisory and not in Britain's interests",
        "additional_details": "Less than 38 percent of the British public have advised that they wish to leave the EU. They have done so on the back of key Leave campaign promises that the Leave campaigners are already backtracking on. There are Leave voters admitting regretting their vote. The economic fallout, predicted by the Remain campaigners, has already begun with the pound devalued and ordinary British people losing out as their savings (e.g. cash and share ISAs) and pensions were materially devalued overnight.",
        "background": "The EU referendum is only advisory and has no legal force. Our elected representatives in Parliament have a duty to consider this advisory result, along with all other relevant facts (see below), and then act in the best interests of the people of Britain by voting to remain in the EU.",
