        "additional_details": "Special Constables are expected to perform a minimum of 16 hours a month, yet most Special Constables go above and beyond, some completing upwards of 60 hours a month. One East Midlands force had Special Constables perform over 60,000 hours of duty in 2015, 59% of which were spent on frontline policing duties, responding to 999 calls and life or death situations. The rest carried out where either on local policing initiatives, community safety and training.",
        "background": "Special Constables provide vital support to front line policing, giving up their free time, often days away from family, and even using leave from work to perform duties. Though no Special Constables do this for financial reward, all duties are performed voluntarily, often risking their own safety.",
