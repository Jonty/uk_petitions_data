        "additional_details": "In Romania, dogs are caught by dog catchers, left in the cages of the Public Shelters, often without water or food for 7 days, without  medical treatment, often in agony and then destroyed (in-humanely). Some people run dogs over in their cars and leave them to die in the road. THIS IS NOT OUR WAY! It is inappropriate to align a nation of animal lovers such as ours with a government / nation that does nothing effective to prevent this. We don\u2019t want Brexit deals with Romania until this stops.",
        "background": "Our \u2018Bid To Save A Stray\u2019 Adopters group is one of a number that adopts Romanian dogs / cats as pets to save these poor animals from a short life of immense suffering and an early death. We urge those who care about animals to sign this petition & tell our government to act now, before Brexit Talks.",
