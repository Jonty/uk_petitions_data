        "background": "Reading way too many tragic stories of women under 25 dying of cervical cancer. Smear tests should be a legal requirement from the age of 16. Too many young women are in danger and this needs to stop. It's so upsetting to read for us all and can easily be changed by the government moving the age. ",
