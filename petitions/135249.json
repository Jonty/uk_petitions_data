        "action": "Hold another UK EU referendum in which UK residents can vote alongside Brits",
        "additional_details": "The Office for National Statistics (ONS) Labour Force Survey estimated in 2015, there are 3.3 million EU citizens residing in the UK.\r\n\r\nUK residents have been calling this country home for years.  They work here, pay taxes, have had children here, own property and yet they didn't have a say in the future of what is also their country.  \r\n\r\nA new referendum must be held to include their voice.",
        "background": "The results of the UK EU referendum does not accurately reflect the wishes of the country and that is because UK residents were not granted a vote.  UK residents deserve to have a voice in the future of their country.",
