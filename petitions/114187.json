        "action": "Make every female entitled to a free reusable menstrual cup on the NHS.",
        "additional_details": "Reusable menstrual cups are around two inches long and made from soft medical grade silicone. Instead of absorbing the menstrual fluid they collect it, and it is designed to be taken out and rinsed. This means it doesn\u2019t cause dryness or irritation, and holds up to three times the amount of fluid as a tampon. It forms a light seal inside that stops any leakage or odour. The reusable element also provides a good solution for the costly and environmental issues that tampons create. ",
        "background": "The recent decision to keep the tampon tax is appalling for many reasons. To solve this problem and also the environmental problem of menstrual products, all women should be entitled to a reusable menstrual cup on the NHS. They at least have a free option and can choose to buy products if they wish.",
