        "additional_details": "I am an employee forum representative much aggrieved that redundancy packages cannot currently be calculated by taking into account the years a person held a full time role within the same company, if they now work part time.  \r\nThis is not fair, it greatly reduces redundancy payments to loyal and long serving employees, leaving them distraught, in tears, when they realise this in consultation meetings.\r\nI urge all MP's to have the statutory redundancy pay rules amended without delay please, \r\nDad.",
        "background": "People that are facing redundancy under current legislation are only entitled to payments calculated against their current roles.  If the role is part time, say after returning to work from Maternity Leave, SRP doesn't take into account any previously held full time role.  \r\nMums are being cheated!",
