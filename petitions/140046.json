        "additional_details": "It is unacceptable for any participant in an election or referendum campaign to either make a statement that they know to be incorrect or to make a claim that is outside their direct ability to deliver if they win the vote. \r\n\r\nThe test should be if they are challenged they must immediately clarify and evidence their claim. If they cannot they should immediately retract the statement, apologise and not make it again. \r\n\r\nFailing to do so should be a crime.",

In commercial activities, such wilful misrepresentation and intentional deceit for gain would be fraudulent and subject to penalty and criminal proceedings.",
