        "action": "Introduce licensing and strict regulation of driven grouse shooting",
        "additional_details": "To sustain unnaturally high numbers of birds, reckless use of veterinary drugs is commonplace which can have unpredictable impacts on the ecosystem. Rare and protected animals such as hen-harriers are persecuted because they prey on grouse, and mountain hares are culled on mass unnecessarily. Due to frequent heather burning, local flood risk is increased and vital carbon storing peatlands are damaged. Regulation is needed due to the unwillingness of landowners to self-regulate these practices",
        "background": "Grouse shooting is a 'sport' that relies on intensive land management to maximize bird stocking densities and therefore profit. There are many detrimental environmental effects linked to this practice, hence the need for strict legal restrictions and enforced liability of landowners.",
