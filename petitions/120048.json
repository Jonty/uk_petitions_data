        "additional_details": "While the Queens death may be a sad event for many fans of royalty we have to remember that she is an unelected head of state and the head of an institution and family that discriminates against many different groups of people on the grounds of gender, race, religion, colour, sexual orientation and class. \r\n\r\nThe BBC should report her death as news and in a proportionate and appropriate manner and not in a way that might be considered by many to be mourning her death on our behalf. \r\n\r\n  ",
        "background": "It is rumoured that the BBC plan to drop all sitcoms and light entertainment shows from their TV and Radio schedules after the Queens death for a period of twelve days while they apparently mourn her passing on our behalf. In addition to this the schedules will be disrupted in other ways.",
