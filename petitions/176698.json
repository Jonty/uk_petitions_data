I have witnessed more times than I care to count, cars use their full acceleration in traffic to move from a slow moving lane to a faster moving lane without thought of a motorcycle. They do this as they are not taught about about motorcyclist! This WILL save lives.\r\n\r\nThanks you for reading and please sign & share",
        "background": "too often cars drift around their lanes freely instead of staying straight, especially when moving slowly, this makes filtering through traffic Dangerous! Car drivers pay very little attention to motorcyclist. While I was learning to drive a car, not one thing was ever mentioned about a motorbike! ",
