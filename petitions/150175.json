        "action": "Agree a \"Brexit Lite\" deal that promotes close ties and free trade with the EU",
        "additional_details": "The EU referendum result was clear but divided. 48% wanted to remain, 52% wanted to leave in varying degrees.\r\n\r\nA withdrawal of free trade was not on the ballot paper and would be counter-productive. Even freedom of movement was not on the ballot, or subject to promises by the official Vote Leave campaign.\r\n\r\nParliament must carry out the wishes of the majority and exit from the EU institutions, but should draw a firm line under isolationism and instead agree to a Norwegian or Swiss model.",
        "background": "Following the EU leave vote, parliament must negotiate a deal that protects jobs, investment, families and our nation's global standing.\r\n\r\nIt must give full access and movement to the EU for British companies and people, even if it requires a reciprocal deal for nationals of existing EU states.",
