        "action": "Legislate to stop match ticket price discrimination in football",
        "additional_details": "Such an issue does not appear in other sports. \r\n\r\nWe (the undersigned) believe that such discrimination has no place in Britain\u2019s most prominent sport. We therefore ask H.M Government and in particular the Department of Culture Media and Sport to look at the issue of ticket prices in football and bring forward legislation to ensure that such postcode pricing discrimination is eradicated. \r\n",
        "background": "Away football fans are often charged more than home fans to watch the same football (league) games. This is not only a visible form of discrimination but also risks public safety as away fans are presented with an economic incentive to sit/stand in sections of grounds designated for home fans. \r\n\r\n",
