        "additional_details": "The problem is that once falsehoods get out there, the damage has been done. Most people don't see any rebuttals or if, they do, tend not to believe them.\r\nThis is not specifically about the referendum but a fear for the future of our politics. In theory, the media should pick up on the lies and expose them but the bulk of our media is either complicit in the process for political reasons or too timid to call them out. If politicians can lie with impunity then we are a democracy in name only.",
        "background": "It is often the case that in politics both sides make unsubstantiated claims about what will or won't happen. In the referendum, though, the Leave campaign persisted with demonstrably false claims such as us sending the EU \u00a3350 million per week. Outright lies have no place in the democratic process.",
