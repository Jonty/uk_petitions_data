        "additional_details": "For example, I myself have been on minimum wage (under 18 wage rate) for just under a year. So if I decided to stay in this job role towards the future, I would have to wait 9 YEARS to receive FULL MINIMUM wage. What will I have done in 9 years of waiting for this wage? Yes, I may have more work experience. Yes, I may be more advanced and have more knowledge in this career. But I will still be working 42 hours a week doing the exact same job daily what I was doing at the age of 18, 9 years ago.",
        "background": "I'm starting this petition simply because I and many others believe it is unfair that the Minimum Wage Rate rises in age groups. Why do under 18's get paid \u00a33.90 less for working the same hours and carrying out the same job role as a 25+ year old? ",
