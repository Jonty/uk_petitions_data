        "action": "Give people in Overseas Territories & Crown Dependencies an EU referendum vote.",
        "additional_details": "The Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies receive large sums of money from the European Union for development purposes. The Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha for example, with a population of around 8,000 people, relies heavily on the European Development Fund with the 11th EDF granting the territory 21.5 million Euros. The loss of such funding and other benefits of UK European Union membership would be devastating to such small island communities.",
        "background": "There are an estimated 350,000 British Citizens living in British Overseas Territories around the world and 250,000 British Citizens living in the Crown Dependencies of Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Mann. These people are also European Union Citizens and should be given a vote on EU membership.",
