        "action": "Make LA's provide Post 16 Autism specific education provision in the local area",
        "additional_details": "As a parent of an autistic child I feel incredibly anxious regarding this issue. \r\nTransition from child to adult services is difficult and I feel by continuing education within the local community, would promote much better long term outcomes for individuals as well as their families. I also believe it would be financially better for Local Authorities to provide this rather than sending these vunerable members of society out of borough. So please sign this and let's make a positive change now",
        "background": "There are not enough education provisions for autistic young people aged 16+ within local areas. This is such a difficult transitional stage in their lives and many are forced to travel long distances in order to attend an appropriate provision that can meet their individual needs. This has to stop.",
