        "action": "Reduce the six week school holidays.",
        "additional_details": "Children go back to school forgetting what they have learned in the previous term.  Many children are not physically active and spend the six week holidays inactive.  Childcare is very expensive children expect to do activities which unfortunately very rarely are free.  Family life is stressful due to the time scale and general cost.  Holidays abroad double.  Time with family is important but we need to look at an agenda which helps parents rather than hinders.  If the holidays are going to continue there needs to be a scheme to aid parents.",
        "background": "We are now in 2016 which is a different era from times gone by.  Parents work not every parent can rely on free childcare or assistance from grandparents.  When a child is away from school for such a long time it is a detriment to any educational development.",
