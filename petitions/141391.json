When a party wins a general election every voter who chose another party has to accept that vote as the majority of the country wanted something else! The remain side need to accept that more of the UK population wanted a leave vote! ",
        "background": "The leave side won under democratic rules as they gained the majority with not only winning by a few hundred thousand voters but by a staggering 1,269,501. If this vote was done by constituencies the leave side would have won the majority with 270 out of 382. A 2nd referendum would be undemocratic! ",
