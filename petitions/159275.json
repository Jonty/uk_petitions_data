Aside from students' grievances about the ludicrous new table-tennis tables and prison-like isolation booths, students wish to exercise their right to eat where they wish. The only place that would be left to eat with the proposed changes in place would be the atrium - with the amount of people already in there, the atrium will be cramped, rowdy and frankly dangerous.",
