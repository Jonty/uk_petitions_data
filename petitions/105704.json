        "additional_details": "Compulsory mediation would force both parties to the negotiating table and to achieve a fair outcome through mediation by an independent third party. Strikes are avoided and the public is not harmed by abstract, arcane industrial disputes.",
        "background": "Tube strikes have been paralyzing London for years, and for no good reason. The battle of egos between the unions and TfL management leave the public in the lurch, suffering through horrendous queues. They do great damage to the economy and to our image as a world-class international city.",
