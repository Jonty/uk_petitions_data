        "additional_details": "Don't be fooled to believe that raising the speed limit would mean motorists would then break the speed limit even further. 50% of motorists travel at 80mph and 20% travel at 90mph. This doesn't mean that increasing the speed limit by 10mph that the 50% of drivers would also up there speed by a further 10mph and so on. Yes they are breaking the speed limit regardless, but this does not mean they will then further increase their speed. A debate should be considered with presence of professionals.",

Moreover, persons who travel long distances could get home or to work faster, this giving them extra time.",
