The company would release all of this by excavating yet they constantly apply for permission to build-tweaking each plan each time. Thus far we have been successful in our fights but it has been happening for at least thirty years.The dangers remain the same, there should be a limit on the applications made. I am sure this must be happening elsewhere in the country. ",
