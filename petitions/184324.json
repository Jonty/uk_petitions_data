        "additional_details": "As a signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and with one of its countries having enshrined this convention into its domestic laws, the Government should not be the sole arbitrator in determining whether or not an unaccompanied migrant child should be allowed to seek refuge in the UK. The 'Dubs amendment', in the first instance, prevents 3,000 children from being trafficked and should be upheld. Ministerial scaremongering should not determine the fates of vulnerable children.  ",
        "background": "The UK Government should not be allowed to arbitrarily renege on its promise to provide asylum to 3,000+ vulnerable and unaccompanied migrant children on mainland Europe who face appalling living conditions and life chances. To abandon them after offering refuge goes against our moral duty & values.",
