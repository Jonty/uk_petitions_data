        "additional_details": "Long summer holidays disrupt children`s education and inhibit learning.\r\n\r\nThe economy of the country would benefit as families would not have to rely on expensive holiday child care.\r\n\r\nIndustry would benefit from parents not having to take time off work due to child care commitments.\r\n\r\nChildren will receive more education creating a better educated society.\r\n\r\nParents will avoid being fined for taking children out of school.\r\n\r\nMore full time jobs would be created rather than seasonal employment.",
        "background": "Many families are priced out of holidays because traditional school holidays cause peaks in demand. If schools are open all year round families can synchronise their holiday to suit their work commitments. Schools can then arrange catch up lessons for children who have been on holiday.",
