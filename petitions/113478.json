        "action": "Remove the right to abort up to 40 weeks if there is a risk of disability",
        "additional_details": "The Abortion Act 1967 section 1(1)(d) Ground E allows a woman to terminate her pregnancy at full term (40 weeks) if there is a risk of the child having a disability. Surely the mother of the child would know of any risk factors prior to 40 weeks. The decision to abort could be made at the normal limit of 24 weeks. Healthcare professionals such as RNLD's provide and empower quality of life for people with disability. To terminate after 24 weeks due to ''risk'' of disability is discrimination. ",
        "background": "It is an unethical decision in that there is not always a definite yes that the child will have a disability. Ground E specifically states ''risk''. Therefore there is also a possibility of a ''normal'' child being aborted. Ground E is seen as treating a disease. Disability is not a disease \r\n ",
