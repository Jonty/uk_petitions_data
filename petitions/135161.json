        "additional_details": "In London as well as Brighton, Bristol, Cambridge, Oxford, Manchester, Liverpool, Cardiff, and the entirety of Scotland people have recognised that we were better off in the EU, even though it wasn't perfect. \r\n\r\nThe EU is good for business, arts, and science in London. This isn\u2019t about being unhappy with the outcome of the referendum but about Londoners having the right to make their own choices and to set their own destiny, like the people of Scotland. ",
        "background": "If Scotland gets a referendum due to Brexit - why can\u2019t a city with 3 million more people get the same?\r\n\r\nLondon is a unique global city that voted to remain in the EU. A million Londoners  come from EU countries. Londoners should get the chance to make the decision on staying in the EU themselves.",
