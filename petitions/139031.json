        "action": "Do not invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty leading to the UK's EU exit.",
        "additional_details": "The Leave campaign, during the run up to the referendum held on the 23rd June, deliberately and maliciously mislead the public with inaccurate and fictional 'information'. The UK public was grossly mislead by the Leave campaign and let down badly by the Remain campaign who did not spell out accurately or broadly enough the consequences of leaving the EU. The public were therefore, not fully informed of the information they needed to make an informed judgement on the UK's membership of the EU.",
        "background": "As the outcome of the referendum held on June 23rd is an advisory, the UK government should not be empowered to invoke Article 50 on the basis of its result. A referendum leading to departure from the EU should require a 75% electoral turnout with a minimum 60% vote for either Remain or Leave.",
