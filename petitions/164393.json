        "additional_details": "Mothers and fathers will understand this legal loophole in which they lawfully do not receive child maintenance from their child's non-resident parent. By starting up their own business and hiding their money in someone else's account (i.e their partners) and not putting their earnings through HMRC the Child Maintenace Service say they do not have to pay maintenance due to not having a taxable income or savings.\r\n\r\nThe government need a different method of assessing maintenance to plug this hole.",
        "background": "Even fathers who are on benefits need to pay child maintenance, but affluent fathers evade paying by 'starting up their own business'.\r\n\r\nWe need to protect our children by changing the 'no child maintenance' requirement for fathers who have left their salaried job to start their own business.\r\n\r\n",
