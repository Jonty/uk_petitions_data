        "additional_details": "Redcar has recently been refurbished. That money is lost to those in Thailand who invested it but it does not need to be lost to the people of Britain or Redcar.\r\n\r\nA public, crowd funded, rescue package, vocally supported and encouraged by the Chancellor, would allow the liquidators Price Waterhouse the time and legal right to find a British buyer for the business as a going concern. \r\n\r\nSteel will not always be $200 a tonne. Can we be reliant on foreign steel from a National Security perspective?",
        "background": "A British company has the chance to buy a long term strategic asset at a bargain price. Redcar is almost making a profit and will be viable term as steel prices recover. Huge debts, owed by its owners SSI (UK) Ltd to banks in Thailand, have led to its liquidation - a golden opportunity for Redcar",
