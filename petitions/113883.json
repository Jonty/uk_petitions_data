        "additional_details": "Many politicians are rumoured to use drugs, these people have the most important jobs in the uk, make the most important of decisions.  We should have the right to know that when they turn up for work they have clear minds! Not minds addled by alcohol or other drugs.  We deserve to know that those who 'drive' the nation are as sober and drug free as those who drive our buses!  They have the responsibility for all our lives andr those we love, the wars we fight in which our children may die!",
        "background": "MP's steer our country, drive our economy, make our laws, yet no one checks they are in a fit and proper state when deciding on the country's future.  We expect bus  and train drivers, the operators of heavy machinery and many other professions have to be drug tested for their jobs, so should MP's!",
