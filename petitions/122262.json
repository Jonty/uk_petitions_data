The cap will decimate the support housing sector, making schemes that provide additional support to those who really need it simply unviable, with the expectation that public services such as the NHS will pick up the pieces.\r\n\r\nRead an open letter on #LHAcap by Bromford CEO Philippa Jones: http://www.bromford.co.uk/news-hub/blog/2016/january/mp-open-letter-local-housing-allowance-social-housing-impact-vulnerable-people",
