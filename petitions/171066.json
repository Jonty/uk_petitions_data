        "additional_details": "Other developed countries offer routine scans at 8 weeks to pick up any concerns as early as possible. Why don't we have this in the UK? Recent studies show 45% of women who have had a miscarriage show signs of PTSD. When 20-25% of pregnancies end in miscarriage and up to 75% are in 1st trimester, earlier precautions should be essential. Because our pregnancy was so advanced I had to have a surgical miscarriage under general anaesthetic. The US and Australia offer 8 week scans and so should we.",
        "background": "We experienced a missed miscarriage that wasn't picked up until our routine 12 weeks scan. Our baby had stopped developing 2 months previous at 5 weeks. Because the pregnancy had gone on so long I had to have surgical management which required a general anaesthetic and a overnight stay in hospital. ",
