How on earth could any fair minded person come up with a plan so unfair and discriminatory. \r\nThe change to the required service from 22 years to 20 years, made by Royal Warrant from19 January 2010, is therefore for officers in service on or after that date.\r\n It would appear that this is nothing more than a money saving exercise. ",

However, on 19 January 2010, it was decided that Police Officers would only have to serve 20 years Police Service, bringing them in line with Fire, Ambulance and Prison LSGC Medals, \r\n",
