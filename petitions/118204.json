        "additional_details": "A recent petition has been drafted requesting minimum sentencing for assaulting a police officer.\r\n\r\nA police officer dons the uniform and in their own minds view themselves as different.\r\n\r\nThey rely on this difference when making statements that they know will be given more credence than contradictory statements made by \"ordinary\" members of the public.\r\n\r\nThe abuse of this power should be met with the full anger of the law they perverted.",
        "background": "Police officers swear an oath to act with the highest level of integrity. They choose to put themselves up as a beacon of virtue and honesty and believe their uniform sets them apart. They are placed above other members of society and are expected to act with honesty and integrity at all times.",
