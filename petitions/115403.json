        "action": "Make it Illegal for those in debt to be financially penalized for non payment",
        "additional_details": "The UK government are allowing poor and vulnerable people to be financially penalized for non payment of debts. It is outrageous that debt recovery firms are given a free hand to bully and badger people for money they simply haven't got. To add insult to injury they then charge financial penalties to their victims for non payment. Many of these debts have been accrued by overzealous lenders.",
        "background": "Hundreds of thousands of UK citizens face a future of poverty debt and eviction. These people on low incomes or of poor health have been victimized by debt collectors, banks, solicitors and the courts. Legalized bullying by debt collectors must be stopped.\r\n",
