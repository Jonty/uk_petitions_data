        "additional_details": "Misleading students shouldn't be a valid goal for exam boards as it is not a true test of knowledge, under time pressure it is easy to make simple mistakes and with the added pressure of having to watch out for exam boards trying to catch you out, many students run out of time re-reading questions. Measures can and should be set in place by the government to make sure questions are relevant to the syllabus and not as difficult to understand. Who is benefitting from the difficulty of these exams?",
        "background": "Every year an increasing number of questions on exams are written with the intent to mislead by; asking confusing questions; writing half a question on one page and the rest on another; asking questions that do not appear on the syllabus and by asking students to do lots of work for very few marks  ",
