        "additional_details": "Whilst not everyone who voted for Brexit is a racist, every racist probably voted to leave, and victory has given them confidence that 52% of the population shares their view. \r\nThere has been a shocking increase in the number of reports of experiences of racial abuse in media and social media since 24th June: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-36646979\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36643794\r\nIt is unlikely that we can change the outcome of the referendum, but we must ensure that it does not legitimise racial hatred in this country. The government spent c. \u00a310 million campaigning for Remain. It should spend at least at much preventing the disintegration of society.",
        "background": "The victory for Leave has resulted in a disturbing increase in incidents of racial abuse in the UK. Parliament must take swift and decisive action to:\r\na) Make it clear that all immigrants in the UK are welcome and protected\r\nb) Strengthen laws to prevent racial abuse and incitement to racism",
