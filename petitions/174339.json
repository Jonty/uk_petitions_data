        "action": "Make all school 'inset days' during 'half term' periods, to save childcare cost.",
        "additional_details": "Schools doing their training during the half term periods, would save millions of parents time, money and inconvenience. It's extremely difficult for full time working parents to accommodate those ad hoc days, when the school is closed to pupils. \r\n\r\nThe school building should be utilised during the half term periods for teacher training, as this is not only convenient for parents, but would be a better use of the school facilities, many of which are paid for with public tax money.",
        "background": "Schools in the UK typically have 6 holiday periods per year. During this time, many parents need to pay for additional childcare or take time off work. In addition to this, schools also take many add hoc inset days (teacher training days). This training should be done during half term periods.",
