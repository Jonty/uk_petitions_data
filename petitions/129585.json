        "additional_details": "By making registration mandatory ( 2 year period to register ) it will help solve crimes of pets that have been shot and / or killed.\r\nIt will also make sure that owners are punished for offences committed with their weapons.\r\nWe dont want to stop people shooting, we just want to ensure those that own weapons are using them sensibly, on lands with permission.\r\nSimilar to the UK Gunlaws on ShotGun ownership.\r\n\u00a315 per weapon registration and \u00a310 per year renewal fees for up to 10 serialised weapons.",
        "background": "Make mandatory registration of air rifles.\r\nCurrently in the UK anyone can own an air rifle & use these to illegally shoot on lands without permission committing the acts of armed trespass and poaching.\r\nSome shoot pets escape prosecution and costs owners thousands of pounds!\r\nwww.ukgunbook.com",
