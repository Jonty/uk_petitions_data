        "additional_details": "Trapped rodents and other animals suffer immeasurably during the days that it takes for them to die. Glue traps rip patches of skin, fur, and feathers off the animals\u2019 bodies as they struggle to escape, and many animals even chew off their own legs trying to get free. Some animals get their faces stuck in the glue and suffocate, which can take hours. And the screaming of ensnared rodents is extremely upsetting to people who are then unsure of how to \u201cdispose\u201d of these living creatures.",
        "background": "One of the cruelest methods of killing animals that exists today is the glue trap. These devices consist of pieces of cardboard, fiberboard, or plastic coated with a sticky adhesive designed to ensnare any small animal who wanders across or lands on its surface. ",
