        "action": "Stop animal welfare codes being written and controlled by the agri-industry",
        "additional_details": "Furthermore, we call on the government to more energetically police and reinforce the existing codes, something it has singularly failed to do as two recent investigations by Viva! have shown. In both cases the farms involved carried industry approval - Red Tractor for  pigs and British Lion mark for eggs. Both revealed unacceptable suffering and indicate what we can increasingly expect if the livestock industry regulates itself.",
        "background": "We call on the government to keep codes for farmed animal welfare as statutory and not replace them with industry-led guidance, as replacing them will lower animal welfare and increase suffering; raise the risk of zoonotic diseases; and increase drug use and antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria.",
