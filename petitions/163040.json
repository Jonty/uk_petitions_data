        "action": "Allow all alternative milks on the school milk scheme for allergy sufferers",
        "additional_details": "I would like to see the scheme offer alternative milks which are suitable for children with allergies such as almond, oat or coconut. Another alternative would be soya, however, this isn't suitable for all children with a dairy allergy.  This would then allow all children to have the milk they should be entitled to. Milk is very important for any child and they shouldn't have the opportunity taken away from them just because they have a dairy allergy. ",
        "background": "Currently the milk scheme in schools allows cows milk, lactose free milk, goats milk and sheep milk which are not suitable for children who have a dairy allergy. I feel that a child shouldn't be excluded from having milk, this is preventing them from much needed nutrients and are being singled out",
