        "additional_details": "Testing is not routinely offered unless a lady has had 3 or more miscarriages, or her loss happens in the second or third trimester.  As miscarriages happen in 1:4 pregnancies this leaves a very high percentage of women with questions and unimaginable pain.  The not knowing WHY is often the hardest to come to terms with.  Many miscarriages do have an underlying reason and for the parents who have lost their baby this is vital information that would help them.  They have the right to know WHY.",
        "background": "Miscarrying a much loved and wanted child is heart breaking.  It is a life changing event that leaves the parents, especially the mother, with many unanswered questions.  Often guilt is felt and not knowing WHY is very damaging both psychologically and emotionally.  Testing will bring understanding",
