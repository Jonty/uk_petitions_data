        "additional_details": "Studies have shown that the people who have a poor religious education are radicalised. This includes a study by MI5\u2019s Behavioural Sciences Unit which concluded the following about potential radicals:\r\n-A large number do not practise their faith regularly\r\n-Very few have been brought up in strongly religious households.\r\n-There is evidence that a well-established religious identity actually protects against violent radicalisation.\r\n(http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/aug/20/uksecurity.terrorism1)\r\n",
        "background": "We urge the govt. to halt these plans due to their counter-productive nature, and to evaluate whether a link really exists between supplementary religious schooling and radicalisation. The proposals can have significant impacts upon ordinary British people, their children and religious institutions.",
