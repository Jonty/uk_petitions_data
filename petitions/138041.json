        "additional_details": "An example of the misinformation is the \"350 million per week to NHS\" which is now being denied or reffered to as a mistake. It can not be known how many people voted leave for simply this reason. This is only one of the many promises that have proved to be false. An example of how uninformed the electorate was is the fact that after the Brexit vote many people in the UK were googling \"What is the EU?\". Also most young people voted Remain and will have to live with the consequences for longer.",
        "background": "There has been a lot off misinformation by both sides and also a lot of bickering and personal attacks leaving many of the electorate without the necessary information to make a informed vote.",
