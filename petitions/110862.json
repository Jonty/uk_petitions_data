Amazon paid \u00a34.2 million in tax on \u00a34.3 billion in sales and Starbucks paid no corporation tax between 2009-12.\r\nThe new 'Google Tax' does not do enough by discouraging avoidance but will simply act to find new methods.\r\nGovernment must act, and it must act now rather than taking from the poor so the rich can have more.
