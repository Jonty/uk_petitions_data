        "additional_details": "The environment secretary, is overseeing scrapping the statutory codes on farm animal welfare and move to an \u201cindustry-led\u201d guidance.\r\n\r\nThis could impact on the legal weighting these documents have in providing magistrates with legal guidance when considering negligence during animal welfare prosecutions.\r\n\r\nThe new guidance may not contain the same level of welfare information as the existing codes and may only serve to help ensure animal keepers are compliant with minimum legal requirements.",
