It should concern us all. Builders and politicians need to be more imaginative with unused buildings and brownfield sites.",
        "background": "There seems to be a creeping acceptance that we need to build on the Greenbelt. I think it's imperative we protect and preserve beautiful parts of Britain for future generations. It must be the red line builders can not cross. We don't want Britain to become a concrete jungle.
