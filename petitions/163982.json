        "additional_details": "Small businesses do not have the infrastructure of large companies and cannot have resources to cover all areas for contracts, accountancy, and legal complications. Specifically regarding contracts agreed over the phone where the seller could not possibly deliver all the rules and regulations of a contract, there should be 14 days allowed to consider an agreement in full. Presently an 'over the phone agreement' is irreversible and binding. Equivalence of consumer rights for Small Businesses.",
        "background": "l purchased a small pub 2 years ago to save from closure. When agreeing a Sports package over the phone I realised the next day this was not what I required. After immediate calls, letter and emails I was told I have no 14 day cooling off period, I could not cancel, and had to pay for a full year.",
