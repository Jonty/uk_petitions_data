She was found a week later by one of our neighbors  her lifeless body laying in the curb.  All this heartache could have been avoided if someone had informed the authorities when it happened as our cat was micro-chipped, so we would have been informed sooner or her life could have actually been saved.  ",

If you hit a dog by law you must call the appropriate authorities and inform them of the incident. By changing this law you could save countless cats lives.     ",
