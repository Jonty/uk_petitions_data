        "additional_details": "So, we need the same protections as police officers. Obviously we cant carry tazers or guns, but I think we do enough to deserve the same protection. And that goes for ALL ambulance staff: whether they be office based, clinical or otherwise.\r\n\r\nThis must be extended to not only NHS trusts, but also voluntary organisations and private providers.",
        "background": "If someone assaults a police officer, they can be arrested for the SPECIFIC offence of \"Assaulting a police officer\". However, people who assault ambulance staff do not face a charge of \"Assaulting a member of ambulance staff\" instead it mostly goes down as common assault or assault occasioning GBH.",
