        "additional_details": "Just two common and well known examples of this are:\r\n\r\nCharging an ever increasing amount for planning applications, and charging additionally for pre-application questions - even where the applicant can only follow the full planning process.\r\n\r\nHousehold rubbish collection services - reduced service and amount of waste allowed, type etc, and expectation that householder take on responsibility of sorting waste -  and all at the threat of non-collection, with its inherent health risks etc.",
        "background": "Many councils are starting to charge additional amounts for services normally historically provided as a service as part of their remit, and therefore already paid for by local taxation (council tax).\r\n\r\nSome are also cutting back services, but without cutting the amount they have charged as tax.",
