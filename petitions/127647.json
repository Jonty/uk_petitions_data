        "action": "Maintain the statutory role of the Supervisor of Midwives",
        "additional_details": "Supervisors of Midwives (SoM) give guidance and support to both midwives and mums to ensure that the care offered is timely and appropriate; is given in the right place; by the right person and that it will benefit the woman, baby and their family. Every hospital has a team of SoMs who are on call 24/7 to directly support women and midwives.\r\nAt time when there is clear evidence of NHS trusts prioritising financial balance ahead of quality of care this change will erode safety in maternity units ",
        "background": "Changes in the law recommended by the Kings Fund mean the statutory requirement for midwives to have a supervisor will be removed. Supervisors of midwives safeguard women and babies by ensuring excellence in midwifery practice. This recommendation would remove a vital part of public protection. ",
