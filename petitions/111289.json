        "additional_details": "The American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) and the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) endorsed oocyte freezing as a standard and safe procedure in 2012. It is acknowledged that it is healthier to conceive younger. Currently freezing eggs in your twenties is rare, but I believe if women want to pay to freeze their eggs for up to a maximum of 55 years as is the case for women who experience premature infertility, then they should be legally allowed to. ",
        "background": "The current law in the UK enables a woman to pay to freeze her eggs for up to ten years. Unless she or her partner has a medical condition that means they or their partner are,or are likely to become, prematurely infertile. Egg freezing is no longer experimental, the UK laws need to be updated now\r\n",
