        "action": "Ensure that roaming charges are capped at low rates once the UK leaves the EU.",
        "additional_details": "The reason why I am campaigning is because the EU has capped roaming charges and is planning to abolish charges all together but this is not applicable after brexit. This affects me as capped roaming charges has saved me a lot of money. So I hope that the UK government makes it a law for mobile networks to cap roaming charges at low rates. This would apply for roaming in EU countries and could apply to other countries outside the EU.",
        "background": "The EU is planning to abolish the roaming charges by June 2017 but UK will have triggered Article 50 by then, so the rules don't apply any more. This could mean phone companies will raise roaming charges if they want to. So I am campaigning for the government to cap them at reasonable rates.",
