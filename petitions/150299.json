Now it is time for our Government to lead by example, practise what they have been preaching and have invaded other countries for - DEMOCRACY. \"THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN.\"  We now require a leader who is a Leave politician to negotiate the Brexit terms.  It would be reprehensible to expect a Remain politician to negotiate clean Brexit terms.  Leavers want out. \r\n",

A Remain politician will not represent the best interest of what the British people have voted for and will only have their interest foremost. \r\n",
