        "additional_details": "The road tax hike needs to stop. British roads are what we pay road tax for not fuel emissions that is what the duty we pay at the pump is for. People are being pushed away from there transport modes and if only electric and hydrogen are to be free then every town needs electric and hydrogen stations before this motion is complete come April. ",
        "background": "This hike is blamed on emission yet we are already taxed over 70%duty on our fuel and diesel more so. Yet other countries such as environment friendly australia promote diesel and charge far less for fuel even from suppliers such as bp. This has to stop as it is killing the working class.",
