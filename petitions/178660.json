        "additional_details": "Unlike in a General Election, British people will not be able to change this in five years\u2019 time. Once out of the E.U, Britain could be out forever; even if voters choose a pro-E.U. Government in 2020, the E.U. may not take us back - it only needs one member state to object and a renewed British membership application will be blocked.\r\n\r\nWe therefore call upon all MP\u2019s to do what is morally right and vote against the rushed triggering of Article 50.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Triggering Article 50 will strip millions of British people of their European Citizenship rights. This will be one of the largest collective strippings of citizenship in history, from people who have committed no crime or presented any threat to a state. It may also be open to legal challenge.\r\n",
