        "additional_details": "We used to have a direct link between National Insurance and the NHS. Funds raised were used for the NHS. That link has been broken. We should allow people to pay more tax (an income tax which is progressive) for the NHS without necessarily raising the general rate of taxation.\r\nHaving the NHS fully funded by the taxpayer will reduce the possibility of politicians playing games with our health for their own political ends.",
        "background": "The NHS should not be a political football. We all value the NHS, we all want it funded. We don't want politicians playing with it for their own ends. A separate tax allows for the NHS to be funded by a specific tax which can be raised (or reduced) as necessary to fund the needs of the service.",
