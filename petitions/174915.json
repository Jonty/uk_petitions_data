        "additional_details": "Many staff are EU citizens. Will rights to residence, healthcare, and pensions change?\r\n\r\nThe UK received \u20ac8.8bn EU research  investment 2007-13. Will we still be able to lead/join EU-funded collaborative projects  (Horizon 2020 and beyond) post-Brexit?\r\n\r\nFees for EU students at UK universities are currently the same as for British students. Will these increase?\r\n\r\nWill immigration rules affect recruitment of new staff? If so, how?\r\n\r\nAnswers are needed to address damaging uncertainty in the sector.",
