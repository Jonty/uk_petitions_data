        "action": "Stop Theresa May allowing schools to wholly discriminate based on religion",
        "additional_details": "The complete segregation of children will encourage a more disparate society in the future, with less understanding of each other.\r\n\r\nSchools should exist to educate - not to encourage tribalism. \r\n\r\nFurthermore; religious schools do not allow a free, independent arena for children to learn to question. When a child receives religion from a place of worship, home and school - there is no space to form an independent opinion. It's tantamount to brain washing.",
        "background": "Theresa May wishes to relax the school admission rules to allow them to select every child from one religion. Creating environments where children would not come into contact with a children from a different background to themselves.",
