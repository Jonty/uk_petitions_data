        "action": "Ban disposable plastic crockery and cutlery to help the environment",
        "additional_details": "Plastics are extremely durable, lightweight, cheap and versatile - features which mean that they have replaced many traditional materials such as metal, glass and wood. Unfortunately these features make them the most pervasive, persistent and hazardous form of litter in our environment. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, plastic manufacturing is estimated to use 8 percent of yearly global oil production. This precious resource is being wasted on disposable products for 'convenience'. This is not sustainable.",
        "background": "Recently France became the first country to pass an all-out ban on plastic cutlery, plates, and cups. Let's follow their example through a ban on disposable plastic tableware. These plastics affect our environment and use fossil fuels. Plastic pollution is a pervasive issue but we can change this.",
