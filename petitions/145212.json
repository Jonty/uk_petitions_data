        "action": "Vote for No Confidence in Jeremy Corbyn to lead the Labour Party.",
        "additional_details": "People have been disgusted by our current Government and have high hopes that the Labour Party could win a General Election. However, with Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the party, it is feared we would face another Conservative Government. Can we really afford to let that happen after all this Government have put us through? We need a strong leader to take us into a General Election and Jeremy Corbyn does not have the fight, determination and passion to run our great country.",
        "background": "Jeremy Corbyn has been very quiet during his time as leader of the Labour Party. He is not prepared to take on issues that the public have felt passionate about. Would we be leaving the EU if he'd shown any real enthusiasm? Can you really imagine him as our next Prime Minister in a General Election?",
