We are petitioning to lengthen this sentence and put animal abusers away for longer-term jail sentences. We do not want people on our streets who have the capability of performing such horrific and dangerous acts. THE SENTENCE SHOULD BE TOUGHER.",
        "background": "Abusers of animals so often get lenient sentences in court such as fines and 'bans of animal ownership', I am petitioning to make these sentences stronger, and count animal abuse as a step towards human abuse. The evidence that a person can abuse a living creature shows no decent moral integrity. ",
