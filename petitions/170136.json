        "additional_details": "A  Select Committee should provide an opportunity for politicians to consider whether (inadvertently or not) their statements and actions have contributed to the present deplorable situation. It should also focus on exposing those elements of the media which are peddling misinformation and fostering hatred. Members of Parliament, working across party lines, should develop strategies to oppose racism and xenophobia and demand effective action from the Government.",
        "background": "Police report that hate crimes have increased substantially since the EU referendum, which has been taken by some to legitimise racist & xenophobic activity. Politicians of all parties must work together to oppose this, and avoid encouraging such behaviour with careless statements and actions",
