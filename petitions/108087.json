        "additional_details": "Immunity is dependent on rank, and ranges from immunity from criminal and civil and administrative jurisdiction to immunity for official acts only.\r\n\r\nIf we truly believe in equality then nobody is above the law. We can't live in a society where there's one rule for the majority and another for the powerful elite, holding office. \r\n\r\nIf foreign diplomats have nothing to hide then they wouldn't require favourable treatment compared to the people they represent in their home countries.",
        "background": "Diplomatic immunity in the UK is conferred on all entitled members of a foreign mission (and entitled family members forming part of their household) who have been notified to, and accepted by, the FCO as performing a diplomatic function.",
