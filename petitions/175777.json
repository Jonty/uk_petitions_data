        "additional_details": "One packaging strikes myself which is incredibly appalling to be advertised is the packaging 'Smoking kills your unborn child' with a shocking image of a baby coffin with grieving parents looking over the cot. This image is absurd to anyone who may be going through miscarriage/loss child who DO NOT even smoke. \r\n\r\nBan these shocking images, blank packaging is reasonable without going over the top.",
        "background": "Ban disturbing photos on new tobacco packaging\r\n\r\nNew tobacco packaging law became introduced to the UK in May 2016 which concluded that blank packaging would be made for all tobacco products. New photographic images are also in place with new packaging which are incredibly disturbing to the public.",
