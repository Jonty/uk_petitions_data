        "action": "Change legislation to enforce yellow box junctions around the Dartford Tunnel.",
        "additional_details": "Yellow box junctions are not currently enforceable outside of London.  Allowing Part 6 of the Traffic Management Act 2004 for England to be enabled around the Dartford Tunnel would allow for the civil enforcement (i.e. by local authorities) of moving traffic offences, such as yellow box junction enforcement. Enforcement of these offences in England outside London is currently the responsibility of police who do not have the resources to enforce this. \r\n",
        "background": "Changing current legislation would allow for the enforcement of yellow box junctions on the A206 approach to the Dartford Tunnels, J1A & 1B of the M25 via local authority powers. This will improve traffic flow in Dartford and surrounding areas when incidents and heavy congestion occur.",
