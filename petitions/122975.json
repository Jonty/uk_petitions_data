Something needs to be done, we cannot carry on letting people in charge destroy our human rights.Please help me and many others by signing this petition. I know its not a lot, but if we all tried to pull together. Maybe we can make a start.",

I think this is unfair how we are having to deal with these consequences while the people who make the choices sit in their luxury \u00a31m houses and private healthcare. ",
