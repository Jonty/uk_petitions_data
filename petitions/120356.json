        "additional_details": "Many disabled people face obstacles to working, due directly to their disabilities. This limits the range of jobs they can even consider doing.\r\n\r\nSome people who are disabled face additional obstacles to working because they're prohibited from driving. They may have to take lower paid jobs closer to home, or only work part time.\r\n\r\nAllowing disabled people to travel on buses for free at any time would help disabled people to work, by encouraging them to travel further to work.",
        "background": "Currently the English National Concessionary Travel Scheme grants free bus travel via a special bus pass for both elderly people and eligible disabled people.\r\n\r\nFree travel is limited to between 9:30am and 11pm on weekdays, but is at any time at weekends and public holidays.",
