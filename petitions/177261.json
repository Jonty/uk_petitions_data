        "additional_details": "In 2008 The Government issued guidelines stating that:  If you are in receipt of a war pension award, be it a gratuity (one off payment) or a weekly pension, you are entitled under an NHS Executive Guideline HSG(97)31 to receive priority treatment for the accepted conditions on your war pension. Also, in 2008, this guideline was extended to include conditions that are not accepted under your war pension but could be caused from your service in the Armed forces.  The NHS does not honour this.",
        "background": "Successive Governments have promised since 1948, that War Pensioners would receive priority treatment for attributable injuries caused by their Military Service. In 2008 The Govt issued guidelines to receive priority treatment. This promise, a duty of care, to Military Personnel must be upheld. ",
