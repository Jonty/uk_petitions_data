        "action": "A life-time ban from politics, and punishment, for MPs that renege on promises.",
        "additional_details": "Whatever you voted, the decision to leave the EU is a chance for Britain to fix its democracy.  In elections, and now in the referendum, politicians make campaign promises in order to win votes, only to u-turn or deny making those promises. It mocks the principles of democracy. Now is a chance to write into law an insurance against such deception. This law would put an end to 'career politics' and remind all elected representatives that they work for the electorate, not their own agendas.",
        "background": "We propose a life ban from politics for MPs who do not enact all manifesto promises - or those implied in slogans.  Also a fine or imprisonment for 'perjury to abuse public trust'. Party funds used for such campaigns should be forcibly recovered to fund a watchdog body against future such abuses.\r\n",
