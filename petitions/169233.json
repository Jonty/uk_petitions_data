        "additional_details": "It is in the interests of fairness and justice to ensure that the referendum result is an accurate representation of the extant population of eligible voters at the point Article 50 is triggered, or as close as possible to that date. People who have become eligible to vote by the date of triggering Article 50 should have their voices heard, and it is unfair that the votes of people who have since passed away and are unaffected by the consequences should influence the result.",
        "background": "The decision to trigger Article 50 should be based on the wishes of the true UK population at that point, not the population as it was on 23.6.16. People who are no longer alive in the UK should be excluded and people who have turned 18 since 23.6.16 should be given a chance to vote.",
