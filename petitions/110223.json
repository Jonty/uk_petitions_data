        "additional_details": "Currently in the middle east we are supporting terrorists. Evidence that the US and its allies have armed and supported, and continue to protect jihadist groups is irrefutable. The UK must pull out of all conflicts in the area, or support Russia in her attempts to restore stability. In the Ukraine we are supporting a regime put in place by an illegal coup. The narrative that the west are the good guys is no longer true. We, the public, do not support these actions and do not want war.",
        "background": "Without any consultation with the UK populace our government, in support of US/NATO/EU 'false flag', proxy and illegal military campaigns seem willing to go to war with Russia. We the British public do not wish war that is unwarranted, and in which we are on the side of wrong.\r\n ",
