        "additional_details": "A recent example is that a young girl of age 16 recently cancelled a contract with 5 days remaining. Those 5 days were refunded and she went on a pay as you go contract for those 5 days - this was not communicated to the parents. At the end of the month, a \u00a31400 bill came through as the charge per mb of data was set at \u00a37.20. This is UNETHICAL and there is no logical reason data should be this expensive. It is an example of pure greed and something needs to be done to protect the public.",
