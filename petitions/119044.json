Freezing or warm weather does not distinguish between borders, Switzerland & France - come to mine. I know it is based on average temperatures, but over the last month the warmest temperature in the UK has been 14C compared to average temperatures in Greece of between 8 & 11C. Based on this temperatures would have be monitored on a weekly basis.",

I think 94000 pensioners are being discriminated against. I also find that it is very difficult to predict  the weather over a 3 or 4 month period.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
