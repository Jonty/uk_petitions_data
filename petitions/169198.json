        "additional_details": "In determining the starting point of Brexit, our elected representatives must have the chance to properly scrutinise and vote on the aims of the negotiations. MPs must engage with their constituents and all stakeholders to represent us, the people, in determining what the aims of Brexit should be. Our elected MPs should then vote to ensure article 50 is triggered so negotiations start following these aims set out by Parliament. To be truly sovereign, Parliament must play its full role in Brexit.",
        "background": "The country voted 52:48 to leave the EU in June and to make Parliament sovereign in the UK. To be sovereign, Parliament must therefore be able to vote on and scrutinise the initial aims for Brexit negotiations and then vote to ensure article 50 is triggered, not leaving it to royal prerogative.",
