        "action": "Ban single-use plastic bottles in the UK",
        "additional_details": "Plastic harms the environment and our health. Animals often die from being suffocated and poisoned by it. Some marine organisms, like fish, can be eaten by humans, spreading the plastic further into the food chain.\r\n\r\nBanning these bottles leaves people with suitable alternatives. Re-usable plastic bottles are not the most eco-friendly alternative, but is still a better option as they can be re-used several times. Metal bottles can be used as they are made to last for a much longer time.",
        "background": "Single-use plastic bottles are not designed to be re-used. Thus, many people buy and later throw these bottles away. These bottles, like much litter, ends up on streets and is blown by the wind, into rivers, polluting them.\r\n\r\n",
