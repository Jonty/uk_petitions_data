        "additional_details": "We are at war. At war with a contrary ideology, one that uses Islam as it's foundations and seeks to kill and obliterate all other alternatives. The agents of this force work in the shadows, but also hide in plain sight, posing as the needy and downtrodden, all the better to infiltrate our societies. And our society in Britain has been disarmed! We are defenceless except for a thin blue line who claim to be overstretched and underfunded. Time to let us defend ourselves with firearms once more. ",
        "background": "Yesterday, in Paris, 8 Jihadis reaped a toll of over 158 innocent civilians as they socialised on a Friday night. 8 killed 158, that's nearly 20 civilians for every 1 terrorist. Their targets were unarmed, I propose that an armed populace would have stopped their spree much sooner. ",
