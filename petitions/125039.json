The government has more than \u00a330 billion of our National Insurance contributions just sitting around not being used for its intended purposes, i.e. to fund the NHS/social welfare. \r\n\r\nGeorge Osborne meanwhile is cutting our National Health Service over and over again in an attempt to undermine its usefulness so he can later justify privatisation.\r\n\r\nLet's put a stop to this now and use these NI contributions!",
        "background": "George Osborne is sitting on a NI surplus of \u00a330Bn whilst the NHS is underfunded and faces more cuts. House of Lords Library figures show the government spent \u00a3106Bn from NI contributions, of which the NHS only got \u00a321Bn. Instead of cutting this vital service, use the money we have paid to save it.",
