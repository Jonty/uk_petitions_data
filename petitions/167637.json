        "background": "It's currently too easy for the general public to impulse buy pets many of which end up being sold, rehomed, surrendered to rescues \r\nThe staff in the pet shops generally do not have the right skills or training for each animal.\r\nAll too often profit comes before welfare with many pet shops.\r\n",
