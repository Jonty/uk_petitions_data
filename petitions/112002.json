        "additional_details": "The bill is flawed: There's the costs of running mass surveillance, the potential for abuse, and the costs of destroying trust in businesses.\r\n\r\nFundamentally this bill is in fact weakening national security by installing backdoors that malicious users can exploit. By monitoring the Internet we become less secure ourselves. The choice isn't between a digital world where GCHQ can or can\u2019t eavesdrop, but between a digital world that is vulnerable to all attackers or one that is secure for all users.",
        "background": "The bill was designed to ensure \"law enforcement, security and intelligence agencies ... can keep us safe\u201d. Yet the bill is fundamentally flawed and assaults our privacy (which we do not need to justify). Terrorists do not abide by the law esp. one which can be bypassed easily through VPNs or Tor. ",
