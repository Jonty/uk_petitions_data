        "additional_details": "Guidance for schools on this, which was previously available on the DfE website, was recently removed (something which the DfE, despite evidence to the contrary, later denied).\r\n\r\nMathematics teaching professionals believe that there will not be enough time to effectively implement these changes for a September 2017 start. Moreover, we believe that their implementation will slow the Secondary curriculum, create a testing culture, and reinforce a language of failure inappropriate at such a young age.",
        "background": "Children in Year 6 at Primary School currently sit National Tests (\"SATs\") in Mathematics and English. The DfE are proposing that children who fail to reach a \"required standard\" will resit these tests at Secondary School in Year 7.",
