        "additional_details": "It often happens that outbreaks are kept secret and advised biosecurity is not adhered to correctly. Horse Welfare is the biggest concern as containment procedures are optional, meaning that it often spreads and more horses suffer. The damage to the equine industry is great; entire show seasons lost, loss of livestock, and loss of income. Were it a notifiable disease anyone who had a case would not be able to keep it secret and they would have to put correct biosecurity measures in place by law.",
        "background": "Strangles is a deadly and horrific disease in horses. Bacteria is spread through direct and indirect contact. It causes horses great distress and pain and is difficult to deal with. Outbreaks are currently managed by the common sense of horse owners but often still result in spread of the disease.",
