        "additional_details": "I'd like the government to legalise the use of the Segway/ hover board on UK pavements. Doing so would ease traffic congestion in busy town/city centres. Obviously it would be dangerous to have people scooting along at 25mph on the pavement, therefor I suggest that when bring used on pavements the Segway owner limit their device to 12.5mph.",
        "background": "The Highway Act of 1835 renders the Segway Is illegal in the UK on pavements. They can't be used where bicycles can (even electric bicycles) because they do not have pedals and they cannot be used on the road as a motor vehicle because they do not meet any kind of permitted type approval in the UK\r\n",
