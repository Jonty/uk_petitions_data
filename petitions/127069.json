        "additional_details": "The two techniques are used for very small crimes such as vehicle interference or trespassing. Sin bins and needle exchange has been provided for drug users as we understand their addiction therefore they is no excuse to put the public in danger of diseases. Children play on the street innocently because they are unaware of the risk of a needle which could change their life forever, smoking in the same car as a child is child abuse therefore how come giving a child a disease isn't abuse. ",
        "background": "The public get stabbed by needles left in the street by drug users and have to wait 6 months to see If they caught HIV or Hepatitis A/B/C. Drug users who throw their needles on the street should be prosecuted with a minimum sentence. A simple test for DNA and fingerprinting will catch the criminal.",
