        "action": "Add Makaton sign to the national primary school curriculum",
        "additional_details": "Neuro-typical Primary aged children brought up in multi-lingual environment can pick up multiple languages effortlessly. The young developing brain is a sponge for language. Teaching simple Makaton sign in schools would assist teachers and children to communicate with children who are late to develop and/or non/verbal. It would have the added benefit of providing a common back up for individuals who loose the power of speech in later life.",
        "background": "Late talking and non-verbal children are often isolated and underestimated, even while surrounded by well intentioned teaching staff and classmates. Adding a simple sign system such as Makaton could bridge this gap, normalise difference and ultimately make for a more inclusive society.\r\n",
