        "action": "Make all Government properties and events globally alcohol free.",
        "additional_details": "The Government has a duty of care to those working on & visiting Government estates & events. As such the Chief Medical Officers advice on drinking limits should be rigorously adhered to & enforced at all times. To not take such action would show a reckless disregard for the health of those in Government employ or attending Government events, & would undermine both the authority of the chief medical officer & the work being done to tackle the problems caused by alcohol consumption.",
        "background": "Given the new advice on alcohol, that there is no safe limit, all Government buildings and events should be alcohol free, alternatively any alcohol subsidy should be removed & the new limits, including recommendations on days of abstention and a daily limit of 3 drinks be strictly enforced",
