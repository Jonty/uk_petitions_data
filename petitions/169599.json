        "additional_details": "I spent long enough explaining to them I am unable to live in shared accommodation due to my mental health issues. I have tried to get a one bed flat and nothing I do for universal credit is good enough. How can the government expect our future generation to live with their parents till 35 because most of us can't get help to live alone! Why are we expected to live like students? Why do they not care for people with mental or physical health disabilities? I now have two options. Live on my friends couch, or move back with my parents which I cannot do. Is this acceptable to keep our younger generation in such horrible circumstances?",
