        "additional_details": "All prospective trainee teachers must pass the skills tests before they can be recommended for the award of qualified teacher status (QTS). It consists of two exams, some questions are written and presented in a series of on-screen questions, others are audio with headphones. \r\nSurely we should be ensuring we train the right people and not place a barrier in their way that appears to be meaningless and provides no evidence to support it has any impact on the selection process?",
        "background": "My daughter has ADHD. She's been offered a degree with QTS but failed the tests twice. The format causes sensory issues for her. Why is she not competent when she passed her GCSEs with an AB&C in 2014? Why are we allowing discriminating tests to lose passionate teachers of our future generations? ",
