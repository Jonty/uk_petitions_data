        "additional_details": "Young children and teenagers don't want to wear a helmet as it looks uncool, if it was compulsory everyone would look the same but would have the protection. There are too many accidents on the road now involving cyclists and cars and not enough people wear helmets.",
        "background": "Most children, teenagers and adults own a bike. It is illegal to ride on the path but roads are very busy and bikes can go unnoticed on the road. It would be safer if everyone HAD to wear a helmet, if you ride a motorcycle it is the law why not a bike?",
