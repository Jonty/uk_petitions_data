        "additional_details": "The wording is based on the Fraud Act 2006. Voting influenced by lies is not democracy; it is a perversion of democracy. In campaigning for Brexit, many untrue and misleading public statements of fact were made, most notably on the side of a red bus. Knowingly false statements in order to influence voters should be a criminal offence. The offence would not cover for example statements made in Parliament, subjectively-worded statements or where a statement expresses any degree of uncertainty.",
        "background": "Make it a criminal offence for a politician or news organisation, or any person acting on their behalf, to make a public representation of fact that they know is, or might be, untrue or misleading and where they intend, by making the representation, to influence voting in an election or referendum.",
