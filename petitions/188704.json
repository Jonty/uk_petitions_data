        "additional_details": "This would encourage businesses to adopt greener transport and does not need expensive infrastructure and costly enforcement departments.  Firstly, it would incentivise employees to walk or cycle instead of taking their cars for very short journeys; thereby increasing national physical activity levels, improving health, and reducing obesity rates. Secondly, it could reduce the number of vehicles used for short business journeys; thereby reducing congestion and reducing pollution.",
        "background": "The current permitted Mileage Allowance Payment for business travel for the first 10,000 miles for bicycles are less than half the allowance for cars, while there is no tax refund for walking to your local business meeting instead of taking your car.",
