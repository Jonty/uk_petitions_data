        "action": "Ban leashing dogs by their collar, in favour of front-chest harnesses",
        "additional_details": "\"I have observed the relationships between the neck injuries and health of dogs, and learned that if the flow of energy in the neck is interrupted or restricted, a whole array of problems may arise, including lameness, skin issues, allergies, lung and heart problems, digestive issues, ear and eye conditions and thyroid gland dysfunctions. I also suspect that the patients who have severe energy flow congestion in the neck area have higher cancer rates\" - Dr. Peter Dobias, Holistic Veterinarian.",
        "background": "Being leashed by the neck puts pressure and damage on:\r\n\r\n- the trachea (windpipe)\r\n- the spinal cord \r\n- the vertebral discs, \r\n- the oesophagus (gullet)\r\n\r\nHarnesses offer better safety and comfort, alleviating pressure on the neck and also allowing the owner to better pull the dog from harms way.",
