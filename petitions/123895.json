        "additional_details": "Males of the egg laying breed do not gain weight fast enough to be raised profitably for meat.  Very few of them are needed for breeding future generations of laying hens, so killed shortly after birth. The problem of unwanted male chicks exists in all methods of egg production, from battery cages to organic. The British Egg Information Service says it is necessary to dispose of male chicks because they are no longer of used by the food industry, which uses birds specially bred to grow fast.\r\n",
        "background": "40 million chicks are shredded alive or gassed. After the chicks hatched \r\nthe birds are dropped onto a conveyor belt where they are sorted by sex. The males are either thrown alive into electronic mincers or instantly gassed to death, their bodies packaged to be fed to reptiles.\r\n",
