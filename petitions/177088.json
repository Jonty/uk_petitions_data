At the time of writing the post and its attendant link to his petition have been shared 263 times on Twitter and 724 times on Facebook. And it is flatly untrue.",
        "background": "\"Chris Packham is a BBC presenter.  Who voices his opposition to all the usual countryside activities from badger culling to grouse shooting and, of course, hunting. It is wrong that the BBC allow high profile employees to use it constantly to promote his personal beliefs with lies etc\r\n",
