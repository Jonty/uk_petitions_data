        "additional_details": "according to http://www.theecoexperts.co.uk, a 3 to 4 kW solar panel system will produce enough energy for a family sized home, while a 2 to 3 kW will typically be the right size for a smaller household. An average 4 kW solar panel system will generate around 3,400kWh of free electricity a year. They say this is enough for 4,857 hours of the washing machine, 97,143 hours of the fridge, 1,880 hours of boiling the kettle, 1,417 hours of the oven. ",
        "background": "With the planet slowly dying under our hands and our global resources running out I feel we should add solar panels too all newly built houses in the UK with a hope to increase renewable energy. ",
