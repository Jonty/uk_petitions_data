        "additional_details": "Today 1st March 2017, unelected officials within the House of Lords voted to impose conditions on the Article 50 Bill, which is inappropriate because the purpose of the Article 50 Bill is to trigger the start of withdrawal negotiations, and nothing more. This contradicts the result of the EU referendum, and does not reflect the overall will of the majority of the British people. \r\n",
        "background": "The House of Lords is comprised of unelected appointees, hereditary Lords, and bishops. This is no longer acceptable within 21st century society and no longer represents the will of the British people.",
