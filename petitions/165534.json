        "additional_details": "It has been argued that changing the name 'Team GB' to 'Team UK' will still leave athletes from the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands, Gibraltar & the Falklands, etc., excluded, but surely keeping a team name that excludes one of the four countries making up the United Kingdom is worse?\r\nThis is a very simple change which will be more inclusive, and 'UK' is already widely used in many aspects when referring to the country of The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.",
        "background": "'Team GB' does not represent the four countries of the United Kingdom, it excludes Northern Ireland despite the fact the full name is '\"Great Britain and Northern Ireland Olympic Team\"\r\n'Team GB' has only been in use since 1999 so changing it to 'Team UK' should not be dismissed on historic grounds.",
