        "action": "Make access to mains gas a legal right for all homes and properties in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Mains gas delivered via a pipeline would instantly remove the damage to the environment caused by the hundreds of millions of carbon related miles from delivery trucks polluting our towns and villages each and every year whilst travelling back and forth delivering alternative expensive fuels such as LPG and oil to off grid homes. These journeys will never stop, there is no alternative. Over 1 million properties many with children and older occupants have no access to mains gas. Thats just wrong.",
        "background": "Many families can't access mains gas & are forced to use more expensive forms of fuel for cooking and heating. The gas network often expands when new homes are built close to the existing network, however whole communities have been left behind because they are off grid, often only by a few miles. ",
