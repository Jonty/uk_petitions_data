They'd be less likely to quickly move or cause damage or infection and you'd know there allergies (I.e Gold) by then, a child should be able to ask, especially as if they choose they don't like them they'll be left with either holes or scars on their ears all because there parents pierced them without permission while so young. It's assault. ",
