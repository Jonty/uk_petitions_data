        "action": "Add political studies onto the national curriculum.",
        "additional_details": "Educating our young people on politics will help them in the future when it comes to voting and other matters that will affect them. Politics affects all of our lives, so it's something we should all be educated on.\r\n\r\nI am proposing that politics is put into the national curriculum in secondary schools. Please join me in my campaign to achieve this.",
        "background": "Politics is something that's incredibly important to everyone within society. Over the years, we've seen a lack of interest in politics among our young people, and this won't benefit anyone. Giving young people a knowledge of politics will allow them to be more educated on important future matters.",
