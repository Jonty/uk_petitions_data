        "action": "Reduce sewage pollution on UK beaches - abolish OFWAT.",
        "additional_details": "The U.K. has a large number of beaches that are classified as having poor water quality and many others are inadequately monitored at all.\r\nSewage and hospital waste contained within are often found within shellfish and bathing water samples. All could be reduced through investment in storage capacity and real time control rather than the current monitoring.\r\nWe truly need to forget the political sensitivity of the price of water and allow price increases to permit investment",
        "background": "Every year millions of cubic meters of sewage laden waters end up in our rivers and on beaches. The current regulations are monitoring and reporting driven and fail to focus on proactive reduction of spills. OFWAT is a regulator that is obsessed with price reduction and fails to tackle this issue",
