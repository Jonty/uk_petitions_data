You can use this page to find out how to start a petition on Manchester City Council\u2019s e-petition site:\r\nhttp://petitions.manchester.gov.uk/petitions.ti \r\n\r\nYou could also contact local councillors about this issue. You can use this page to find out who the local councillors are and how to contact them: \r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors \r\n\r\nThe court will have taken its decision on the basis of existing law. Parliament has the power to change the law. You could therefore start a petition calling on Parliament to change the law to protect the use of tents by homeless people. This would have an effect across the country, not just in Manchester. \r\n"
