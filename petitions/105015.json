        "additional_details": "We are petitioning to change this law to the following:\r\n\r\nLow stakes poker to be permitted in pubs but with stakes kept to: a \u00a310 Maximum per player with a \u00a3200 maximum pot, in social clubs: a \u00a320 maximum per player \u00a3500 maximum pot, with the correct gaming permit\" \r\n\r\nthe stake limit should now be raised as inflation no longer reflects the old limits set in the gambling act 2005\r\n\r\nWe believe that this change to the law would also benefit all UK pubs who are struggling to survive",
        "background": "Current law states that:\r\nLow stakes poker is permitted in pubs so long as stakes are kept to a maximum of \u00a35 per player and \u00a3100 total pot per premises per day\r\nLow stakes poker in social clubs with the correct gaming permit allows a maximum of \u00a310 per player and \u00a3250 total pot per premises per day",
