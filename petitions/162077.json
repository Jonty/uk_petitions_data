        "action": "Make it tougher for foreign buyers to purchase UK properties",
        "additional_details": "We ask that the needs of the British people be met first. A lot of foreign investment properties are empty when British workers are finding it harder and harder to even rent a place. \r\n\r\nCurrently UK property developers like to pre-sell their developments to overseas buyers because, unlike UK buyers, they pay a deposit of 20% even before the project has started. It helps to finance their projects but makes Brits second priority. ",
        "background": "Places like Denmark, Singapore, Hong Kong, Switzerland & Australia have made it much tougher or more expensive for foreign buyers to snap up homes. However, UK still allows foreigners to buy and sell properties as they wish, making profits but pushing up prices which many UK families cannot afford. ",
