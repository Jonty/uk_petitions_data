        "additional_details": "2 days ago the UK voted to leave the the European Union, 52% to leave and 48% to stay. In a Democratic County, when a Democratic vote was taken, the wishes of the winning vote must be accepted. If the result was to be revisited, how can the UK claim to be a Democratic country. In fact we would be no better that some of the dictatorships in other countries. The UK prides itself in being a totally democratic country and this petition is one way of showing this Democracy. ",
        "background": "Following the Democratic vote by the UK to leave the European Union, we now see on-line Government Petitions to re visit the decision and try and overturn a democratic vote. This is totally against all that a democratic vote stands for in a so called democratic Country.",
