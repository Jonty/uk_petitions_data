        "action": "Raise maximum sentencing on those committing vile racism offences on citizens.",
        "additional_details": "I can speak for the majority of people from both sides of the recent EU referendum who will condemn these vile attacks. Our country should be applauded and renowned for its diversity. Any form of racism against any citizen of any country residing in the UK should be deplored, and an increase in judicial sentencing on such crimes should be approved. Regardless of what world we live in, the UK should welcome all that arrive in this great democracy.",
        "background": "After recent events in the UK, a wave of hatred and racism has overshadowed the democracy to leave the EU. 100's of crimes of online and physical racism have been carried out particularly on EU citizens. With a new future for the country ahead, we need to stamp out this evil with increased severity.",
