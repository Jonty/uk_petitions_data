        "additional_details": "Many have noted that the decision to leave the EU was based on a very slim majority.\r\nAustralia and Switzerland, for example, require more than a simple, general majority for such a momentous change because the \"burden of proof\" to alter the status quo should be high for major constitutional matters.\r\nThe final outcome of Brexit negotiations should be weighed against the alternative of continued EU membership so that we can truly have confidence that the process has been in the UK's interest.",
        "background": "Major changes to Britain's status and future are in prospect following the EU referendum result and many of them are negative, perhaps more so than was apparent during flawed campaigning.\r\n",
