        "action": "Create non-geographical parliamentary \r\nconstituencies for our Armed Forces.",
        "additional_details": "Our Armed Forces deserve to elect their own MPs, rather than have them chosen by an electorate with little appreciation of service life and the conditions under which the military operate both here and abroad.\r\nWithout independent representation, or a formal federation, our Armed Forces are unable to make their views known in a coherent manner.  Non-geographical constituencies will enable service personnel to elect their own MPs, wherever they serve or live, and be seen as an identifiable entity.",
        "background": "Depending on individual circumstances, service personnel register to vote using an address which is either: their current address; one where they would reside but for their service, or a previous address. Thus personnel at any one location may be represented by MPs, from across the political divide.",
