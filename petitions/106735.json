        "action": "Review scientific evidence about cannabis and classification of the drug.",
        "additional_details": "The government stated the effects from cannabis are harmful. Other research contradicts. The government say the legalisation of cannabis will create healthcare problems and put a strain on the health system. Elsewhere people use cannabis all over the world with good effects, treating medical problems.\r\nHistory proves government findings are ambiguous and misleading to the public. Previously lying about effects.\r\nFurthermore they (including David Cameron) have admitted the war on drugs is failing.",
        "background": "A previous petition to legalise cannabis was rejected due to the scientific evidence suggesting it causes harmful effects to the body. I call for a review into this evidence, to look at and study more recent research, alongside an independent study being conducted.",
