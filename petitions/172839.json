        "additional_details": "North Sea Oil reserves are dwindling but still generate sizeable revenue for the UK Government.  This should be directly invested via a National Wealth Fund with the long term view of funding all pensions. A generous slice of all fuel duty receipt's should also be invested in said fund! As we explore Fracking, NOW is  the time to plan ahead for how revenues will be used! Looking at countries like Norway, Singapore and Qatar, A Sovereign Wealth Fund is long overdue for a country as rich as the UK.",
        "background": "Norway's Sovereign Wealth fund is the worlds largest, with over $700bn in assets - this equates to about \u00a3130,000 for each Norwegian citizen. Singapore also provides another example that the UK could emulate. Primary function of said fund is to finance Pensions for an increasingly aging population.",
