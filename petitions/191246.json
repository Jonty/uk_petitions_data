        "action": "Make all naturally medicinal drugs legal: Cannabis, Magic Mushrooms & DMT.",
        "additional_details": "Even though there are risks to these drugs, they are a lot safer than Alcohol & Cigerettes. Imagine cutting down trees because people may fall out of them? Thats the current logic as to why they are illegal. You cant be fully safe with anything but you can be INFORMED. Once these are decriminalised they should make it okay for us to grow them ourselves or for us to be able to go down the road and pop into a cafe with an age restriction, add tax to the price so then money is being put to good use",
        "background": "First of all, the human experience is a living drug, our emotions & feelings are made up of chemicals and drugs in our brain. Naturally occurring drugs are there to help us heal ourselves and to reconnect with nature. Why allow man-made smoking but forbid what has grown on earth naturally for us?",
