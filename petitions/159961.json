We have seen a startling rise in both reported and unreported acts of hatred and violence towards sections of our communities \"identified\" by offenders as \"Non-British\". Whilst millions of British people may have voted to leave the EU, they do not, and would never, condone this behaviour. We all, and our government has an irrefutable responsibility to challenge and prevent these deplorable acts, with all the force of the law.",

Police and the Judiciary should be provided all necessary resources to investigate and prosecute offences. ",
