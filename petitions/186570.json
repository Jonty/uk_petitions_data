A lot of people support themselves but cannot be given more help due to parents. Change the rules on applying to just look at the students income and financial situation. ",
        "background": "When applying for a student loan you have to give your parents financial information even if they do not support you financially, meaning a lot of people get given the minimum for student finance and then have to struggle for the year. Change this so that it looks at your own financial situation. ",
