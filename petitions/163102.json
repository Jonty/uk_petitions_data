        "action": "We ask for an independent review of the validity of the EU referendum franchise.",
        "additional_details": "UK expatriate citizens residing abroad for 15 years or more were excluded from voting in the EU referendum, in contravention of their human rights, as laid out in Article 21 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights of December 10, 1948 (General Assembly resolution 217(III) A). We believe this disenfranchisement to be unacceptable, since these UK citizens are among the most directly and adversely affected by the referendum outcome.",
        "background": "Many UK expats were disenfranchised from the referendum, violating Art.21 of the UN Declaration on Human Rights. We call for an independent inquiry into the validity of the referendum electoral roll and for further government consideration of EU exit to be postponed until its finding is made public.",
