        "additional_details": "we have a great benefits system that is here to help British citizens, the system was not put in place to pay people money for doing nothing, if an immigrant wants to claim any benefits they should have been living, working and paying tax into the system for 4 years minimum before they can claim any benifits.",
        "background": "this is one of the big reasons why people chose to voted out of the EU, we have now chosen to leave the EU and we should no longer be giving immigrants housing benefits, working tax credits or job seekers allowance from a system that they have never paid into. This should be stoped immediately.",
