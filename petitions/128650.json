We hear professionals complaining of midweek games. Yet we have 2 in 3 days. \r\n\r\nEveryone suffers. Players, managers, referees & most of all, the standard of play.\r\n\r\nPlease consider:\r\n\r\na) Starting new seasons weeks after the end of the previous.\r\n\r\nb) No football over winter period.\r\n\r\nLet common sense prevail. \r\n\r\nPlease support by signing\r\n",
        "background": "Yet again this season we have been unable to play every week due to adverse weather conditions. A handful of games since December is all we have mustered. This is something that happens every season. \r\n\r\nThe amateur associations must act and change season dates. Summer play is a necessity. ",
