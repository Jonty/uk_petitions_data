        "action": "Repeal the decision that forces hospitals to stop providing heart surgery.",
        "additional_details": "If a standard of care is deemed unsatisfactory every effort should be made to raise that standard considerably to save lives. Our government shouldn't be abandoning people with heart disorders and rejecting the phenomenal work of those doctors who strive to provide the best care for their patients. This decision will also force patients and their families to travel great and costly distances. The government is putting lives at an even greater risk by shutting down these services.",
        "background": "Three hospitals in Leicester, Manchester and London have just been ordered to stop surgery on patients born with heart disorders by April 2017. This puts the lives of many patients at risk. Force our government to invest in heart units and not to abandon those, like me, with heart conditions.\r\n",
