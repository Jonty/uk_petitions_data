        "additional_details": "So much grammar is being shoe-horned into primary writing that the result is stressed educators, anxious children and unnatural writing.  Many parents themselves are unaware of what is expected of their children and are therefore unable to support them effectively. ",
        "background": "Because standards of grammar dropped over recent years, educators are now expected to cover the majority of the curriculum for grammar over Key Sages 1 and 2 (ages 5-11).  This material should be spread over the 4 Key Stages.  ",
