They are not part of the court system in this country and have no means of enforcing their decisions. If any of the decisions or recommendations they make are contrary to national law (including the Equality Act 2010) then national law prevails. This is no different to any other council or tribunal - whether or not based on Sharia principles.\r\n\r\nYou can read the full response here:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/archived/petitions/48352\r\n\r\nIt is therefore not clear what action you would like the Government to take, since Sharia councils already operate under British law in the UK. \r\n"
