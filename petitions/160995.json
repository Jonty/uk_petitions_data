        "action": "Bring back Spitting Image to satirize the political class",
        "additional_details": "The basis of this petition is the lack of accountability of the political class. Currently, the only readily available political satire in the mainstream television media is the long running Have I Got News for You. We the undersigned believe this is insufficient in light of the current political situation. Further, we believe that the commissioning a new series of Spitting Image should be not be awarded to the BBC, but to ITV, Channel 4 or Sky. ",
        "background": "We believe that that political satire is underrepresented in the mainstream media and that the halcyon days of Spitting Image in the 1980 and 1990's need to be returned to our television screens, especially in light of the current political turmoil, Brexit and the schism in the Labour Party.",
