        "additional_details": "Many British expatriates living in the EU are elderly, in need of regular healthcare and living on a fixed income. \r\nIf they lose the right to use the health system within the countries in which they are domiciled they will inevitably either have to take out expensive health insurance that they can ill afford or return to the UK for treatment, adding further pressure on an already overburdened NHS.\r\nExpats who were residents of other EU nations at the time of the Referendum should retain their right to healthcare in those countries.\r\n",
        "background": "As part of the Brexit negotiations the UK Government should ensure that British expatriates who were residents of other EU countries at the time of the Referendum vote, should retain their rights to healthcare in their countries of residency.\r\n\r\n",
