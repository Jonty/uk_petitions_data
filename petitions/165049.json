        "additional_details": "As further evidence I would like to quote some versus from the Qur\u2019an: \r\n\r\n6:151 says, \u201cand do not kill a soul that God has made sacrosanct, save lawfully.\u201d\r\n\r\n5:53 says, \u201c\u2026 whoso kills a soul, unless it be for murder or for wreaking corruption in the land, it shall be as if he had killed all mankind; and he who saves a life, it shall be as if he had given life to all mankind.\u201d",
        "background": "The use of the term \"Islamist Terrorism\" should be banned as it is not approperiate and primarily is derogatory to Islam. The first reason is that \"-ist\" is added to verbs to form a noun that shows they do something, like a \"motorist\". Secondly, any terrorist is not part of any religion.",
