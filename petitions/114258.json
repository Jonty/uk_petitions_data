        "additional_details": "I believe that the people of this country are able to make up their own minds with regards to going to war.  In recent history we have been lied to about the reasons we have gone to war, which is quite simply, unacceptable.\r\n\r\nIf the government has a particular issue it will have to put that across to us.  Hopefully in a responsible, non-scaremongering way.",
        "background": "I believe that going to war is such a major thing, causing death and destruction, that we as a country should get to vote.  It will be our money paying for the war, bombs/planes, and we spend billions of pounds, and the government is currently cutting all of our public services.",
