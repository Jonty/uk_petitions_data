However, the implication of a leave vote was not clear at the time, given that a withdrawal agreement had not yet been negotiated. Therefore, we the undersigned call for HM Government to hold a second EU referendum to allow the British people the opportunity to decide whether they, when presented with a negotiated withdrawal agreement, now wish to remain in the EU or proceed with leaving the EU.",
