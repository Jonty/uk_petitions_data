        "additional_details": "This taints the reputation of both Houses, makes a mockery of reforms following the \"expenses\" scandal and sets the dangerous precedent of placing parliamentarians' expenses beyond public scrutiny or prosecution.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we call on both Houses to debate and reform the practical application of \"parliamentary privilege\" in cases of prosecutable false accounting or fraud. Also, along with this, members subsequently convicted in the courts should automatically be deprived of their seats/titles.",
