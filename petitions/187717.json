        "additional_details": "IPCC report Stockwell One published in 2007 details Dick's role http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100908152737/http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/stockwell_one.pdf In particular para 20.47 on page 127. Dick gave the order to stop which was interpreted by armed police as the command to shoot to kill. Rudd announced appointment of Dick as Met Commissioner on 22 Feb 2017.",
        "background": "Cressida Dick was operational commander on 22 July 2005, day of the fatal shooting of innocent Jean Charles de Menezes at Stockwell underground. Dick's role then makes her unsuitable to become Met Commissioner nor can she command public confidence. We call on Amber Rudd to recall her appointment.",
