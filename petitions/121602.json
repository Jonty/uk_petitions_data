        "additional_details": "I work supporting people with learning disabilities and their families.  Government financial policy is undermining our ability to support people properly giving them dignity and human rights.  I believe that any MP who worked with people would appreciate the positive inspiration they are to others and see people as a gift not a cost.  In other sectors the whole sense of what is important and of value would change.  Our leaders would lead from lived experience rather than mental guesses.",
        "background": "People who actually do the work - eg: teaching, fishing, being creative - have real insight into what works and what doesn't work. Let's our ministers that hands on experience and set of real relationships.  Then perhaps they would make wiser policy decisions which work with people and our values.",
