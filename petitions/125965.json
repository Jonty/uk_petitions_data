        "additional_details": "The UK ranks 137th out of 138 when it comes to air ticket taxes and charges - 2015 World Economic Forum\u2019s Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report.\r\n\r\nOnly six EU countries levy a similar tax, but with substantially lower rates than those in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe high charges of APD are severely hindering economic growth in the UK's Transport and Leisure Industry. In order to boost economic growth and improve competitiveness in the market, I urge the UK government to scrap APD.",
        "background": "Air Passenger Duty (APD) is the UK Government tax that is currently being charged on all passengers departing from a UK airport. Which since introduction in 1994, has risen by up to 539%.\r\n\r\nAbolishing APD would see a significant increase in the UK\u2019s GDP as well as the creation thousands of jobs. ",
