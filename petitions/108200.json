        "additional_details": "VAT is a sales tax. Sales taxes most affect those who consume the most - the poorest people in our society.\r\n\r\nGiven that inflation in times to come will also reduce spending power, measures like the minimum wage and tax credits are short term patches to the cost of living problem.\r\n\r\nReducing costs by reducing taxation and thus the role of government will negate need for these measures and allow us to stop tolerating their adverse affects like youth unemployment and downward pressure on wages.",
        "background": "There is a cost of living crisis in the UK. One of the reasons for everything costing so much is taxation. By scrapping VAT, the price of many goods and services will be reduced by 20% which will drastically improve the spending power of all citizens and directly address the problem.",
