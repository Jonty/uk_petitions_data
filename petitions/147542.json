        "additional_details": "I believe that if you have a baby more than 10 weeks early that has a long hospital stay, you should be able to apply for extended maternity pay and not start your official maternity leave till your baby is home so that you get the same privilege as a mum who has a full term baby with 9months paid at home with your child.",
        "background": "After having a premature baby at 26+1 gestation and having spent 13 weeks in hospital. That's a third of my maternity leave used without having my baby home. Many other mums have the same problem not being able to take the unpaid leave due to not being able to afford it. ",
