        "additional_details": "Working up to 100 hours, the Carer's Allowance equates to 62p per hour, in contrast to the minimum wage of \u00a37.20 per hour. The burden of caring is great, with 625,000 carers suffering from mental or physical illnesses - around the population of Glasgow. The problem will only get worse with 6,000 people becoming carers every day - these people need help now.",
        "background": "There are an estimated 6.5 million carers in the UK, meaning that 1 in 10 people have caring duties. Unpaid carers save the UK government \u00a3119 billion per year, more than is spent on the NHS. To receive the carers allowance, you must care for 35 hours a week, when many care for 100 hours or more.",
