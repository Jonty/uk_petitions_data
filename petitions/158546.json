        "action": "Call a General Election once the new Conservative leader has been selected.",
        "additional_details": "For better or worse, if the UK leaves the EU, we will be entering an unfamiliar economic and diplomatic landscape. A General Election would give the nation an opportunity to debate the implications of the vote and our place in the world. It may not be legally required but, given the vast implications of the referendum result, a General Election is surely a moral and democratic necessity. The future direction of the whole country should not be decided by the members of any single political party.",
        "background": "The EU referendum result has left the current government with no backup plan. This petition therefore asks for a General Election to be called so that the parties can set out their positions with regard to EU negotiations. The new government can then go forward with a new mandate and clear plans.",
