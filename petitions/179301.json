        "additional_details": "Dividing communities and creating an illusion of a war with Islam will provide \"evidence\" for those trying to recruit followers to terrorist groups. The ban could cause even those whose inclination is against violence to reconsider. It also introduces a dangerous direction of movement for the country which likes to be considered the leader of the free world. The sporting boycott showed South Africa how strongly the world disapproved of apartheid. A sporting Boycott of America would do the same.",
        "background": "The US ban on muslim entry ignores several elements of The Geneva convention on Human rights:  \"freedom of thought, conscience and religion\" , \"equality before the law\" and \"presumption of innocence until proven guilty\". The ban will be used as \"evidence\" to incite and recruit potential terrorists.",
