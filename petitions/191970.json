        "action": "Reform both Houses of Parliament to 301 elected members in each house.",
        "additional_details": "The plethora of lucrative jobs now held by George Osborne has precipitated me to address this clear iniquity in the way the so called cost cutting of public services to balance our public deficit was carried out by the previous coalition government. Although many of the UK\u2019s vital public services were reduced by up to 25%, MP numbers remained constant throughout; could it be that parliamentary service is not regarded as public service? Government must show true leadership in this regard.",
        "background": "Many MPs have jobs other than their parliamentary work. They are clearly under-employed and open to the charge of lack of neutrality owing to their vested interests in their outside employment. Rewards for devoted service to the government should be adequate to ensure no need to earn elsewhere.",
