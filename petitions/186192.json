        "additional_details": "I am seeing more and more cases of people being seriously injured, disfigured, left with brain damage and killed because of this accepted culture of violence.\r\n\r\nSuch attacks are clearly life threatening. I myself have had my skull broken in half from such an attack but was lucky enough to not have any visible damage.\r\n\r\nThose who have been proven to stamp on a victim's head should be subjected to a mandatory attempted murder charge. This is the only way to stop it before it gets any worse.",
        "background": "There is a culture of violence that is growing in today's society whereby stamping on someone's head is perfectly normal during an assault. \r\n\r\nThis is literally trying to kill. Anyone who claims they don't think it is life threatening is a liar. \r\n\r\nThose who do it, do it often",
