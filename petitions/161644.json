        "additional_details": "On average over 30% of sales fall through each year in England, the knock on effect of this can ruin people\u2019s lives. Almost every country around the world other than England dictates that both, buyers and sellers have to pay a NON refundable deposit to secure the property. If either party withdraw the deposit is forfeited. In England a buyer or seller can pull out up to the day of exchange. One thoughtless person can ruin people\u2019s lives with no consequence. Let's put a stop to it.",
        "background": "I have been working in the property industry since 2000 and now own my own Estate Agency firm. Over the last 16 years I have seen thousands of people who have been messed around by buyers and sellers alike. This has resulted in heartache, stress and the loss of substantial amounts of money.",
