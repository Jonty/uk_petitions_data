The reasons for delays are blamed on lack of staff due to sickness however conversations have been had with staff who have turned up to the same announcement as customers and are shocked that this is what is happening and people are being lied to. On 27/06/2016 trains were subject to cancellations or delays of an hour plus. Clearly there are internal politics at play and it should be put to an end, customers come first!",
