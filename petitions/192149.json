        "additional_details": "If you were to sit at 70MPH on the Motorway, you know that you would be overtaken, safely, by a whole manner of people, driving a whole host of cars. This shows that the maximum speed limits are outdated.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for the increasing of National Motorway speed limits, and A-Road speed limits (where appropriate) to 80MPH.",
        "background": "The Motorway speed limit has remained unchanged since 1965. Since then, cars are much more capable at higher speeds, and safer in the event of an accident. ",
