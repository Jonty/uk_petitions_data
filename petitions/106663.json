        "additional_details": "I can't vote, I can't buy alcohol, I can't apply for certain jobs, I can't go to nightclubs or age-restricted venues, I can't view 18 films, I can't buy 18 games - therefore why charge me for public transport as if I am 18? Why take advantage of the fact I am 16 or 17?\r\n\r\nIf it's not possible to change 16/17 year olds paying adult fares, I would like to see the introduction of a 'teen' fare for public transport.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
        "background": "As a 16 year old I am not legally an adult, and do not have adult rights - so why am I being made to pay adult fares on public transport? If I get a train from Portsmouth to London I have to pay just over \u00a330, whereas a 15 year old will pay \u00a38 for a return.",
