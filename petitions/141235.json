        "additional_details": "In the Scottish Referendum in 2014 the UK Government gave young persons aged 16 and 17 years the right to participate. This proved to be a resounding success. In terms of consistency there is no reason why this age group should not have had a say in the EU Referendum. They have both the right and ability to participate fully and responsibly in the democratic process of a EU Referendum.",
        "background": "The outcome of the EU Referendum will have a profound effect on the livelihoods of all UK citizens for decades to come, particularly on our young. It is only right and democratic that those aged 16 and 17 years are given a say in such a momentous decision.",
