        "action": "Revision of Universal Credit system for people with mental health issues",
        "additional_details": "Not only is the application process difficult to complete once the claim is running unlike ESA that respected a GP's fit note Universal Credit expects you to fulfil commitments some of which are unrealistic, for example arrangement of face-to-face interview at the job centre for somebody suffering from agoraphobia... If commitments are not adhered to then you are sanctioned ...i am sure you get the picture and ask you to please support this petition.",
        "background": "Currently the Government is in the process of transfer all authorities from ESA to Universal Credit.  Therefore, people with mental health issues are struggling to get the financial support they are entitled to as with the new system focuses on work rather than understanding of mental health needs.",
