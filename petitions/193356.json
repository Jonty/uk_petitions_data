It stays with them all their lives yet the animal that committed it will be out of jail in usually less than 2 years. It has become the norm for a paedophilia to recieve low term times - why? But we just let it happen? Well I'm not anymore. \r\nI've once wrote to a judge over a low jail term and he replied it was the government who term the time - let's make them change it!",
        "background": "I am so concerned by the lack of jail term time pedophiles receive after committing horrendous crimes against young children. Other crimes such as drug dealing and armed robbery, whilst still awful crimes, receive a much higher custodial sentence- why? I believe there should be a minimum term set.",
