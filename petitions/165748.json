        "additional_details": "Please see option details and maps at\r\nwww.highways.gov.uk>roads>a27-chichester \r\nPlease take note of the costs, the saving on journey times, environmental impact and the time taken to build the \"improvements\" with the subsequent traffic congestion. Although the southern options are cheaper than a northern bypass they will all be unable to cope within a few years and the whole process will begin again.\r\nPlease help our small voices be heard by joining this petition.\r\nMany thanks for your interest.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The A27 is a major road connecting the towns and cities of the South Coast. At Chichester the A27 is a dual carriageway to the south which frequently becomes gridlocked. A northern bypass proposal, popular with residents, has been dropped and voting is only on the inferior southern options.\r\n\r\n",
