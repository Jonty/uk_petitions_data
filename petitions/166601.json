        "additional_details": "Clinical trials such as MAGENTA still use graded exercise therapy, even in children, but are being justified on the basis of the flawed PACE trial. Scientists have severely criticised PACE, the major adult trial that claimed the therapy to be safe and effective. Thousands have demanded retraction of PACE\u2019s \u201cmisleading\u201d analyses and 24 ME/CFS charities from 14 countries demanded that its data be released for reanalysis. PACE is no basis for a trial in children or adults. Read more at stopGET.org ",
        "background": "In surveys hundreds of patients have reported harm \u2014 some becoming housebound or bedbound, indefinitely \u2014 from graded exercise therapy (GET). The Government must demand that research and funding bodies suspend all trials of graded exercise therapy for ME/CFS until the evidence has been reassessed.",
