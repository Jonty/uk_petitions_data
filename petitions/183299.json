        "additional_details": "Mary was not allowed to call witnesses or take notes during her trial. She was kept in English prisons without trial for nearly twenty years.\r\nShe was accused of writing letters to supposedly accused plotters who were tortured and executed and the original supposed letters were never produced then or today. False letters were produced in the court 1586 written by a scribe and Mary denied writing them.\r\nHer execution is the greatest scandal in English Justice.",
        "background": "Mary Queen of Scots was beheaded 08/02/87 because of false allegations of treason by the most corrupt regime in English history with a parcel of rogues and liars and the brutal Tudors who were eradicated. She was also betrayed by the Protestants of Scotland who destroyed Scottish Cathedrals. ",
