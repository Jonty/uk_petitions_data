        "additional_details": "Why do people think it is acceptable for hounds to rip a live fox apart for fun after chasing it until it's too tired to run anymore? It makes me sick! Foxes are beautiful and they deserve to live just like we do. If you hurt foxes you should be sent to prison FULL STOP!",
        "background": "I am asking you to please sign my petition to stop any killing, hunting and hurting of foxes in the UK. It upsets me so much and a lot of other people also. Hunting with hounds is still happening, and other horrific deaths due to traps and nasty people.",
