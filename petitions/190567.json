        "additional_details": "Driving regularly on the M1 , I notice that there is rarely workers on the Motorway 50MPH zone that stretches for 15 miles. In order to speed up journeys and avoid congestion, put the speed limit back to 70mph when there is no workers there. This will help speed up journeys and eliminate frustration for drivers as they are stuck driving at 50MPH on the UK motorways with no reason. ",
        "background": "Most long journeys spent on UK motorways you come across 50MPH zones which rarely have workers on it. Why not make the 50MPH limit redundant when workers aren't present and put the speed limit back to 70MPH.",
