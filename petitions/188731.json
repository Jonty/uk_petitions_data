Then another test for the A1 licence that is for a 125 AGAIN. what consists of a theory test, a module 1 and a module 2, and then they have to wait to be older anyway to go for the A2 licence what again consists of a module 1 & a module 2 , then for the full A licence they must do ANOTHER! module 1 and module 2 test, and to prepare for the tests, training is needed consisting at least 5 lessons costing a bomb! and takes up alot your time. It's over kill",
