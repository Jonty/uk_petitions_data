        "additional_details": "Karen Partington, CEO @ Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS trust stated  'It is accurate to say that this issue has not arisen overnight.  We identified the emergency department staffing situation as a risk to safe and sustainable service provision in 2012'.  17 May 2016\r\n\r\nOn 13th April 2016, it was announced that A&E department would be downgraded to an Urgent Care Centre. LTH said the A&E department would reopen in August but have now confirmed it will stay closed until a review in April 2017\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The buck stops with the CEO and board of LTH for the situation facing the A&E dept @ Chorley & South Ribble Hospital. The current situation is due to a collective failure of planning, organising and management on the part of the trusts leadership team. As such, their positions have become untenable.",
