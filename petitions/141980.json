        "action": "David Cameron to withdraw his resignation & remain Prime minister of the UK",
        "additional_details": "Mr Cameron has been in office during times of austerity, and has experienced a number of difficult challenges during this period of uncertainty. I do however consider Mr Cameron as a person who represents the people of Great Britain, and consider him a great ambassador in every sense.  I do not understand why Mr Cameron's wish to 'Remain' within the EU has to have a bearing on his future as leader of the UK and would like him to retract his decision to resign.",
        "background": "Following the UK's decision to leave the EU, David Cameron has decided to resign as Prime Minister.  Whilst the people of the UK voted to leave the EU contrary to Mr Cameron's 'Remain' Campaign, I believe that Mr Cameron is by far the best man to lead the UK through this transitional process.",
