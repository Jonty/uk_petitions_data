        "action": "Cyclist using the public highway should complete Compulsory basic training(CBT)",
        "additional_details": "The statistic shows only 1% of road users are motorcyclist, they have to go through CBT, theory and a 2 part practical exam. This is similar to road users in a car. It makes perfect sense for cyclist to go through Compulsory basic training (CBT) course before one can cycle on public roads. I think this would greatly decrease the number of deaths on the road for cyclists. Its ok putting cycle lanes everywhere & such but its teaching people how to behave on the road and respect other road users.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "A lot of cycling friendly improvement has been made over the years, but the fundamental issue on safety in public roads lies in the knowledge and the experience of the road users. Many cyclist have limited knowledge of the highway code (unless motorist) and often disregards the rules of the road.\r\n",
