        "additional_details": "In a period when the Government is making cutbacks everywhere to save money, it appears that the only people unaffected by austerity measures are MP's.\r\nThe population of the USA is 320 million but they get by with 435 congressmen, ( their equivalent to an MP) leaving an average of approx 750,000 people per congressman.\r\nThe UK has 650 MP's  but a population of only 65 million, (an average of 100,000 people per MP).\r\nSurely 250 MP's should be sufficient.",
        "background": "There are far too many MP's, most of them underoccupied when they have time to dedicate to company directorships and obtaining cash for questions in addition to numerous other methods of feathering their own nests.",
