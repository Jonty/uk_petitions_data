        "additional_details": "The people who assess  that petition have already found and removed over 77,000 signatures as being false. If the referendum was fair and legal then there can be no reason to allow another referendum. The figures for the referendum should stand. If people change their minds it should never be a valid reason for a 2nd referendum.",
        "background": "Its shown that the petition for a 2nd referendum on the EU has signatures from people outside the UK,and non-British people,  and therefore should be withdrawn as it will be impossible to pinpoint everyone of these people therefore will  be fraudulent. Referendum was fair and legal and should stand.",
