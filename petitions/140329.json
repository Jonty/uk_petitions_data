        "additional_details": "If those signing a petition for another referendum just because they didn't get their way want the UK to stay in Europe then they should have got more of their friends to vote the same way. The bottom line is, the British people turned out and voted for the referendum. The decision was that we should leave the EU. This decision must be honoured by our MPs and without endless further referendums or silly petitions.",
        "background": "On 23rd June, Britain held a referendum on whether or not to leave the EU. A decision was made to leave. We should ensure that Brexit goes ahead without interference from \"remain\" MPs or those petitioning for another referendum. A decision was made and that decision should be honoured.",
