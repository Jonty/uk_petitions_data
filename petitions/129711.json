        "additional_details": "Attention is key while driving and smoking distracts you fully from the road. It should not be allowed to promote safety in cars and also healthier living in the population.",
        "background": "Using a mobile phone behind the wheel in the UK is banned because it's distracting and causes accidents, so why isn't smoking behind the wheel illegal too. It's dangerous for drivers as only one hand is likely to be present, but also distracting to roll, find and light a cigarette.",
