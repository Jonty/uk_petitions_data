        "action": "Take NHS control away from the Government of the day",
        "additional_details": "Interest rates fluctuations have significantly reduced since the Bank of England took control of it as they are above politics and are not politically motivated for short term \"wins\" .\r\n\r\nI believe by adopting this principal, there is more chance of making the efficiency savings required whilst improving the service levels to the public",
        "background": "Policies and targets are politically motivated by the sitting government and seldom have chance to be tested due to changing political parties/policies following elections.  I propose a cross party group takes control for setting NHS policies/budgets so they are given time to be implemented in full",
