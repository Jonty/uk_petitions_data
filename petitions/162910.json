People in Europe are applying for gun permits in droves and can only use those guns to defend themselves at home and left defenceless in the streets.",
        "background": "Enough people are dead in Europe and the time to act is upon us. GCHQ has done an amazing job at preventing terror attacks in the UK but the police cannot possibly act fast enough to save us all in case of attack by terror groups. We propose a government measure to allow civilians to keep handguns.",
