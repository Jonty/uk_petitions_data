        "additional_details": "I am calling for this petition as today my health visitor advised me that my child who was born just above the 75th centile for weight and above the 98th centile for height is \"overweight\".  (Despite being breastfed on demand for 16 months of his life, as per best advice to breastfeed for the first year.)\r\nDespite this the Health Visitor tells me that at any contact with a health professional we are likely to be advised about regulating his weight. ",
        "background": "Infants and Children's weight in the UK is measured on an outdated growth chart formulated in 1988 based on formula fed babies and children in 1988. This is wrongly leading to children and babies being \"labelled\" as obese from birth.",
