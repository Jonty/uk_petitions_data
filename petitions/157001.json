        "additional_details": "I believe that it was morally irresponsible to hold a referendum before the terms of EU exit were more clearly mapped out. Whilst the EU are apparently resisting any negotiation until we trigger Article 50, I believe that in practice there will be a lot more facts on the table before we get to an irreversible point in the process.  We deserve an opportunity to have our say on these facts, since both Leavers and Remainers may have a different opinion when terms of exit are clearer.",
        "background": "The referendum was held before any negotiations (or negotiation planning) had taken place. We were put in the position of having to \u2018guess\u2019 the consequences, or rely on campaign messages which have since proven to be unreliable. Voters deserve the chance to vote on the \u2018reality\u2019 not the \u2018fantasy\u2019.",
