Whilst the majority of paying parents have no issue paying maintenance, it is unfair and unjust that payments do not take into account the financial circumstances of either the paying or the receiving parent.  ",
        "background": "The service levels offered by the Child Maintenance Service are exceptionally poor, staff are unhelpful and do not carry out instructions within reasonable timescales.  Also, the use of Gross Income in the calculations is unfair and takes no account of paying parents financial circumstances.",
