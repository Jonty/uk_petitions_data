        "additional_details": "Many football pitches are (water logged/on a hill/dangerous/ridden with dog muck) despite there being record breaking amounts of money in the English Premier league. \u00a31.165bn spent to date this season already. Health of kids would increase from these pitches as would anti-social behaviour in communities. National football team would benefit as more children given opportunity to play on 'fit for purpose' pitches and fulfill their potential.",
