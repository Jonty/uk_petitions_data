        "additional_details": "Assumptions of HS2 economic projections are based on London being at focal point of connection between UK & other European countries. Logic may now not hold true.\r\nUntil full scale of Brexit negotiations are known economic case for HS2 is tenuous.\r\nIf after Brexit negotiations on UK leaving EU, Scotland negotiates to remain part of EU, perfectly conceivable Edinburgh & Glasgow could become significant economic hubs in their own right. Trade is more likely to flow via Scotland in such a scenario.",
        "background": "Economic case for HS2 can't be justified until all Brexit negotiations complete & or 2nd referendum.\r\nUnder Brexit if carried out, London may no longer retain hub status. If Scotland negotiates to remain in EU, strong economic case for HS2 Phase1 connecting northern England with Edinburgh & Glasgow",
