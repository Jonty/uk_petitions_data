        "action": "Instruct David Cameron to either Invoke Article 50 or resign immediately",
        "additional_details": "We need strong decisive leadership, a clear strategy and a government capable of delivering it.  \r\n\r\nAfter Article 50 we have 2 years to negotiate terms.  This is long enough for a skilled & experienced team.\r\n\r\nWithout immediate action the referendum result could be buried by bureaucracy and subterfuge \u2013 like the Chilcot report (still unpublished 13 years after the UK invaded Iraq).  Democracy will not be served.\r\n\r\nWe call on David Cameron to either Invoke Article 50 or to resign IMMEDIATELY.",
        "background": "In the BREXIT referendum the UK people voted to leave the EU.  \r\nDavid Cameron had made a commitment to begin the process of exit straight away if this happened.\r\n\r\nHe has now reneged on this commitment and plunged the UK into a limbo land of fear and uncertainty.",
