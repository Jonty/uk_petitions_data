        "action": "We the undersigned hereby request a vote of NO CONFIDENCE in the Prime Minister.",
        "additional_details": "During the election the Prime Minister insisted he could reform or get reform from the EU concerning the UK and its interests. Did he stake his reputation on it? Any decision made by a foreign government that affects UK sovereignty is imposed against the wishes of the people. (e.g. TTIP) Cyprus and Greece were both punished for standing up to the EU.  The 800 million EU public did NOT vote for Juncker. The EU is therefore not democratic, nor does it treat members equally. ",
        "background": "Due to the bias displayed by the Prime Minister over the EU we request he resign with immediate effect.",
