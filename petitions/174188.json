        "additional_details": "Bank notes must be made in an ethical manner, so that they can reasonably be used by the millions of British people who live their lives actively avoiding being complicit in the exploitation of animals or the cruel treatment of animals- including unknowing exposure to any products contaminated by using the flesh or fat or bones from animals, including those killed using the cruel Halal slaughter method.\r\nIt is wrong that bank notes contain any animal product or allergens.",
        "background": "The Bank of England has confirmed that the polymer pellet from which the base substrate is made contains a trace of a substance known as tallow. Tallow is derived from animal fats (suet) and is a substance that is also widely used in the manufacture of candles and soap.",
