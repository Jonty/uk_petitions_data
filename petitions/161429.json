        "additional_details": "Each year an estimated 100-200 million sharks are caught for their fins, which often go into the Asian delicacy 'fin soup'. Sharks have been populating our oceans since before the dinosaurs and we can't lose them now. Sharks also play a crucial role in the ecosystem of the ocean by eating sick and dead animals and keeping the seas healthy. By saving sharks we save the oceans and the planet. Shark finning has no place in our modern world and must stop before we lose this ancient species forever.",
        "background": "Shark numbers are declining due to shark finning - this is when a live shark is taken out of the ocean to have its fin cut off and then thrown back into the water. A shark needs its fin to swim and ultimately to survive. Without it the shark soon dies as it can no longer fend for itself.",
