        "additional_details": "Only today two trains have been cancelled on the southern network. The 08:09 Southampton central & 08:30 Chichester. Many people rely on these services including school children who may be left venerable waiting on platforms when their parents are expecting them at a different time. This is a shocking service and needs to be resolved.",
        "background": "This year many trains have been cancelled by this company outside of industrial action. The company have cited staff shortages. But this is happening every day of every week. Surely their planning &/or HR department should & could have seen this coming. ",
