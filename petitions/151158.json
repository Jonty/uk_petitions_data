        "additional_details": "We saw during the EU referendum over a million Spanish expats (selfishly) tried to vote 'stay' in Europe purely because they wanted to keep their NHS benefits abroad! Not for the good of the country.\r\n\r\nSign if you believe British Expats who do not live or pay Tax in the Britain should NOT be able to vote in Britain!\r\n",
        "background": "Just over 4.5 million Britons live abroad with approximately 1.3 million of them in Europe. Allowing them to vote on British issues severely alters the results of elections and referendums.\r\nIf Britain isn't good enough for them to live or pay Tax in then why should they have a say in how it is run?",
