        "additional_details": "A gang of teens stole and tortured a small dog named Chunky. This dog was fed drugs, kicked, punched, burned and they snapped his neck, before leaving him for dead. Luckily, he was found and taken to the RSPCA and the teens were charged with the disqualification from keeping animals for the next 5 years, a 1 year youth referral order and the father of one of the youths was charged with a fee of \u00a35,791.50. Miraculously, Chunky survived, however, months later the attack still traumatised him-RSPCA",
        "background": "Animals are being abandoned and abused each day. These innocent creatures are being abused in ways that spread from being maliciously tortured to being deprived of water, food, shelter and vetinary care. The charges,even at their most severe, are incredibly weak and are not going to change anything.",
