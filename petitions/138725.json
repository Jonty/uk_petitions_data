        "additional_details": "The people who's futures depend on this outcome the most were unable to vote. Our generation will suffer from this decision more than any other for the rest of our lives. Double standards between Scotland's referendum voting and this are unacceptable. Competency and understanding of the situation isn't an issue as many 16-18yos are more knowledgeable on how it'll affect our lives, compared to the millions of leave voters who voted purely to revolt against the government's views.",
        "background": "We, 16-18yos call upon HM Government to hold a second EU Ref. should this petition reach the 1,269,501 signatures from 16-18yos required to overturn a decision which affects our futures the most. Parallel to the Scottish Ref., we have the right to vote on our futures should a second Ref. take place.",
