It is through his bravery and the will to help others that he sacrificed his own life to help lives from a burning house. One of the Home Office requirements for being granted a status is good character, this act of bravery is good character especially in today's world whereby he could have chosen to be a bystander from afar. He deserves recognition not psychological persecution from the Home Office. ",
