        "additional_details": "Fireworks produce a sound output that is in the 150 to 175 decibel range. There is medical evidence that each year, many people experience some damage to their hearing as a result of fireworks. On top of this many animal owners have to sedate cats & dogs, baby birds and rabbits can die of the shock and elderly people find it alarming especially if they live on their own. Displays in gardens pose a much higher problem that organised ones where people are more prepared for their level of noise. \r\n\r\n",
