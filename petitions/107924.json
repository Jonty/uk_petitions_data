        "additional_details": "These same governments have been closing bases and making redundancies while these servicemen were fighting in the Middle East and they came home to no job, no home, no future. Those bases are sitting empty, they are small villages. Why not use these abandoned bases for ex-servicemen/women? They can rehabilitate in an environment they are used to, surrounded by people who understand their troubles and traumas.They could then get resettled into civilian life and get much needed support. ",
        "background": "it has been a known fact for years that there are many servicemen living on the streets, they need medical help, counselling. Our Governments chose to send servicemen/women to war, many have mental and physical injuries, were dismissed because of these or simply left because they could not cope",
