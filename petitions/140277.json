        "additional_details": "Evidence from many sources shows that the majority of England who voted to leave are above the age of 60 which isnt right as they will be the least affected by the change and instead it should be judged by the younger generations that have upward of 50 years left in this country.\r\n\r\nFollowing on from Scotland's referendum, they invoked on 16 year old to have their say as many 16-18 are educated and understand the significance of their vote and should have the right to use it and have their say.",
        "background": "After the UK completed there first referendum it is shown that the majority of voter to leave the EU, are in fact above the age of 60, this is where my argument comes into place, as it is shown that younger ages are gonna be the ones affected the most it would make sense if 16+ would be able to vote",
