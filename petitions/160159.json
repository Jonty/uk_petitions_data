        "additional_details": "1/ The amount spent on Trident is obscene.\r\n2/ The shameful shortfall required to barely fund care and support currently is being topped up by charities. Without it they would be even worse off. \r\n3/ It's been going on for too long.\r\n4/ The Government has all the stats. What they need is the guts and moral stamina to take care of our fallen. Fully.\r\n5/ The Poppy has become a symbol of successive Government's failure to care for our damaged service people and their families.\r\n6/ It's our moral duty.\r\n",
        "background": "For too long, the RBL Poppy Appeal and HFH charities subsidies care and support given to disabled returned service people and their families. Taxation is being squandered on Trident when the real cost has already been incurred. It is morally wrong to depend on charity. It's the government's duty.",
