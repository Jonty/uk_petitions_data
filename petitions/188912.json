        "action": "Enforce the law that makes placing tart cards in public telephones illegal.",
        "additional_details": "Every day on many public telephones the sexually explicit pictures can be found in abundance. Numerous studies have revealed how looking at such images damages the brain. It is not acceptable that our children and youth are exposed to these images in public places and that the perpetrators are not brought to justice. It is a primary duty of government to protect its citizens, and that includes protecting children from explicit images in public places. This law must be enforced with more vigour. ",
        "background": "Tart cards are the cards that advertise prostitution services, which are often found in public telephones. The placing of these advertisements was made illegal by the Criminal Justice and Police Act of 2001, in Section 46. However, it seems as if nothing is being done to enforce this law.",
