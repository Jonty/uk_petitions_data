        "action": "End Annualised Hours Contracts",
        "additional_details": "As an annualised hours employee, my life is dictated by the organisation that I work for. Working extensive hours equates to less than minimum wage, I am unable to book holidays off due to there not being enough staff and the holidays that I do accrue - I can not be paid for or carry over to the next financial year. As a UK citizen, this kind of contract reverts back to 18th century workhouses and is similar to a Charles Dickin's Novel, not allowing an individual to have a work life balance.",
        "background": "Annualised contracts in a large organisation (Airports) are an exploitation of a person, their work life balance and job insecurity. Organisations have the power to dictate a person's life, not allowing for holidays, amending shifts and rostering people on their days off with only 72 hours notice",
