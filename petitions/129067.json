NICE recommends that prior to offering bariatric surgery (Tier 4) the NHS should provide a network of dedicated centres, staffed with experts in weight loss, exercise, and talking therapies, to help obese lose weight (Tier 3). Currently these centres are few and far between.\r\nThis petition calls for more Tier 3 centres so all obese are able to access Tier 3 services as a right.",
