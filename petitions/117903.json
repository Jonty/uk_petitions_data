        "additional_details": "In 2015, Turkey launched a war on its Kurdish south-east and has since committed atrocities against its own people and brought the country to the fringe of civil war. Meanwhile in Syria, Turkey has complicity supported terrorist groups in their war against the Kurds and at times directly attacked the Kurdish YPG militia. Such crimes should forfeit Turkey's position at NATO and their friendly relations with the west. The UK should lead international condemnation and sanction against Turkey.",
        "background": "The UK should raise the issue of Turkish crimes against humanity for the Kurds in Turkey and Syria, and their complicit support for terrorist groups such as ISIS and al Qaeda. The UK should also make efforts to raise the issue at the UN and in NATO.",
