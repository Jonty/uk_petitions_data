        "action": "Maintain free movement of people between Britain and the EU.",
        "additional_details": "Diversity and the exchange of ideas have always been key to prosperity, they enable us to learn from each other and grow faster and stronger together. While we may be leaving the EU it does not mean we must cut off a vital asset to our nation.\r\n\r\nFor those Britons that are looking for work and to learn and move forwards the opportunities that Europe has to offer are priceless. Restricting free movement with the continent will deprive our people of opportunities just as much as it deprives Europe.",
        "background": "I am proud to live in a country that has been seen as the most desirable place in Europe to move to. Furthermore I believe that the free movement of people across the continent has been a great step forward in promoting equality for all. The UK should maintain free movement of people with the EU.",
