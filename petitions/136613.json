        "action": "Revoke the EU Referendum as it was cast by a misled and misinformed public.",
        "additional_details": "All would agree that the EU requires change. However people in this instance were forced to vote on a critical issue that was beyond the understanding of the general public. The government underestimated popular sentiment at the expense of current and future generations. Numerous examples exist of outright lies to the public which should be challenged by class action in the court of law. Most notably the assertion by the leave campaign that 350 million pounds a week would be returned to the NHS.",
        "background": "The result to leave the EU is threatening the unity and stability of the United Kingdom. The vote was cast by a public that was misinformed by HM government about its far reaching implications during a crucial period of recovery from deep recession. ",
