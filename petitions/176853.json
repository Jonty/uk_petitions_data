        "action": "Install an electric vehicle charging point in every town and village in the uk",
        "additional_details": "My parents, friends and I (and other advocates of the change to all electric vehicles) feel it is a shame that charging points are not available when we travel. We support this initiative but it is made a lot less practical because of the lack of charging points in accessible places. We recognise the government provides grants for their installation, however if every council was made to install them these would be redundant. Grants are about pro activity, laws are about consistency.",
        "background": "There are vehicle charging points in London and the South and in towns and cities around Europe. If the government is promoting their use and therefore reduced emissions, it is vital that these are available throughout the UK. Charging points in every conurbation would allow for all electric travel.",
