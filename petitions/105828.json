        "additional_details": "\r\nThere are 48,000 registered pharmacists and approx 13,000 pharmacies. Over 3000 pharmacists graduate each year with high expectations but are dissapointed with the lack of jobs available, target orientated services, poor pay and increased pressure with minimal staff which is often experienced practising as a pharmacist. Already oversupplied with 27 schools of pharmacy the gov has approved another, to make 28. We need action and change now. Please sign and share this petition to be heard.  ",
        "background": "Each year the average pharmacy salary has decreased and the workload increased fuelled by the oversupply of pharmacists and poor management of NHS funds. There are 27 pharmacy schools in the UK and next year there will be 28.  ",
