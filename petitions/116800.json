        "additional_details": "Although the BBC has passed the Formula 1 rights to Channel 4, experience has shown that eventually such events end up on subscription TV such as Test Match Cricket, Ryder Cup Golf, Live Premiership Football.\r\n\r\nFor those of us that either do not want to, or cannot afford, to fund the Murdoch empire, we experience a continuing reduction in the ability to view top sporting events.\r\n\r\nThe Government should revisit options for funding sport , perhaps with two tier licensing to raise additional funding?",
        "background": "The Government is forcing tight budget reductions on the BBC. This has just resulted in the BBC cutting its funding of sport with the news that the BBC will no longer be covering Formula 1 and this follows the loss of rugby and golf coverage.\r\n\r\n",
