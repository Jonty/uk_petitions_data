        "action": "Change the law to bar convicted sex offenders from local council service.",
        "additional_details": "Last year a parish Councillor was found guilty in Court of downloading more than 400 indecent images from a website.\r\nDespite public pressure, the councillor has refused to resign.\r\nThe local MP for the area has been pushing the Government for a change in the law.\r\nIt is important that the law is changed so, in future, convicted sex offenders would not have the opportunity to hold public office once they had been convicted. \r\n",
        "background": "We believe that convicted sex offenders should be barred from holding public office as either a Parish Councillor or Local Authority Councillor.\r\nAs the law stands, a convicted sex offender cannot be forced to resign. \r\nWe believe this is wrong & once convicted of a crime, sex offenders must resign.",
