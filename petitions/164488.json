        "additional_details": "Majid Malik is a serial offender with 39 previous offences. Had appropriate sentences been applied to the likes of Malik our son and others would be alive today. Malik chose to drive at 90mph, to race, to leave James dead in the road. Such choices made by those who are willing to kill by racing are calculated acts that must bring charges of   manslaughter and not be downgraded to dangerous driving. A car hitting a pedestrian at 90mph is more certain to kill than the use of a gun or knife.",
        "background": "Our son James was killed in a hit & run while on a pelican crossing. The driver who killed James was racing at over 90mph in a 40mph zone. The impact was such that James landed 70m down the road and killed instantly from multiple injuries. Leaving James he disposed of the car and burnt his clothes. ",
