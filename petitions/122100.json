Forms do not ask the right questions with regards to other schemes and benefits misleading parents and allowing them to be claiming for other benefits which they do not realise they are not entitled to. A number of complicated forms are sent out to \"check\" details throughout the year very often with wrong information on. Errors are amended by lengthy phone calls to the credit office, but still we get it wrong!",

This is due to a very complicated application and benefits system.",
