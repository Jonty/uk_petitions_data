        "additional_details": "During any political campaign there will be claims made by both sides that are \"best case scenarios\" and might not be 100% true. We accept this as part of democratic tradition. \r\n\r\nHowever, the mistruths perpetrated by the Leave campaign fall well below the standard we should expect for a decision as important as the EU referendum.\r\n\r\nWith such a narrow margin of victory it is entirely possible that the Leave campaign would not have won without promising things they knew they could not deliver.",
        "background": "It has become clear that many of the points made by both Leave campaigns were predicated on misdirection, unsound statistics and outright fabrication.\r\n\r\nThose who knowingly misled the UK must not be allowed to get away without any consequences. Parliament must hold them to account for their lies.",
