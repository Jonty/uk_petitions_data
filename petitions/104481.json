        "additional_details": "Our dear mother, like thousands of others, who having been released from hospital after complications with her dementia is currently under review, (free for up to 6 weeks), and having her illness assessed for future care. Her cognitive state means that she will need constant care, in a care home, so it's certain that we will have to sell her house and use up all her savings to provide for this care. MP's who have just received a pay rise are unlikely ever to need to resort to such measures! ",
        "background": "This was a Tory pledge promising 'dignity and security in your old age' to capture the elderly votes prior to the recent General Election. It now seems that having used those votes to gain power, they have reneged on that promise by 'kicking it into the long grass' until 2020.",
