        "action": "Introduce preferential voting to UK general and local elections.",
        "additional_details": "The UK's voting system is known as a \"first-past-the-post\" system. It means that one can only vote for a single candidate, and, as has been the case in recent elections at home and abroad, this means that one is unable to vote for their interests as any vote for a third party is wasted, and may even serve to split the vote and see an unpopular candidate win. Preferential voting allows one to vote as they wish, rather than being forced to vote strategically against their least-favoured candidate.",
        "background": "Preferential voting is a voting system that allows voters to rank their choices of candidate in order of preference (see: \"instant-runoff voting\" in Australia). Such a system is very helpful in preventing the so-called \"two-horse race\" issue that is common in first-past-the-post voting systems.",
