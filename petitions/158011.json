Here are just a few examples:\r\n\r\nVote Remain:\r\nCameron would invoke Article 50 immediately and start countdown\r\nEmergency budget would be required with increased austerity\r\nLeaving will put 3 million jobs at risk (based on 15 yr old estimate)\r\n\r\nVote Leave:\r\nEU costs the UK \u00a3350m a week\r\nTurkey to join the EU imminently\r\nFalse certainty over immigration controls\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition and Stop the Lies.\r\n",
