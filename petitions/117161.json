        "additional_details": "We should:\r\n\r\nDiscourage private landlords and buy-to-let investors by making it less financially attractive. This will free up properties for those who will actually live in them.\r\n\r\nDiscourage foreign investment in the UK housing market which drives up prices.\r\n\r\nBan \"Shrink Wrapping\" of properties to make sure no properties are left empty\r\n\r\nIntroduce taxes on unused land to free up land for residential development\r\n\r\nIntroduce rent caps to prevent profiteering in areas of high demand",
        "background": "UK house prices are unsustainable and unfair. Properties are needed for people to live in not for private landlords and investors to turn a profit and drive up prices. Priority should be given to first time buyers and families, not investors and landlords. \r\n",
