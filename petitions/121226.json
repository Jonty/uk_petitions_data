        "additional_details": "- Many MP's are against this change and have stated so in Parliament\r\n- Archive paper has a shelf life of approx 200 years\r\n- Vellum lasts - no need for climate control\r\n- Vellum docs such as Magna Carta bring in huge amounts of tourism\r\n- We will lose a masterful art form as the last remaining vellum makers will lose business in an already struggling economy\r\n\r\nThis is a tragic loss that is quietly trying to be pushed through, one that our heritage and country will be worse for in the long run.",
        "background": "This April, the House of Lords will remove the historical process of writing UK legislation and laws onto calfskin vellum and replace it with a poor substitute - archive paper. All to save the government eighty thousand pounds. The House of Lords are not an elected democratic body of representatives",
