        "action": "Legislate the number of dogs that professional dog walkers can walk at one time",
        "additional_details": "From our own personal experience we see on a daily basis dog walkers sometimes walking 4-6 dogs and more at any one time - Some of the walkers just allow the dogs to jump out of the cars in the car park area and run around out of control.  We question whether a dog walker with 4-6 dogs or more has total control for any eventuality - whether that be a pending dog fight, a dog running off or just being able to collect and dispose of their dogs poo. Logistically its practically impossible.",
        "background": "We want to ask the government to legislate the number of dogs that professional dog walkers are allowed to walk at any one time. To a maximum 3 dogs per each dog walker. This will be more beneficial for each dog, and the dog walker can promote responsible dog ownership/care.",
