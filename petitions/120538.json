        "additional_details": "I propose to bring back licencing. \r\nMake a perspective owner have to PAY for the privilege of owning a dog.\r\nHopefully, this cost would also put off people who are not serious about committing to a dog for 10+ years, not able to provide for the dog properly and those who treat them as objects or accessories - in the long run maybe even helping to lower the amount of poor pups dumped and subjected to life in kennels. \r\n\r\nIn the event of said dog (which legally must be chipped now!!!) being mistreat, neglected, abused, dumped, killed, the licenced owner should face an appropriate sentence as we all know they are statistically known to re-offend and/or more likely to do the same to children.\r\n\r\nI hope you will speak up for all the dogs who have no voice of their own. Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "With increasingly disgusting, distressing cases of animal neglect/abuse and even murder of innocent dogs, that have no way to defend themselves, becoming more and more common in daily news, I propose to make it more difficult for those unfit to care for an animal to own in the first place.\r\n\r\n",
