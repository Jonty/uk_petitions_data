        "action": "Stop schools ruining kids' childhoods with an unachievable curriculum",
        "additional_details": "Teachers and parents alike seem to agree that the curriculum expects too much from our kids. My 7 year old boy can only just about remember to bring his jumper and books home, yet I'm expected to work on fractions and pages of comprehension with him. Most primary age kids I know are being tutored simply to keep up. This cannot be right and the minister for education needs to address this without delay as these financial pressures just add to the stress that parents are facing.",
        "background": "Kids in the UK are becoming depressed, anxious and even suicidal. The pressure schools are placing on kids through homework and curriculums that are 2 years ahead of where children should be is unacceptable. It causes stress for families and tension between children, their parents and school. ",
