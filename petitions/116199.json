        "action": "Impose an Environmental levy on Non-European steel entering the UK",
        "additional_details": "It should be argued that this is the correct way the world should be regulating itself over emissions etc, which is why the EU have created the IED (Industrial Emissions Directive), however, why do the EU allow Non-European steel to flood our market with no environmental penalties incurred? \r\n\r\nAfterall, countries such as Russia and China especially don't have these environmental regulations imposed on them.\r\n\r\nIt's a huge contradiction and needs to be addressed immediately.",
        "background": "All we want is a level playing field.\r\nThe European steel industry is at a financial disadvantage over the rest of the world because of many reasons but mainly due to environmental regulations.",
