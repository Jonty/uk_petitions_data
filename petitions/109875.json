        "action": "Remove the requirement for ministers to be Parliamentarians",
        "additional_details": "In our government ministers have a crucial role that that requires expertise and knowledge in the relevant area, yet Prime Ministers and Leaders of the Opposition are forced to select MPs and Lords, the former already having the demanding job of representing their constituents, to fill these positions. This has led to areas of government being viewed as out of touch with the professionals that they direct or ineffective in either their ministerial role or in serving constituents. ",
        "background": "We call for the PM to be able to select those outside Parliament to serve as ministers as they are currently limited to selecting sitting MPs and Lords. In our view this would help ensure that ministers have more experience and knowledge of the department they are responsible for.",
