It is possible to end world poverty but this depends on the individuals with the power and wealth to do so. ",
        "background": "More than 1.3 billion people live in extreme poverty on less than \u00a31.01 a day and according to UNICEF, 22,000 children die each day due to poverty. This is something that is hugely unacceptable and can be easily changed by leading nations' involvement, including the UK. ",
