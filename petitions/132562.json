A Russian MP has backed the attacks, \"I see nothing wrong with football fans fighting. On the contrary, well done to our boys! Keep up the good work!\" https://twitter.com/Russian1972/status/742256350424641536).

        "background": "A recent history of racist and homophobic chants and threats at Russian stadia, plus the well planned and brutal attacks on England fans at Euro 2016 strongly suggests Russia is a very poor choice to host World Cup 2018. The UK Government alongside the English FA should pressure FIFA to move it.",
