        "additional_details": "In a country with a large Muslim population our government owes reassurance to the  citizens whose contribution  to our culture, economy and services is invaluable, that we stand with them in the face of oppression. \r\nWe have a duty to stem the growth of xenophobia and fascism in the wake of a changing world. \r\nNow is our chance to make a stand and not sit by and find ourselves on the wrong side of history.\r\nWe the undersigned stand against oppression and demand our representatives do so too.",
        "background": "In light of the movement by the new American administration to ban refugees and immigrants with a clear bias on religious belief we demand a rejection of this xenophobia.\r\n\r\nThe party leaders and the PM must condemn the policy change and reject stronger ties with the US unless they are reversed.",
