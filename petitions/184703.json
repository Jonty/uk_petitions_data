        "additional_details": "The \u00a310bil funding promise has not been delivered. Meg Hillier (Chair of the Public Accounts Committee) & Sarah Wollaston (Chair Health Committee) wrote very clear letters stating their grave concerns. \r\nUK health spending is falling as a proportion of GDP (King's Fund 2016) & the UK now lies 13th out of 15 European countries (OECD) for such.\r\nThis sustained underfunding & failure to enable long-term planning jeopardises the health & welfare of our citizens. Theresa May has a moral duty to act.",
        "background": "NHS is under extreme pressure. Of the \u00a310bil promised to it over the course of the parliament (Theresa May, Birmingham 5/10/16, Jeremy Hunt 11/10/16) in reality, only \u00a34.5bil is available. The Commons Public Accounts (3/11/16) & Health Committees (26/10/16) have demanded action but Gov fails to act.",
