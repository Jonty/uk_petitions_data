It's not down to the Remain supporters or their MP's to set the terms of exiting the EU as there would be a conflict of interest. ",

They did not give a mandate for Remain including those Remain MP's to negotiate their terms to exit. Those voting Remain lost their argument on June 24th 2016.  They have no rights to the negotiations. ",
