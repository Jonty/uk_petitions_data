And others promote the use of vitamins more than the daily consumption is allowed, and some would say unsafetly. \r\n\r\nIf someone with the resources could lift the lid, I believe pandemonium would ensue, it's terrible that new mothers and those on mostly low incomes (including those on solely benefits) are prayed on like this, it has to stop.",
        "background": "Lots of women sign up for multi level marketing, it's the promise for their own business, and a chance to stay at home with their children.\r\n\r\nThe fact is these are pyramid schemes, with lose product/s to get around the law, all they want is new recruits, with some charging \u00a3200 to join.",
