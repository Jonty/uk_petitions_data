        "background": "No ones likes to get bus lane tickets and understandably they are \r\nthere for a reason  to help the flow of traffic for buses. \r\nMy proposal is to equip all buses with device which would send a signal to an electronic sign at a bus lane notifying road users in advance when a bus is approaching.\r\n",
