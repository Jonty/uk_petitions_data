        "action": "Make it compulsory that all 18650 batteries come with care and safety  leaflets",
        "additional_details": "I want it to be compulsory that all 18650 batteries either bought, or shipped to the UK, come with a leaflet explaining the proper care and handling of these batteries. Giving a stronger and a better understanding of how dangerous they can be. Not just a simple 'warning' and a picture or two on the wraps of these batteries.\r\nSome larger companies do not even have a warning sign on the batteries, and it is then left to vendors, or hope people have done their researched. ",
        "background": "Due to the recent influx and high demand of more advanced, and powerful  electronic  cigarettes, 18650 batteries have become more in use to power these devices. \r\nI feel that people aren't either receiving the right safety guidance, or buying these online, and not knowing how dangerous they can be.",
