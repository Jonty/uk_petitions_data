        "additional_details": "It is my opinion that the EPC provided to the property purchaser or tenant should be an up to date document giving the current rating of the property. The EPC should be no more than 6 months old to give a true reflection of current running costs and an up to date reflection of the current heating system and insulation measures.",
        "background": "When selling or renting a property an EPC must be produced and provided to any potential buyer or tenant prior to the property being marketed. Currently the certificate is valid for 10 years and can be very misleading as a property rating may have increased or decreased due to modifications.",
