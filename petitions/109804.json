        "additional_details": "These long hour workers, earn enough not to receive working tax credits and, in some cases, child tax credits. But also do not earn enough to be able to get mortgages or to live a live that is comfy.\r\nThis is a situation that is growing exponentially within the working environment. We need to consider these middle workers who dedicate massive portions of their lives to the jobs and the government acknowledging this in a small way would do a lot to improve moral.",
        "background": "Nowadays it is common for people to 12 hour shifts with some peoples working week exceeding 80 hours! These people, who earn too much fo Tex credits, deserve a separate tier for tax credits where hours worked instead of money earned is taken into account.",
