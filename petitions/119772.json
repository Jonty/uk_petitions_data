        "additional_details": "SCE- stop crime early educational pressure group We only want to keep the youth offenders in the prison environment for a short amount of time, because results have shown the longer people remain in imprisonment, they start to think it is normal and no longer a punishment that would make them change their ways. Sentences would alter on the severity of the crime, and after they have done their time it will be compulsory to attend some sort of service such as cadets or helping the community. ",
        "background": "We are a campaigning group wanting to change the way u18 criminals are punished. We think that if young offenders serve a short amount of time in a prison environment with other offenders of the same stature, they will realise and understand the consequences that will come if they keep on offending.",
