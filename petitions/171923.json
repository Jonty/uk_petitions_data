        "additional_details": "Donald Trump won his election based on lies and false promises.\r\n\r\nHe told US voters that Muslims are terrorists and Mexicans are rapists. He kicked off a modern day witch hunt without facts to back it up. Many claims made about immigration by the Leave campaign have also been proved false - too late to make a difference!\r\n\r\nCampaigners can't advocate burning witches as a good thing because that's what the masses want to hear. We need proper checks and balances. Please sign the petition. Thank you.\r\n",
        "background": "It should be a legal requirement to back up statements and promises made during election campaigns with material evidence of validity. Evidence should be independently assessed before it can be made public. \r\n\r\nOnce a statement has been made the damage is done, even if it isn't true. This is wrong.",
