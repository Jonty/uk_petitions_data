        "additional_details": "We ask the Home Office to obey their own guidelines which state that a decision will be made within 6 months after an asylum claim is made, and not the years many are experiencing today.\r\nThese people have fled to this country for political or religious reasons and are desperate to work, study and find their own home. They are prevented from doing this while waiting long overdue decisions by the Home Office. \r\nAs a direct result, many suffer from mental health issues including stress, depression, sleeplessness, anxiety and physical problems. \r\nWe therefore call on the Home Office to do everything in their power to give decisions within six months and to issue regular reports on the proportion of cases in which this is achieved.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "We deplore the fact that the Home Office is failing to issue decisions about the future of asylum seekers in a timely manner. \r\nIt is clear that many clients are waiting over a year, which contravenes EU guidelines and poses a breach of their human rights.\r\n",
