        "additional_details": "His comments not only portray a stereotyping of black people as involved in the \"disco and drug trade\", but also imply that the riots were to be attributed to the colour of the residents of Tottenham, which is deeply racist. (\"Lower-class, unemployed white people lived for years in appalling slums without a breakdown of public order on anything like the present scale\".)",
        "background": "In light of memos he wrote when an advisor to Thatcher, we call on Oliver Letwin to resign as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister of State for Government Policy. They give rise to a reasonable apprehension of racial bias, making him unfit to hold executive authority in modern Britain.",
