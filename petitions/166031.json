        "additional_details": "In addition, many students struggle to buy things such as notebooks and pens and textbooks needed to study. How is it fair that uni students can get loans yet we can't? We would pay it back once we completed studies and got jobs; it's very hard for a 16/17 year old to get a job these days especially without experience. It is very hard to get a job to support ourselves whilst studying a levels- it is simply too stressful which could effect our results and futures. ",
        "background": "Many people can not attend college sometimes due to not being able to afford things like the bus or metro, and not everybody is eligible for the bursary. However, the bursary is not enough for some people, for example \u00a314 a week can not cover a \u00a320 weekly bus pass. ",
