        "additional_details": "On June 23rd 2016 a referendum was held in the UK asking the electorate to choose between the UK leaving or remaining in the European Union. The result given out on the 24th June 2016 was in favour of leaving. In order for the process of leaving to begin it is necessary for the Prime Minister of the UK, currently David Cameron, to invoke article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, in order to initiate procedures in accordance with EU law. He has announced that he will not do so and furthermore intends to stand down as Prime Minister in October 2016. People are extremely concerned that he has failed in his duty and if he refuses to invoke article 50 before August 31st 2016, he should resign immediately on the 1st September 2016.",
        "background": "In light of the UK referendum resulting in a majority for leaving the EU, we demand that Prime Minister David Cameron invokes article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty before August 31st 2016.",
