        "action": "Resolve the inconsistencies in refunding NHS trainees under the WAT Scheme.",
        "additional_details": "A student salary is not classified as earnings and as such should not have been subject to tax or NI deductions. HMRC instructed NHS Trusts not to deduct tax/NI from such salaries and pledged to refund those who had already trained. NHS Trusts and HMRC are treating claimants inconsistently. Some have been refused a NI refund, despite The Social Security (Contributions) Regulations 2001 (regulation 25 and part 7 of schedule 3). Some claimants are still waiting for refund two years after claiming.",
        "background": "The Widening Access Training Scheme was introduced in 1999 to broaden the professional knowledge of NHS workers. This scheme offered tax and NI exemption, yet many eligible NHS students were incorrectly taxed and paid NI. Reclaiming these payments is proving extremely difficult for many.",
