        "additional_details": "Concerned family or friends can restrict a loved ones ID by flagging them as \"At Risk\". Restrictions would include a limit on the number of times bets can be placed in a week, as well as the amount of money that can be bet. If the gambler is still using up the cards limits on a regular basis after being restricted, bookmakers should ban the card. Once banned, the ID can never be used to bet with again, preventing gambling addicts from relapse. Recovering gambling addicts can also ban themselves.",
        "background": "The ID would be a scannable photo card with a unique ID number, like a drivers license, which will be needed to place a bet. The ID will be scanned by bookmakers before a bet is placed, which tells them if you have been flagged as \"At Risk\" causing weekly restrictions to your betting, or \"Banned\".",
