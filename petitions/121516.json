        "action": "Stop Jeremy Hunt forcing a change in doctors' contracts without their agreement.",
        "additional_details": "His change in terms is a smoke screen to further underfund the NHS and further worsen services with unsafe practice by making doctors work even longer hours for less pay. His proposal for a 7 day NHS would require non emergency services to be available when the government aren't prepared to fund with extra cash. His process is dictatorial and not in keeping with the democracy which we should be enjoying.His governance is dangerous & will cost lives, has only his interests at heart not the public",
        "background": "Hunt has lied about the 'benefits' of his changes to doctors' contracts which make them vulnerable to longer hours for less money & therefore unsafe practice. He hasn't negotiated terms with junior doctors & is forcing change to further demoralise, underfund the NHS to then force it to be sold off",
