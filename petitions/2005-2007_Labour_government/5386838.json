            "background": "The Olympics are only 5 years away, but London's main airports are already approaching capacity 5 years before so how will we get the extra people into London?\nSouthend Airport is currently a small and rarely used Airport about 35 miles away from the Olympic Site.\nI think that using Southend Airport would be a good idea because with a train line right next door and with plans to build a station at Southend Airport, tourists can get off a plane, and within an hour, be at the Olympic Site.\nAnd this would also improve the local economy of Southend for many years to come.",
