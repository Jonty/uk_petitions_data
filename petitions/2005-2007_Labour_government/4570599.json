            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The Government is likely to introduce pay as you dispose refuse collections for all householders in an attempt to reduce the total amount of landfill waste produced each year. This will encourage flytipping and will not produce a net reduction in the quantity of waste produced.\nRather than doing this, Government should legislate to compel manufacturers and retailers to reduce the amount of unneccesary packaging used for goods on sale in the UK, thus tackling the source of problem rather than further financially penalising householders.",
