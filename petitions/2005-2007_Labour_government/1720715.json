            "background": "Transponders enable Air Traffic Controllers to gain information from aircraft by responding to interrogations from the ground infrastructure or from airborne safety systems.\n\nOnly mode S transponders identify the aircraft that is responding, providing Controllers with information enabling identification of the individual aircraft, as well as safety-critical information about the aircraft's current altitude (height above sea level).\n\nThe ability to uniquely identify every airborne conveyance allows the state to pro-actively monitor alien/unannounced/illegitimate inbound flights to the UK carrying who knows what.\n\nThe final safety-net that passenger carrying aircraft have, collision avoidance systems (TCAS), rely on threats to their safety carrying transponders.\n\nFor owners of light aircraft, balloons and gliders, fitting a Mode S transponder is a minor additional one-off cost.\n\nWe request that the Prime Minister insist the CAA implement this as planned.",
