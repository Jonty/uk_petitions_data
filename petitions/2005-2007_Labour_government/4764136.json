        "background": "The Helmets on Quad Bikes Campaign was founded in May 2006. The campaign started shortly after my uncle, Andrew Gill, was riding his quad bike along the public highway near Exford when he went to pull off the road to allow an on coming vehicle to pass. The quad bike overturned and my uncle was thrown from it landing on the ground and as a result he suffered severe head injuries. This whole incident could easily have been reduced in seriousness if not prevented all together had he been wearing a crash helmet while riding his quad bike. My Uncle is now recovering at home but other might not be as lucky in the future. It was later discovered that it was not in fact a requirement of the law to wear a crash helmet or any other form of protective head wear whilst riding a quad bike unlike riders of motor cycles so I have launched this campaign in order to close this loop hole in the law.
