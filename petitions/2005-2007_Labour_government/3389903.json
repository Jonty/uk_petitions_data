            "background": "Law breakers who have been found guilty of non-violent crimes such as fraud represent a significant portion of the prisoner popultation. While it is recognised that these people are criminals, they pose no significant physical threat to the safety of the general populous and therefore do not need to be incarcerated. The suggestion is that such non-violent criminals be 'tagged' and placed into schemes where the debt they repay to society for their wrongdoings reflects the nature of the crime they committed. This would reduce the taxpayer's financial support for the prisons as well as increasing state income through a financial punishment scheme.",
