            "background": "It appears the \"Child Trust Fund\" was introduced in 2002 to encourage \"Tax Free\" savings for all children born after its introduction & to provide each child with a \"Tax Free\" lump sum for the benefit of the child when he/ she reaches 18 years of age. In addition to the standard Govt. Contributions, the \"Child Trust Fund\" appears to allow a further \u00a3100 per month to be saved \"Tax Free\" for the childs benefit (e.g. Parents etc.).\n\nIt appears that a child born BEFORE the \"Child Trust Fund\" was introduced in 2002 is NOT entitled to such a \"Tax Free\" Trust.\n\nI would like to propose that the \"Child Trust Fund\" be extended to include all children under the age of 18, allowing \u00a3100 per month to be saved \"Tax Free\", by any party (e.g. parents), for the benefit of each child until they reach 18.\n\nI am also proposing that the \"Child Trust Fund\" may then be converted to an \"ISA\" when the child reaches 18.",
