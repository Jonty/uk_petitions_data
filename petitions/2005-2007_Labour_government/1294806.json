        "background": "School indiscipline is at the heart of societal weakening.Children learn the wrong lessons when allowed to misbehave with no effective deterrent.Schools must be able to exclude and a coordinated policy should ensure that excluded students are made to attend reform establishments. Excluded students and their families should forfeit access to benefits. The highest standards should be expected at school and staff should be empowered to punish children through an effective range of policies. Schhols should be backed up by government.This is an effective and popular policy. Common sense for most decent people.",
