            "background": "Absent parents must pay money for their child's upbringing. However there is nothing to prevent the parent with care spending the money on other items and not on the child. Currently the absent parent has no say on how the money is spent, and often has watch their child be neglected and walk around in rags whilst the parent with care enjoys an enhanced social life. Theoretically the absent parent could be paying for a drug misuse or alcohol habit.\n\nI urge the Government to allow an appeals process under the new legislation and the parent with care to prove the money is benefiting the child, and if it is proved the child is not benefiting, have it withdrawn and put in a trust fund.\n\nPerhaps the absent parent can purchase direct, clothing or other essential items for the child and have this deducted. \n\nThe petitioners do not disagree with the maintenance system but ask it addresses this important issue and give absent parents the right to see their child benefit from their payments.",
