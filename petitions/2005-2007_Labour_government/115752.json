            "background": "The Hunting Act was, and still is, a vital part of our legislation. It confers vital rights in favour of animal welfare. It didn't go far enough as it excluded many practices still in operation including but not limited to fishing and shooting. Other legislation is desperately needed to prevent other barbaric practices. We must continue to fight. If any concessions are given on the Hunting Act, what hope do we have of ever getting those other laws passed? We must continue to support this act if there is to be any justice for those that cannot speak for themselves.",
