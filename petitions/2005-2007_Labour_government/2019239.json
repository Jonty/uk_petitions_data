So many of its creators are now left saddened by this mistake and to this day desire for the final book to be made. The BBC has not even allowed the second series to be officially released on to DVD or VHS and we wish for this to happen now also. Despite the years there are many hundreds of active fans and contributors alike who want this project to be fully realised and completed.",
