            "background": "Currently stamp duty goes up for the whole cost of the property so the cost of stamp duty if you pay \u00a3249,000 is \u00a32,490. If you pay \u00a3250,001 (\u00a32 more pounds!) your stamp duty bill goes up to \u00a37500.03 more than \u00a35000 for paying \u00a32 more.\n\nRates of stamp duty should be altered so that each level applies to the proportion of the property price in which it falls, so if you paid \u00a3250,001 the cost would be 1% on the first \u00a3250,000 and 3% on the \u00a31 over the threshold. This may require a review of the threshold levels and percentages chardged but would help buyers who are put off houses priced between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3300,000 becuase of the unreasonable amount of duty paid.",
