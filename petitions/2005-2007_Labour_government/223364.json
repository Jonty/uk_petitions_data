            "background": "David Hicks is an Australian being held in Guantanamo Bay prison, for five years, many think, illegally.  He has obtained a British Passport due to having a mother with British connections.  However, the British Foreign Office refuse to help him because the crimes he is alleged to have committed, were  before he obtained his British passport.  Nine other British subjects have been released from Guantanamo Bay prison, returned to the UK and after being questioned for 24 hours by British police, were allowed to freely go back into the community.  It is likely that the case of David Hicks is no different.  When David Hicks' case went before the British courts, the Americans placed him in solitary confinement, not because of bad behaviour, but because of his legal challenge.  His latest setback was when his British citizenship application, enforced by the courts, was refused almost immediately under the order of then Home Office Secretary, John Reid, \"because of the public good\".",
