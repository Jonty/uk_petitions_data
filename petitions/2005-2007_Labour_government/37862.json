        "background": "Re-nationalise utilities (electricity, gas, water) and public transport (buses & trains).  In the interim prevent further ownership by foreign companies. Services vital to the economy and well-being of the country and its citizens should not be in private ownership (particiularly foreign). An efficient integrated transport system, run for the benefit of the users, is the only way to encourage reduction in car use.",
