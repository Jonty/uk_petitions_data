        "action": "Ban lenders from charging excessive valuation fees for mortgages and excessive early redemption charges.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Lenders are increasingly taking advantage of the booming housing market and charging excessive fees from every angle for mortgages. Does it cost 2.5% of a property value to value a property? Some lenders can charge this simply for setting up a mortgage. It is blatant exploitation with no restriction by law.\n\nIf you pay off a mortgage early in a tie-in agreement you could end up paying a huge penalty clause. These penalty clauses should not be allowed. You should only be required to pay any discount back. I believe it is forced exploitation through price fixing. The banks are making huge record profits as a result. Something should be done to prevent the number of repossessions increasing. This should start by preventing the banks charging unreasonable and completely unjustifiable fees. They are charging money for nothing.",
