            "background": "From 01/07/07 a lone individual in a commercial vehicle may continue to smoke while in England. However, no-one may smoke if there are two or more persons in the same commercial vehicle.\nWhile it is understandable if there is a non-smoker present, this law takes no account of variables, such as: all of the occupants may actually be smokers.\nThere is also a need for more clarity of the law, relating to smoking in commercial vehicles. For example: As a small, partnership business, our 'works (commercial) vehicle' is our only mode of private transport. Are we not allowed to smoke when we use it for social and domestic purposes as well? How long before picking up a member of staff, must we not have smoked in the vehicle? Etc. Etc.\nThis, like other parts of the smoking ban, has been badly thought out and forced upon the Britsh public. We want the PM and the government in general to seriously look again at the detail of the ban, and make changes where appropriate, in the interests of common sense and fairness.",
