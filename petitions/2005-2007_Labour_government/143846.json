It's time for the Atlantic alliance to be put on the back burner and have a stronger European alliance. \n\nNo need for non-cooperation with the US but cooperation on level terms and acknowledgement that the 'special relationship' was only ever one way, that between a man and his dog.\n\nDo as in 'Love Actually'.",
