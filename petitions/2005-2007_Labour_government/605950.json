            "background": "How many times have you had to take a days holiday to get done all those jobs that can't be done outside of work hours. So many things need to be done but the important places like dentists, doctors and banks all shut at least half an hour before most of us finish work. Or they are open for all of half an hour after you finish work but you spend an hour driving home/sitting in traffic - let alone making it to the post office! So some things you try and fit into your lunch break but then you don't get time to eat and that was possibly our only spare hour of the day! surely in a culture where shops open for 24 hours some of our more important sectors could consider changing their hours too!",
