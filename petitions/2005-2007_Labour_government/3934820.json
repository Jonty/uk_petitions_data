            "background": "The King's Cross Railway Lands are 67 acres of prime redevelopment site.   They include numerous listed buildings and two conservation areas, and were home in the 19th century to some of the most significant engineering triumphs in the world.   The area has been run down for decades and undoubtedly needs improvement.  However the London Borough of Camden in its urge to see something done, proposes to allow the demolition of blocks of solid Victorian housing to build offices, in an area desperate for social housing.   The King\u2019s Cross Conservation Area Advisory Committee, the King\u2019s Cross Railway Lands Group and many other residents\u2019 groups believe the current plan fails to respect either the community or the heritage.   They say Think Again, and ask for your support.",
