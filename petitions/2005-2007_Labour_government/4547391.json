        "background": "Gordon Brown should take responsibility for the mess that he has created against advice from his own civil servants. His actions will result in millions of people being poorer than they needed to be, work longer than they should have had to and have a reduced life experience. Governments should be about improving the lot of their citizens not making them worse. Someone who has such poor judgement should be removed from office.",
