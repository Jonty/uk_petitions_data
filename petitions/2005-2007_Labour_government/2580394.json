            "background": "This law to apply whether the space is officially designated as a parking space or not.  \nThe registered keeper to declare the vehicles permanent parking space to the DVLA and there to be full cooperation between the DVLA and LAs to ensure an efficient audit and collection process.  Automatic penalties to apply, for failing to provide the correct information equal to the highest yearly fee applied in the UK, and for non-payment to be half the yearly fee for the locality and any unpaid fee with the vehicle scrapped after a default period of 30 days. The introduction of this law to take priority over the introduction of the planned vehicle tracking and road pricing policy for two reasons; 1 At present there is no incentive to self provide or maintain an off road parking space, in fact quite the opposite and many people act on that; 2 It is part of the true cost of using a vehicle and should not be disguised.",
