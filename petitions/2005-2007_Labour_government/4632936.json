            "background": "BT are introducing a charge to customers who choose not to pay by direct debit. This will hit the most vulnerable - the elderly and low paid, many of whom have always paid their bills promptly and are now being unfairly penalised to add to BT's already enormous profits. The Trading Standards Institute has already condemned this move, but many customers are unaware that charges are about to be imposed. This should be stopped.",
