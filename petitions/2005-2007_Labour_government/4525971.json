            "background": "CCTV cameras that talk to you are very reminiscent of George Orwell's 1984. His reason for writing that book was to give society the ability to foresee when its Government is trying to take too much control.\n\nThe government is doing just that. Talking CCTV is just one of the many \"Big Brother\" things it has done and it plans to do.\n\nPlease, lets prevent a dystopian future for our children where talking CCTV cameras (or \"telescreens\" as they were in the 1984 book) are normal.\n\nBy signing this petition, you are requesting that the Government immediately remove all talking CCTV cameras and ceases plans to put new ones up.",
