            "background": "To ensure that people understand the impacts of climate change upon our world, we must begin teaching them at a young age. Therefore, by ensuring that the 3Rs: REDUCE, REUSE and RECYCLE are taught as a compulsory part of the curriculum in all schools (primary, secondary and special education), people will have better skills, knowledge and understanding on how they can make a difference and how to do it in a fun and enjoyable way. I have been these 3Rs as a separate subject away from the National Curriculum subjects and the impact it has been on my pupils has been extremely positive.",
