            "background": "We are unable to cycle on most road due to the amount of traffic and parked cars.  Most motorist see cyclist as a \nnusiance. If new roads are build with cycle paths it would be safer for both cyclist and motorist.  The Netherlands, Germany and other European countries can manage to plan around the cyclist why do you think there are so many in these countries.  If you ask people who live a short distance from work I am sure many would say they would cycle to work if it was safer.  The goverment is trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, what better way.  The present cycle lanes go nowhere and end after a few hundred yards. Not the best use of resourses.",
