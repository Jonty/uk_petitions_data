The proposed tidal barrage between England and Wales would generate enough electricity to close a number of coal/gas/nuclear (you choose) power stations.\n\nWind turbines could also be built along it's length to further increase output.\n\nAdditionally it could carry a railway line, saving a long detour and creating a new strategic and economic link.",
