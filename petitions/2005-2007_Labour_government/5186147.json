        "action": "Make the returning of unused airport taxes cheaper to claim back -if not free",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The airport tax is a nice little earner for the airlines who will only refund taxes on flights not taken against very often a \u00a325 pound handling charge. There is no handling charge for collecting it!! I petition the Chancellor to introduce the condition that passengers who do not fly should have the Tax refunded without any charge. Currently it is so excessive the airlines make money from taxes when flights arenot flown. The airlines OFTEN make more money this way than the from the actual cost of the low cost flight not taken.\nThe Chancellor has given them a profitable loophole to make EXTRA  money for doing nothing. If the airline keeps the flight money for flights not flown why do they still need a handling charge as well to refund the Taxes",
