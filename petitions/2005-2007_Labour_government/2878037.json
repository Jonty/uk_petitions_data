            "background": "The transport infrastructure in the UK is in obvious need of improvement, for the good of the environment, the economy and the quality of life of individuals.\n\nMany solutions have been proposed from all sides of the debate:  better public transport, schemes to reduce road traffic, more roads, an overhaul of the railway infrastructure, subsidisation of rail travel, disincentives to cheap air travel, more efficient aircraft, encouragement of home working, reduction in the school run, etc.\n\nThis petition is not intended to choose between these or the many other options. All it seeks it a commitment from the Prime Minister that all money raised by the Government directly or indirectly from transportation is ring-fenced and spent only on work that is designed to bring improvements to the transportation system as a whole.",
