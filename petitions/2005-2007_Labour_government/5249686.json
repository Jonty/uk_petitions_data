It take no account of how cultural differences in other countries will interpret it.  It is reminiscent of poor 80's 'yoof' culture programmes.  It has been develoloped by the London elite and therefore does not resonate with the rest of the country from which the organising committee looks to gather support.  As such it is an embarrassement globally and irrelevant locally.  It needs to go now.",
