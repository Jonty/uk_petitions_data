            "background": "why is taxpayers money being used to bribe Englsh companies to relocate to Wales and in the process making the area they leave behind in England an area of unemployment and future degeneration? It seems foolhardy to compete with our own countries - if the Welsh were winning business from anywhere else then fair enough, but to take jobs from England using Englsih taxpayers money seems immoral, stupid and probably illegal.This has just happened with the loss of 250 jobs at a cosmetic factory in Littlehampton which is moving production to Maesteg primarily because of the 'bribes' it is receiving from the WDA",
