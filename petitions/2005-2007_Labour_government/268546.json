        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The current national holiday calendar is partially based around the Christian religious calendar.  This is unfair to the many Britons who follow other religions, and are forced to take time off for Christian festivals such as Christmas and Easter, but may be unable to take time off for their own religious observances.\n\nThe system of national holidays should be reformed to be entirely secular and thus more tolerant of the varying religions practised by British nationals.  Christian-centric bank holidays would under this system be abolished, and replaced with an equal number of extra days' holiday that employees can take off work according to the sacred days of their particular religion, such as Rosh Hashanah, Eid, Diwali or Samhain.",
