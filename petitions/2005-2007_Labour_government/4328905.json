        "background": "At St Peters high school one class in year 10 only get two periods of Physical Education every two weeks. We know that goverment recomendation is two hours per week and we only get two hours every two weeks, whereas everybody else in the school gets the recomendation time of two hours of P.E  a week, is this fair. The reason for us not getting the recomendation amount of time is because we are one of two classes that do German. The top set get their deserved two hours a week but the second set only get two hours every two weeks. This problem is not the modern foriegn languages and the Physical Education departments faults,it is the school timetables fault, so please sign our petition so that we get our well deserved physical education. All we want is our physical education.",
