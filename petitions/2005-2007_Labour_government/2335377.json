            "background": "On July 1st 2007 the social configuration of this country will change forever. Throughout history, smoking for social reasons has been a part of our way of life. I personally have enjoyed smoking my pipe for over 36 years and together with my friends, will no longer be able to go into my local pub order a pint and light my pipe, if I do so it will constitute a criminal offence. How difficult would it have been to have separate areas in pubs, clubs and restaurants where smokers could have been catered for?\n\n I would like to see a full-televised debate which will include so-called professionals, like epidemiologists \u2013 who come up with different figures each time they issue a report \u2013 and government ministers, together with other health experts. These people should be put under severe questioning as if they\u2019re in a courtroom, then we can judge whether or not the Government has any justification for destroying the social life of millions of people\u2026in this great land of ours.",
