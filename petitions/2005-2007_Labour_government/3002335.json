        "background": "I am labelled a \"non-resident father\" of my wonderful 3 sons. I willingly pay child support and purchase necessities such as clothes, shoes and property maintenance. I don't believe people realise how expensive it is to maintain this role, as every weekend i aim to ensure that my children have as much fun as possible. Therefore, i am sick of reading all of the stories about those useless fathers who do nothing for their children, and i believe those that do, should qualify for an extra tax break to help towards our situation. This would also act as an incentive for those pre-mentioned fathers to pay for their responsibilities. I would spend my last penny on my childrens needs or desires, but i am sick of being thrown into the same category as those who make the headlines!!! Come on Tony, i voted you in power many years ago now, to be honest you have let me down badly in so many ways! Don't even mention the CSA!!! What a shower!!!",
