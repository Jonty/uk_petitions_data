            "background": "Most Deaf children are struggling in mainstreams because they felt left out with other peers in their schools and they dont achieved high grades in their GCSE because there are not many communication support in some schools. They dont understand thier identity till they met other Deaf children, Nowadays Deaf Clubs are dwindling because most Deaf children dont know about Deaf Clubs when they leave school. Theyre more isolated nowadays. We wanted Deaf Schools to be back and make Deaf Children more Happy. I was happy at Deaf School from 3 till 16, there were no problems./",
