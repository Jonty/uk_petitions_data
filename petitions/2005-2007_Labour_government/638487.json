            "background": "The french road system is one of the best in the world where money is spent to sympathetically bypass towns and small villages, taking large trucks away from housing and disguises the presence of the road, with landscaping and regional forna and landmarks in the area information boards, while keeping traffic moving cutting waste and unnessesary polution. It also provides free facilities in the form of regular stopping/resting places whee you are allowed to park and sleep (Overnight if you wish, free)that are managed as beautiful natural enviroments. This all cuts traffic jams and recognises that you cannot un-invent the car, but at the same time makes our country a nicer place, to be proud of, and It will stop accidents caused by tierd drivers.",
