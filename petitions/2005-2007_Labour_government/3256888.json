Upon the conviction of the non violent offenders, the police then pay the informant, sometimes vast amounts of money.\nThe violent informant also has immunity from typical criminal procedures & if convicted is often given an extremely lenient prison sentence. \nIn my mind, the police and criminal element of society should not be allowed to \"work together.\"\nNo matter what the circumstance.",
