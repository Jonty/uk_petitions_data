Yet they are in power against the will of the other half of the country. How is that a fair electoral system?\n  We should have an electoral system where a party gains power on the basis of what percentage of the country wants them in power, not on whether they have a majority vote. We should have a voting system where every part gets power based on how many MPs they have, not if the have more than the others.\n  Lets reform our electoral system now!",
