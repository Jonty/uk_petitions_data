            "background": "I would formally like to ask the British public to dig deep in their thoughts to realise & appreciate all the good work & spirit that this Prime Minister has brought to this country. Rubbish, to those who think that he has made the worst decisions in British history, you obviously don't know what you're talking about. Try living abroad and seeing from a foreigners point of view what a governor like the present has done for his country. Does anybody remember what it was like to be living under the policies of previous PM's?  Has this country ever seen such a shake up? Or a stand up and fight, against the worlds most dangerous enemies? I can say that the last one I remember was Winston Churchill. There is a lot of evil on this planet and anyone in his position would have had to make the tough decision that he made. I must remind the people: We are not dutch! We don't stick our arms in the air & surrender! WE ARE BRITISH! WE RULE! WE WANT TONY!",
