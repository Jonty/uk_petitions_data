            "background": "Why should the Government pay children in low income families at birth and then again at 7 double the child trust fund amount than other children get \u00a3500, instead of \u00a3250. The children do not get this money until they are 18. All children should be given the same amount, regardless of their parents financial situation at birth, as this no doubt will change before they are 18. This is completely unnecessary and is discriminating against the average child.",
