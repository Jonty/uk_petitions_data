            "background": "In most cases, perpetrators have violated the human rights of their victims. They therefore cannot expect to enjoy the priviledges afforded others. To this end, prison sentences should be used to penalise, not provide a holiday environment. A 10 year sentence should be exactly that, no remission for good behaviour. They should be made to work for society and not enjoy benefits like television until they earn them. If prisons were not so soft, offenders might think again before reoffending.",
