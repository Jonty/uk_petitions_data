            "background": "Religion is irrelevant to modern life. The moral precepts of most religions are divisiveand elitist and encourage sectarianism and even violence. This cannot be permitted in a free and fair society. The promotion and propogation of religion is effectively ensuring that dvisions occur in our society. Life is also becoming more complex by the day. Children are the future of this planet and as such should be encouraged, especially in the face of the future's likely trials and tribulations, to get on together, cooperate and be able to turn their minds to problem solving without reliance on fairy tales and fables, fairy tales and fables that take the place of useful subjects at in the school curriculum. Therefore we the undersigned require the Prime Minister to undertake legislation to make it an offense to teach religious studies during school time in any school within the United Kingdom.",
