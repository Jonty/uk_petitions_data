        "background": "Our society exposes kids to an relentless bombardment of advertising and marketing attacks. Not only unethical, it borders on abuse of the most defenceless group of society. New legislation on food advertising recognized this fact, but further action is urgently needed to protect our children from daily exploitation. This petition seeks Rights For Kids, new legislation to: Modify child-directed advertising (e.g. removing statements like 'Collect them all!' , or 'I can do it too!'); Encourage advertisement-free TV for younger children; Ban point-of-sale advertising (e.g. displays of confectionery etc. at a height easily accessible to children waiting in a checkout queue with parents); Ban ads which encourage inappropriate development of adult behaviour (e.g. wearing make-up, using mobile phones).\nHistory will judge us as guilty of callous neglect if we don\u2019t try to stop powerful wealthy companies from stealing our children's youth. Join this petition and give back our kids' innocence.",
