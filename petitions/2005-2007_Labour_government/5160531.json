        "background": "We feel that there is no justification for David Beckham to receive a knighthood as he has done nothing to deserve it.  His charity work, like his footballing skill, is limited and quite frankly the thought of \"Lady Beckham\" is quite nauseating.  This proposal appears to be more about the pop culture of \"New Labour\" than something warranted by achievement.",
