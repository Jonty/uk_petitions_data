            "background": "We cannot continue to try and tax motorists off the road. Instead the 'carrot' of totally free public transport for local journeys should be used.\n\nTo pay for this, road tax should be ring fenced and used solely to subserdise local journeys at 100%. eg Private companies will tender to run buses and then submit a receipt for all the qualifying journeys. The tax on fuel should also be ringfenced to pay for roads.\n\nWe have to acccept that people will drive cars regardless but at least reward those who do get on public transport.",
