The system as it stands it\u2019s inherently discriminatory.\n\nAlthough domestic partners can register under the Civil Partnership Act, there still remains great inequality within the system as Civil Partnerships have created a two tier system of recognition maintaining 'marriage' is reserved for heterosexual couples and civil partnerships solely for same sex couples.\n\nWe believe all long-term domestic partnerships should be recognised under the same act of parliament whatever form that may take.",
