        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Tax breaks and grants to fund the conversion of derelict buildings into housing stock should be provided in order to aid in the regeneration of rundown areas and alleviate the difficulties in getting on to the property ladder in Britain. Special subsidies should be made available for individuals (as opposed to comercial interests) wishing to take on derelict properties to reonvate, providing a more financially accessible route to owning your first house. Such an initiative should prove cheaper than building new housing stock as well as helping to prevent unnecessary expansion onto greenbelt and virgin land. It is a sensible long-term supplement to the government's existing building programme.",
