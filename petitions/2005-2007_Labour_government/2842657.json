            "background": "Nurses, quite rightly, are promoted when their skills show that they can take on a more responsible nursing role. In most cases they are placed in charge of other nurses, but have no management skills whatever. This leads to a \"playground hierarchy\", which relies on bullying and threats, where Employment Law and the rights of nursing staff with lower rank are routinely disregarded by untrained and unskilled people who have been placed in positions of power. \n\nIf, on promotion, nurses were required to pass courses on Management Training, the lives of younger, and less skilled nurses would be made less miserable.",
