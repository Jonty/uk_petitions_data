        "background": "Perhaps the people in Britain would do something about their ever increasing waist lines if they had the facilities to do it. Too many times I have turned up to play football on Saturday / Sunday mornings only to be confronted by something which resembles the Somme. How people are expected to help themselves is beyond me when the facilities are not there for them. Older people may say that they played on pitches in all conditions when they were younger but we are not given that chance, with councils calling off games in mass because of rain or removing the goal posts when its dry to prevent damage to the below standard pitches. I can only assume that people who try to enjoy other sports suffer the same fate.",
