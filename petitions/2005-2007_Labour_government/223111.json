            "background": "people who are in receipt of DLA care component at any rate and higher rate mobility have already justified there disabilities. For someone genuinely disabled to be sent for a medical is further stress and indignation for these people that they can do without. These people should not have to justify there condition as a simple GP letter would give better information than these forced medicals. The doctors who carry out these examinations are there to catch people out, although this may be good in the case of the person claiming income support for a sore back, 80% of those caught out are not on DLA, these people have already been examined by government doctors.",
