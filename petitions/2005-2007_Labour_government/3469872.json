        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "After the recent Virign Trains derailment from London to Glasgow recently, I feel that it is time to push the government to bring the Railways properly and fully back into public hands. Before the tories sold it off, travelling by rail was safer and there was hardly any accidents. Unlike today, Remember the Hartlifield derailment, the potters bar derailment, the fact that too many companies are mainaining the lines and the shocking statistic that these are now being carelessly maintained by Network Rail and other rail engineers. \nWe,the public need better,safer rail travel - even more so since rail fares are on the increase, yet we get nothing in return for these fares as the recent Virgin Train disaster shows.\nCompanies like Network Rail have learned nothing since the last derailment tragedy and the government MUST be forced to take immediate action, thus ensuring this NEVER happens again on British Soil!",
