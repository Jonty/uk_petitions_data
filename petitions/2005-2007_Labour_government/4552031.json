            "background": "In ordinary circumstances this would be prohibited. It seems because the soldiers were detained by the Iranian Government this gives the right to change policies and practices. Just because the Iranian government is not co-operating regarding Nuclear enrichment process, does not mean we should play games and incite hatred between Iranian and British people. Publicity of this nature is unhealthy. Whilst sympathising and worrying about each and every soldier who was detained, it is sickening to use them as pawns in a situation with a bigger agenda.",
