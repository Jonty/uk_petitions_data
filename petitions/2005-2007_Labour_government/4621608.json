        "background": "i am a loving father who through no fault of my own is estranged from my former partner. for some strange and outdated reason this means as i was not married at the time of my sons birth i have no rights at all in law and have to beg to see my son. i am not allowed to take him away as my ex partner is very bitter and uses contact with my son as a barganing tool. i work in the nhs and therefoe cannot afford thousands of pounds on solicitors to achieve what should be my right to proper and fair accsess to my son whom i love with all my heart. how can this be right or fair on either my son or myself, not to mention the countless other fathers or mothers without the money to pursue this issue through the courts?",
