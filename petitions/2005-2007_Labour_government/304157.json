We are all quite capable of seeking out for ourselves products, services and like-minded people, without being bothered in our own homes by uninvited visitors. This is particularly important in view of the way such approaches are used by criminals, however, people should have their right to peace and privacy protected and only the police and similar authorities should be able to visit people's homes without request.",
