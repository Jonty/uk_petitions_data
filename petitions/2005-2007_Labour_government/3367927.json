            "background": "Royal Mail are in the process of finalizing plans for a massive cull of what remains of the Post Office network, with government blessing.\n\nIt is anticipated that 604 sites will be closed in the North of the country, in addition to a further 380 in the Midlands, 327 in the South West, 296 in Scotland, 228 in the East, 209 in the South East, 205 in Wales, 157 in London, and 94 in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe company state that the closures are necessary in order to retain a competitive edge, despite the fact that more income is being generated through the new system of mail charging.\n\nThe closures will inevitably affect many citizens, but mostly the elderly, poor and sick who rely upon benefits paid into Post Office accounts.\n\nBefore long the mere concept of a local Post Office will disappear altogether for many people in this country. So, please add your name to this petition and help us fight for all those who will be affected.",
