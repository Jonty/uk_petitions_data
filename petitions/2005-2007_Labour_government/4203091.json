        "action": "Bring back local council rent offices and the previous rent card system in the London Borough of Havering. Council tenants were able to visit their local offices to pay their rent and deal with other relevant enquires with staff who were knowledgable of your local area. People now, have to travel a lot further to one central office which puts a strain on pensioners, disabled and families with young children who form the majority of council tenants. The scrapped rent card has also created more confusion for people as it was working perfectly as a written recorded reminder of your rent account.",
