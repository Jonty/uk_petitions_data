            "background": "Currently the public transport links between suburbs in North London are close to non existent. When journeying between suburbs a passenger must go in to central London and then out to the destination suburb. This is severely time inefficient, as a result the north circular road is consistently congested with vehicles as commuters can not spare the extra journey time. A train or tram linking the suburbs must be introduced at the earliest possible date.",
