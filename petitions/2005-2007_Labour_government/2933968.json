            "background": "It is illegal to buy Alcohol under 18.\nSo why is it ok to drink alcohol at five and over.\nAlcohol is a depressant drug. Users can end up feeling very down.\nGirls get more drunk than Boys on the same amount of alcohol consumed and they can also develop drink-related health problems earlier than boys.\nYoung people seem to be drinking alcohol\nmore openly than ever before since it is not illegal to drink alcohol only to buy it.\nWith so many outlets now providing alcohol.\nIs it not our  responsibility  to protect our young in society and guide them in the right directions.\nLong term over-use can lead to serious\nLiver,Heart and Stomach problems.\nMore and more young people in our areas are admitted to Hospital with acute\nAlcohol intoxation needing emergency\ntreatment with fatal outcomes.\nThis Habit is increasing so why do we not do something about it now before it could end up being one of your children.",
