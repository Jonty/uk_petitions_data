A resolution is proposed by Louis Georges Tin, the President of the IDAHO Committee for the UN to have a Universal Decriminalisation of Homosexuality to protect individuals\u2019 human rights.  \n\nWe ask the United Nations :\n\nTo request a universal abolition of the so-called \u201ccrime of homosexuality\u201d, of all \u201csodomy laws\u201d, and laws against so-called \u201cunnatural acts\u201d in all the countries where they still exist.\n\nWe ask Tony Blair, to support the resolution, and ask him to bring the resolution to the United Nations next year as a supportive country.",
