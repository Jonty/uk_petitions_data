            "background": "The SNP minority government intends to bring forward draft legislation in the autumn, with the intention that, by April, all future graduates will be exempt from the graduate endowment liability. It is unreasonable and highly inequitable that students who enrolled in 2001 and fulfilled their academic duty unwaveringly i.e. did not fail, or defer a year, will be the only students liable to this endowment.\n\nSurely these diligent individuals should not be financially disadvantaged as the only Scottish students liable to this financial burden in the face of a divided, rapacious, short-sighted parliament.",
