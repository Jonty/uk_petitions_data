It is expected that the government will scrap their \u2018supermarket needs test\u2019 and stop local authorities considering whether a new supermarket is needed when deciding on planning applications.\n\n\u201cIf local councils cannot say \u2018No\u2019 to supermarkets when they are not needed, how will they ever be able to stop them undermining our high streets.",
