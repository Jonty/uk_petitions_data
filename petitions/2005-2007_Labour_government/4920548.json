        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This petition is to bring parking or obstructing a cycle lane an offence similar in severity to the offence of speeding in a motor vehicle. That is to say, a fine of 60 pounds and 3 penalty points should be applied to an offending motorist who parks in a cycle lane. It is of no doubt to anyone that blocking a cycle lane forces cyclists out into the road, and therefore into oncoming traffic.",
