            "background": "G.P's frequently misdiagnose through lack of insight, or even ignorance. Patients do die as result of these misdiagnostics. I know of two personally within two miles of each other who were misdiagnosed and died in the same year. I learned of the second misdiagnosis and death whilst I was in hospital myself due to dialing 999 as I fealt my GP  was constantly misdiagnosing me whilst I was becoming more ill. G.P's do not offer treatments to patients in the process of reaching  NHS money saving targets.   It is a well publicised policy that part of GPs job is to save the NHS money. Unfortunately the General Medical Council  looks after the GP first when a patient takes the time and trouble to complain.",
