            "background": "Farm land that is vital for our survival is being destroyed to make way for housing. Without this land we will not be able to produce enough food for our rising population. \nDefra's consultation paper 'Draft soil strategy for England'  States that, 'It has  been long standing government policy to protect as a national agricultural resource the best and most versatile (BMV) agricultural land. However the government is allowing these grades of land to be built on. Local councils are including grades 1 2 and 3a in local plans when alternative sites of poorer quality land exist.  The prolonged heat wave in central and southern Europe in summer 2003 caused estimated crop losses of $12.3 billion. This will increase due to global warming leading to food shortages.\nWe can't imagine a UK with food shortages however without land to grow crops this may become a reality for the next generation.",
