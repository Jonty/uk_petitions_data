            "background": "Many government related contract jobs are posted with the requirement that the candidate must be security cleared / CTC level etc. However, the time-scales for these jobs prevent anyone without current security clearance from applying. Moreover it is not possible to independently obtain it as it requires a sponsor. This is effectively a closed shop as only those who have previously got SC can apply.\n\n\nI call on the government to allow contractors to apply for independent certification (along the lines of PRINCE2) so that they can apply for security cleared positions and thus the government will have a wider range of candidates to choose from when recruiting for such positions. Independently sought security clearance would be at the individual's expense.",
