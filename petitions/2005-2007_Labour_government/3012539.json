        "background": "The Police and Safety Camera Partnerships are policing 30MPH areas in an evermore draconian way. Some say for no reason other than to raise money through fines. Yet 30MPH areas are signed to a lower standard than any other speed limit. Even highly experienced Police drivers have said there are times when they are not sure of a speed limit when driving out of their own areas.\n\nWe the undersigned petition the Prime Minister, Police, Safety Camera Partnerships and Highways Agencies to sign 30MPH with 30 MPH roundels mounted on lamposts on the output of roundabouts and where a road opens up into two or more lanes (i.e. where safety Camera Partnerships place their camera vans).\n\nWe ask this to reducing speeds in built up areas and to be fair to all drivers.",
