            "background": "In April 2005 new legislation was introduced to give the Spouses/Common law and Same Sex Partners of Service Personnel four times their annual wage as a lump sum on their death if it was attributable to their duty.  Unfortunately, the Government refused to backdate it, so Widows who lost their husbands in the early days of us being in Iraq and before only got one and a half times the wage, it's not that much money compared to what the Americans give to their War Widows.  I believe that all living War Widows, whether they lost their husbands in Iraq, the Falklands, Northern Ireland or at any time deserve the difference paid to them, their husbands made the same sacrifices no matter when they died and should be treated the same.  A fair deal for the dependents is long overdue.",
