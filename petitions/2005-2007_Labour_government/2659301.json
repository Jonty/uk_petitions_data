            "background": "One of the reasons that capital punishment was abolished was due to the problem of a miscarriage of justice. When the death penalty was last in operation in this country it was the only punishment for murder. My answer to this is to make the death penalty just one of the punishments available to the courts. With the advances in forensic science and DNA profiling the likelihood of a miscarriage of Justice is greatly reduced. If the case could not be proven beyond reasonable doubt in order to warrant a capital sentence, then the offender would be sentenced to life imprisonment.",
