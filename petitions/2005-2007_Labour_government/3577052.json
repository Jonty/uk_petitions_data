Also it encourages the crime of deliberately causing accidents.\n\nAnother possibility is removal of the \"named drivers\" clauses and replacement by automatic 3rd party \non any driver being made law.\n\nAll insurance companies should be reviewed by trading standards once a year.\n\nIt seems that under the current system it cannot be decided wether it is the driver that is insured or the vehicle, meanwhile the insurance companies make money for noting hand-over-fist",
