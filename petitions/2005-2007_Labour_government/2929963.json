Passports are already available with administrative systems in place. So it would be less expensive to expand the existing system. The government has a history of projects over running and costs more than doubling on any large IT projects it undertakes, the reason for this is because you fail to keep it simple. To make this system fair any national id should be issued free of charge.",
