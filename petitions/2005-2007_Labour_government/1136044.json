The use of \"Historic vehicles\" (Classic Cars) is mostly to complete a few miles cruising on a Sunday or to display at fetes and rallies.  Lets preserve our now none existent motoring heritage by giving some incentive to the enthusiast to keep these cars and bikes going for the enjoyment of all.",
