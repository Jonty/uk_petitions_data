            "background": "Snoop Dogg has been let into this country on numerous occassions with his past well documented.  With his revamped image and message of love and peace it seems he is being thwarted.  This is a major contradiction and all peoples young and old should not stand for this hyprocrisy as there are alot of fans awaiting his arrival.  These fans feel an extra attachment to Snoop as he is/was a firm friend of the most acclaimed rap scholar of all time Mr tupac Amaru Shakur and sean 'Puffy' Combs being affilliated makes this somber collaberation a truly historic gathering.  We ask the few from the police who block his arrival to bury the hatchet, be proffessional and set a good example themselves.  Thank you.",
