            "background": "Re The high cost of school uniform: Letters issued to parents of 'new intake' pupils clearly indicate that schools in Hull have rudely ignored government guidelines recommended in the recent \"Watchdog\" enquiry.  This enquiry was set up by the OFT, CAB, and various child welfare agencies, to enable parents a freedom of choice when seeking the best value supplier for their childrens school uniform. One such Hull school is still insisting that parents buy either in-school, or from a sole designated supplier, completely resisting these guidelines. If you object to this continued, costly exclusivity, please add your support to this petition.",
