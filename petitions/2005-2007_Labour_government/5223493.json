        "background": "Having been a sufferer of anxiety and panic attack disorders for more than 35 years, I still find it unacceptable that this area of relatively common complaint receives such scant attention. I have just been referred by my GP to a therapist in the NHS only to be told that I have an 11 1/2 month wait. I felt atrocious a few weeks ago and visited my A&E department only to be told that there was little that can be done, but had I considered yoga!! The rest really speaks for its self in that I submitted this petition almost 2 weeks ago now, however it was refused on the grounds that it contained a link. Fair enough, but the link was highly critical of the governments present stance, the report was entitled 'A New Deal for Depression and Anxiety Disorders' - from The Centre for Economic Performance's, Mental Health Policy Group. \n\nHelp is all we need!",
