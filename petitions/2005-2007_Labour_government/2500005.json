Common sense.\n\nIf you're stopped at a red light, and an ambulance/police car/fire engine comes up behind you, sirens and lights on, you should not be fined for moving through the red light so that they can pass you.\n(Common sense would also dictate that you make sure it is safe to move through the red light.)",
