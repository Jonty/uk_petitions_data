            "background": "For too many years we here in Essex have been vilified and have had the Mick taken with stereotypical nonsense from the media and cheap shot comedians. In truth mostly we are hard working and entrepreneurial, but it is remarkable considering how your Government treats us with poor road infrastructure and overcrowding in already overpopulated areas such as the Thames corridor. The wealth generated by my County must be immense but we are hampered by bottom of the league table status when it comes to our future well being.\n Therefore I ask that we be allowed independent status so that we may better control our own destiny free from consecutive Government oppression and poor neighbour white stilletto cheap shots that deminish our hidden talents.",
