        "background": "Why should it be so difficult for someone to come to the UK to work and live, to contribute to the economy, while it so easy for those who wish to take advantage of the system? Illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers cost us, the tax payers, a lot of money. (This petition is not in relation to true asylum seekers.) It is very easy for fake asylum seekers to enter and stay here on benefits for years until their cases are decided, lodging appeal after appeal. At the same time it is extremely difficult for someone who is willing to work and pay taxes - without the right to benefits - to come to work and live in the UK. Their cases are decided much more swiftly (a good thing), as are their appeals. While it seems there is a lot of focus on cutting down on legal immigration, there is not nearly enough focus on cutting down on those non-UK individuals who are here, living on benefits while not contributing anything, and who so often turn out to have been here illegally all the time.",
