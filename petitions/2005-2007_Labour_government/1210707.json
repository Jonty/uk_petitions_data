            "background": "I am sick of cyclists always being looked down upon by motorists and pedestrians. The roads are not safe with the amount of idiots there are about. Also arrogant motorists (esp taxi and van drivers) think they rule the road and we have no right to be there. Then pedestrians think they own the pavements even when there is a designated cycle path. I ride down the CYCLE path and all is hear is 'get on the road' by ignorant pedestrians. Its about time cyclists were treated more fairly and allowed on the pavements.",
