            "background": "SPD (and DSP) affects the pelvis in early pregnancy and is related to hormonal changes. In SPD the pelvic tendons slacken too much and basically cripple the sufferer, meaning they depend on mobility aids to get around. Usually, SPD corrects itself after birth, as hormones return to normal. However, if it doesn't it\u2019s known as the more severe form: DSP. The sufferer then has a permanent instability in their pelvis, leading to chronic pain and limited mobility, resulting in a dependence on mobility aids. Aside from the physical issues, the condition has a physcological effect on the sufferer, leading to depression and a reliance on strong pain killers. This affects the whole family, often resulting in one partner leaving work to care for their family, which compounds the physcological issues of the sufferer. This is a massive drain on NHS resources, and there is no clear path of treatment and no known investigation into identifying the causes, preventing, or resolving the condition.",
