            "background": "NHS staff are highly skilled, educated people who constantly and consistantly provide selfless care for those in need.  Assaulting a member of NHS staff in or on the grounds of a hospital will result in a nine month prison sentence, six months more than assault on a member of the public.  Yet those who assault NHS staff are rarely prosecuted.  This is not acceptable.  A fine of \u00a350 is not enough to deter the public from assaulting staff.  Assaulting a police officer instantly gains you a night in a cell.  The punishment for assaulting NHS staff must be of equal severity.  We are being disgustingly let down by the courts, Mr Blair.",
