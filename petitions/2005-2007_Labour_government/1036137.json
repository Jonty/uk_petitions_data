            "background": "To date the siting of offshore wind farms has been at the discretion of the DTI, they have failed to consult with any users of the sea as to the appropriateness of the sites they have chosen. Even Trinty House (the General Lighthouse Authority for the UK) have not been consulted and they have to mark these sites to prevent danger to shipping and damage to the installation. Example The Offshore Energy Hub in the western approaches has been sited in the middle of a very busy shipping lane.\n\nWhilst not against wind farms we ask that when licenses are issued, due note is taken of the current use of that area by mariners.\n\nThe sea is not a limitless resource and must be managed sustainably.",
