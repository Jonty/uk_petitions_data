            "background": "With traffic congestion becoming an increasing problem in the UK, more emphasis should be placed upon developing the cycle lane infrastructure. It isn't enough to paint a line on the side of a road and expect that to pass as a safe and usable path for cyclists. Cycle 'superhighways' - straight, wide cycle paths that are independent of roads - should be built in towns and cities which cater solely for cyclists and provide a safe means for travelling around on a bike. Not only will this take cars off the road and improve both traffic congestion and the environment but it will also improve the nations health.",
