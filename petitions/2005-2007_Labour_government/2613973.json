            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "There is more light at the end of February than there is at the end of October when summertime ends. There is absolutely no reason why the country should be made to wait to the end of March for the lighter nights to begin.\n    Bringing forward summertime would be beneficial to the economy giving people the opportunity to get out and about sooner and out of hibernation mode. It could also save lives on the roads as previous studies have stated. Sufferers of SAD syndrome would get a months reprieve from the dreadfull durge of wintertime.\n     The alternative suggestions of no wintertime or double summertime \netc are never going to get acceptance due to the lack of agreement between the affected parties. Bringing forward summertime by one month would be the best compromise and should be acceptable to the majority.",
