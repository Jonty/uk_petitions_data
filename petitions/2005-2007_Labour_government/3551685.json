            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Satellite dishes that measure more than 100cm in diameter require local council planning permission to use them on your property. \nThe current system of applying for planning permission is ill suited to this subject and should be abolished. This system is a waste of resources in local planning offices, resources that could be put to better use on other issues.\n\nThere is no law that is against huge trampolines being placed in gardens!\n\nI propose that satellite dishes under 180cm in diameter should not require planning permission if they are ground mounted. Ground mounted meaning, not attached to any wall of a building and not mounted on a groundpole where the absolute top of the dish is higher than 10 foot.\n\nIn addition the 100cm maximum size limited for wall mounted installations should be increased to 120cm.\n\nThese proposals need not apply to installations in area's of natural beauty or those on buildings that are grade listed.",
