These are just a few examples of the bad road usage that is ever present on the UK road network.\n\nThe government has a duty to encourage better driving practises to promote the safety of all road users, so why not use the media to teach road users?  Small adverts that explain the reasons NOT to put your fog lights on just because it's raining a bit or it's dark.  Show users the reason why dazling the driver in front with badly adjusted headlights can cause irritation.\n\nThis in turn could reduce \"Road Rage\" incidents and accidents.",
