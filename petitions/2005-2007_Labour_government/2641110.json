In light of the fact the Government policies appear to be failing to provide adequate social,educational and welfare provision for children, I suggest that the British Goverment is privatised and that the Dutch Government(Netherlands came top in the Unicef study) are asked to run Britain in order to improve social, educational and welfare standards for children and future generations.",
