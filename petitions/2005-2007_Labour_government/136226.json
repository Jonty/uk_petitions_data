            "background": "The retail sector is the most inefficient when it comes to energy efficiency; emiting on average more carbon dioxide per sq ft than households or industry.\nOne of the reasons for this is that supermarkets have huge open fridges and freezers. Apparently this is due to \"public demand\". ALthough I don't know anyone who has demanded that their supermarket to have an open fridge.\nIf all the supermarkets put doors on their fridges and freezers they could significantly reduce the amount of energy they use.  That's a cost saving, as well as an environmently-friendly one.\nIt's not going to happen unless somebody tells the supermarkets they have to. As our Prime Minister we want you to tell supermarkets that we want doors on fridges and freezers so that they save significant energy.",
