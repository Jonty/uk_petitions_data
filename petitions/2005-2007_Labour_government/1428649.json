            "background": "Countless generations of Britons have prospered and thrived under the banner of a United Kingdom and wales, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland have all benefited greatly from the unique melting pot that a unified Britain represents and allows.  In these days of seperatism and minoroty lobbying it is time for the great British Majority from all the home nations to unite and ask HM Government to re-write the Act of Union binding the United Kingdom together in social, political and economic union for generations to come.  Lets not talk about devolution and independance and remember that whichever nation we call home that together we are stronger and each of us has more to gain from the others.  Speculation and rumour mongering about Scottish and English independance does nothing for our great nation.  The reason Britain is great is because we have been United for 300 years, as the old addage goes 'United we stand, Divided, we fall.'",
