If 2,000,000 people buy there 1 pack a week it could generate \u00a32,000,000 a week for the goverment. This can be used to for alot of things. It can run clinics to help the more heavy users. It can also go into the NHS, and also go towards police to manage it.\nJust think \u00a3104,000,000 a year will go along way.",
