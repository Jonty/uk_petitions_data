        "background": "I am a single person who is trying to live a single life. Why do I have to pay the same amount of tax a a married couple. it's cheeper to live as a couple than a single person. The discounts you get on Council tax is 25% I put out half the rubbish a couple would use, but only get a 25% discount. I don't want to live with someone, I'm hapy alone whay make my life harder because you want married people and couples lives to be easier. There are thousands of young single mums in the country. Who don't work and my taxes go to pay for them to live and bring up there children. I think it's time you gave us single people tax relief for a change.\nAlso my income tax is the same as a couples tax, again this is not fair as I need to work longer hours and more over time to compensate for the shortfall your tax system leaves me.",
