            "background": "Millions of pounds worth of illegal diamonds come in to Britain from countries where there is war and thousands of innocent people killed in order to retrieve these diamonds. The money we spend on these diamonds can then be used in these countries to buy weapons which are used to take even more control and shed more blood. You can now request that a diamond be conflict free but how are we to know they really are unless there are none of these diamonds coming in to the country at all.",
