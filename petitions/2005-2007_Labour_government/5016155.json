            "background": "Currently, far too much coverage on television is of more mainstream sports such as football. Whilst we are not necessarily asking for this to be decreased, there seems to be no reason why coverage of dinghy sailing should not be increased. Currently, if you were to see just 1 hour a month on BBC TV, you would be lucky! Sailing in this country is quite a popular sport, so why not help to increase awareness of it through television?",
