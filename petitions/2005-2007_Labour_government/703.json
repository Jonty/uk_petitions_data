This causes environmental damage through the production of the junk mail.  It then has to be disposed of presenting further problems.  I personally, get a small bin full of junk mail every week all of which goes straight in the recycle bin.  If I dropped this junk mail in the street then I would be charged with littering.  However, anyone who wants can litter my front room with this junk under the current laws.  Therefore, junk mail should be banned.",
