His legacy has been blighted by the Iran War and heightened tension in Iraq; not stopping the offering of peerages for loans, not dealing with knife culture in deprived communities; failing to sort out the Health Service during his watch, presiding over a Home Office that has become a laughing stock; acting as a lap dog to an incompetent American president, increasing tension and security risks from the Muslim nations.",
