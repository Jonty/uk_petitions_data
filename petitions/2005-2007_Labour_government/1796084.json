        "background": "The benefits system should be a 'safety net' for all of us. Unfortunately, there are too many able bodied people, 'career claimants' who are capable of doing some work, claiming benefit and some have a better standard of living compared to many of those who are working and paying taxes to support them. Single parents and other 'able bodied' benefit claimants should engage in some training/part-time work to help them improve their skills to return to work and they should only be allowed to remain on benefits for a maximum of 10 year to reinforce this aim. Too many women claim to be single parents when the father of the child is residing with them. Sadly, these scenarios of the benefits system being abused are no longer occasional and the whole system needs to be 'tightened up'. The funds saved could be paid to pensioners and the disabled to allow them some dignity and to keep the retirement age for those of us who choose to work and pay taxes to a maximum of 65.",
