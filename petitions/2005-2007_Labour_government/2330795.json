            "action": "use legal aid for deserving cases which can be deemed as a justified cause instead of legal aid given to certain groups of people to hold their beliefs in religion. I do not believe that taxpayers money should be used for irrational causes e.g promoting veils because it is the belief of certain individuals and not all of us taxpayers and why should we pay the legal aid costs for those cases in court when we do not believe in those things",

            "background": "Legal aid should be used for people who are deserving and are really not able to finance themselves for justified causes. But the religious beliefs of certain individuals should not be entertained for legal aid as this discriminates against the others who are paying tax yet do not believe in that particular religion and feel wronged in having their hard earned money used for religious or hatred propaganda hence it should not be used for any religious beliefs",
