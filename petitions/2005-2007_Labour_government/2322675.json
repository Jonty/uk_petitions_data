            "background": "This A&E facility is the only one serving this area to the North and South of the Downs in the Chichester area.   Closure would mean that cases would have to go to either Queen Alexandra Hospital Cosham (already overloaded and some 40 minutes away) or Brighton the same distance away.  Money has been spent on modernising the facility and this will be wasted.   Downgrading the status of this hospital will also remove a valuable NHS training facility at all levels.",
