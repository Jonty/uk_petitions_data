If goods were priced at a round figure, the annoying, wallet clogging penny could be removed from circulation and maybe given to charity. There are an estimated ten and a half billion pennies (approx \u00a3105,000,000,000) in circulation which could be put to better use. So, companies, round your prices up by a penny and between us WE CAN RAISE MORE THAN ANY OTHER FUNDRAISING ACTIVITY EVER!",
