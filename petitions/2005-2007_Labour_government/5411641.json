            "background": "Non resident parents (NRPs) allegedly pay child maintenance for the benefit of their children. There is no requirement by the resident parent (RP) to direct such funds for the benefit of the child. Today, many couples do not live in the same household when they begin a relationship or even when they have a child. Their \"separation\" consists of each parent continuing to live in their own property and one parent obtains residence of the child and payments for \"child maintenance\". It is not denied that with some expenditure results in the child deriving some indirect or direct benefit, but any funds not so used means that the RP receives help maintaining a home which was not receivable prior to the relationship. Non payment of \u201cchild maintenance\u201d for any reason carries a stigma which is not always justified. This is not an attempt to let off parents who do not pay, but an exercise in transparency and truthfulness which is needed in this contentious area.",
