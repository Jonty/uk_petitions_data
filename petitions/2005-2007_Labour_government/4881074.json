I am very disheartened that of the petitions I have signed none have resulted in any change in policy or direction.  The only \"action\" that has resulted from my signatures on the petitions has been an email from the PM stating the reasons why he intends to plough ahead with the policy regardless.  This is not acceptable to me when, as in the case with the recent road charging petition which attracted well over one million signatures a large portion of the public is making their feelings known.\n\nThe government is ultimately in place to represent our interests and unfortunately our interests are being ignored.",
