        "background": "There is a chronic lack of nurses on wards in Hospitals. St James in Leeds is one such hospital. A nurse who has only been working for 3 months was left on the pediatrics ward on the night of the 14/02/07 by herself and further to this she had earlier been told that her best friend had passed away. This is just one example of how bad the situation is. Nurses are being asked to work 14, 16, 20 even 24 hour shifts. This is bad for there health and this only compunds the problem. More money needs to be given so that more nurses can be employed at all times. Maybe bank shifts could be brought back",
