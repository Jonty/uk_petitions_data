            "background": "The Government has introduced a \u00a315 surcharge for persistent offenders. This fee will not go towards victims associated with the persistent crime, but a pot used mainly to appoint dozens of domestic violence counsellors to help bring alleged cases of abuse to court.\n\nWe support initiatives that help victims of crime, and abuse but fully oppose the penalisation of motorists when the perpetrators of those crimes should be the ones paying this Domestic Violence surcharge.\n\nA motorist is an easy target to be labelled a persistent criminal, who could inadvertently clock up multiple offences in a very short distance or time frame due to speed camera proliferation and increased motoring offence legislation.\n\nAny charges payable by motoring offences should directly support victims of motoring crimes, and improvements in road safety.",
