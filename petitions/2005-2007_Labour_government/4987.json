            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "With over \u00a31billion raised by councils in parking revenue in the last year many members of the public and motoring organisations believe that some policies are revenue geared. Especially with some councils offering incentives/ targets. We are now fined \u00a3100 if we return to a metre 3 minutes late whereas if caught shoplifting we could receive an \u00a380 fixed penalty! Now we are watched constantly by cctv cameras to see if we stop with a wheel in a yellow box or cross a bus lane. Then in London we have the western extension of the congestion zone forced upon us despite the consultation showing many more people against than for it. Finally we are told that if we live in the zone and drive such polluters as a ford mondeo or a 1.8 audi tt that we are in fact driving chelsea tractors and will pay \u00a325 to drive our kids to school when it's raining from 3 years time. The alternative is to sell our vehicles to drivers outside the zone This relentless persecution of the motorist must stop.",
