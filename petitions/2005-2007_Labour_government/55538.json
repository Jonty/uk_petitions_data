            "background": "The current speed limit is hopelessly out of date; it was set back in the 1960\u2019s based on the safety, performance and capability of vehicles manufactured then. Over 40 years ago. But, automotive design and technology has come a long way since then. Even the cheapest modern cars are far more capable than the best made 40 years ago. Therefore, the speed limit should be raised to a limit that would be reasonable today, in modern Britain, that being 100 MPH.",
