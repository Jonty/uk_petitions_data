            "background": "If our civilisation has a future we need to move the polluting industry and power generation out into space.\nWe need power from the sun, and power from nuclear sources, but the place for these is out in space. \nWe may have only a brief window of opportunity where we have the resources and skill to attempt this move into space. Many writers have explored the new frontiers that such a move produces, and the vibrant cultures that could develop. Equally they have explored the stagnation and decay of civilisations in decline. The historical record is full of civilisations that have flowered and then fallen into decay. \nWe must take all the resources that we need to lift our civilisation into space to ensure a long term future for our descendents in space,for life on this planet. To give an exciting focus for all our generations. A source of inspiration, a reason for study, investment for new industries, a long term solution to chemical and carbon pollution. It is the only way forward.",
