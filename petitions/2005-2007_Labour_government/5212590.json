The logo is ugly and totally inappropriate for the purpose to which it will be put.  It will age badly and will look dated even before the Games begin.\n\nThe prime minister should put pressure on the Olympic committe to think again about this logo.  Further, he should insist that the \u00a3400,000 wasted on this symbol be returned to the public purse.",
