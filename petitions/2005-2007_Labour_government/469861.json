            "background": "Two e-petitions have been created, one asking that census information should be released after 70 years, and another that access to census information should be improved under the FOI Act.  When householders gave information to the census enumerators, they understood that information would not be released for 100 years (most people who gave information would be dead before that).  This undertaking should be respected.  The organiser of one petition writes that 'Birth, Marriage and Death information is already available so why is information about where people lived hidden.'  Birth, marriage and death registers have always, neccesarily, been in the public domain, unlike the census.\n\nThe FOI Act should be amended to prevent access to information the submission of which has been accompanied by confidentiality guarantees",
