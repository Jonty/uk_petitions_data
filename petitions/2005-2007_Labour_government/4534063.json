            "background": "As a person who is blind in one eye, I have been denied a provisional driving licence by the DVLA. There are many other people who have also been denied as a result of a disability. However, this is a severe disadvantage, limiting the people to whom this applies in many ways; such as certain jobs, and not to mention convenience. Thus, I think it should be made that the people aforementioned should be entitled to free public transport.",
