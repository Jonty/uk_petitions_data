            "background": "I am concerned about the high volume of foriegn agency workers being brought into the uk by british employers to keep down the costs of wages.There are many british citizens who cant find work as alot of unskilled work is taken up by agencys from other countries,i believe this needs looking at before our the unemployment rate gets higher.Already at my place of work there are more foriegn agency workers than british and these are people who havent come to live in the uk permanently but brought here by the company i work for untill their visa's run out then they draft in some more and so on,they hardly employ british citizens any more.",
