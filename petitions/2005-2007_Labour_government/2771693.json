            "background": "The Prime Minister and his Government seem to have chosen to ignore the unprecedented support for the anti road pricing petition, and intend to continue with the plan and local trials for the system. This scheme will prove even more unpopular than the Poll Tax, and will undoubtedly result in civil disobedience on a massive scale: If the Prime Minister intends to persist with the introduction of it then he must also plan ahead to deal with this civil disobedience, if each prison were able to house 1000 inmates then 1500 would seem a conservative (pardon the use of the word Prime Minister) estimate of the likely need in view of the number of petitioners and far many more who will also rebel against the scheme.",
