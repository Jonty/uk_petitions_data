            "background": "Create Regional Young Offenders Institutions to be run by former members of the British Armed Forces.  These would take adolescents from the age of 14 - 18 and give them a 6 week correction and rehabilitation course which would initially correct with physical, mental and discipline routines and then train in life, social and work experience skills.  On completion of course, adolescents would 'graduate' with a basic work based skill (carpentry, plastering, IT etc)and a social skill (Help the Aged, Care in the Community etc).",
