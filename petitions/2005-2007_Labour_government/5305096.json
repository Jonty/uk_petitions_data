            "background": "Im 16 years old and have just left school, Instead of investing money in exclusion units for being a \"naughty boy \" why dont schools and the government give us something to be at school for, There are no lessons which teach you about day to day things when we leave school like  ironing,putting on a tie, washing and cooking. Also why are there no competitve sports in high schools, were constantly told not to \"slide about \" whilst playing football. This is silly there should be differnt \"houses\" at school where you can gain house points and bring in some competitveness ! This will also bring down child obeisity and combat some behavour problems in schools.",
