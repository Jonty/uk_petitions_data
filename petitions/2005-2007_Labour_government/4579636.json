On many occasions, the 'output' reflects the views of the minority, rather than the majority! There are too many occasions where the BBC provides a very negative viewpoint, whether the topic is UK related or on foreign policy, such as Iraq.  The BBC should comment accurately and truthfully, provide a balanced report, and when there is good news, highlight and acknowledge it. If they, the BBC,  wish to follow an 'Agenda', then we, the tax payers/UK residents should be released from paying the License Fee!",
