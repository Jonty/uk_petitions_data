Charges patients 26 pence a minute to ring out, 3. Charges friends and relatives 49 pence a minute to ring in, 4. Charges \u00a32.90 per day to watch TV, 5. Charges for car parking at hospitals, 6. Cannot supply an high proportion of patients with an NHS dentist, 7. Has introduced minimum waiting times for treatment in many hospitals, 8. No longer carries out treatment in small local hospitals, 9. Provides different levels of treatment in different areas of the country - and if he is as ashamed as he should be, then take immediate and effective action.",
