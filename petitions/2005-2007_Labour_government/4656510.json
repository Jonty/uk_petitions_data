        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This bill will allow wrongful forced treatment of people who are labelled by others as 'mentally ill'.\n\nThe use of these powers could be influenced by prejudice, racism or other varients of discrimination.\n\nThey are a likely weapon of misuse against minorities and innocent sufferers of mental conditions, by doctors and police as they see fit.\n\nBBC News has suggested that some people will avoid making doctors appointments for fear that they might be detained simply because of their illness and not knowing when or if they will be released.\n\nA petition based on this matter has already been rejected on the grounds of 'unauthorised mention of a web site'. \n\nThis text has no such grounds for rejection and for the sake of extremely valuable human rights the public should unite against this bill.",
