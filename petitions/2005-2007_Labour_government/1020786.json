            "background": "The rationing of petrol and diesel is a much fairer way of reducing car emissions and helping stop global warming. \nThose that do not need all or any of their fuel ration can sell their rations to others requiring more.\nThe total amount given in rations per year or month could be decreased gradually, thereby gradually reducing fuel use and harmful emissions.\nRations could be adjusted according to accessibility to public transport.\nProposals to introduce road pricing and tracking are unfair, will not affect the rich and are another infringement on our privacy.",
