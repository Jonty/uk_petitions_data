        "background": "So many people don't bother to vote at the local elections, this could be the time for a questioner to be handed out to all voters on the main issues of the day, so that the government in power can get some feed back on what its people want them to do while in power.  We need to let the government know how they are doing every 2 years. \n\nWe want to let these (some time detected and vacant) MP's know how were feeling. We need another type of platform where we can have our say and not have to wait 4 or 5 years to have it. I'm sure that if this was available at Local and general elections then the government would know what the people who put them there want them to do.\n\n\nThere could be 5 or 10 questions that can help steer them to what the general public want them to concentrate on, i.e.. Immigration, Road Pricing, National Health, Iraq, etc. \n\n\nIts our country, why should a few hundred people decide without consultation to the people they serve.",
