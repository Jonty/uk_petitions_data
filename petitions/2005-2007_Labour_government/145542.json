            "background": "We ask the Prime Minister to support and promote the provision of affordable homes in the UK, for long term affordability. At the present time affordable homes are only affordable to the first  buyer of the property as co-ownership and right to buy schemes allow large discounts to the few lucky residents of such properties. These schemes and the sale of the property  prevent the properties affordability in the long term. True affordability must remain at the heart of housing provision and as a basic right to british people. we the undersigned, urge the Government of the UK to create a scheme of truly affordable homes for british people to be able to live in and remain affordable for all time.",
