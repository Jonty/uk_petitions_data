        "action": "raise the minimum wage to encourage those on benefits to work instead of living off tax payer's money.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is ridiculous that some government benefits mean that it is better to be on benefits than to work full time on minimum wage, particularly single parents. Whilst it is appreciated that it is costly to raise a child etc, a single mother will earn more on benefits than through working. There does not seem to be any incentive to work and it is not surprising that this government is producing a nation of underage mothers and drop-outs who would prefer to get free housing and an easy life without having to work whilst those who have worked hard all their lives are taxed enough per year to support someone such as described. Of course some people are unable to work but there are far too many who choose not to because being on benefits is much easier and more convenient; there needs to be an incentive for everyone to want to work and achieve, and this will come from raising the yearly income of minimum wage above the levels of benefits per annum.",
