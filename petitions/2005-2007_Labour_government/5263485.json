            "background": "Recently the CSA has decided to name and shame fathers who do not pay child support. i am in full agreement of this. However as a divorced father I have found that the resident parent usually the mother refuses us to see our children when the law says we have a right to. There is then usually a long court battle to have a court order put in place. Even then the mother may still refuse without fear pf the law getting involved. I would like to see these resident parent (and I say this as it may not be the mother in some cases) named and shamed for preventing lawful access to children by the other parent. If you agree please sign the petition.",
