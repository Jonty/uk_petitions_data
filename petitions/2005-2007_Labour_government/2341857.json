        "background": "As a normal motorist I get fed up with the way some drivers use our public roads as a private playground and seem to think they are the only ones using the roads and motorways, I suggest that if they knew that they would have to take a driving test in a few years time, it may make them stop and think the next time they come to a roundabout I should warn other motorists that I am on the junction by indicating my direction of travel or on a motorway changing lanes with no warning to other road users.\nby this measure we can cut down the number of accidents on our roads & motorways with the knock-on effect of cutting down the number of deaths as well, I urge you all to support looking at this idea with a serious and open mind.",
