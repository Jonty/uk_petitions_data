The BBCs 606 message board is swamped with people expressing their dislike (only a few hours after the launch) and I feel this should be brought to the attention of the Government.\n\nIf you really want young people involved in the Olympics, why not hold a competition and a public vote?  The BBC could put it on their website.",
