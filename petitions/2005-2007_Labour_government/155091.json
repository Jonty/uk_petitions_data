        "background": "In July, 2006, the Home Secretary announced that British passport control officers are to be put into uniform.\n\nIt is an unusually friendly face that Britain has presented to those entering until now, and one that it will be a great shame to lose. Having passport control officers in plain clothes, as opposed to uniforms as in most other countries, presents a pleasant, civilised, image of the country, and suggests a state that is welcoming, and non-oppressive. Impressions do count.",
