This disease causes irreversible liver damage and liver failure.  Patients are likely to have approximately 8-10 years from diagnosis before liver transplant is required, and there is only one treatment currently available that slows down the progress of this disease.  It is an autoimmune disease unrelated to lifestyle.  No cause is yet known for the onset of PBC, only suspicion about the factors involved.  PBC is a debilitating disease with fatigue and depression being some of the early symptoms before diagnosis. Low energy is probable, together with significant associated pain in the muscles and joints from PBC and other associated autoimmune conditions.  In many cases patients have at least 1 or more of these conditions together with PBC and the quality of life is greatly reduced.",
