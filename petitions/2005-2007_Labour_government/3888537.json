        "background": "In 2005 there were 5671 successful suicides in adults aged 15 and over. \n\nIn 2005 there were 3201 total number of deaths in road accidents.\n\nI am happy that there will be a clampdown on the use of mobile phones whilst driving with no hands free kit, as I think this is a genuine factor in road traffic accidents.\nI agree that anything above a zero death rate in road traffic accidents is not acceptable, however, the number of fatalities has remained fairly constant over the last ten years.\n\nThus proving current policies are failing. \n\nCan you accept that targeting speed as THE major factor in road accidents is incorrect (although in some cases it can be a contributing factor); can you divert your resources to investigating other causes?\n\nOr maybe the finances would be better used to treating those people at risk to suicide, a bigger problem and an even more tragic end than dying whilst commuting on Britain\u2019s roads.",
