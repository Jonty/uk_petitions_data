            "background": "I would like to see a ban on the sale of all retractable dog leads as they can cause serious injury to other people. Owners who use these leads frequently allow their dog to run around in circles, very often around other members of the public causing them to trip or fall. On occasions I have also seen these leads being the cause of road accidents as the dog has run across the road in front of oncoming traffic and the owner has been totally oblivious to what the dog is doing.",
