            "background": "We are being urged to be green and to recycle more and more. Yet across the UK, there are so many inconsistencies with local recycling policies. In some parts of the country, you can recycle virtually anything, including yoghurt pots, margerine tubs & tetra pak. Yet, in other parts of the country, recycling even plastic bottles is extremely difficult.\nWe urge the government to create a standard recycling policy to be adopted by ALL councils in the UK. This would make it very easy for us, as a nation to become much, much more eco friendly and reduce dramatically the amount of waste that goes to landfill.",
