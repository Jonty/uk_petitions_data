Some of these con-artists work very quickly & some take their time to get as much money as they can. If you find out that your marriage was a con, you should be able to get an annulment, the marriage isn't real in this situation. You cannot save it or work on it, because there is nothing to save.......it was not real & should be dealt in this way. The marriage should be annulled & seen for what it is, a con!!!!!",
