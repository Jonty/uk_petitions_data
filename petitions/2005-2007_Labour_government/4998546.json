            "background": "Over the years, we, the British television license fee payers, have paid a substantial amount towards the Eurovision Song Contest via the BBC.\nOver the past few years, it has become more and more obvious that the UK is not welcome in this event and last Saturday really proved it. It is an embarassment and  a complete waste of British People's money and we should withdraw our support, like Italy. \nAs we are told that the BBC is 'our' BBC then one would hope that they have paid attention to the negative press following this years' debacle, but I doubt it.\nI am sure that Sir Terry  would welcome a break from commentating on the bias that this contest now has in the form of 'neighbour' and block voting. It is now a waste of his formidable talents.",
