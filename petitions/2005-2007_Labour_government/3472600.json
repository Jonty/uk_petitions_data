Debt repayments take up most of our income after essentials, and this is barely paying the interest. There is no hope of getting onto the property ladder. Rents are \u00a3400+ a month in London and the south-east for a basic room in a shared house or studio flat. The debt is crippling. We need interest-free loans to help us to live and get out of debt.",
