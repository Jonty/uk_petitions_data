        "background": "Graduates leave university in huge debt. The job market is tough. Most end up on relatively low incomes - but most work, rather than living on benefits. Debt repayments take up most of our income after essentials, and this is barely paying the interest. There is no hope of getting onto the property ladder. Rents are \u00a3400+ a month in London and the south-east for a basic room in a shared house or studio flat. The debt is crippling. We need interest-free loans to help us to live and get out of debt.",
