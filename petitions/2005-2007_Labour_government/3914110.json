Once october arrives the council begins to shut the park earlier and earlier - ending up at 3.30pm in december. In the winter this means you can't walk your dog after work, which is really bad. The park is not unsafe. Its well lit. Its overlooked. There is no rationale for closing the park so early. Its ridiculous.",
