            "background": "This could be used as an alternative or as an additional sentence to fines, prison sentences, commmunity services, etc. The act of being spanked in public would humiliate offenders rather than giving them street cred, it would cause no lasting physical harm and would give the public the opportunity to confront the people responsible for much misery. It would be cheap to administer (you could even charge for the best seats), tourists would love to see a slice of old England.",
