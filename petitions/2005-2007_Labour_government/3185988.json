        "action": "Allow the BBC to advertise and scrap TV licensing, make the most used communication medium of this millenium free.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "With the right management or overseeing, the BBC could keep it's policies of serving general public interest without bowing down to advertisers. By removing the need to fill every advertising space with something, they will be able to show many programs without interruption. The elderly and less financially fortunate would no longer have to pay for their television viewing.\n\nVery few countries (if any) require a license to own a TV. Many people, including myself feel it's obselete. Especially as now when we can have access to hundreds of channels full of advertising, a couple more won't hurt. The benefits I feel will outweight the negatives.\n\nThe money wasted in scaremongering people without televisions or licenses both in print and on screen could also be saved and make the UK population feel less watched.",
