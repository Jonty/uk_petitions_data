Regardless of the mechanics involved, we have a right to ensure that we are minimising the impact of our time on the planet. We have to protect a legacy for future generations and ensure that we enrich and evolve in conjunction with the planet. Rather than focusing on CO2 as a cause/effect mechanism, lets spend some money and find out how we effect the planetary weather systems. It is our DUTY to act upon this, we should not be driven only by finance.",
