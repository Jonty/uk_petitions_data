            "background": "We wish to ban large and heavily over weight females from wearing items of clothes that show large amount of flesh, this includes summer tops, small t-shirts etc items that are in fashion but do not cover unsightly parts of the body. Females should be banned from wearing such items especially when they think it is sexy. Males would not get away with this and we know it, so we don\u2019t do it and females would be the first on our case. So why do they think they can get away with it. Small items of clothes should be for females that have the figure for them.",
