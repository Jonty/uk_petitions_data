            "background": "Under recently introduced legislation, local housing allowance, previously called housing benefit, will be paid to tenants who are expected to meet their rent from it.  Quite a number don't - they spend the money on anything but their rent and only after 8 weeks rent arrears has arisen (and a few other closely defined circumstances)can the local authority thereafter pay it to the landlord direct on the basis that the tenant cannot be trusted.  There is no penalty attached to a tenant misusing public money in this way so therefore a new offence ought to be created to stop tenants effectively stealing the landlord's rent for up to 8 weeks!",
