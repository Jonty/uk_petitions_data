If they fail to comply then we should hit a new target every 6 hours until they do.\n\nOur service personnel are not political pawns they are brave sailors and marines and deserve the protection of our government.\n\nIf we fail to act now every tin pot dictator in the world will take it as a sign that it is OK to kidnap our military personnel.",
