            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The recent spate of \u2018gangland\u2019 shootings in London and the UK, show gun culture is being seen as normal, and that carring guns is seen as 'romantic' by many teenagers who are influenced by gang culture.  \n\nCurrent regulations dictate a 5 year jail sentence for carrying or being found in possession of a gun. Compare this to ABH/GBH 5 years, Fraud 4 years and shoplifting 7 years! And you see it is a mockery.\n\nA strong message has to be sent that this crime will not be tolerated. We need to act swiftly to ensure the UK is not swamped with gun culture.  People who carry guns invariably do so because they would consider using one.  GUNS HAVE NO PLACE IN A CIVILISED SOCIETY.\n\nWe call up the PM to increase the mandatory sentence to at least 10 years in order to create an effective deterrent against gun carrying.",
