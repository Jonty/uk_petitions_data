            "background": "In the 21st century we should be ashamed of the number of children leaving school unable to read and write properly.  Instead of reducing lessons to 10 mins, the current education system should be simplified. Our childrens education is the foundation of the future of this country and from the extremely low standards being achieved and offered by the current system Britain's future looks extremely bleak and all we are raising is a generation of unenthusiastic, uncompetative under achievers.  The system should be simplified and concentrate on the basic skills such as reading, writing and mathematics.  From such little acorns oak trees grow.",
