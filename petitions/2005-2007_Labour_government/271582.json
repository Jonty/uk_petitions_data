            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I believe that the most effective way of reducing serious crime is not to treat persons convicted of crime to a easy life behind bars, But have a stricter regime which will deter people from carrying out crime,and taking liberties with anothers health and quality of life. Instead of molly-coddling the criminal,The criminal needs to be made aware of his actions and must face the suitable consequence? I'm not suggesting 'Off with there heads', But what I suggest is making cells smaller,A bucket for a toilet, No computer games, no pool or snooker tables, Certainly no trips, And basic plain provisons enough to provide the relevant nutrients but no treats like burgers, pizza etc. I truly feel that if a harsher regime was introduced, Then instead of persons brazenly breaking the law then thinking 'Oh well it was worth doing for a few months easy time' Hopefully it would make them think twice before taking a liberty with another humans life. WE HAVE TO GET TOUGH, ENOUGHS ENOUGH",
