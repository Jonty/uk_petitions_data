        "background": "In light of the teenage killing in London and rising youth crime across UK, the police cannot be the ONLY ones held responsible for controlling youth crime. As a community, PARENTS should also be held responsible for crime committed by teenagers under 18 years old. I feel alot of parents have left their teeangers to run their own lives and do not care about them anymore, making their children feel unwanted and demoralized. IF parents show more concern, interest, civic responsibility and guide them to become rightful citizens. As this is not being done by parents, then they should be held responsible for not taking their parenting role seriously and they should be held responsible for serious crimes committed by teenagers.",
