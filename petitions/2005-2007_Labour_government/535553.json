        "background": "I am in favour of speed cameras in the UK - providing of course they are positioned in accident blackspots and there to protect lives.\n\nHowever, over the last couple of years they have popped up on national speed limit roads - such as the A14 and other roads which could be perceived to deliberately extract cash from drivers.\n\nAs the number of speed cameras are unlikely to be reduced, would it be possible to have a choice in punishment for minor speeding offences? \n\nPersonally, I would rather pay a flat rate \u00a3150 fine and have no points on my licence than \u00a360 and 3 points. But we should be given the choice.",
