        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The safety of young children is being put at serious risk by fully laden quarry vehicles on a narrow access road to a busy Bolton primary school at pick-up and drop-off times. At the busiest times there can be more than 25 20-ton lorries blocking the school lane and the junction to the main Hardy Mill Road which is a designated crossing area. Lorries have been mounting the pavement in this area. We would like to work with the quarry owners James Booth to reach a workable compromise that would keep lorries and children apart at the busiest periods of the day. If this isn't achieved the probability of a serious accident or fatality is extremely high.",
