I wish to ask the PM to encourage a new logo based on the true meaning of competitive sporting pride in the 21st century. The new logo should be put to a vote by the populace on a national TV and the internet.\nA very public forum should decide how we look to the world and we should encourage the previous designers of the appalling graffiti to give the public the money back it spent on producing such a grotesque image that will do nothing but degrade our standing on the international sporting scene.",
