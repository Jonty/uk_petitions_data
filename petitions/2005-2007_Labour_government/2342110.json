        "action": "Reform the TV Licensing legislation, to allow UK forces personnel residing in single living accomodation, to be excluded, or to have abated television license fees",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Many personnel, within the UK armed forces feel that paying full price for television license, is excessive, for example:  A single accomodation block containing approx 30 troops will cost these personnel accumulatively \u00a34500.  Whereas today personnel held within this countries Detention Centres, are provided with televisions free of charge and are paying nothing towards the licencing costs.  One other factor to contribute, is the amount of time forces personnel spend out of country, thus paying for what they are not using.",
