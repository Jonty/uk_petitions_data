            "background": "Sundays should be cherished as a time for frolicking, playing and having fun. We would, therefore, like to suggest that the Prime Minister seriously consider pushing this further into the national consciousness, by naming every 10th Sunday \"Funday Sunday\".\n\nThere would be clear benefits for society, the economy and our national image - it would certainly end any perception of British people as stuffy and humourless.\n\nOver the last 12 months we have conducted research into the concept of Funday Sunday, and have found that it significantly increases happiness, social cohesion and enjoyment of life. \n\nWe would suggest the following dates for 2007 as an example of how the Funday Sunday concept might work in practice.\n\n28th January (ideal antidote to January blues); 8th April; 17th June; 26th August; 4th November (the significant amount of fun around Christmas would negate problems caused by the gap until the first Funday Sunday in 2008)",
