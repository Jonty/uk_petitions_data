            "background": "Too many people are fitting illegal exhaust systems to their cars knowing fine well they are illegal. People are fitting them anyway, knowing it is a very hard thing for a police officer to enforce. The MOT garages can enforce the law but it is a simple matter to refit the original exhaust system prior to an MOT. Cars under 3 years old do not require an MOT so they get around the law this way. The law abiding people of the UK are entitled to a decent nights sleep but anybody living near a road used lots by car enthusiasts will tell you that they are kept awake until all hours by the racket coming from these illegal exhaust systems. We propose that anybody caught with a non-standard exhaust sytem that doesn't conform to legislation, then that persons car should be confiscated until they pay a \u00a3500 fine and arrange for an independent vehicle repairer to fit a conforming exhaust system. A second offence within twelve months should result in their cars being confiscated and crushed.",
