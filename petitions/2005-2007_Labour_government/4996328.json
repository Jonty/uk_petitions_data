All UK companies should be required, by law, to print a mandatory message on all their products which state (a) That they contain no animal products which are unsuitable for vegetarians; and (b) That no animals have been tortured or killed in the manufacture of this product. Companies who print this message on their products should be regularly monitored to ensure they comply with the message. For companies who do NOT print this message on their products, it will be assumed that their products are NOT suitable for vegetarians.",
