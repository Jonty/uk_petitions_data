            "action": "ensure that the high level of safety enjoyed by UK\u2019s road users as a result of the current MoT testing regime is maintained and not watered down by deferring the MoT until a vehicle's fourth year, then followed by MoT testing  every two years.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The MoT critically increases safety and emission standards, preventing thousands of accident deaths and injuries, making UK roads the safest in Europe.\nEvery year approximately 30% of vehicles (8 million) fail when first presented for MoT testing.  Changing to a regime  of 2 year tests will mean that these 8million vehicles will carry their dangerous faults \u2013 brakes, tyres and lights for another year. Few vehicles over three years old are regularly serviced. \nReducing the period between MoT tests to comply with the minimum EC requirement will allow millions of reckless vehicle users to save money by skipping vital servicing of safety and emissions systems, making the roads less safe for all road users.",
