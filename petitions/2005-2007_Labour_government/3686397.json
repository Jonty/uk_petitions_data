            "background": "Approximately 2 years ago Translink acquired new trains for use on the Northern Ireland rail network. They have specifically excluded the Larne line from benefiting from these and have refused to distribute them equally throughout the Northern Ireland rail network. Indeed they use them frequently in the Republic of Ireland despite the fact that funding was provided by the Northern Ireland Assembly to replace old trains currently in use in Northern Ireland. Passengers on the Larne line are denied the use of these new trains despite having higher passenger numbers prior to their introduction than other lines. This is a scandalous misappropriation of funds.",
