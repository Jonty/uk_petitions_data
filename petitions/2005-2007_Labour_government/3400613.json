            "background": "The Current Unjust Situation: When one borrows money from a bank it is not depositors' money at all. It is new money created by the simple process of writing the amount of the loan on the credit side of the borrower's account. 97% of all money in circulation originates in this way. Banks are charging a tribute\u2013 interest\u2013 for money which did not exist before the loan was made. So they are getting money, in the form of interest, for virtually nothing. \n\nWe petition the Prime Minister as follows:\n\nIt should be made illegal for anyone except the Bank of England, and including the commercial banks, to create new bank-account money denominated in the national currency, just as it is already illegal to forge coins or counterfeit banknotes.\n\nFor Further Details see http://www.bilderberg.org/monref.htm and http://www.simpol.org.uk/policy_monreform.php",
