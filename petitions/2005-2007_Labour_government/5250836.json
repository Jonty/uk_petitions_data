            "background": "Many parents are having their children taken away from them whilst never being convicted of any crime. This is a possibile abuse of the human right to a fair trial. Babies have been removed because of the excuse that the parent has the possibility of committing a crime in the future. It has become so serious that the Lib Dem MP John Hemming  has asked the United Nations Human Rights commission to investigate the issue. He believes that 1000 children are wrongly being seized every year-even though they have not been harmed in any way.",
