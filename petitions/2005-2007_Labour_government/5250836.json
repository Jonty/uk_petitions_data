Babies have been removed because of the excuse that the parent has the possibility of committing a crime in the future. It has become so serious that the Lib Dem MP John Hemming  has asked the United Nations Human Rights commission to investigate the issue. He believes that 1000 children are wrongly being seized every year-even though they have not been harmed in any way.",
