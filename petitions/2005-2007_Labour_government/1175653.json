            "background": "Back in 1997, before devolution, the UK was a harmonious unitary state with local government to address the needs of local communities. The introduction of new assemblies has not only wasted money but has prompted disaffection elsewhere in the UK, and issues such as the West Lothian question. It has grossly upset the balance of representation within our sovereign nation. We must act now to prevent devolving to the situation pre-1707 of a collection of squabbling states.\n\nStop regional nationalists from splintering it and focus on unity, reforming local government to address local needs, do not introduce more expensive assemblies. Devolution has been taken too far unnecessarily. We must support a United Kingdom and preserve hundreds of years of political evolution which has put us at the forefront of the world stage for almost 300 years. What would our ancestors think, who struggled to achieve such union, if now we allowed its death?\n\nGreat Britain is great, keep it that way!",
