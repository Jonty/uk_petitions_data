        "background": "At the moment, Child Benefit is only payable for over-16s as long as they do not do any higher education courses. \n\nFor example, if a 17-year-old is doing A-levels at XYZ School, the parents get Child Benefit. If a 17-year-old is doing A-levels at XYZ School and also does an Open University course, the parents don't get Child Benefit. This means that the families of hard-working young people are penalised.",
