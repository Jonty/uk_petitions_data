Apart from the flashing images that can cause those sensitive to 'strobing' to become unwell, there are none of our British Colours represented within the logo.  We are a multicultural nation with millions of talented contemporary artists, please use someone who can represent us as we are today, not re-gurgitate a look that stems from the 1980's childrens television!",
