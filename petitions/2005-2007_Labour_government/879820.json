        "background": "The best thing to start rebuilding this country is to abolish central government, which is an institution which has no real interest in the human person, it is only self serving and drains all our resources, murders our people with pointless wars etc etc. We need to get back to human basics, 1st family 2nd local community and by local community I mean the one an individual chooses! Democracy what does it mean? It means what ever some power drunk person wants it to mean. We all know this is unlikely to happen peacefully so maybe it will have to happen by force, which is a great shame but a probably reality.  I could write much more about the sad state of our human races current failings, but of course your not allowed to do that because you be classed as a terrorist whatever that is, abit like democracy NO REAL MEANING!",
