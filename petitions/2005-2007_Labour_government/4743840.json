            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Privatisation has resulted in a rail system that in many places performs worse than British Rail had.\n\nThe system is wide open to abuse from both the DTi who are demanding enormous and unnecessary sums of money in premiums and unscrupulous companies who pass the cost of premiums to their customers to protect their profits. They also have been allowed to provide poor services and raise ticket prices. Action against them is not being taken quickly and the operational mistakes some of them make are a joke, such as providing insufficient trains for rush hour demand.\n\nThe premiums system must be abolished and ticket prices kept tightly controlled so to stay below inflation. Schemes such as railcards for people who do not have cars or frequently travel on trains must be encouraged, and unpopular companies who provide poor standards of service such as dirty/ overcrowded trains or poor customer service must be PROMPTLY removed from the industry unless significant improvement is made.",
