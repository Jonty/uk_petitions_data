And yet our input amounts to one tick every 4-5 years. If we are judged competent to convict or acquit, why not judge us competent to serve as members of parliament. It is currently the one job where you need have no relevent experience so it wouldn't exactly hamper the quality of the people sitting at Westminster, whilst it would encourage everyone to participate in the workings of the country, as free, responsible citizens. It would allow parliament to be truly representitive instead of being a mish-mash of ex-lawyers, union big-wigs, and business leaders.",
