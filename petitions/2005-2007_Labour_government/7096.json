            "background": "One of the arguments against the UK taking a lone stance on greenhouse gas reduction is that it will leave us economically fragile. One way to minimise this impact would be to support and incentivise the use of home-grown UK-based technologies.\n\nFirstly, the Government should identify ways to better support UK microgeneration companies in start-up and growth, and secondly, consumers should be encouraged (mandated, if possible) to purchase technologies largely produced in the UK.",
