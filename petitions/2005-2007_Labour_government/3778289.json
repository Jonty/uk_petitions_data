(Actual quote from JCHR report)\n\nWe do not want homosexuality to be banned, all we want is that our freedom, whether religious or atheistic be retained.\n\nIf you hold any type of belief, whther religious or not against gays, your civil freedom to say and think what you like will be taken away unless the SOR is stopped.",
