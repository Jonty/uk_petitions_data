        "background": "The Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR) believe that Gay people should be given undeniable rights to do whatever they please, even if this limits, or indeed removes the freedom of other groups to act in the way they want to, and have done for years.\n\nThey propose to 'limit the manifestation of those beliefs' that contrast with those of gays. (Actual quote from JCHR report)\n\nWe do not want homosexuality to be banned, all we want is that our freedom, whether religious or atheistic be retained.\n\nIf you hold any type of belief, whther religious or not against gays, your civil freedom to say and think what you like will be taken away unless the SOR is stopped.",
