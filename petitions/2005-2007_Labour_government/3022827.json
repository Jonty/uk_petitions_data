            "background": "This allowance is supposed to help disabled people buy in extra care they need to help them stay at home rather than in a residential home. Historically this allowance is allowed depending on how much your local authority pays towards care and not the amount of hours. As the north of the country charges less per hour than in the south this is unfair as someone for the sake of example who gets 25 hours per week can get charged almost half as much per hour in Yorkshire as someone in London so a lot of people miss out on essential care or have to go into residential care.",
