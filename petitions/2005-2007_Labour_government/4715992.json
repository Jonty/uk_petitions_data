            "background": "I own an incredibly 'green' car (spectacularly low emissions and over 90 mpg)but it was first registered about 5 months too early for emissions testing. It is also light enough to be partly classed as a Quad (also mysteriously excluding it from such tests).\n\nIt would make sense to allow owners of older vehicles (and indeed all categories of vehicle) to voluntarily include an emissions test at MOT and thus qualify for 'green' tax breaks for as long as the results justify it.\n\nThis would be fairer and would reflect the fact that - as long as the vehicle is in good 'green'condition - it is 'greener' to keep it rather than have another one manufactured.\n\nIf it's emissions ever rose to above tax breaks threshold it would lose them, and if they soared to an unacceptable level it would have to be scrapped. The owner would voluntarily opt to take the 'risk' or not at each MOT.",
