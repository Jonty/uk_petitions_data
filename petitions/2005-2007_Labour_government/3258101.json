            "background": "One of the biggest polluters in this mordern world is aeroplanes, however they get very limited tax on them, therefore they get away with not paying for the damage they are doing to our Environment! Instead the government likes to put the tax on the cars for polluting the earth when they are a minor factor of pollution compared to the aeroplanes. This is why i think the government should scrap the tax on road charging and tax the aeroplanes more for their major pollution!",
