        "background": "\"The Government plans to reduce the number of qualifying contribution years needed to obtain a full basic State Pension to 30 years for both men and women who will reach their retirement age on or after 6 April 2010\" (BBC News 31 Aug 2006). \nAnyone who reaches 65 before that date has to have 44 years (men) or 39 years (women). I propose a gradual reduction in the the number of qualifying years required, from the current 44 to the new minmum of 30 years.  This would be similar to the gradual change of pensionable age for women from 60 to 65, and would avoid a sudden change in the requirement between those reaching retirement on 5 April 2010 and those reaching retirement on 6 April 2010.",
