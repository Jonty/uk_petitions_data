            "background": "Due to the fact that man made global warming is a lie by our government, this petition has been created to abolish carbon dioxide taxes. There is no direct correlation between the amount of carbon dioxide and the temperature of our planet. In fact our climate is driven by the sun and carbon dioxide is a product of temperature rise. This is because our oceans have carbon dioxide dissolved in them, and when the temperature of the ocean rises it gives of carbon dioxide. Which is why carbon dioxide is a product of temperature rise and not the cause! this bring me to the conclusion that are government, who already manage to tax a huge amount of money from us, should not tax us for carbon dioxide emissions.",
