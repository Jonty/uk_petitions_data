            "background": "I think we can all agree that Star Wars Episode 4, 5 and 6 were the best films ever made; I grew up with them. In my adult life I went to watch Episode 1, I sat there for 2 hours and watch a loony fish man and an irritating. I walked out and where as I felt sad it did not destroy my resolve.  \nThen came Episode 2, Lucas had learnt his mistakes with the fish man and had got rid, however the irritating kid had turned into an even more irritating hoody, who quite clearly had schizophrenia which should have been picked up on. Episode 3, I won\u2019t even go into, you get my point. \nNow, to the point of my petition, I want Lucas to make Episode 7, 8 and 9 before it is too late for the original actors, except this time make the damn things right! I want the British people to back me on this and force the government to officially ask Lucas to make them. If a negative response then I say the British government send the SAS in to take him hostage until he complies. Whose with me?!?!",
