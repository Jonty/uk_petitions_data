            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The abolition of the 10pence tax rate is unfair and reports suggest it will make life harder for individuals earning less than \u00a318,000 by raising their tax burden.  It will adversely affect younger single people, who already face very high housing costs and growing student debt.\nThis money could be recovered by cutting the \u00a3200 heating allowance from the asset rich baby-boomers (those reaching 60 now). A recent report, from the Bank of England revealed that those just coming up to retirement age, 55 to 64, saw their wealth almost treble from \u00a350,000 to \u00a3149,500, due to rising property prices, whilst  those under 35 years have lost out. It is ridiculous and grossly unfair to be redistributing taxes from poor to rich. Indeed, I have met recipients of this handout who use it to buy their Christmas champagne.\nFurther, in terms of Carbon giving money to buy extra fuel is worst possible way tackling fuel-poverty or preventing death due to hypothermia. Other approaches would be more sustainable.",
