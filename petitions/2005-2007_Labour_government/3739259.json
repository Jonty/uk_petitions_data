            "background": "It is bizarre in the extreme that Red Arrows joyriding should be funded from the public purse yet Air Ambulances across the UK are reliant on public generosity to provide a vital service.\n\nIf people wish to see this luxury continue they should be allowed to contribute from their own pockets. If the Red Arrows are a symbol of excellence for British industry then those companies that believe they will benefit should contribute to the cost - not the taxpayer.\n\nIf the pilots maintain an operational commitment they should be paid by the MoD. If the aircraft have no operational function then they should be privately funded.",
