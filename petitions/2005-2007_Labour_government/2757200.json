Teenagers involved in Guns, Knives, Drugs, Muggings and other serious crimes should be sent to Boot Camp. I urge the Government to consider introducing US style Boot Camps with a strict code of discipline. Inmates would have the threat of being sent to Prison if they fail to conform to Boot Camp rules.\n\nNo more softly, softly approaches to violent crime, it does NOT work!",
