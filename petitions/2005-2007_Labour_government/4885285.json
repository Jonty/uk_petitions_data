Realise that in 50-60 years' time, this newly expanded Heathrow will be too small and will need to be expanded again.  How much more expansion of Heahrow can London take?  What about the people who live around.  More expansion means more flight routes and more flights and we will all go slowly insane.  Think of the future.",
