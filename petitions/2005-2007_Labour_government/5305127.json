            "background": "At present, if you care for your child at home and are not in employment, you are not entitled to claim any clild care costs.  I care for my six year old son 24/7. In order to have some form of respite he attend an after school club twice a week.  But because \"I don't work\" I cannot claim child care costs.  This is an insult and is discrimination to all carers.  I ask that this be changed so that those parent carers at home be allowed some help with respite breaks.",
