            "background": "We have a son, whom we need to educate in a loving, diciplined, like minded (to our beliefs) educational system. We are Biblical Christians and have an oath to our God to raise our children in His ways. Proverbs 22:6 states:\n\"Train up a child in the way he should go, And when he is old he will not depart from it.\"\nWe believe in seperation of Church and State and Individual Soul Freedom, thus we are obligated to teach our son in the way that we know is best for him and that serves God and all other people best. Thus we will be contributing to State Education, when we ourselves will never be able to use it, and at the same time we will have to make great sacrifices to educate our child privately. As a person with a disabilty it is difficult enough to pay the bills and mortgage. We only ask that we get what you believe we invested, to use ONLY for the Education of our Child in a schooling system which serves God and all mankind with love.",
