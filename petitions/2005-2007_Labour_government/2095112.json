            "background": "It is well known the local councils around the country waste our money, it is a national joke,on there sites people on site one working three watching, the joke stops when we get our bills in April each year.\nI believe all councils not just services but the whole lot should be put out to the open market, for private companys to tender for there services, there should be no more councillors, but each home ,the people that matter should say if say, after four years they are happy with the costs and services from that company, if not they vote in a better leaner one , no longer would we have councils dictating how we should live and we as the customers would have the upper\nhand, after all WE pay them",
