            "background": "The victim of a crime should be legally represented in criminal courts, representation there to ensure the rights of the victims.  This should include liability of CPS, Police, etc, in their investigations, the liability of the court for past sentencing which failed and has lead to this victim on some level, involvement in the sentence which may in the case of lower level crime help to avoid custodial, better victim involvement and integration to the system.  And to make sure that this system represents not simply the offenders and CJS employees but the human rights of those who are the victims of crime.  At present the suspects are represented, the prosecution which is presenting facts on the investigation is represented, but the real persons who matter in the system are lost - victims are voiceless in the process. Further with Case Law by ensuring the victims are represented in system then courts maybe be further partitioned for a better balance in this system.",
