I have been through the local council route and they tell me that they have no power to make him take them down until the late evening. I find it hard to comprehend that people are allowed to blight other people's lives in this way, \nAs there is no way to stop this noise pollution at the moment, then may be it's time to think about a legal way for it to be stopped. I have no idea how this could be bought into existence, but I am sure there are thousands and thousands of people up and down the country who would be very pleased if something could be done.",
