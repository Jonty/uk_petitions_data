            "background": "As we all know, much of the bus, tube, and railways networks are the worst in the world for varying reasons ranging from: over crowding, lack of investment, expensive fares, awful political decision makers, and profiteering multi-national companies.\n\nA simple solution to this problem is to tax everyone \u00a35 per week, but allow anyone to travel anywhere in the mainland UK for free by these modes of transport.\n\nThis would work providing the government re-nationalizes the whole network, plus it would automatically free traffic from our congested roads by allowing the coaches and buses to run fast and freely.\n\nHalf price reductions for: pensioners, students and the unemployed.\nKids go free only when accompanied by an adult.\n\nBy my estimate, this would generate 10.4 billion pounds per year from 40 million working paying citizens.",
