            "action": "Repeal the legislation whereby British Telecom can install overhead phone cables and poles without permission from home and landowners and that they be made to install their cable infrastructure in underground ducts.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "It is apparent to many home and landowners, that BT can now just turn up and install telphone poles where they think fit, even though it may entail running their apparatus over peoples land and invading airspaces without permission. Telephone poles should be a last resort, especially within conservation areas where stringent planning issues are in place for the general public.",
