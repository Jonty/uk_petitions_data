        "background": "The Ministry for Transport decided in its wisdom to allow lorries to use all lanes other than the outermost on motorways.  This has created a situation where a five lane motorway is frequently reduced to a single lane by a moving road block of lorries occupying all but one lane.  This has introduced a serious hazard that has increased the number of accidents on what should be the safest of roadways.",
