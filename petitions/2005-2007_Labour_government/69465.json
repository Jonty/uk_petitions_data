            "background": "The Forth Road Bridge is a vital crossing, linking the counties of Midlothian and Fife. The bridge carries annual traffic of over 11m vehicles - 4 times more than it was originally designed to service.\n\nThe bridge's main cables are weakening due to corrosion. The bridge is likely to have to stop carrying heavy traffic by 2013 and all traffic by 2020.\n\nIf this occurs, a national economic disaster will occur. Haulage costs; house prices; social factors; Kincardine bridge etc. will all be adversely affected.\n\nIt is estimated that a new bridge will take 10 years (minimum) to plan, construct and test. Thus even if action was taken now, the bridge may have already closed to heavy traffic and only be 4 years away from full closure. We must act now and make a decision on what the strategic plan to tackle this problem is.",
