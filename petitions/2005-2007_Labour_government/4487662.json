        "background": "School uniforms are just another way for the authorities to push young people into groups. Dress is one of the major difiners of personality and by forcing young people to wear uniforms in school the education system is stopping young people develop and show their personality.\n\nNo other developed country has forced children in state schools to wear uniforms and this has led to them all scoring miles higher than Britain on the recent UNICEF child welfare and happiness survey. They are allowed to show their personality without fear of retrebution whereas here young people are forced into a group as if you are no different from those around you.",
