Many are \nretired or approaching retirement and have a lot of money to \nspend in your towns and villages. However when it comes to \nparking our vehicles on local authority car parks we are in the \nmain locked out, restricted by height barriers or penalised for \nhaving larger than average vehicles. If we take up two car park \nspaces we pay two charges. This does not stop local parking \nwardens issuing fixed penalty tickets because they state we are \nnot parking our vehicles within the confines of a parking bay. \nMany of us would love to visit and shop in the local town or \nvillage whilst touring the country in the summer months but are \nstopped from doing so by the lack of provision from the local \nauthorities. Let us park on your car parks and we will spend \nmoney in your shops and contribute to your economy",
