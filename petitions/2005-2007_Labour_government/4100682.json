            "background": "Bring in legislation to allow the culling of birds of prey back to a more natural level not a man made one. Also stop the RSPB from releasing anymore into the environment. How anyone can claim to be a bird lover then have orgasm's when they see a bird torn to pieces whilst still alive is beyond me. The raptors are devastating our songbird population, our small birds are disapearing at an horrendous rate.",
