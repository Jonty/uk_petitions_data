This way the roads will only be used by the genuine people.\nWhere I originally come from  it has seen a 100% infulux of immigrants,  every week there are reports of these people caught driving with no licence.\nWhat does frighten me is that to buy a TV to watch BBC you must prove you have a licence, however any one can go and by a Motor Vehicle and not show that they have a licence to drive it.\nSeems to me that the goverment is more concerned with you having a TV llicence than a driving licence",
