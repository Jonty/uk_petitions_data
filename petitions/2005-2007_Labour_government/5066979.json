            "background": "All types of company vehicles have now found there way into residental areas for parking on part of the pavements and roads as part of a growing problem around housing areas ,this problem is now getting widespread as it is getting more difficult to park your car by your home as well as your visitors,  it seems we now have upto four vehciles to one household with parking only designed  for possibly  too vehicles, i believe there should be restrictions on the bringing home of large company vehicles as im sure there are  some that are not even  insured for home use, this problem is only going to get worse and cause future parking issues as well as safety issues with people having to walk into the road to get around parked vehicles on roads and pavements  that are not designed to take the parking of this type of vehicle\nso join with me and lets get our streets safe and clear  from this problem..",
