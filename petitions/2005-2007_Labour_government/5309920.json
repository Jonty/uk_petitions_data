            "background": "The suggestion that lowering the drink drive limit will reduce accidents is ridiculous, according to figures from my local area, as published by the BBC website, 6.6% of drivers stopped were over the limit, and 7% of drivers involved in accidents were over the limit. 0.4% difference. Any reduction in the limit will not affect those that are too drunk to stand, they will still drive their cars and kill people. Preventing those who are more than capable of driving after a pint or two is counterproductive. Perhaps someone should look at the 97% of sober drivers who have \"accidents\". According to police figures 99% of accidents are caused by bad driving.",
