            "background": "For over 15 years we have had to watch Midlands football struggle to play well and beat lower league teams while we pay our hard earned cash to watch rubbish on a regular basis. We believe that Wolverhampton Wanderers and West Bromwich Albion should be given twice as much money if either are promoted this season just beacuse we have earnt it. In effect more London teams will be dropped a league giving the better teams a chance to provide better viewing to the nation. This in due course will move up through the country when all midlands clubs have settled themselves in European places. This will give us the right to watch the type of football that we are already paying for.",
