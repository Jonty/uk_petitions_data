For example, public service standards, school leaver standards, customer service standards. This is a call to action to the PM to ACKNOWLEDGE this petition",

            "background": "Please sign this petition to make the Prime Minister acknowledge that while he stands there and says such incredible statements as school standards are better than ever, the NHS is improving, and gun crime is down, we the people at the receiving end do not agree. The government think if they say something often enough it is true. It is clearly not. It is true however, that they keep pouring our money into a bottomless pit and we do not see any improvement in standards anywhere. The opposite is happening. \nI believe the tax system is fair. We must all pay into society, but is it too much to expect some sort of service back?\nPlease make this the most signed e-petition. \nAm I the last person in Britain with standards, a lone voice in the wilderness...? I hope not. Britain, it should make you proud, but does it?",
