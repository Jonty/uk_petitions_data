            "background": "All telephone calls to my NHS Doctor's Surgery go through an 0844 number.\nThis I believe is very wrong, and should not be allowed by the Government who after all first introduced the NHS in 1948 to look after the health and well being of the resident's of the UK.  \nThere is no alternative low cost geographical number available in my case. \nI am also aware of many other practices throughout the UK that are doing the same by making their patients pay premium phone call rates for appointments etc.  \nI urge everyone who is affected in this way to sign this.\nThank you",
