Local councils do not want these vehicles parked on commercial land as they are classed as 'messy' and do not conform into nice little outlets or warehouses etc. Coach and Minibuses provide a much needed service, especially essential services such as  for educational transportation and help the environment by less cars being used .Local companies need to used these vehicles for employees and clients. The government must take responsibility in helping coach/mini-buses business be allowed to grow and help should be available in supplying parking for these types of operation within local districts.",
