            "background": "At present DLA does not assess whether a person can use public transport or whether their disability/ special needs prevents this. It is like assessing whether the person can get to the bus stop and saying that as a result they are clearly fully mobile like all non-disabled people. Some disabilities/special needs like ADHD or Autism may allow you to get to the bus stop but not safely wait for the bus or you may not be able to use the bus once it comes- may be through safety, unable to stand the loud noise of the bus engine, or behavioral reasons that others on the bus would have a problem with or whatever. Since the government wants to force us out of our cars those of us caring for these folk face not being able to go out shopping,take their disabled kids to school, etc unless there is someone to care for the disabled person as their mobility needs are not properly assesed and not everything is close at hand for most people.",
