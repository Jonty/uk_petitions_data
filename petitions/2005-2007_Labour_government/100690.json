            "background": "It's a crying shame that people are not allowed to legally purchase, carry or use ANY form of effective self-defense equipment in this country. At the very least, allow people to carry CS or Pepper spray, as the police and or politicians cannot always be there to protect us 24 hours \u2013 they may have bodyguards, we don\u2019t!. It is also not possible to trust by-standers to help in a mugging situation. A whistle or strong words are not enough to defend oneself with in case of attack. I\u2019m sure that giving people a fighting chance against the increasing number of yobs and thugs in this country will make the criminals think twice about their planned actions. This may help people to start thinking about winning, instead of thinking like a victim.",
