With Storm Trooper \"armies\" marching at the Rose Parade, is it enough to have only a couple of Star Wars themed rides scattered around the globe. With the outside of the Dome remodelled to be even more Death Star-like (ie paint it grey), the Dome would become iconic again rather than be the white elephant it is at the moment. Inside, every fan-persons dream of a world dedicated to Star Wars... rides, lectures, films, shops, conventions ... everything Star Wars under one roof.",
