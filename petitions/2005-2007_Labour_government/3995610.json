            "background": "Low energy light bulbs are well known and quite widely used but provide an inferior light to the traditional tungsten filament (TF) type. They are very suitable for a side lamp (perhaps when viewing television) or a hall light but not where bright, clear illumination is required. Furthermore, the development of LED lighting may lead fairly soon to a light source that is equally as bright as TF and use even less energy than fluorescent low energy lighting, and last for far longer. If the market provides a cheaper, better light, then people will buy them.",
