The money gained could be used to fund a department policing animal cruelty. Animal cruelty is a growing problem and we in this country rely on individuals reporting incidents to a charity who if able then need police and vets to prove cruelty is taking place. The main obstacle to this is the governments lack of interest except when issues are in the news",
