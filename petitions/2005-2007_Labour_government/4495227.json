The amount we actually get isn't worth claiming in the beginning.  \nDo the right thing and abolish the working family/child tax credit and bring back tax relief on the mans wage.\nFor once reward the people who actually work hard to support their families rather than handing everything on a plate to the ones who have no intention of providing for their own families!\nTheres many many families in the same boat as i am.",
