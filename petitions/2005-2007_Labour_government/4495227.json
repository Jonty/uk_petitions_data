        "background": "I'm a working mum, with a husband who works very hard, and 2 young children.  since the tax credit system was introduced we have been much worse off, as it seems we're forever being overpaid and then recieve nothing while we pay the amount back.  The amount we actually get isn't worth claiming in the beginning.  \nDo the right thing and abolish the working family/child tax credit and bring back tax relief on the mans wage.\nFor once reward the people who actually work hard to support their families rather than handing everything on a plate to the ones who have no intention of providing for their own families!\nTheres many many families in the same boat as i am.",
