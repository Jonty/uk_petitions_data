            "background": "An agreement on the reform of the EU institutions was reached at the European Council in Brussels on 23 June. EU leaders agreed the mandate for an Intergovernmental Conference which will draw up the Reform Treaty by the end of 2007. If ratified, this treaty could come into force in June 2009.\n\nGiven that the Reform Treaty contains a substantial amount of the previously proposed EU Constitution, increases the power of the European Parliament and represents a major derogation of UK political sovereignty, a public debate and referendum on this critical issue would be both logical and democratic.",
