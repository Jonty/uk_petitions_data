This Grade 11 listed building has a book value of \u00a33.2m and has been put on the market for \u00a31.9m. Suffolk PCT propose to deliver care in the home and whilst this is appropriate for some people it definitely is not for a large number. Once this facility has been sold off- it can never be replaced. THIS FACILITY IS DESPARATELY NEEDED.",
