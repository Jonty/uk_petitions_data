It is often suggested that these people do not care about politics, but this is quite un-true. Most do care but, simply feel that there is no body or party in the election that represents their opinions or needs, or is suitable for their vote. To truely represent the electorate democratically, these people should be given the choice to say they do not support any of the candidates in an official capacity. This could be done through a simple 'none of the above' option on ballots.",
