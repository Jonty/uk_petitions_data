Whilst it may be justifiable on the 'sidewalks' of Downtown L.A., it is somewhat offensive to see acres of exposed flesh in Wythenshawe Shopping Centre on a rainy Saturday afternoon. We the undersigned petition the Government to outlaw the public exposure of more than 1cm of flesh above the waistline and below the torso garment. We also petition the Government, under the terms of the statute, to provide the police with the ability to issue on the spot fines for any person found displaying their naked stomach in public.",
