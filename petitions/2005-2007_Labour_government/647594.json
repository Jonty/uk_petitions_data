            "background": "For many years, successive governments have waged a war against drivers.  Hitting them with over burdening regulation, reducing road space, imposing excessive taxes, the proliferation of speed cameras, giving councils incentives to reduce car use and setting un-realistically low speed limits.\n\nIf any other section of society were treated like this then it would be considered totally unacceptable. It is time that this persecution of motorists stopped.",
