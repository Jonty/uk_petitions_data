        "background": "Many motorists have suffered damage to their cars as a result of contaminated petrol being released by refineries.  Now we hear that the oil companies are likely to raise the price of petrol by 2p a litre [9p a gallon] to cover their costs to rectify the situation.  This is grossly unfair: the oil companies made the mistake, so why should we have to pay for it as well as paying to have our cars repaired?",
