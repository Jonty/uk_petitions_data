        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Mosquito and other similar ultrasonic devices are designed to deter youths from congregating in areas where older people find them troublesome, however middle-agers and seniors who install them have no empathy with the painful nature of the very loud noise that we can hear, as it is beyond the range of their hearing.\n\nDue to the excessively loud nature of the noise, and the potential for damaging sensitive, high-pitch hearing in those under 30, these devices should be banned as a public nuisance.\n\nThey are indiscriminate in their operation, being heard by all whose hearing range operates to higher pitches (e.g. children, young adults, musicians), and operate at a decibel level that would never be permitted if it were in the normal range of sound.",
