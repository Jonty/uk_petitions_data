            "background": "I wish to make a case on behalf of the thousands of care workers throughout the country who only receive the minimum wage for the invalueable work they do.  Many of these workers who work within a care home environment have to give the most intimate of personal care.\n\n Most of these care homes are privately run and charge extortionate fees in order to make huge profits and keep shareholders happy.\n\nAlthough we have a laid down minimum wage it has not gone far enough.  It is time that individual professions were looked at and a decent rate of pay laid down by the Government to ensure that we get thr right people to do this important work.",
