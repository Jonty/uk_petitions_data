        "action": "Repeal legislation which removed the requirement on Local Authorities to provide suitable permanent sites for Traveller and Gypsy families",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "During the reign of the last Conservative Government, the law was changed to mean that Local Authorities no longer had to provide permanent settlements for Gypsy and Traveller families.  The result has been that families have been forced to occupy land such as playing fields and other communal areas to provide shelter and housing whilst on the road.\nWe would like to see this repealed, so that Travellers have safe and sanitary stop sites to over-Winter and to raise their families.",
