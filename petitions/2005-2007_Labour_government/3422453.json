We the undersigned believe that these channels such as Sky One should be protected from being taken off the air on any platform simply because the companies concernece cannot reach agreement on the cost of those services. Where this happens the deal should be sent to arbitration automatically so that the customer is protected and thus ensuring their interests remain paramount at all times.",
