Even if the greenhouse effect is true its not necessarily a bad thing there are too many people in the world anyway the world will recover afterwards. People who care about global warming either just gullable and believe the propaganda from eco-terrorists like Greenpeace or they are narcissists who want to take the credit for 'saving' the planet. Where would we be today if we had never industrialised, and how is the third world supposed to become developed if they aren't allowed to use their resources it's only fair that they get to burn theirs like we did.",
