            "background": "The MOT is for road safety.If there were no MOT most people would drive their vehicle until it stopped.  With modern ignition systems parts don\u2019t wear out i.e. points, the car keeps going but there are many more parts that are wearing out because of use i.e. steering, brakes, tyres, suspension, lighting, exhausts.The manufacturer has extended service intervals for sales reasons i.e. some vehicles have 30 thousand mile service intervals that means it is only getting 3 inspections in 190000 miles.\nThese cars will probably change hands and could miss an inspection.  The vehicle could do 60000 miles before being inspected. Tyres do not do 60000 thousand miles with average use. Brakes will be worn out steering exhausts light bulbs etc.The driving conditions today need a vehicle to be in A1 condition for the safety of the population.  Instead of scrapping the MOT a vehicle should be tested every year or at least after the first 2 years and then every year after that.",
