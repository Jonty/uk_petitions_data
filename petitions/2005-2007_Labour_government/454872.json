            "background": "I, along with many other people are sick and tired of the behavioural problems currently associated within the UK society.  Criminality appears to be the norm.  Moral standards have been qoushed and the youth of today is able to manipulate the law to their own benefit.\nFrom my view of UK society over the last 10 years - and bearing in mind I am only 35 - there seems to have been a general breakdown of society and its moral attitudes.\nThere is no deterrent to crime and anti social behaviour, and although it will probably take a further generation to dilute the current anti social behaviour problems, the use of corporal and capital punishment within reasonableness, i.e corporal punishment within schools and capital punishment for criminals, would be a deterrent for any parties within the general arenas of life.\nSign this petition to have corporal and capital punishment brought back, which may in turn assist in returning the UK to a positive natured society.",
