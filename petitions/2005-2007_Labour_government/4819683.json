Country life will become non existent, concrete jungles will increase, the English garden will be at risk and to desicrate the English gardens will affect wildlife, the ozone, what little we have left of our way of life and will also affect those on lower incomes, disabled people, everyday walks of life who look to improve thier lives and have a right to enjoy a reasonable life without having to pay for it. We are already highly taxed on all services that are poor. We do not want the English way of life destroyed any further.",
