            "background": "Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation appears to be gaining an increasing stranglehold over the media in this country. In the recent breakdown in negotiations between Virgin Media and Sky TV, it appears that Sky are abusing their role as a content provider to unfairly boost their position as the dominant pay-tv platform.\n\nIf an energy supplier was to behave in a similar manner, the utilities regulator OFGEM would come down on them like a ton of bricks. However OFCOM claims there is nothing they can do as the Communications Act 2003 does not give them the power to intervene.\n\nIt should it be possible to force Sky to separate these two functions in the same way that BT was forced to distance its wholesale and retail operations to ensure transparency and a level competitive playing field in the telephony/broadband market.",
