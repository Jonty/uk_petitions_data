            "background": "If the Mayor of London and the PM put more money in to making whole of london green, then the big citys of the world like New York green. What the Mayor and PM should do is to put Solar Panels on all Skyscrapers and on big Commercial e.g Supermakets and Shopping centers. Then to power the rest of london, the best thing to do is to build wind turbines out side the mouth of the river thames or the noth sea out of the site of people living near the thames or north sea. if this happens then other citys in the uk and the world will follow. and this will mean cheaper bill for people in and out of london.",
