            "background": "To reduce congestion on all roads, impose a curfew on HGVs between 0800-0900 and again at 1700-1800. During these periods when traffic is at its peak often HGVs cause problems when overtaking slower vehicles but then causing a tailback during this maneuver which in turn has a knock on effect. If this curfew was in place then traffic would flow smoother and reduce the congestion time on roads.",
