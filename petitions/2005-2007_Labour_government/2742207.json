            "background": "In this day and age of computerised widely available technology, it is clear that it is easy for the relevant authorities to establish whether or not a vehicle has the appropriate road fund licence, without the necessity to display the traditional disc. When its possible to pay for tax on line without producing insurance or MOT test written proof, its clearly straight forward and easy to check a vehicle / drivers credentials. In addition, on a motorcycle, its very easy for the tax disc to be stolen, and then costs the owner to replace the disc.",
