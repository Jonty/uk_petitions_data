        "action": "introduce mandatory registration of all Estate Agents to the OEA ombudsman",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Ombudsman for Estate Agents\u2019 (OEA) code of practice, to which all member agents must adhere, has received the full backing of the Office of Fair Trading, which has now granted it Stage II approval.  \n\nThe scheme allows the public greater protection from malpractices by estate agents than ever before and can mean any member agent can be struck off from the scheme by OEA if they fail to adhere to the code of practice. \n\nThe Ombudsman for Estate Agents is a limited not-for-profit company that is self-funding and is totally independent. Under its powers it aims to resolve the disputes between member agents and clients and can make financial rewards to consumers.\n\nI believe all Estate Agents must be registered under this initiative and only government legislation can make this happen!\n\nYour vote counts!",
