            "background": "Currently universities can discriminate against potential students by enforcing strict requirements on study-related technology. For example, The Open University requires that all students must have a Microsoft Operating System, a Cassette Player, and a VHS Video Recorder/Player.\n\nAn OS should be a personal choice for each individual to make. Cassette Players, and VHS machines are not available in High Street shops.\n\nUniversities should cater to the top three Operating Systems, and publish study media in current consumer standard formats.",
