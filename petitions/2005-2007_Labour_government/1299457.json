            "background": "The railways of this country have fallen for behind those of European countries both in terms of speed and quality of service.  To redress this, the Government should throw its weight behind the plans of a new high-speed link running between London and Scotland.  The findings in the Eddington Report, which did not back the link, were flawed and should be rejected.  This new line is desperately needed and should be built as soon as possible.",
