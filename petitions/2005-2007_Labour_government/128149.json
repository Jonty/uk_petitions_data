            "background": "1)A top rate of 40% is FAR too low for people who are paid (I won't say they earn) 6-figure sums PER WEEK; even a rate of 90% (without tax allowances) would leave them with more per week than most people earn in several months.  2) If people decide to become tax exiles that is up to them; but if they choose not to contribute to British society, despite being WELL able to, why should they benefit from it?  3) Ordinary working people, including those on very low wages, have no option but to pay tax.  Why should people, who are rich by definition (since they can afford accountants to tell them of these loopholes), get away with not contributing?  Who do they think will pay for the services we all need if they don't?",
