            "background": "The Government has proposed a new National Pensions Savings Scheme (also referred to as Personal Accounts) into which millions of employees will be auto-enrolled from 2012 onwards.  But the new scheme will be put in place with the current system of means-tested handouts for pensioners left largely in place.  The mass provision of means-tested benefits for retired people has the unfortunate effect of making pension savings unsuitable for millions of people in the workforce as the system penalises savers.  Under the proposals in the Pensions Bill people who will one day be in receipt of means-tested support in retirement would find that each pound invested in the pension scheme may only yield sixty pence worth of value.  That is essentially a tax of 40% for saving.  As the proposals in the Bill make it likely that one in three people reaching retirement in the UK will be in receipt of means-tested support, this unfair penalty for saving will potentially affect many pension savers.",
