            "background": "Most people assume that the law requires that packaged and processed  food (such as biscuits) should carry nutritional data. This is not true, if the manufacture makes no claims that its food is healthy, then it need not declare any information at all, even on saturated fats, hydrogenated fats, trans fats or sugars. These latter ingredients can seriously shorten life and lead to heart attacks. In short, with the current law, it is best to avoid all food that do not show concentrations of  saturated fats etc. on its labelling. All food containing harmful fats should provide that information on the packaging.",
