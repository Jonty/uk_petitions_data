        "background": "When the smoking ban kicks in across England (as has already happened elsewhere), there will be a lot of spare ash trays, mostly plastic or glass. Currently, businesses such as pubs etc have to pay for any recycling so there will be no incentive to stop them binning them, and they will end up in landfill.\nWe wish to petition the Prime Minister to actively encourage the recycling of these ash trays, maybe by means of an incentive to such businesses or by offering free recycling for a short period.",
