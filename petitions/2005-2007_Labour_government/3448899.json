        "background": "I believe that religion is the sole cause of global violence these days, it has caused war, famine, hate and most of all has warped the minds of millions. Religion induces racism, sexism, homophobia, feminism, and many other prejudices which most religious books (such as the qur\u2019an or the bible) should condemn but spend half of their time contradicting them selves so is hard to interpret properly and clearly. Atheism should be the way forward. Following a religion is foolish and dangerous and we should put a stop to it.",
