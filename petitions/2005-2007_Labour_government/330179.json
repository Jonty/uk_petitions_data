All such 'evidence' always turns out to be anecdotal and not the result of formal blind trials. Conversely, where formal trials have been performed, no evidence has emerged to suggest that homepathic treatments are any better than placebos.\n\nThe inescapable conclusion is that taxpayers are being conned.",
