        "background": "While there is a time and a place for complementary or mood-enhancing treatments such as massage, it seems at the moment that the pendulum has swung too far in favour of mumbo-jumbo and quackery, rather than scientific evidence.\n\nWe believe that all medical treatments paid for from the public purse should be obliged to submit themselves to formal blind trials and peer review.\n\nSpecifically, there is no reliable medical or scientific evidence to support the efficacy of homeopathy. All such 'evidence' always turns out to be anecdotal and not the result of formal blind trials. Conversely, where formal trials have been performed, no evidence has emerged to suggest that homepathic treatments are any better than placebos.\n\nThe inescapable conclusion is that taxpayers are being conned.",
