        "background": "would it not be more sensible for adults(even raise the age of smoking to 18) to be able to choose if they wanted to go to a pub that allowed smoking (a pint and a castella go together?)or have to go and have a social drink in a pub/restaurant and smell food cooking when they are not hungry? my family all run a pub and none of us smoke but would like to have a choice,we employ no staff, have no food facilities.please see sence,do not make me a criminal,after all it is legal to smoke.things are bad enough in this industry as it is don,t make it worse.thank-you",
