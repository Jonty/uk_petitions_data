            "background": "Prior to my unit taking up JPA we were briefed that the original LSSA bonus structure would be scrapped.  However, to compensate for this loss of allowance the original 10 day qualifying period would be reduced to just 1 day.  Unfortunately, this is now not the case and the original 10 day rule is still in force.  This was not just a Unit misunderstanding, this information has been fed to a vast array of other units in all of the three services.  \n\nAswell as having to face an uphill struggle on the new LSA increment ladder, this comes at a time when all 3 services are seriously overstretched and personnel are spending even more time away from their families.  Please sign this petition and help us get back what we all deserve.",
