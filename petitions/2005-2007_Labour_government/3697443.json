A man driven by his love of his religion and his attempt to reintroduce the Gothic style to Britain, his greatest triumph was his work at Westminster which saw him overlooked afterwards as the architect Barry accepted his knighthood and the plaudits.\n\nNow is the time to right the wrong and award a posthumous knighthood to AWN Pugin.",
