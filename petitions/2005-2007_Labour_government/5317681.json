            "background": "A Cheshire developer Patrick Properties, wants to turn green fields next to the Leeds-Liverpool canal in Chorley, into an industrial estate.\n\nWe, the local Chorley residents & people from surrounding communities object to this on numerous counts:\n\n- wildlife & green fields: wild fowl, heron, water vole, bats.  Children play on the fields and one contains a public footpath that is the access from the Great Knowley housing estate and residents on Blackburn Road down the canal for dog walkers, walkers and joggers, path is well used by visitors and tourists.  \n- Increase in traffic and reduction in safety: junction of B6228 Blackburn Road with A674 is already an accident blackspot. This would increase traffic volume.  No safe crossing on B6228. \n- Increase in crime, noise & light pollution. \n- Unwarranted and unneeded: to date (17/6/07) there are 130 vacant available business units in Chorley. \n- Overall reduction in quality of life.",
