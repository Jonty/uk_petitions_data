            "background": "We are sick of all the drivers that practically get away with not having the minimum insurance required to drive a motor vehicle on our roads. Time and time again these idiotic drivers are caught and fined substantially less than the cost of actually insuring a vehicle. It is about time that these drivers are given much harsher penalties than a small fine and  court costs. \n\nWe think that with every offence the drivers caught should be banned from driving for at least 12 months and fined a substantial amount of money to compensate all the victims who are hit by uninsured drivers. \n\nAlso that a larger emphasis is put on finding and convicting drivers without insurance, instead of concentrating on speeding motorists, such as regular checks of the insurance status of a vehicle, like the road tax cameras that are already in service.",
