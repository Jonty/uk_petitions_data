            "background": "House prices have increased over the last few years and now very modest properties are valued at above the inheritance tax threshold. The money to pay for these properties has been taxed throughout the life of the Morgage, as no relief is now available on Mtg. payments, so in effect tax is being paid twice for the same value, which is unfair. Raising the threshold to 1 million would go some way to redressing the inequity in the tax and would take away the burden from most ordinary families on low incomes.",
