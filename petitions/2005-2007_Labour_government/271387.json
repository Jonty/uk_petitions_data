            "background": "Kelvin Mckenzie has recently made comments about the Scots that can only be described as racist in the Sun newspaper, this combined with his remarks about the Hillsborough disaster are evidence of the unsavoury nature of this man. As such, he should not be allowed on Radio 5 or any BBC outlet, put it this way would they allow David Irving the Holocaust denier on? Kelvin Mckenzie has managed to offend most of the right thinking people in Merseyside and presumably in the UK over these matters. If the BBC allows him to appear, they are insulting the Scots, and the memory of the 96 that were killed in 1989 and giving legitimacy to distasteful comments. It is insufficient for the BBC to merely state that he is a controversial character. There is a big difference between being controversial and offensive, racist and hurtful.",
