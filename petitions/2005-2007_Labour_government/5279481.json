            "background": "Birmingham City Council have put forward proposals for the introduction of parking permits on all roads in the Jewellery Quarter in Birmingham.   The Jewellery Quarter is an historic area of the city and is well-known throughout the UK for it's fine jewellery.   \n\nThe cost of \u00a3400 per permit per year is wholly unreasonable for on-street parking for workers, businesses and those who live in the area.\n\nFurthermore, the purchase of a parking permit, to be bought in advance will  not even guarantee or reserve the holder, a parking space.\n\nThis action will drive many businesses to the wall and is unjustified, unreasonable and in most case, unaffordable to those people who have no choice but to use their cars.\n\nWe request the Prime Minister asks Birmingham City Council to review it's proposals.",
