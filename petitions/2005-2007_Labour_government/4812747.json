The present practise is to exlude them, yet we allow foreigners and those who have not contributed to the system FREE treatment.  Recent Tonight with Trevor MacDonald programmes have highlighted concerns by ex-pats who have paid all their lives and now find themselves having to sell their homes to fund treatment back in the UK.  Their money is funding foreigners and those who have never contributed at all.",
