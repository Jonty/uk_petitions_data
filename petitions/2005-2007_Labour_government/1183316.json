            "background": "For a family of 4 like us, two adults a 2 year old and a five year old you have just increased our holiday by \u00a380. Whilst the airlines will probably soften the blow with fare adjustments etc, to retrospectively apply this tax increase to flights already booked is a disgrace. We like many others book 11 months in advance to try and secure the date we require for work/ school holidays; to apply this to fares we have already paid for, contracted for and accepted is diabolical, underhand and disgraceful.\nWhat choice do we have?  Not take our holidays? Ask the airlines for a refund?  No, neither of these. We have to pay this and I really and truly hope this means the downfall of you, your tax hikes and the way you have taken every hard penny I earn and waste it.\nIf you want to tackle the environment, save the money elsewhere, like on Iraq, or your own flights and expenses, or go to the airlines.  Do not come after us passengers. You tell me another way we get to Orlando please Mr Blair?",
