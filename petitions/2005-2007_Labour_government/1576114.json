            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "When the smoking ban comes into force in July 2007, the House of Commons will not be legally obliged to comply with its own legislation and prohibit smoking in all parts of the building because of its official status as a royal palace, even though it has not been used as a royal palace for nearly 200 years and even though royal palaces do normally comply with legislation. Although smoking is banned in Westminster cafeterias, it is allowed in some rooms - including a 'smoking room' - which means that House of COmmons staff are still exposed to the harmful effects of passive smoking.\nSurely, the House of Commons should be the first, not the last, to put a total ban into force in all parts of the building - Otherwise, why are not public houses allowed areas/rooms cordoned off for those wishing to smoke - the simple answer is that it presents a serious health issue!",
