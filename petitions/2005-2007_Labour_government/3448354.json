            "background": "In 2008, the total switchover to digital television is due to begin, and it is scheduled to end in 2012. This could pose a big problem to many UK citizens, as they may not have managed to, or not been able to afford to obtain a digital TV, or the switchover could be delayed.\n\nThis would mean that some people would be partly cut off from the world, and many people would miss the heavily anticipated 2012 London Olympics. This would detract from English culture, and mean that many people would be unhappy.\n\nI propose that the beginning of the digital switchover is moved until 2013, when more people will have had the chance to purchase appropriate equipment, and the Olympics will be over.",
