            "background": "At Puffin crossings, the Green/Red signal to pedestrians is displayed only on the post at the right-hand side of the crossing, not on the opposite side of the road where pedestrians have been accustomed to look for it.  This causes considerable confusion, especially to elderly pedestrians. The official reason for this layout is that it encourages pedestrians to look in the direction from which the traffic is coming, but in fact the signal is often invisible because other pedestrians waiting to cross obstruct one's view of the signal.  These crossings are dangerous and should be withdrawn as soon as possible.",
