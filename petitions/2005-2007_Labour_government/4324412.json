            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Robert Mugabe has clearly shown himself to be murderous tyrant who has turned what was one of the richest and most prosperous countries in Africa (Rhodesia) into what is now one of the poorest and most oppressive. Over the past 26 years Zimbabwe has witnessed the genocide of the Matabeles, the systematic starvation of opposition-supporters, state-sponsored attacks of brutal violence on farms and widespread and significant political intimidation and violence against detractors. Mugabe's forced land seizures have plunged a country that formerly exported food into poverty and starvation. Unemployment is now at 80% and inflation 1730% pa. He is a former terrorist who had no qualms about murdering civilians in order to further himself and his politics in the Bush War. Now he is the ruler to what is effectively a totalitarian one-party state, delivering poverty, misery and starvation to his countrymen. The recent brutality against the Leader of the Opposition at the hands of the State's police should leave no doubt as to whether Mugabe is 'Most Honourable' or not. We urge the prime minister to see that Mugabe is stripped of this utterly ill-deserved honour forthwith.",
