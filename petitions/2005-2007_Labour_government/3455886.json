Please sign this petition if you like I am not forcing anybody to do it but it would make my family so happy and we could start a new life away from violence and racism.\nPeople just do not realise how much parents do for us we always as teenagers love to blame them for things that we do wrong. They have cared for us from the day we came to this world and always will love us aslong as they are alive. REMEMBER THERE IS NEVER A BAD PARENT ONLY A BAD CHILD",
