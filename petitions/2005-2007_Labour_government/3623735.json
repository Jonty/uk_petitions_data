            "background": "Prosecutions for excess speed aalone are alienating motorists from the government. Motorways are designed for high speeds, to standards that predate the 70mph limit.\nCompliance with 70, 60, 50, 40, 30 & 20 mph limits increases congestion, pollution, frustration and ill-mannered driving. \nVictim-less crimes of simply exceeding speed limits should not be prosecuted.\nProsecutions must consider the vehicle\u2019s capability, condition and age, driver competence.\nResidential areas to have advisory 20 & 30 mph limits.\nMinor roads to have advisory 40 & 50 mph limits.\nDual carriageways to have advisory 70mph limits. \nMotorways to have advisory 100 mph limits. \nPenalties for speed contributing to an accident or injury should relate to the type of road and the accident conditions.\nSkilled, responsible drivers in high speed vehicles should not be prosecuted for speed alone.\nAny driver whose speed results in injury, death, damage or loss should expect severe sentencing, loss of license, and the need to retake a driving test.",
