And why is the political and social fabric of the nation in such disarray? And why are our institutions so crippled by anachronism? And why are we still sending young boys to war? Oh would that they cared for the generations of the future so passionately as they care about the state of their front lawns!\n\nGrey vote? Blue rinse vote more like it! Let's do ourselves a favour by taking them out of the political process altogether. Then that'll leave them more time to concentrate on the Bingo.",
