For example, to help reduce congestion on our roads, we could offer a reduced rate road tax which would only allow the vehicle to be used at quieter times, (ie through the night.) If we could encourage freight to move during the night, then the roads would benefit during the busy daytimes.\nIn the same way, if freight were moved by rail or even canals, then there should be a tax benefit.\nIn short, reward instead of punsment.",
