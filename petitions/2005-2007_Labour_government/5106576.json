            "background": "im am concerned about the number of recruitment agencies that are springing up all over the country i currently live in hull to which their is over 100 such agencies to a population of 300.000 people,i imagine the rest of the uk has the same problem, after having worked for some of the recruitment agencies myself and having alot of problems, as i discovered i wasnt the only one i began researching the facts of these agencies to discover alot of them breaching the 13 week probation period incorrect wages on a regular basis advertising for workers for work that doesnt exist`as well as not refunding bank charges incurred by employees  Also workers who have used their own assets to pay for skills such as cscs cards or certain licences only to be paid the national minimum wage for these skills also i have been notified about agencies deducting money from employees wages for providing p.p.e which is necessary in certain types of work and should be provided by the recruitment agencies free of charge if required the government needs to force these recruitment agencies into a national government accreditation scheme with tighter restrictions for agencies not signed up",
