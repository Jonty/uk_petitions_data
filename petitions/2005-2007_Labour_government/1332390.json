        "background": "I feel that the government should raise for debate a new act allowing future votes at all levels and in all constituencies and wards to have an additional option - RON.  The purpose of this is for voters to indicate they do not wish to vote in any of the candidates, regardless of which party they are.  Should RON win, a byelection is automatically declared and the election campaign process restarts.  This should be repeated until there is a clear winner.",
