            "background": "Currently there is a problem with the amount of the annual budget given to schools as many departments receive much more than others. Certain subjects are reliant on out of date books and equipment whilst others have enough money to spend on unnecessary luxuries. \n\nTake for example Tanbridge House School in Horsham, now a 'specialist' school in Maths and IT. Previously its strength was Music but now the music department rely on broken keyboards, outdated computer systems and broken practice rooms and desks to teach their students. In cases like this the departments receive little or no budget at all and the education of our children is being comprimised for the sake of strengthening subjects that look good on league tables. The government should ensure that our children receive a well-rounded and beneficial education by stopping some subjects like Maths and IT are not made favourites over others.",
