            "background": "There is a misconception that High Functioning Autism means mild or less needing of services and special education.  I would ask the government, as a mother of two such boys and the secretary of an autism support group, to consider the population of children and young adults who are high functioning autists.  In our experience they recieve no services what so ever, and school is a scary, sad place for them.  We need schools that are Autism specific. The most recent studies show that it affects 1 in every 86 children.  That is a huge population of children who are being ignored and going through hell daily as they are expected to fit into a neurotypical/mainstream world but are not taught the skills with which to do this. There are no winners in the system  of inclusion, especially for the autisic child.  We need state schools that are Autisim Specific.",
