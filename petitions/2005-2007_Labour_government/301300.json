            "background": "The idea of raising the driving age is to cut the amount of road deaths caused by teenage drivers Correct?\n\nRaising the driving age will not help in fact it could make the situation 10 times worse as young teens who are waiting to be able to drive at 17 will simply be annoyed and angry that they will have to wait another one to four years. I think that it will increase the amount of unlicenced drivers and uninsured drivers on the roads therefore causing more deaths and accidents.\n\n Simply because it has always been at age 17 you can start to drive and people look forward to it.\n\nPeople who do drive unlicenced and uninsured do it simply to break the law. So why increase the age when it is going to cause more trouble and people will more than ever i beleive break the law and drive wether they are allowed or not.\n\n All that needs to be done is to bring in tougher laws",
