            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The construction of new cars, laden with safety systems, emission control systems and silicon components consumes huge amounts of raw materials and energy and, as in all heavy industry, is heavily polluting to the environment.\n\nInstead of taxing vehicles for using the roads, which forces people to use inadequate public transport or simply continue using their cars anyway, I propose that all new cars should be heavily taxed in a similar fashion to the automotive industry in Japan.\n\nThis would encourage people to maintain current vehicles, buy used cars, discourage them from spuriously purchasing new ones and drastically lower the carbon emissions from the automotive manufacturing industry in a manner that would make a significant difference.\n\nIf the large amounts of tax from this scheme were then implemented into public transport, people would also be encouraged to use it.",
