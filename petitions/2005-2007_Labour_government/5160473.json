            "background": "Top-tier COMAH sites are premises that store large quantities of dangerous materials; materials which have the potential to cause significant harm to people or the environment (such as large volumes of explosive, flammable or toxic chemicals).\n\nIt is currently illegal for civilian personnel to apprehend any person caught trespassing on such premises, unless they witness said person interacting with equipment on the site. The potential is that an individual entering such an establishment with the intention of sabotage or terrorism (causing an explosion in an oil storage facility, for example) cannot be touched unless such an act is witnessed.\n\nMaking such trespass a criminal offence and giving civilian security \nforces the ability to use reasonable force in apprehending and detaining those trespassing on top-tier \nCOMAH sites would act as a deterrent and provide the legal ability for security personnel to prevent potential acts of industrial sabotage or terrorism.",
