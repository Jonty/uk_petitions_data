        "background": "Too many people claiming Child Tax Credits are being told they have been overpaid and subsequently are asked to pay back the overpaid money, often thousands of pounds, in relatively short spaces of time. Even when all of the requested information is given when requested, the claimants are being overpaid. This is extremely unfair, as if people had the money to pay back these 'over-payments', they wouldn't be claiming Child Tax Credits.",
