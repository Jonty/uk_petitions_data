            "background": "I would like to ask for everyone to sign this petition asking for all those persons  that abuse the 999 Ambulance service to be charged..\n\nWhen a patient is conveyed to hospital by ambulance a patient report form is completed, all it needs is for the ambulance crew to tick a box on the form  indicating that they felt it inappropriate and for the doctor at the recieving unit to countersign the form to that effect. and then charge them. Im not talking about charging genuine emergencies, I am talking about those who phone because they have a paper cut,  week old toothache, recreational drug overdose etc... this way more ambulance's may actually be available for the genuine cases",
