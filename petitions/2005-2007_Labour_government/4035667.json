This is a hugely important issue that must not be sidelined by such blatant and clumsy attempts at consorship). Some proposals are obviously humourous in nature and should be rejected; however, legitimate petitions should be allowed, whether or not the subject has already been broached. Please note: this online petition scheme is in its infancy, and a greater degree of latitude should be allowed until the UK population becomes aware of its existence.",
