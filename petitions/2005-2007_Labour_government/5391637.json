        "background": "At the moment Revenue & Customs are applying penalties for various reasons on a monthly basis without issuing any notification that they are doing so. This is not necessarily for any tax oustanding, it is normally for information not being provided on time.\nFor example, it would be possible to incure 11 months penalties for not providing a yearly return before you were notified that you had not provided a return. \nThis can only be seen as an attempt by  Revenue & Customs to maximise any penalties for what may be a simple adimistrative error.\nIt cannot be just that a Government Department is seen to create a penalty which it arbitralily applies, which accrues monthly without any notification or reminders. \nSurely these penalties, which might run to many thousands of Pounds, must have at least one reminder issued by the Reveunue after the first months charges have been applied. How else can anyone attempt to correct the situation, which may have been caused by lost post either before it reached the Revenue or within the Revenue's internal post.",
