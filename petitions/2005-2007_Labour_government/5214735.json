Not only do many people find it dated, it also looks as though it was designed and made by a young child.\n\nOn several forums and discussion groups, the logo has been mocked, since it looks as though it is made of two people who are performing a \"sexual act\". Not exactly a good image to portray of London and the rest of the United Kingdom!",
