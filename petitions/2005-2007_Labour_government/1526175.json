Why cant we the public put a small scale turbine in our garden to produce some of our electricity to try and cut carbons without having to wait 8 weeks and \u00a3130, then for someone to say yes or no to a small turbine in your own garden, cant they see we are trying to save the planet. Please sign the petition to make a difference.\n\nRyan Raymond",
