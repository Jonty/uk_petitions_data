            "background": "Currently the services of independent childcare providers are exempt from VAT, which means they cannot register for VAT. If the services were zero rated, then providers could register for VAT and be repaid the VAT on their purchases. This would put more money into day care centres, nurseries and the like for investment in educational equipment, toys, staff training etc to the benefit of the children.",
