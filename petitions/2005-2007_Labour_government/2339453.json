            "background": "When a car owner pays his road tax, he is supplied with a swipe card that would enable the driver to purchase petrol/decal at a very low cost, much lower than they are paying at the moment (this would make the scheme more palatable to the public) once their ration of petrol has been used they will have to pay a very high rate for any fuel that they purchase.\nThis will encourage drivers to think about whether a journey in the car is necessary,  Most important it would encourage people to use public transport. Which will have to be looked at to ensure that the best possible service is given.\nDrivers would have the freedom to decide when they use their swipe card. They may decide to save some of their petrol ration for special occasions.\nExtra arrangements can be made for companies, reps, GP's and so on, so that they are able to go about their work without any extra cost.",
