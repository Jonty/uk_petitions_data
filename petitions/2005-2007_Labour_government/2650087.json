            "background": "15 thousand pound in debt after 3 years.\nThe Government need to have a re think. The Ministers that agreed to University fees came through the Uni system with out having to pay a penny. Support our home grown Citizens. The ones that have received their education in the UK. Our Sons & Daugthers are the future. Lets start to think about the future now and give them chance. Government support is the way forward. All social backgrounds and ethnic creads will all have the same opportunity to receive further education without future debt. This effects you Blairites too. If our kids gain a better education, the good old bank of Mum & Dad may be able to put a bit more toward their old age pensions as the futures not looking to bright in this area at the moment. Give our kids all the support they need. Sign this petition and let this Government know your true feelings. It could effect us and our off spring for years to come!!",
