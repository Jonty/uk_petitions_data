            "background": "Anyone earning less than this amount should not be paying income tax. Taxing those on such low incomes can make it hardly worth their while working at all, especially if they have to pay travel and other costs. This change should be at least partly paid for by abolishing the complex and inefficient tax credits system. This just recycles peoples own money back to them, less the administrative costs, and would be unnecessary if those on low incomes were not taxed in the first place.",
