            "background": "In canada the legal age is 14, and I never hear about 14 year olds getting pregnant as much in canada, another reason for doing this, is because 95% of the girls I know lose their Virginities when they are 13/14. I feel they do this because they are told \"you can't have sex before your 16\" so in away they are doing it just to say \"erm yes we can, we just proved it\"\n\nI do not see the point in having it at 16 years of age, if no one is going to obay it, OK you do get your odd people who do (like me) but realy, I feel it is one law that needs bringing down.",
