They forward me these fear based e-petitions, with their Daily Mail top-lines telling me that Tony Blair wants to put a tag on my children and turn my car into a hill, and that this is a basic breach of my human rights and must be quashed. But I don\u2019t care. \n\nNot a single one of these petitions (including this one) puts forward both sides of an argument or provides us with an opportunity to learn more about what we\u2019re putting our name to. Of course not all are bad and I\u2019m sure a great many have a very fair point to make, but the ones that seem to be doing the spam rounds are manipulative, populist, fear driven idiot lists that potentially serve to do more harm than good; assuming, that is, that anyone is actually listening to these things and that the whole thing isn\u2019t just a lovely, placatory bone to chew on.",
