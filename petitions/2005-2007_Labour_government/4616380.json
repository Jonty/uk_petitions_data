This has to stop. \n\nMany of times when we watch the news there is reporter informing the public on where our troops are, what they are doing and what they plan to do next. This is endangering the welfare of our military personel currently stationed in these warzones. \n\nThe public have a right to know what is going on, but when that information might endanger the lives of many there is no excuse to publish it. \n\nThere is every possibility that this information could fall into the wrong hands and take away any advantage our troops might have.",
