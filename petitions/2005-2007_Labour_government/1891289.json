            "background": "As the greatest bowler of his (or possibly any) generation, Shane Warne is the only one of the Wisden cricketers of the 20th century that does not have a knighthood. This situation has to be rectified, and what better time than now, as he retires from international cricket. A man who plays with a smile on his face, yet a determination to win that is unsurpassed. \nShane Warne revitalised the dying art of leg-spin, going on to smash record after record in a Test career that saw over 700 victims (96 in 2005 alone).\nEven as Poms, we have to admit cricket is poorer without him (although our Ashes chances have improved slightly).\nArise, Sir Shane Warne!",
