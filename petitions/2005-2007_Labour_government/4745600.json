Most of the population do not know the date of St Georges Day. Pubs and other businesses celebrate St Patricks Day with offers, flags etc. Yet St Georges Day, there is nothing. Anyone opposing this, should first think that St Patricks Day is celebrated in England so why not the day of our own Saint? Please restore some English pride into the country that is rarely named outside of sport, as England.",
