Not content with just the airfield site Northstowe could be built on most of Longstanton parish land and much of Oakington parish. After 4 years consultation a recent Interim Inspectors Report has thrown out the safeguards the parish councils and the District Councils have worked 4 years to obtain. Build Northstowe but please leave the parishes of Longstanton and Oakington with some parish land for themselves. In a democracy this is not too much to ask.",
