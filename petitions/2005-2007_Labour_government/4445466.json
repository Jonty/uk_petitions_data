        "background": "Northstowe is a proposed new town to be built on the site of former RAF Oakington. Not content with just the airfield site Northstowe could be built on most of Longstanton parish land and much of Oakington parish. After 4 years consultation a recent Interim Inspectors Report has thrown out the safeguards the parish councils and the District Councils have worked 4 years to obtain. Build Northstowe but please leave the parishes of Longstanton and Oakington with some parish land for themselves. In a democracy this is not too much to ask.",
