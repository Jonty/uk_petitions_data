            "background": "The economic benefits to the country are clear and over looked. Bus, train and tram companies look after themsleves and shareholders; as a private business should. There is no cost to a bus company if a bus is 40min late. There is a cost to the workers trying to get to work, their companies and the country as a whole as we loose GDP. Bus companies tend to make single or daily tickets far too expensive and so people buy a season/monthly/weekly ticket. Therefore, there really is no cost to a bus company if your 52 to the city centre does not run. \n\n'Give us our buses back' in Sheffield (and other movements up and down the country) are voicing the call for public transport to be in the hands of the public. Will the powers that be listen?",
