In combination with direction 38(1), ... provides that temporary signs can be used for up to 6 months for the purposes of conveying information about the availability of new routes or destinations, or (for up to 2 years) changes in route number\"\n\nMany red and white temporary signs, if not all of them, stay in place well beyond their period of usefulness and beyond that time are merely distracting roadside clutter.  Since they are not being removed voluntarily, someone must force the DfT to get rid of them after 6 months at most.",
