            "background": "\"Speed Kills\" is the mantra trotted out by 'experts' at every opportunity. This is a nonsense, akin to saying \"the ground kills\" because you die when hitting it after falling off a cliff. Inappropriate use of speed kills, and this is purely down to the appalling lack of driving/riding skills prevalent on Britains roads. We petition the Government to introduce a two stage test, whereby all car and m/cycle full license holders have 5 years to pass an an advanced driving test, from a set date (Jan 1st 2009?) or lose their license entitlement and have to start again. This would apply to new license holders also, 5 years from date of passing the test. Improved driving skills, road awareness, less death and injuries on the roads both to drivers and pedestrians, and less need for technological money-spinners such as speed cameras and limiters. Win-win.",
