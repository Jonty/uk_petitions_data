Therefore I would like to consider that on any first recorded offence you should receive a warning, second offence \u00a3100 fine and third offence \u00a3100 fine plus three points. It is a fairer way as most people like my self do make the odd error, due to personal and work stress and family problems.  I am a very conscientious driver and feel that because of one error due to family concerns it has turning me into a criminal.",
