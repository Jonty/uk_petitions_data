            "background": "There is a shortage of candidates of sufficient quality coming forward to stand for Councils at a higher level than town/parish.  This is particularly marked among women and younger people.  It needs radical measures to introduce new blood.  It is important to keep the current system where electors vote directly for a candidate, so choosing between groups selected on a quota by proportional representation will not do.    The chance of paying zero Council Tax will attract serious candidates.",
