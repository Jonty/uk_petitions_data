            "background": "The culture of targets in education has not brought real improvement. Instead, it has resulted in a narrowing of educational horizons as schools increasingly 'teach to the test' to ensure a high position in the education league tables. This system is also suceptible to dishonest practices, with schools trying to remove students who will not help them achieve a good position. It leads better-off parents to exploit the system by moving into the catchments of 'good' schools, thus driving up house prices, while doing nothing to improve standards for the most disadvantaged in society.",
