            "background": "As per the Stewart Report it was suggested that \"the widespread use of mobile phones by children for non-essential calls should be discouraged\"\n\n\"the Expert Group considers that children less than 16 years of age should be discouraged from using mobile phones.\n\nChildren are likely to be more vulnerable to any unrecognised health risks from mobile phone use than are adults. \nthe developing nervous system is likely to be more vulnerable than the mature nervous system to potentially hazardous agents. \nbecause of their smaller heads, thinner skulls and higher tissue conductivity, children may absorb more energy from a given phone than do adults. \nif there are detrimental health effects caused by mobile phone signals, those using phones for a longer period of their lives will tend to accumulate a greater risk. \nThe justification for suggesting persons aged less than 16 years is as follows:\n\ndevelopment of the head and nervous system is generally complete by age 16 years. For example, the density of synapses reaches adult level around puberty and skull thickness and brain size reach adult levels around ages 14 to 15.",
