            "background": "From the beginnning of May, British Telecom will charge an extra \u00a34.50 per quarter if payments are not made by direct debit. Virgin Media charge an extra \u00a35 per month, and soon, some mobile phone companies will start charging extra for those who do not pay by direct debit.\n\nIn Ireland, this is not legal and companies who tried to do so get heavily fined - why can it not be the same in the UK?\n\nAs long as payments are being made when bills are received, why should our payment method make a difference?\nThese charges are unreasonable , and the law says that penalty charges (which is what this is!) should be fair, and this is not currently the case for any of these companies.",
