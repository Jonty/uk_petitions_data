            "background": "Dear Prime Minister,\nPlease request the Government of Gibraltar to bring the twenty three year old liquidation of International Investments Ltd, to a conclusion. As you may already know the Government of Gibraltar granted a limited licence to this company in 1978 to trade as a bank. The Government of Gibraltar then allowed this comany to trade without Auditors or books of account until the bank collapsed owing creditors millions of pounds. Recently I requested my local MEP to write to the First Minister of Gibraltar requesting information about when the liquidation would be brought to a conclusion only to receive a reply stating that the company had no Assets and that no one there had any interest in the finalisation of the company's affairs.\nThe banking authorities in Gibraltar have also informed that the original banking licence which they granted to this company is no longer in their possession and cannot be traced.",
