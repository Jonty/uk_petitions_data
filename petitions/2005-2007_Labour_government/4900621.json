        "background": "In a society where our carbon footprint says more about the kind of person we are than the clothes we wear or the cars we drive, everyone needs to take responsibility about their personal carbon emissions.\n\nI consider that since it has been scientifically proven that more than 40% of your body heat escapes from your head that voluntarily bald people should be charged an individual tax because of their higher heat emissions, than people who have insulated their heads with hair.\n\nThe government is already planning on charging 4x4 drivers a higher road tax, so why should shaving your head be exempt, since they are also making a personal choice which results in higher emissions.\n\nPeople who lose their hair through natural circumstances would not incur such a charge; I propose only to charge people who choose to shave their heads.",
