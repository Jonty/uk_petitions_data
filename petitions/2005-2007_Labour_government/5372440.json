This is a novelty!\n\nThe 'Reformed' treaty (2007) maintains the essential principles of the putative constitutional treaty which was rejected by voters in France and the Netherlands. \n\nSince a British referendum on the  predecessor treaty was \"promised\" and the present document conserves that document's main content, its ratification should not proceed without that promise being fulfilled.",
