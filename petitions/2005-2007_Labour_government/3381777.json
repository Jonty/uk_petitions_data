            "background": "The use of cheap modern steel tublar post lamp posts is causing alarm as older style cast iron and wrought iron lamp posts are replaced for no other reason than standardisation. Here in Evesham all of our 1970's swan neck (and visually pleasing)GEC made posts have been replaced recently with a bog standard Phillips design seen all over the country. We would like to see vintage lamp posts reinstated and kept in working condition especially for residential areas.",
