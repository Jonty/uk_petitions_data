            "background": "All world leaders should work out their differences in a boxing ring. \nIts them who have the problem with other countries, not us the people, we just get dragged in and innocents get killed.\nBesides the world leaders arn't in the firing line anyways... they have bunkers and body guards to protect them! So who bares the brunt of a nuclear war? \nIf two leaders have a squabble then they should fight it out KNOCKOUT style, or in a cage. I would pay alot to see that. \nLast man/woman standing wins\nThat seems much fairer then sanctionos or war against, what is at the moment, ah yes terror. what a load of rubbish. i have more chance of killing myself than being killed by a so-called terrorist. \nOne mans terrorist is another mans freedom fighter.\nSign this patition and let the masses speak. \n\nthank you",
