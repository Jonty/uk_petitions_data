            "background": "The new logo for the 2012 Olympic Games is a total embarrassment to our country. It is confusing, unprofessional and unclear. It is almost unbelievable that such a logo should even make it past the initial design stages, as it looks like it was designed by a 6 year old. The logo should be clear, good looking and sophisticated. The new logo is none of those, and gives a very bad first impression of the games.",
