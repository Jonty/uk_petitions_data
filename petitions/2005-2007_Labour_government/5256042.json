            "background": "As it stands, people in Scotland and Wales, and from 2008 onwards Northern Ireleand, require a subscription to Sky Sports in order to watch their national football side play their home World Cup and European Championship qualifying matches. This is unacceptable - why should anyone have to pay in order to watch their national side live on TV?\n\nThe FA in England, quite rightly, award their contract to a 'free-to-air' broadcaster, but the SFA, FAW and IFA would appear not to have supporters' best interests at heart. Therefore they should be bound by law to award their live-game contract to a terrestrial broadcaster.",
