            "background": "Just like the schools inspectorate, OFSTED, I believe that there should be inspectors for nursing homes to check that they are being cared for properly, that the local doctor is attending call outs and to investigate allegations. The inspectors should have the power to place orders to care homes and doctors to revise their conduct or face closure, fines and job losses. The elderly are vulnerable just like children",
