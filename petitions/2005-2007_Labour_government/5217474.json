They then get shot because they are not only more likely to attack and wreak havoc in the hours of daylight, but are also less canny than their country brothers.\nWhy cause such unnecessary suffering to not only our livestock and pets, but also to the foxes themselves. Once contained these pests can be humanely destroyed.\nThis insane misguided practice has continued for too long now. Please help stop it.",
