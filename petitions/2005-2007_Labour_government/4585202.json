However, 10 emails to \"the team\" over three months have been ignored.  My votes on certain petitions have been removed.  My earlier rejected petitions - previously available to view - have been removed, along with one which I was querying with e-petitions as to why the web-site was blocking any signatures to it.  From the website: \"To ensure transparency, any petition that cannot be accepted will be listed, along with the reasons why. A list of rejected petitions is available on this website.\"\n\nThis is created on 12th April 2007 and at the time of \"going to press\" is entirely accurate. So, e-petitions, what's the story?  I am requesting action that you explain why you are removing valid petitions, and are so clearly NOT being transparent.",
