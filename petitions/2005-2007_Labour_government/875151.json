BOTH are to be disclosed. \n\nSome Ministers must travel extensively.  This is not disputed.  The issue is disclosure.  SEEING WHAT WE ARE DOING.\n\nThe 'private' component is that which is affected by lifestyle choices.  Minister\u2019s private lives are a private matter, but GHG pollution is a matter of public interest.  \n\nWe believe that PERSONAL CARBON DISCLOSURE will contribute to leadership on the most serious threat ever faced. \n\n\nNB Before signing petition be sure to know your OWN carbon cloud.",
