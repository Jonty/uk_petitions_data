            "background": "Applicants should be viewed on academic ability ALONE, without reference to background - in this way the university application procedure would be truly egalitarian, and the academic quality of Britain's higher education institutions would remain in tact.\n\nOnly students with the requisite academic ability should be offered places at universities - the government should tackle inequality in the education system NOT by concentrating as it does on universities and enforcing a policy which will lead to a dilution of standards, but rather by providing equal opportunities for learning in primary and secondary education. This way reference to one's background in the course of a university application would be unnecessary.",
