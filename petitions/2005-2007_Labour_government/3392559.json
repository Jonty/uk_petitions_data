This was entirely foreseeable for all who are taking part. It has failed to inspire any confidence whatsoever that this will lead to a fair selection process. It will ultimately lead to the careers of many doctors being damaged beyond repair, and the culmination of many years of hard work going to waste - not to mention the money used to train them.",
