            "action": "go to the United Nations Organisation, to apologise for breaking away from the debate about peaceful ways to confront Saddam Hussein, and to ask the UN to work out a way forward for Iraq which Britain will honour. We look for Britain to play its full role within the UN, not withdrawing unilaterally from Iraq without the mandate of the UN.",

            "background": "Leaving the debate in the UN about Iraq was a mistake. The British givernment said, along with the American government, \u201cWe know best. We\u2019ll take it into our own hands.\u201d We need to apologise for that mistake and commit ourselves to working fully within the UN. A unilateral withdrawal from Iraq will again be Britain deciding what it thinks best without reference to other countries. Announcing a future withdrawal will endanger British troops still further, as opponents will see it as the beginning of a retreat and will become bolder in their attacks. The way forward is to admit that we do not know the way forward and to ask our fellow nations to work with us in discerning a way forward.\nThis approach is similar to that advocated in the USA by Rabbi Michael Lerner, Revd Tony Campolo and the Network of Spiritual Progressives, including Jews, Christians, Moslems, Buddhists, Hindus and others.",
