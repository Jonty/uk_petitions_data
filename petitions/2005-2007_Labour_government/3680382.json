            "background": "Too much money is being spent on sport in schools and communities. We are not denying that regular excersize and a good health is important, but we feel that ridiculous amounts of money are being spent in schools, while other more important subjects are suffering. With the news that we are going to have to deal with a shortage of scientists, some of this money should be spent here, and also in English and Maths. The funding should also be spread to absurdly underfunded (so much so that some schools cannot even offer them) departments such as the arts.\nWe need to think of our future; what would be better; a country of sportspeople, or a country of doctors, scientists and other occupations we really need.",
