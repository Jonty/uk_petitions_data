            "background": "I read in my paper that Gordon Brown is to lobby for the U.K. to hold the World Cup in 2018 and I am very opposed to this.  How much would such a bid cost; and if it was successful how much would it cost to implement it?  One only has to look at the Olympic bid to see the likely answer.  If we can't afford NECESSARY expenditure, on issues such as life-saving drugs, how can we justify spending such vast sums on sports events which may be spectacular but only last a few weeks?  How can we value sport above life?",
