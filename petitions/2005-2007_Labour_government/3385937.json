        "background": "The creation of a Bank Holiday for the UK at the end of `British Summertime` would balance out the working year and improve family life. \nThe Republic of Ireland enjoys an `October Holiday` break to recharge and plan for the winter months ahead.\nOur present system in the UK leaves a four month gap between the August Bank Holiday and the traditional Christmas break. In my opinion this is too long, and this extended working period is detrimental to everybody in the UK.",
