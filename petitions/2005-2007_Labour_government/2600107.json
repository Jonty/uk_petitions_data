The emerging problem however is that in the majority of towns and cities across the country the degradation of the mature street tree stock is gathering pace with councils hampered by the lack of appropriate funding for any substantial replanting, the continuing rise of the \u2018car culture\u2019 and the accompanying car-focussed highway engineering, together with the spectre of the \u2018compensation culture\u2019.\n\nIt is imperative therefore that we need to manage their decline and re-plant as our legacy to future generations. Car-dominated streets and barren characterless \u2018estates\u2019 should not be part of a sustainable community but beautiful, life enhancing streetscapes, which provide so many benefits, are.",
