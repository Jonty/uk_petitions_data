        "background": "I greatly admire the work of the Fairtrade foundation, however the purchase of it's products is made only by those compassionate enough to pay the higher prices. How can it be acceptable that Asda sell a jar of coffee for 30p? If we are serious about tackling global poverty we need to tame the big supermarkets as well as companies like Nestl\u00e9 and Del-Monte to ensure that our enjoyment of certain products does not hold back the prosperity of Africa and South America.",
