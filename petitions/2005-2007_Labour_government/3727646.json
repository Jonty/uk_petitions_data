How can it be acceptable that Asda sell a jar of coffee for 30p? If we are serious about tackling global poverty we need to tame the big supermarkets as well as companies like Nestl\u00e9 and Del-Monte to ensure that our enjoyment of certain products does not hold back the prosperity of Africa and South America.",
