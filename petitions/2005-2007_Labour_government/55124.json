        "background": "In some jurisdiction there is a legal requirement to secure the systems that provide cash point facilities using encryption.\n\nIf this were the case in the UK, the general public would feel much safer using cash points and PIN terminals when paying for goods and services and would not need to cover their hands when typing in their PIN numbers.\n\nIt is likely that such a measure would lead to a drop in debit and credit card fraud.",
