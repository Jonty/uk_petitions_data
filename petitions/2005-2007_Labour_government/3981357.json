The following is an example of what I pay for my road tax\n\n1 full year: \u00a3110.00 in total\n\n6 months road tax \u00a360.50\n\nThe problem is at present if you purchase two 6 months road tax you pay a total of \u00a3121.00\nWhich means the DVLA make an extra \u00a311.00 and this should not be allowed?\n\nSo please sign the petition as the extra \u00a311.00 is unfair",
