The licence should be at a reasonable fee, but should be dependent upon the applicant having Pet Insurance (to include public liabiltiy), all inoculations and microchipping. The vet would sign the application each year to verify this. All dogs to be neutered by 1st birthday unless for breeding. A breeders licence should be issued at a greater cost and with more checks. New offences should be introduced for non compliance. Dog handling courses should be required for owners who have never kept dogs before.",
