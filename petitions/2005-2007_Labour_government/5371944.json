        "background": "Our local holiday club (child care for during school holidays) is going to have to close the special needs section in 2008 unless it can find alternative funding and the 11+ section relies on charity even though the charges parents have to pay are very high. Parents of special needs children rely on access to such holiday care even if they are not working. It can be impossible to do every day things like shopping and housework with the children at home.",
