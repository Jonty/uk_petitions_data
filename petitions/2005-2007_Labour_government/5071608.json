        "background": "I am one of thousands of people affected by a points failure today outside Stevenage. Similar events occur every day up and down the country. Days of our lives are wasted in this manner every year. The solution is to return the rail infrastructure to private hands. Then sufficient investment can be raised to improve and maintain the network to a high standard. National Rail, like all nationalised industries from British Leyland to the entire USSR, cannot provide a good service, because it is not run by businessmen for a profit. It is run by politicians and they have no competition that would force them from the market, and no source of new funds apart from forcibily extracted taxation. In addition all regulation must be removed. Otherwise the politicians are simply in charge by another means, and worse, they avoid taking the blame when things go wrong. Neither politicians nor the will of the people they claim to represent are sufficient means to create a successful business. It is time this country recognised that fact, and celebrated capitalists rather than rob, shackle and disparage them.",
