            "background": "Tony Blair has expressed a desire to impose further regulations on newspapers and other media because he feels they are harmful to politians.  This basically means he wants to further reduce the right of anyone to criticise the government.  Newspapers and other media (blogs, forums, online news sites) should be entitled to present both fact and opinion (there are already libel laws to cover the printing of lies).  Any stricter regulations would be a further reduction in the freedom of ordinary people.",
