They can't keep their customers, nor win new ones. Their competitors can undercut RMs' prices because they can charge what they want while RM must charge what the regulator tells them to.\nMr Blair, we are asking you, both as PM and as the senior shareholder, to release RM from the restrictive working practises being forced upon it, so that they can fight on a level playing field with their competitors. \nWithout your assistance, we can see this great British establishment being run into the ground and sold off for scrap.\nPlease help the loyal, hard working Postmen and Women of RM keep their jobs and futures safe.\nSigned,\nThe concerned members of postmanchat.com, customers and employees of Royal Mail.",
