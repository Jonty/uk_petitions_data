Health, education, crime, international relations, immigration, defence, transportation, agriculture, are in complete disarray. Freedom and liberty have been removed and despite the biggest tax burden in Europe we are not getting value for money and the services we expect. We the people signed below, citizens of the United Kingdom, have NO confidence in the leadership and government of this country and we wish to be given the opportunity to vote on our future at the earliest date in 2007.",
