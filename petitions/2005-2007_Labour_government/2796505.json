I have noticed in Staffordshire especially that these mobile speed camera vans are setting up on roads that already have a HUGE number of fixed speed cameras, the A34 from stafford to Newcastle Under Lyme for instance. This surley goes against any reason for the fixed speed cameras to be there. After passing 3 fixed cameras and approaching a fourth, why is there a Mobile speed camera van?",
