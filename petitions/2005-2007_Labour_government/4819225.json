Alcohol use makes this need more important.\n\nFortunately, water in this country is both cheap and easily accessible. As a nation we take pride in our good levels of health and well being.\n\nI therefore firmly believe that the requirement for the provision of water should be a compulsory condition in order that an establishment obtains a license to supply alcohol.",
