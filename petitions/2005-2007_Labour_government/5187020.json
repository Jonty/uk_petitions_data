Please review why natives of this country should suffer curtailment of their freedom in the name of politically correct immigration policies.  We dont need ID cards, we need sensible border controls. Stop the sale of citizenship through arranged marriages, deport alien terrorists.  Why protect the human rights of those who plan to kill our servicemen abroad??",
