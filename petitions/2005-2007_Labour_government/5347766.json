            "background": "The Chinese government are planning for the 2008 Olympic Games. As is tradition for the games, the torch that will ignite the flame at the site of the games will be carried from Athens. The Chinese government intend on taking the torch on its way to Beijing via what is commonly know as Everest Base Camp. This camp is at 5200 metres. To enable the torch to get to base camp a road is proposed to be built. This is an area that so many mountaineers dream of being able to climb, not drive. To attempt, let alone summit Mount Everest is obviously, and rightly so, an achievement. There is a right place and a wrong place for roads.",
