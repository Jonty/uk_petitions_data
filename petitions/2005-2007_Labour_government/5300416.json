            "background": "This petition is about the freedom to choose and nothing more.All smokers know that they are not doing themselves any good by smoking and i'm sure the last thing they wish to do is harm others willingly,however-if 80% percent of people in a building are smoking then can you class it as being unsociable?\nThis ban is being introduced in the summer so as to minimise the initial effect-all i ask is for somewhere warm and friendly that me and the rest of the millions of taxpaying smokers can go and enjoy themselves.Allow designated smoking pubs and clubs and dry,warm areas to be created external to the workplace if desired.Its all about using common sense and having a choice-which seems to be dissappearing these days.",
