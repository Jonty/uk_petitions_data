            "background": "The Inheritance Tax threshold has not kept pace with house prices over the past decades.  As a result, the numbers liable have soared to more than 35,000 or 6 per cent of estates.  Inheritance Tax was only intended to hit the wealthy, defined as the top 1 per cent of taxpayers.  The threshold should be increased to \u00a32 million to take the burden off ordinary people.  The tax should, however, be retained and not abolished altogether.  The cost of increasing the threshold to \u00a32 million would be about \u00a32.5 billion in 2007-08 and is fully affordable.",
