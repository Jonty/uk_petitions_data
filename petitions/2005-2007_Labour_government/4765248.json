To trail in 5th from a field of 7 is simply unacceptable and I call upon the Prime Minister to examine why a 13/8 favourite can run so poorly. The jockey and trainer will no doubt collude to form some excuse about the going, the pace, or even the horse just not being right, but this has cost me a significant financial investment from which my business empire may well not recover.",
