            "background": "Fully understanding that in the past there has been scandalous discrimination in many public sectors. The current policy of setting targets for racial and gender representation is inherently flawed and unfair.\n\nAs was discovered recently in the Gloucestershire Police, these relatively short-term targets put pressure on organisations to adopt racist and sexist recruitment campaigns in order to fulfil said quotas.\n \nI believe this, by discriminating against majority groups, is creating prejudice where there was none before, undermining confidence in the fairness of the system and potentially endangering public interests by not recruiting the best people for the job.\n\nI respectfully ask that this policy ends, and longer-term, fair policies are introduced.",
