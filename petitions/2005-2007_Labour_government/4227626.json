            "background": "As it stands, on the throw of a dart to a calendar, Tony Blair will be leaving his office and Gordon Brown is almost a dead cert to succeed him. We feel that his position should not not dictate his power, and that we should have a say into whether he is suitable to lead our country through the forthcoming years. If he has no opposition from his own party we believe an untimely general election is necessary to allow the voice of the people to be heard. Democracy is all about choice and this choice is being refused us by use of this back door into power.",
