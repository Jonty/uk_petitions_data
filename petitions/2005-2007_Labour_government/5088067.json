            "background": "How many times have \"we the people\" got to say this to government.\n\nWe want inefficiencies removed from the public sector.\n\nWe do not want the standard response to a request to reduce taxation to continue to be the \"bogey man\" of increased taxes elsewhere to scare us into submission.\n\nEfficiencies in the state would slow down the rate at which taxes may rise - indeed it may cap them for many years.\n\nFor example, I do not personally need, or want, to pay a civil servant to means test my income and to decide that I need a tax credit.\n\nWhat I need is no means testing and lower taxes - so that there will be no need to pay someone out of my taxes to review my income and to decide I may get a few pennies back from the tax I already pay.\n\nIf I were able to have a significantly lower tax rate I would have more for myself than the tax credit permits.\n\nAs an example any shortfall from scrapping inheritance tax should mean an introduction of efficiency into the state rather than an automatic tax rise elsewhere.\n\nSo can we have a little less of the \"bogey man\" of increased taxes elsewhere and some businesslike approaches to the management of the state sector.",
