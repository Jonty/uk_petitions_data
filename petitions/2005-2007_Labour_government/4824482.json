            "background": "Make the transition of welfare benefits immediate/\nas fast as possible to stop the fear of non-working people that they may lose their homes and be left on the streets and poverty stricken if they attempt to work and the job doesn't work out, leaving them without benefits sometimes for months and at risk of all they fear, and unwilling to attempt further work. speed up and gaurantee that social security will now allow people to be without benefits at any time - \nthis is a major flaw in society being overlooked and preventing people from even attempting to find work and keeping them dependent on benefits, people need security and encouragement, not fear of starvation and homelessness as is now the case in this country.",
