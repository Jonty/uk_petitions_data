            "background": "Every day we hear of the need to use public transport. unfortunatly a few years ago a new law came into effect stating that buses/coaches which are legally entitled to travel at 70mph on motorways should be banned from the outside lane. Now journey times are slower as coaches have to follow lorries travelling at 55mph in the middle lane. we should be helping public transport not slowing it down",
