            "background": "Men's Lifestyle Magazines regularly display covers showing naked and half naked girls, have article of sexual nature, explict pictuire and yet are not classed as pornography. This means it is infinitely easier for children to see or even obtain explict material. This is morally wrong and is hurting our children. Supermarkets like my local Tesco sell men's lifestyle magazines right across from the toys and video games aisle, meaning many young children will certainly see these images. These magazines need to be reclassed as Porn and at least doule wrapped for the sake of our children.",
