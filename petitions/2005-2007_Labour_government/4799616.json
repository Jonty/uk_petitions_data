            "background": "Road conditions, vehicle capabilities and legislation change continuously, but drivers currently don't have to demonstrate continued competence. This will have to change. A suggested duration for a license would be about 10 years, as an implementation detail. Existing drivers should be retested in a rolling programme according to the length of time since they passed a test, but the regulation on retesting banned drivers should come into effect as soon as possible. The details of phasing-in retesting will require some demographic analysis by civil servents to plan training and testing resources. The expectation is that some present license holders will not apply for retest and will thus lose their licenses, but the magnitude of this effect is hard to assess. If a driver voluntarily retests (e.g., the IAM advanced test), then this could \"reset their clock\" during phase-in.",
