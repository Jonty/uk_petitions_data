            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The public sector is by nature a not for profit organization and when outsourcing parts of its activity it should do so using other not for profit organizations. \n\nMany public facilities and services are now outsourced to companies whose core interest and expertise is profit \u2013 not provision of public services.\n\nThe reason for involving the private sector in public provision is that the private sector is more dynamic and provides better expertise in the different fields of services.\n\nWith this proposal this character of the private sector would be enhanced as, free from the need to tighten up the belt to produce profits, the management of not for profit companies can work for better purposes than the interest of the shareholders and a market where management expertise and innovation in the fields of the services that are the subject of these contracts could finally emerge.",
