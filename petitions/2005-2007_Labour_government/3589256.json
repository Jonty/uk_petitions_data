            "background": "We in the UK believe that the price we will be paying for the PS3 is too high.\n\nThe Chinese are paying 3,780 Hong Kong dollars which is just \u00a3255.\n\nThe Japaneses are paying 59,980 yen which is \u00a3267.\n\nThe Americans are paying 599 USD which is \u00a3314.\n\nMost of Europe will be paying 599 Euro which is \u00a3403.\n\nIn the United Kingdom we will be paying \u00a3425\n\nIf this isn't bad enough, the European Playstation 3 is less functional than Playstation 3's sold elsewhere. PS3's from the rest of the world contain hardware for backwards compatability but to cut costs Sony has removed this from the European models in favour of a less functional software equivalent.\n\nWe are being ripped off and this isnt fair.",
