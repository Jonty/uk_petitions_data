            "background": "Shisha is an unhealthy alternative to smoking but has worse effects than normal ciggarettes.\n\nA hookah study which found that a session of hookah smoking which lasts about 45 minutes, delivers 36 times more tar, 15 times more carbon monoxide and 70% more nicotine than a single cigarette.  Also, even though smoking a hookah pipe is equivilant to smoking 9 cigarretes, it is not smoked regularly, therefore smoking a hookah twice a year may be like smoking 18 cigarettes a year.",
