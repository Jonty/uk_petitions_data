            "background": "There are six housing blocks on the Crouch Hall Estate, North London, and as part of the home improvement scheme, Islington council started to update the windows but only updated three blocks on the estate. Islington council now refuses to update the remaining three blocks until the year 2014-2015. This is unacceptable. The windows are in such a despicable state with half of them not closing properly. There is an immense amount of draft that fills the homes in the remaining blocks making it     extremely difficult to inhabit. This winter was especially difficult as it was very cold. Although the heating is on at all times, it does not appear to be the case as it is so cold in the house. All the heat escapes through the windows. This is not good for the environment and for conserving energy. These windows have to be updated before the next winter.",
