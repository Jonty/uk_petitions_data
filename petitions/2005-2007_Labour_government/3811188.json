            "background": "In my opinion, The Police Service funding is  too low, we need well policed communities and funding is desparately needed to aid the effective policing of our communities.\nThe Police Service is of course currently funded but more is needed.\n\nPlease ask a local officer how many police officers are serving your comunity as you speak. You may well be shocked! A massive area of a city can be policed by just 4 officers, 2 of which can often be probationers. This isn't enough when more than 2 incidents occur simultaneously, please please i urge you to look in to your police service and the number of officers serving at any one time.. we need more funding to increase officers across the community. Please sign my petition to help increase funding.",
