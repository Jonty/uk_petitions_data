        "background": "The Laws as stated last year do not go far enough in the interest of safety and the anti social behaviour problems in our communities. The best way forward is to ban the sales and use of fireworks by the General Public and Local Government should be encouraged to promote and organise displays at a nominal charge. This enables people to enjoy a good display of fireworks in these settings.\nThe law does not go far enough and a total ban on sales to the public would be best for everyone.\nIf the general public do not have a licence to use or store these explosive materials,then they should not be aloud to purchase them.",
