            "background": "Every day we read in the news of people who weren't helped to feed themselves while in care home - residential or nursing. Every day we hear of more inquests into unexplained deaths. Every day we hear of more elderly patients being abused by the very people we as tax payers are employing to care for them. \n\nIt has to STOP. The system is not working. People are being denied even their basic rights as human being let alone their dignity in their final years.\n\nThis petition calls for an urgent and public enquiry into the state of the system and the care, or lack of it, being provided for elderly. Please sign it - one day that old person will be you.",
