It needs to be modernized and directed to support the peoples of these Islands in a more focused way.\nThe fundamental problems start at grass roots where a member of a political party has either party interests or self interest as their main focus. The electorate is not considered unless the politician\u2019s seat is up for grabs. The recent news reports of a split Kingdom are a reflection of this. People do not feel supported by Westminster and as a result want freedom from it. It is time to have a parliament that is for the people, representative of the people and working for the people.",
