            "background": "The isle of wight is 5 miles from the prosperous south east of england yet has deprivation only equaled by parts of inner London. Building a bridge with possibly EU funds would bring the economic prosperity of south east england to this area of 135000 people. Enabling islanders to work on the mainland and earn a living wage whilst saving on the amount paid in benefits. Average earnings on the island are some 20 25% below nearby Portsmouth.\nThe natural harbours of the island would be more accessible and economically viable enabling the regeneration of all areas of the island benefiting all. The current arrangements of high cost ferries (for islanders) will not achieve this). The Isle of Wight ferries do not receive subsidies from government or EU and islanders pay the full cost of maintaining this link.",
