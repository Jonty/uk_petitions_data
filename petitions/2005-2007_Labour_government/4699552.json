        "action": "reconsider his remarks made in his interview with the FT and now widely reported in the media in respect of changes to the EU treaty.We, the undersigned, note with dismay the comments made by Prime Minister Blair regarding the ditching of the commitment to hold a referundum prior to the implimentation of any change to this country\u2019s relationship with the European Union. Notwithstanding Mr Blair\u2019s statement that a limited new treaty, focused on updating the EU\u2019s rules and institutions, did not require a referendum, we believe that such a treaty would fundementally affect this Counrty\u2019s relationship with the EU, and implimentation of such a treaty prior to any referendum of the proposed details would be a gross abuse of position and would renage on all previous commitments to such a referendum made by the Prime Minister and others to the people of this Country.",
