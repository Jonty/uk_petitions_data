Notwithstanding Mr Blair\u2019s statement that a limited new treaty, focused on updating the EU\u2019s rules and institutions, did not require a referendum, we believe that such a treaty would fundementally affect this Counrty\u2019s relationship with the EU, and implimentation of such a treaty prior to any referendum of the proposed details would be a gross abuse of position and would renage on all previous commitments to such a referendum made by the Prime Minister and others to the people of this Country.",
