        "background": "The petition is to encourage 'poured drinks'.\nWith Pub closures ocurring every week and the loss of these vital hubs of the community, and conversely increased trouble associated with youth and underage binge drinking fuelled by bottled Lagers, Cider and Alcopops this measure is aimed at tackling both.\nPublic houses serving alcohol in glasses provide a responsible atmosphere and control over excess.  By encouraging Public houses and the provision of traditional drinks over bottled lager and alcopops, local communities will be supported and held together, and anti-social drunken behaviour reduced.",
