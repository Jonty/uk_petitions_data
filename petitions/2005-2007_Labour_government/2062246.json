            "background": "Freedom of Speech is the foundation of any democracy; to be able to express one's point of view without fear of persecution.\n\nThere can be no justifcation in an open society for anybody to be discriminated against because of their view(s). This means that we should be free to challenge any accepted wisdom & all the moral imperatives of the day [political correctness], without the fear of finger pointing or demonisation at the hands of those who would disagree.\n\nAn arrogant government has eroded that fundamental right because they wish to impose their morality, adopting the role once played by the church & increasingly, just as dogmatic.\n\nNobody should fear to lose their job because they hold a particular view or speak a truth that doesn't conform, nor should anybody be sent to prison, simply for challenging an accepted wisdom.",
