        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Firstly, there are many competitions where callers need to know how many answers have been given, so that they can decide whether or not it is worthwhile to phone - (as he/she would see how unlikely it would be that he/she would win). Secondly, for competitions and shows requiring voting, it is in the public interest that we should be aware how much money is being generated for TV companies and telephone companies from these devices. By multiplying the call cost by the number of calls this wil be clear.",
