Britain's policy of allowing massive Jewish immigration into Palestine increased the proportion of Jews in Palestine from 8% of the population in 1917 to 30% in 1948. This was sufficient for them to seize 78% of Palestine by force and create the state of Israel. The war that this caused and the wars that followed have created almost 6 million Palestinian refugees, 4 million of whom live in refugee camps.  Approximately 3 million Palestinians live under Israeli occupation or siege in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza.",
