If this is neglected,  an endless series of irritating further contacts is to be expected.\n\nApproval to disseminate personal data should never depend on extreme vigilance, and the default position should be that you are deemed to have opted out of any further use of the information you have provided unless you positively opt in.  The government should legislate to make this the case, and make the current practice illegal.",
