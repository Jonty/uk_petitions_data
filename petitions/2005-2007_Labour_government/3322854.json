            "background": "If we are to fully intergrate with our European partners, I believe that we should remove as many differences between the UK and the rest of Europe. One of those differences, regarded by many as a joke, is the fact that we drive on the left, most of Europe drive on the right. In addition, with the ever increasing amount of road transport between the UK and Europe I believe that if we were to drive on the right side of the road it would reduce the amount of accidents and subsequent deaths that are caused every year by European trucks.",
