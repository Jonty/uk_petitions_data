            "background": "When criminals commit a lesser crime they should be seen to do community work such as clearing canals and manual labour instead of voluntary people doing it. In already overcrowded prisons people are getting silly cautions for serious offences and not serving their time for the crime they commit. There is no deterrent and that is why i feel people commit crimes knowing nothing or very little will happen to them. Out of work people know they do not have to pay fines so people should be made to work or have benefits stopped and then maybe if they work they will have money and will not commit crimes to get money.",
