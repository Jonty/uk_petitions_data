I suggest that the theory test is the first stage in learning to drive, and only when that is passed can the learner begin taking lessons in a car.  \n\nI also suggest that the test centres themselves issue the licenses immediately after the test is complete, so they can take the photo and check eyesight etc, which is currently self-assessed online!",
