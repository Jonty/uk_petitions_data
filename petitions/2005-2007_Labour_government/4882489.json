            "background": "With a population of 60,609,153 (est 2006), if everyone, including children, were to each pay \u00a31 (one pound) per calender month, we would raise over \u00a3720,000,000 per year for charity.\n\nA family of four (2 adults, 2 children) would pay \u00a34, unemployed, would have \u00a31 taken from their unemployment benefit, and so on.\n\nThe charity fund, could be centrally banked, and all charities apply for funding from this (as with the national lottery).  This could stop advertisements like \"please give \u00a33 a month\" and \"whole evening charity events - comic relief etc\".\n\nPeople could still donate more if they wish too (in charity shops etc), but it would stop begging advertisements and programming.",
