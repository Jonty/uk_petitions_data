        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The basic problem with the current prison system is that it is a University of crime with an easy social life. This needs changing to solitary confinement for all prisoners in our normal prisons with Open prisons being used for the rehabilitation process prior to rejoining society. Priveleges of books and radio should be earned by good behaviour and contact with family and friends should only be through glass screens. With prison being then true withdrawal from normal society life instead of a spell at \"Crime University\" sentences can be reduced, negating the need for further prison construction. Extra individual cell space will have to be constructed in the space taken up by the gyms, common rooms etc. It will be easy to curtail the circulation of drugs with this regime and the system will gain the support of the General Public as a true deterrent.",
