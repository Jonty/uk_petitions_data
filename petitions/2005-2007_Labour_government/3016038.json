            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Currently, the school year operates upon random term lengths up to 11 weeks long!  \n\nNationally implemented six school terms, of a maximum length of 6 / 7 weeks, offers a structured learning environment that would not tax children & teachers; yet maximises the learning environment: educational attainments would soar & sporting interests  enhanced.\n \nAll round all would benefit: Children with raised educational attainments + perceptively more time for sport and other interests; teachers & parents having structured term lengths plus, in addition to the summer break, having five 2 week vacation periods resulting in reduced holiday costs.\nIndustry would also benefit through the leisure side accommodating tourists over extended periods & commercially, a happier workforce.\n\nRespect for the current religious holidays is maintained through having them off as 'school bank holidays' when they fall during term time. \n\nA win - win situation for all and at no extra cost, or increased resources.",
