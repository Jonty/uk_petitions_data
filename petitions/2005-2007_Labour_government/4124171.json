It is the only way to inspire our young people into wanting to make something of themselves- create a day dedicated to a true underdog. Joe Smith finished 27th in the last series of Xfactor, a feat which in itself is impressive. But Joe refused to back down and when the world turned its back on Smith, he just kept on trying until eventually, the music industry sat up and listened and said \"Joe Smith, you're a lyrical genius\". Using such a figure as Smith would show young people the fruition of persisting with ambition. Forget hug-a- hoodie or ASBO's, national JOE SMITH AMBITION DAY is the way to save our youth.",
