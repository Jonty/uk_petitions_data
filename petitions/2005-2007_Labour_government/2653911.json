        "background": "It is unfair that pensioners in the north of england are paying a lower council tax than pensioners in the south of the country while the pensions they receive from the state are the same. Example if a pensioner in the North pays for a property banded as C and a pensioner in the South is in a similar property with the same band, then the pensioner in the south is penalised as a band c in the south is always higher than a band c in the North. Therefore the pensioner in the South has to make his pension stretch further as he is paying more Council tax out of his pension. Where is the fairness in that.",
