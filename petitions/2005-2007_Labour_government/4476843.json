Somewhere in our system, fences were broken and walls were breached, and we need to repair them before the system is put to the test again.\" \n\n\"I believe that we are living through one of the worst setbacks for British foreign policy for many years. We are still living with that story, and we cannot be sure how it will end.\"\n\nplease refer to The Rt Hon Lord Hurd's speech - Hansard 22 Feb 2007.\n\nSome of which I have quoted above as my petition was kick started by the Iraq debate in the House of Lords on the 22 Fed 07 - televised 3 Apr 07",
