I went round the man and turned off the tap. As I was leaving he asked me what it all meant. I was quite spontaneous in answering, \u201cIt means the nations have had enough. They are up to here (indicating head level with my hand) with the torrent of legislation and regulations from the European Union.\u201d It is time to turn it off before it overflows the nations with its trading standards, and then insists that you take a Mark or number in your head or hand in order to be able to continue buying and selling with them. \nWe the undersigned petition you to resist the \u2018beast\u2019. Stand alone if necessary, we have the wherewithal and the resources, and the freedom. But far better, trade with Israel and other sensible nations who will also resist. Just say NO! to Europe. So far and NO further! Europe you are not having our nation or Sovereignty.",
