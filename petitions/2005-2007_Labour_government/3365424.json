            "background": "Under my proposal, it would be necessary to pass a written test followed by a spoken interview before being granted the right to vote. The test could be taken by a person of any age, so, if the test was passed by a five-year-old, that child would be entitled to vote in a general election; if the test was failed by an adult (or a child), the right to vote would be suspended for ten years at which time the test could be retaken. The test itself would be designed to establish whether or not an individual has any idea about the nature and purpose of government, the political structure of the country, legal issues, etc. If it works for driving, why not voting?",
