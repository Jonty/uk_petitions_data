            "background": "Ebay was set up as a site that mimicked car boot sales whereby people could auction unwanted items and the buyers could pick up a bargain. More recently it is used for blatant profiteering whereby hard to get goods are sold for prices approaching 3 times their rrp. I know this is governed by supply and demand, but if someone gets \u00a3400 for a \u00a3179 item then they should pay tax on this additional income. I have to pay Vat on my Amazon sales,  which are things I have bought and no longer require, despite having paid vat during my initial purchase.",
