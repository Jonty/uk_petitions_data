        "background": "The law that requires daily acts of collective worship is outdated, and against the human rights of the child to have an education free from religious indoctrination.\n\nIn collective worship there is no equality for all, no adequate provisions for those wishing to opt out of it, and it discriminated against those particularly with no faith. It also breaches equal rights.\n\nReligious practice is not education, it is faith, and should be kept seperate from an educational environment.",
