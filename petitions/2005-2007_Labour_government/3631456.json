            "background": "Currently. patients staying in our hospitals are subjected to pre-frozen, high fat, high salt, overcooked and often utterly inedible food.  This has led to many hospitals providing fast-food alternatives that are highly profitable (please refer to outlets such as Burger King and Pizza Hut often found at large hospitals such as Addenbrookes, Cambridge) meaning the waste bill for producing hospital food must run high.  Specific attention needs to be given to the provision of food in our NHS hospitals to ensure that patients are provided with a nutritious, balanced diet whilst staying on our wards, thus enabling a speedier recovery and ultimately therefore freeing up beds.  If Jamie can do it in schools, surely we can use the same formula in hospitals!",
