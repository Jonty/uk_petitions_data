But, if they can automatically detect your  vehicle registration number and send you a fine if you don't pay on time - surely they can set up a registration number with a debit/credit card!? Paying fines because you forget to phone and pay - is robbery. Lets get Capita (good name eh?) to set this up so that we no longer have to fear forgetting to call! Cheers and thanks, MB",
