            "background": "I'm sure I can't be the only pedestrian to feel very nervous crossing roads; especially either main roada or roads with no traffic lights or zebra crossings.  I have also found that, where there are traffic lights, the time allowed for pedestrians to cross is often so short that the lights have changed while even I, an able-bodied person, am half-way across so it's obvious that anyone old or disabled would have a lot of difficulty.  In tandem with this is the fact that one has to wait so long for the lights to change in one's favour that it is very tempting to cross BEFORE they have changed which obviously risks accidents.",
