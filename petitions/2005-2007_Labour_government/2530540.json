        "background": "I think it is appauling that the goverment now think you are responsible enough to raise a child at 14, yet not responsible enough to drink or smoke until they are 18, 21!\nI know most of you say \"they are going to do it anyway if they want to\" but we need to show everyone that we care!! Would you really want your 14 year old son/daugther coming home telling you that they are going to have a child when they have only just reached puberty themselfs?  How would they support the child, they wouldnt have a national insurance number so they wouldnt be able to get work, which will lead to more unemployed people on the streets! Please think about what your doing Prime Minister! Bring the legal age up to 18 at least!",
