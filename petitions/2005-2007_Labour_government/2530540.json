Would you really want your 14 year old son/daugther coming home telling you that they are going to have a child when they have only just reached puberty themselfs?  How would they support the child, they wouldnt have a national insurance number so they wouldnt be able to get work, which will lead to more unemployed people on the streets! Please think about what your doing Prime Minister! Bring the legal age up to 18 at least!",
