        "background": "The police frequently conceal their vehicles when operating speed guns contrary to APCO rules.  An individual can be prosecuted without camera evidence on the word of two police officers and even though it can be shown that their identification of the vehicle is in doubt because of the reluctance of Magistrates to accept that the Police can be wrong and the higher penalties if found guilty the accused has little option but to plead guilty even though innocent.  There is an unhealthy relationship between Magistrates and the Police.  They serve together on committees and we have been told by a solicitor that the Police take Magistrates out and demonstrate speed guns in use, no doubt in ideal conditions.",
