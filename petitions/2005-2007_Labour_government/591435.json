He is supposed to be the Major of London and with this should be helping the people in London regardless of religion or race and all he does is causes upset, friction and anarchy. He drains vital resouces in needless areas and spends our money on ridiculous things. It all is about power and greed with him and he does not care about what the people in London think.",
