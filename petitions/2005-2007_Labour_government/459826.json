            "background": "Prices for London Transport services have risen yet again, if paid by cash. Not only is this a punishment for those whose Oysters have run out, but it is also another 'stealth tax' on users of Transport and is a heavy detterant on tourism - which would be seriosly detrimental to the capital's economy - as many tourists will avoid out-of-the-way sites purely due to cost of transport. Prices should be at least frozen to last years levels, or better, levelled with Oyster card prices. There are enough incentives to use Oyster without needing ridiculous price differences.",
