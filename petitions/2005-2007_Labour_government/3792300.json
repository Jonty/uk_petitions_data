            "background": "In many parts of Berlin, and former east germany, the pedestrian traffic lights feature a happy man wearing a hat (Ampelm\u00e4nnchen). This looks far nicer than the current british man, and people are far more likely to obey a figure with which they can identify, than a meaningless shape. We therefore request that The Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions (2002) is amended, allowing this as an alternative form; and that all new installations of pelican and similar crossings are required to use it.\n\nAn example of the german style can be seen on many internet websites",
