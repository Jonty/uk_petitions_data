        "background": "From last 60 years we heard about Kashmir conflict which is still on going between India and Pakistan. I think UK Prime Minister can play the part to solve the issue peacefully rather then Indian or Pakistani Governments can do as both Governments failed to resolve this issue so far.  As a Human & Woman rights activist I wish to run an organised meaningful campaign to put pressure on India and Pakistan to allow Kashmiri citizens to decide future of Kashmir as Kashmir not part of India neither belongs to Pakistan. As a socialist and believes in democracy I think we make the necessary arrangements for three options referendum for citizens of State of Jammu & Kashmir. If we are seriously fight against terrorism then we needs to solve issues like Kashmir, conflict between Arabs and Jews in Middle East, conflicts in African States such as Darfur. I think after recent earthquake in Kashmir International community knows the true facts about Kashmiri Land. I feel sad when I think about unclear future of innocent citizens of State of Jammu & Kashmir as they facing State terrorism by various Governments from last 60 years.",
