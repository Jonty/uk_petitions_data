            "background": "How can a road tax be fair if one man has a 2.0 litre engined car that does 2,000 miles a year, and another has the same car but does 30,000 miles a year, but both pay the same for a road fund license?? It is unbelievable in this day and age, a government will charge the driver of a big engined vehicle the same each year to do 1000 miles, as it does the driver of the same car to do 30,000 miles!! Surely it's not rocket science! If it's about the burning of fuel, then the only way to tax is on the litre of fuel we use. The driver of a 3.6 litre Jag who covers 1,500 miles a year will use less fossil fuel than the driver of a Ford Fiesta that does 30,000 miles a year! I rest my case!! Annual road tax needs to be abolished. Tax on fuel is the only fair way forward.",
