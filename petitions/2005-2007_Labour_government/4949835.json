            "action": "proceed with a promised reform of the drug classification system, making the legal status of drugs directly linked to the social, personal and economic harm they cause.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The current \"ABC\" drug classification system is not scientifically based. Rather than appropriately categorising substances based upon evidence of the harm they cause, it imposes an arbitrary control system which is inflexible and fails to accurately reflect the relative dangers inherent to the substances it covers. The end result is a system which does not represent the best approach to the issue from either a medical or law-enforcement standpoint.\n\nThe Lancet has proposed a revised drug classification system, and this proposal has been publicly supported by the Academy of Medical Sciences. The new system assesses drugs on the harm they do to the individual, to society and whether or not they induce dependence. \n\nMore details of this proposal can be found here: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6474053.stm\n\nBy signing this petition, I declare my support for the aforementioned revisions to drug classification in the UK, and urge that the government commence a full reform of the current policies in order to ensure they match the recommendations of medical and law-enforcement bodies, rather than being primarily dictated by tradition and misinformed prejudice.",
