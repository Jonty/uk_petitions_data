            "background": "Travellers on The Underground are subjected to an endless battery of announcements from control rooms, (explaining delays), from drivers (explaing that they have no idea what's going on)from station staff,\n(instructing us to \"move down inside), from automated \"in-train\" systems, (telling us where we are and where we will soon be). There are also automated tannoys instructing us, for example not to leave bags unattended. Some of this is needed, but much is unnecessary, too loud, and unprofessional. For example, most passengers wouldn't leave bags unattended by default, so I doubt that endless tannoy nagging makes any difference. Please have a word with Ken before we are driven mad by this cacophony.",
