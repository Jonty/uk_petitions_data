            "background": "On a daily basis we are seeing perfectly good traditional houses with gardens, being demolished to build \"Affordable housing\" which is nothing more than stackable boxes for people to live in, unsuitable for couples with children, and erected in the most unsightly places; namely busy street corners once containing garages or shops, on the edge of a roundabout, or right next to a railway line. I have just seen 2x lovely Edwardian houses destroyed to build 28x dwellings in the same space area.",
