        "background": "Controversy and violence are inherit to all entertainment mediums. With videogames, however, the act is participatory, not visual, and is akin to actually carrying out the act itself. This leads to influnce on young minds, instilling a violent nature and an inability to distinguish right and wrong, reality from play. Certain countries, such as Germany and Australia, do identify these games and stop them from reaching young people. We should do the same.",
