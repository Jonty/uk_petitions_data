We are sorry that you have been misled by some media reporting on this issue.\n\nWe are able to say categorically that the Holocaust is a compulsory part of the Key Stage 3 National Curriculum for history and is a very\nwell-resourced topic as it has been compulsory for 10 years. Such is the importance of this area of study it will remain compulsory in the new Key Stage 3 curriculum from September 2008.\n\nThe Department for Education and Skills commissioned research into the\nteaching of emotive and controversial issues in history. The Holocaust\nwas mentioned in that research, carried out by the Historical\nAssociation, as one of a number of these issues. The report, which can\nbe downloaded from www.history.org.uk, made reference to one school\nwhere the Holocaust was not chosen as a topic for coursework at GCSE.\nHistory is not compulsory at GCSE and it is for teachers to decide what to teach those students who wish to pursue history beyond 14.\n\nThe Holocaust Educational Trust has also been concerned to allay any\nfears about the place of the Holocaust in National Curriculum and\nfurther information can be obtained from them at www.het.org.uk",
