            "background": "The EC Regulation 785/2004 (effective 01.05.2005) specifies a minimum insurance coverage for aircraft without making exemptions for historical aircraft such as Sally-B B17G, the only airworthy example of the famous \"flying fortress\" in the UK.\n\nThis puts such aircraft into the same category as a commercial Boeing 737. For aircraft maintained in the air solely on private donations, an extra cost of GBP 30,000.- per year is tantamount to grounding.\n\nUnlike commercial aircraft, the historic aircraft is on a British Permit to Fly, and as such:\n\n- is not allowed to carry out commercial flights\n- is not allowed to fly for hire and reward\n- is not allowed to carry passengers\n- is not allowed to fly over populated areas\n\nDespite this:\n\n- it has its own maintenance company approved by the CAA\n- its pilots are all ATPLs with extensive experience on tail wheel and heavy piston\n\nAND it flies only 20-40 hours per year, between May and October.",
