            "background": "Tv gaming channels of all descriptions and from all providers should be banned, as it is leading to vunerable people spending large amounts of money on premium rate television games with sometimes impossible answers. People affected are often of low income families, or the vunerable elderly who are looking for a quick way to win vast amounts of cash, with little chance of sucess, thus leading the people of this country into further debt. This is irresponsible of the tv channels who already make vast amounts money from advertising.",
