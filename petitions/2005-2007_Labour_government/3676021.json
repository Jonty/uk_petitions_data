            "background": "We would like the the Prime Minister to increase the funding for Sexual Health in the UK. Current funding is aimed at specific clinics and teenagers, we would like to schemes like free NHS pharmacy screening for adults and not just teenagers. We would like to see home testing options made available for those who would not attend a specific clinic at a hospital, including outreach services. Britain has an unacceptably high number of infections rates, this need not be the case, but current strategy is primarily aimed at teens. Teenagers are not the only group at risk here. Lets deal with the problem across the spectrum.",
