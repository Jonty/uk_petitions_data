            "background": "Request that illegal parking in front of entrances of drives to private/business places should be dealt with those wardens employed by local councils rather than the police. At the moment, the council traffic wardens have no powers to book these illegal cars/vans/hgv's which block access, in or out, those who are resident at the address. The police have other priorities and, when advised, generally ring back 30 minutes later to ask if the vehicle has gone.",
