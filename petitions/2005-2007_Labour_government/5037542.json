It should be lifted because; it is hundreds of years of culture 'their' throwing down down the drain. Number 1: The hunting yards are been shut down, the horses are been put down and people are losing jobs who have been in aspect of the world for as long as they can remember in some cases. Some hunts are having to put 30% more hounds down now than they usually would of done, there's no point feeding them when they can't do their jobs. There's hundreds of years of breeding thats been put in them dogs and have the correct characteristics to hunt. So please everyone sign this petition and lift the ban cos us country people are strong and fight for our culture and our livelihoods.",
