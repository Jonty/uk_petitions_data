        "background": "This petition is to get the government to recognise that we have a problem with house prices. To understand that we, the people cannot afford the simple and most basic cost of putting a roof over our heads.\n\nProperty prices are uncontrollably increasing but our salaries are being squeezed by international pressure from cheaper salaries abroad. As a result our salaries will never keep up with the property market. \n\nAlso house prices/capital repayments are not included in the Retail Price Index (RPI) so inflation does not reflect the true cost of living (house prices have doubled in 3 years and capital mortgage repayments have doubled as well). So Inflation looks like a few percent a year but in reality our true cost of living has increased considerably more than just a few percent due to house prices.\n\nIn short prime minister, please help reduce house prices and make life affordable for your people.",
