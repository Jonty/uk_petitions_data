It\u2019s down to personal choice, they are not hurting anyone, they are not even harming themselves, at what age should a women cover herself up? Maybe we ought to to hand out jilbabs to every women over 14 we could have a trial week in school then ASK them if they would like to keep it, but at the end of the day it should be their choice, not yours.",
