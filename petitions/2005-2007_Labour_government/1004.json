            "background": "Irrespective of what we do to curb emissions within the UK, the projected growth in aviation will undo any savings we make. As the Prime Minister has stated that climate change is one of his highest priorities, I would propose that the Prime Minister tackles this in two ways:\n\n1. Introduce tax on aviation fuel.\n2. Halt the expansion of our airports\n\nThe only hope we have of tackling this problem is by limiting both the capacity and demand. Motorists have to pay a lot of tax on the fuel they use and airlines should face the same restrictions.",
