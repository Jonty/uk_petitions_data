        "background": "There is no evidence of street cleaning in Purley, despite Croydon Council's claims in its 2007/08 guide to Croydon's Council Tax - \"Building a Croydon to be proud of\" - that it makes sure Croydon streets are cleaned regularly to exacting timetables and specifications.  Pavements are strewn with litter and piled high with rubbish - eg take a look outside Mark Youll Estate Agent or Youngs Builders Merchants on Godstone Road.",
