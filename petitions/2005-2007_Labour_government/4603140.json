            "background": "Where I live in Ceredigion, West Wales, the student vote from Aberystwyth and Lampeter universities is a major contributor to the overall outcome of elections. At the last general election, the Liberal Democrats were elected by a very small majority, largely due to the student vote.  Many of these students no longer live in the area, but those who must reside and work here are left with their legacy.  Students should not have the choice of where they cast their vote, they should vote in the constituency of their permanent address.",
