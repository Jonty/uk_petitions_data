            "action": "ensure that, as a minimum, the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) within the Home Information Pack (HIP) is made compulsory from June 01 2007",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The EPC reinforces the cross-party commitment to monitoring and reducing the impact of CO2 emissions through domestic energy consumption. The requirement for an EPC when a property is sold is an excellent method of demonstrating the energy performance of a property and suggesting improvements as this is when the (new) householder is most likely to be able to undertake such energy improvements.\n\nThis petition is not advocating the demise or postponement of HIPs. It is a fact that apart from the EPC all of the information within the HIP will be required during the conveyancing process and therefore any attempt to speed up this traditional bottleneck is to be welcomed.\n\nHowever, it is acknowledged that other parties with a vested and often partially informed point of view are seeking to delay their implementation and therefore, if a compromise is required, the minimum compulsory requirement should be the EPC from June 01 2007.",
