            "background": "Some Local Authorities, including Leeds, are dismantling a wide range of exemplar social and homecare services through the introduction of eligibility criteria and charging policies that victimise some of the most isolated and vulnerable individuals in society.\n\nThese policies result in denying key support services to older and disabled people that carry extensive hidden costs to the NHS and society in general.  It represents nothing more than an unjustifiable additional tax on age and disability that is socially and morally corrupt.  Lucrative contracts are being offered to private companies who will place profit before care, while highly trained care staff are being made redundant. \n\nPlease sign this petition to register your support for the choices, rights and opportunities of all older and disabled people to live independently with dignity and respect within their communities and demand that all Public Authorities place quality standards first by putting Care Before Profit.",
