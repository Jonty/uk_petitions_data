Too many people getting off with things or getting very light punishment for the crime committed. \n\nCriminals know they can get away with things so they are not scared to do it.\n\nI suggest \n\nRobbers get there hand cut off!\nPaedophiles get castrated!\nMurderers received the death penalty\n(There will have to be hard evidence to support this, understandably)or more time in jail.\n\nI assure you the crime rate will drop with in 6 month. \n\nAnd prisoners HAVE NO RIGHTS it\u2019s a punishment not a holiday!!!!\n\nthe people who run this county should care more about the people rather than filling there own pockets with tax payers money and finding more ways to get money out of tax payers. \n\nif things keep going the way they are i wouldnt worry about global warming i would worry about a revolution.",
