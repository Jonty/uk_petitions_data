            "background": "There are ambitious plans for NHS maternity services in England. By 2009 all women will have choice over where and how they give birth, and support from the same midwife throughout pregnancy. To achieve this we must tackle the chronic shortage of midwives. There is more and more evidence of vacant posts not being recruited to, places for student midwives and training budgets being cut, and much more. What is worse, many newly-qualified midwives find it impossible to find work as a midwife. This is terrible outcome for a new midwife after years of study. It is also a blow to taxpayers, who invest \u00a315,000 on each student midwife every year. A one-year jobs guarantee for newly-qualified midwives would ensure that they are brought into the profession. This is already happening in Scotland, thanks to devolution. That would help to secure the future of midwifery and maternity services in England. Ultimately that is in the best interests of women and their families.",
