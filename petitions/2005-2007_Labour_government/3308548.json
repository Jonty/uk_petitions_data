            "background": "Some pupils can be identified in primary schools as not achieving the required accademic standards and then become troublesome. I propose offering education to suit their needs. practical subjects have far more meaning to young boys in particular, the accademic subjects can then be applied to those practical subjects. The knock-on effect would be a reduction in youth crime and rebuild the manual skills base.",
