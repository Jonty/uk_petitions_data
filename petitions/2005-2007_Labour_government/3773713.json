            "background": "This has been successfully introduced in Eastern European countries at around 17 - 19% rate. The personal allowance should simultaneously be abolished. The Managing Director's non-work time is just as valuable to him as the street-cleaner's, but the MD has to pay tax at a higher rate currently, which is iniquitous. Any scheme which will reduce the amount of snooping by Government, reduce the form-filling and reduce the number of civil servants, is a good thing.",
