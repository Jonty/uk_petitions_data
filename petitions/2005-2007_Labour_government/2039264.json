            "background": "I simply believe that Europe is enacting too much law, and that the processes by which these laws originate are not sufficiently democratic. I believe countries should be free to prioritise their own laws over those of the European Union, so that in the event of a conflict between these levels, the British laws automatically take precendence. In such a situation where there is a conflict between British and European law, there further should *not* be an obligation of parliament to make the British law compatible with EU law. European law makers should concentrate on areas where we (the people, and not just the leaders) agree with our partners, and in other cases respect the diversity of views across the EU.",
