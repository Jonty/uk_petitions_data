            "background": "Recently there has been a change in leglislation about age discrimination for older workers. However, this has not applied to younger workers. Minimum wage for under 21's is significantly less than minimum wage for employees over 21. Why should a young person doing exactly the same job as an older employee be paid less? This is age discrimination which is currently legal. This should be changed!!",
