            "background": "Please raise the higher rate of income tax threshold to \u00a340,000.00.  People who have studied and worked hard to secure well paid employment should not be penalised by the current rate of higher income tax.\n\nThe need for taxes is understood, but people should be able to keep more of the money they earn not the Chancellor.\n\n\u00a332,400.00 the current threshold rises by a risable \u00a3900.00 next year to \u00a333,300.00.   \n\nThe extra money in wage packets will mostly be fed back into the economy by the families concerned and not government initiatives.",
