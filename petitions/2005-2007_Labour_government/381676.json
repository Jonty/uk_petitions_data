            "background": "Landlords are allowed to Purchase and Rent out sub standard living accomodation. Without any real Building standard and Health and safety checks being carried out. The current rules are not good enough. Many houses are let out in a bad state of repair without several of the basic requirements.\nIf a fast food company set up without these standards we would be in big trouble.\nLandlords should be subject to a basic minimum health and safety and building safety standard set of checks prior to being able to rent / Let a property. Mayby this should also carry a certification standard that needs to be renewable once a year.\n\nThe reasons for the government not providing this as of yet can only be down to the lack of cheap housing throughout the UK. ITS EASYER TO TURN A BLIND EYE.",
