We, the Thessexiuns and Thessexy sympathisers, want King Sam's status recognised by the nations containing this fine county. We are entirely peaceful and try to claim land without resorting to violence. The main result is our lack of land.\n\nWe would like to reassure the nation that we will keep to the laws of the land we are in and any laws passed by our King are in addition to UK and EU law.",
