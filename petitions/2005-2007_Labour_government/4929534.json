        "background": "The most recent shelling and indiscriminate bombardment by US supported Ethiopian occupation forces and the Somali Transitional Federal Government (TFG) Warlord militias in densely populated civilian neighbourhoods and major markets in Mogadishu has caused a severe humanitarian crisis in Somalia. Hospitals, schools, and mosques did not escape this indiscriminate bombardment. Most recent reports estimate that approximately 2,000 lives were lost, more than 7,000 people were wounded, and close to one half million people were forced to leave their homes even as they endured tremendous suffering. By undersigning this petition we wish to end all occupation of Somalia from Ethiopian troops and acknowledge that the Ethiopian military is in Somalia illegally.",
