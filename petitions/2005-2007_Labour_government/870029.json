        "background": "I am asking that the Government introduce Dog Licences, this will help with all dogs being monitered, this will help in checks being kept on all vicious breeds. plus it would probably help irradicate all dogs that roam the streets. It would help with the control of families having pets which can't really afford to look after them and also help with those that have too many dogs in one property causing noise and disturbance. If people are really dedicated to having a dog then they will be prepared to follow this. i think at least a \u00a3100 per dog licence, this would then fund the introducing of more dog waste bins being put up in local area's.",
