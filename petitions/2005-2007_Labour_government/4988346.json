            "background": "This petition is generated due to a Religious Group trying to get exemption from having a Bovine animal slaughtered because the animal returned a positive blood test for TB (Tuberculosis).\n\nAny such group that forms within the UK should be compliant to rules and regulations that are in place to protect and prevent disease spreading within the UK, and if they are not happy to comply with the regulations of the Country they should not keep species of animals that come under such regulations.\n\nWe strongly oppose any exemption that gives one group within our Society any precedence or unjust favour against another, especially when the issue surrounds health protection and disease prevention.\n\nWe demand that there be ONE rule for all   on the requirement to slaughter bovines that return positive blood tests in the periodic TB blood testing carried out by Governmental Vets, with no exemptions to any group or Religion.\n\nOne rule for All no matter what colour, creed or religion.",
