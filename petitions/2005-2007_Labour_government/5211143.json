            "background": "There are two ways to enforce congestion charges. The first would be to install cameras on every road entering the congestion zone, or to make it necessary for every road user to purchase a gps-monitoring device so that their cars whereabouts and speed can be recorded. This means every car will be under surveillance. This will almost certainly lead to acceleration fines, a boy-racers nightmare! Possibly even handbrake turn and wheel spin fines. This could make the country a safer place by making the roads of Britain more like a scalextric track. The real question is where is the borderline between making a safer country and a complete nanny-state culture (by the way im not a daily mail reader don\u2019t worry) with your privacy being infringed on every tire squealing corner. After all, wasn\u2019t the first affordable motor vehicle (the model-t) created to increase the mobility and freedom of every American person? Is backward the right direction to go? Are these gps systems compatible with motorbikes? How much does it cost to take a cbt?",
