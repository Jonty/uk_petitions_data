            "background": "Many shops today simply do not stock larger sized bras. In general high street shops, the highest bra size mainly goes up to 38D, or 36DD. Even shops which claim to sell higher sized bras tend not to be able to meet demand. Many women are wearing ill-fitting bras because of this shortage, and should not have to pay the much higher prices that are charged for bigger bras. If women carry on having to wear ill-fitting bras, a higher number of back problems, amongst others may emerge.",
