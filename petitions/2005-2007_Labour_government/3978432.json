            "background": "How can we expect children to learn or show respect to authority figures (such as teachers or the Police), when their hero's on the football pitch show ZERO respect for the match official?\n\nSwearing, surrounding and confronting the Ref, diving (cheating) in an attempt to \"put one over\" the Ref.  Obvious foul playing and then walking away complaining loudly as if they are the injured party.  We can't expect children to behave when these so-called adults don't.\n\nIt's gong to take a long time to bring respect for elders and authority figures back into society.  But as long as footballers are allowed to treat Refs the way they do, then children will treat adults the same way.\n\nOther sports are able to be played with passion and respect, why not football!",
