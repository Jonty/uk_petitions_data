            "background": "For too long have we gone without what is probably the best tasting cereal in the world.  All we want is our lucky charms back.  Whenever I go to the US the first thing i look out for is Lucky Charms and it amazes me that considering the amount of people who tell me they want them back they have never been brought back.  All over the internet you see people commenting on the fact they want to be able to buy this cereal again and there must be a way for it to be brought back.  So I say to you sign this petition and lets try and bring this cereal back to the uk!!!",
