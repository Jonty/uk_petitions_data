        "background": "There are so many people out there claiming benefits such as job seekers allowance, that are claiming this money because they simply cannot be bothered to go to work and earn money like the rest of us.\n\nThese people go down to there local job centre and sign on every week, taking money, which could be spent on a lot of other things.\n\nBenefits should be given to those who are unable to work, no to those who choose not to work.\n\nThe most important factor here is that so much money which is coming from the government, and handed out to lazy people, could be spent on public transport or improving the police forces or equipment for schools or roads....the list is endless.\n\nThank you",
