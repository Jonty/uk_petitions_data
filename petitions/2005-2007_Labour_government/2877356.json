            "background": "With the increasing crime against the public in various natures, I believe its time to consider the death sentence once again. Who in their right minds would rape and murder a 2 year old? Who would rape and beat a pensioner to death? Who would murder someone for their mobile phone and some small change. Rape is a life sentence for the victim, but a few years for the perpetrator! The relations of a child, spouse, parent, relation who has been murdered, suffer a lifetime of misery. Would you the regular citizen do this? No. The regular decent law abiding citizen of the country has a right to live safely, but time and time again the law has let us down.",
