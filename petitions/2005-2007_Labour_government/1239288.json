        "background": "The UK has an ageing population and a shrinking workforce. Currently half of the six million unpaid carers in this country juggle care and work, and more would work if they could.\n\nTax breaks could help workers with care responsibilities pay for extra care and support services for their older and disabled relatives. A similar scheme already exists to help workers with childcare costs through tax breaks on childcare vouchers.\n\nThis proposal for tax exemptions for care vouchers has the support of a wide range of charities, older people's organisations, employers and employee groups, and voucher providers.",
