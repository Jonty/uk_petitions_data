        "background": "The recent fiasco concerning the Home Office losing low security level terror suspects and the subsequent calls for the repeal of the Human Rights Act and Derogation from the ECHR represent a further errosion of the protections of fundemental freedoms.  The problem is not the requirements of these laws, but the incompetance of Home Office staff, poor systems and processes and a reluctance on the part of the Government to make fundemental and systemic changes to this department.  Human Rights should NOT be compromised as a result.",
