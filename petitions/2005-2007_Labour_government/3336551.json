            "background": "The approximate cost of nuclear weapons to our country is \u00a32bn per year. (taken from the Guardian's website) I suggest this is a criminal waste of taxpayers money, as we have never needed or used WMDs, except as an excuse to invade other, coincidentally oil-rich countries.  How can we pressure the world to disarm, (obviously a universally agreeable idea) without first setting an example?  The money could be better spent in ANY other public sector, and National Security would not be affected as any use of such weapons would immediately be an INTERnational crisis.  I propose we become part of the solution to one of the great fears of our age, instead of part of the cause.",
