            "background": "Here in Test Valley and probably in other places, too, many recyclable items cannot be recycled as the council refuses to recycle them. Yet it is happy to try to force us to recycle more such as the ABC Bin System and in future that may include charging us. They should be forced to provide facilities for recycling all recyclables and encourage a market for the recycled product before they do any more to force us to recycle more. I for one would recycle more if more recyclables could actually be recycled.",
