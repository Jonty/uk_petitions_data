Speculation: if this goes on a mass pay strike is inevitable.\nProfits do not seem economically \"normal\", are they derived from under-investment?\nWhere environmental concerns necessitate genuine increases these should be paid out of general taxation: massive increases in water bills are a tax on a basic commodity that bears most heavily on the poorest.\nNo public ownership (e.g. Wessex Water used to be owned by ENRON, now owned by a Malaysian company) and no free market: this whole situation is very WRONG.",
