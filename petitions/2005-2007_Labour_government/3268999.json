            "background": "At 7am the speed limit would revert to 70mph until 8pm that evening.  This would encourage the fuller use of motorways whilst reducing conjestion at a stroke with no costly bureaucracy.  It should be introduced initially as a 1 year trial since there will be those that argue there will be a larger number of road deaths and accidents.  The trial will reveal whether or not this is so.",
