        "background": "There used to be, on the web, a government sponsored forum, or forums, wherein people could discuss all the public issues of British government and politicians. One might suggest that it was removed because of a mixture of thin skins amongst politicians who were criticised personally, and comments by knowledgeable people which tended to make some aspects of government policy, and or \"spin\", look very silly. The reason is not really important though, as we want it back irrespective of possible discomfiture amongst a few people. The government forum was a very popular and lively place and many really thought provoking threads were created. Therefore, we believe that people should regain the opportunity to express their views in a forum constructed on the government web site for which, after all, they are ultimatimately paying.",
