        "background": "This is in response to a petition asking for employers not to be allowed to dismiss British workers in order to make room for Eastern European workers who are perceived to undercut U.K. workers.  This brings up several issues: the injustice of paying someone less simply because he/she is not a British citizen (something not within his/her control), the fact that this perception causes hostility to such workers from their colleagues, and racism generally.",
