            "background": "Many Heavy Goods Vehicles are restricted to about 60mph, however as these restrictions are never exact, many lorries overtake each other, often with a difference in speed of less than 1mph, which on two lane roads slow down other road users, wasting their time and adding to congestion on our roads. This petition requests that it be made an offence for vehicles limited to 60mph to overtake any vehicle travelling faster than 50mph on roads with only 2 lanes in the direction of travel.",
