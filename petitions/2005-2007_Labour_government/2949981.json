        "background": "We need to pay for our roads but there are never suggestions on how to do this only blanket petitions against an idea but offering no feasible alternative. I have the best, fairest and easiest scheme ever. Tax per mile already exists in petrol so put more tax on that get rid of road tax but allow people the ability to claim back tax depending on certain criteria that they have to proove. Like work or school run. Then make loopholes like a per person tax refund for specific qualifying journeys so people who car share will be able to claim back double tax but only use one reduced tax allowance for the actual trip. Give further incentives for green cars. No black boxes, money for roads based on usage, less congestion, no money on scheme to catch road tax evaders.",
