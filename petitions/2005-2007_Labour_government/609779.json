If the UK is to be a multi-faith society we must have impartial, secular government. \nWe are seeking the separation of church and state; the prohibition of the establishment of a national religion; a commitment that one religion will not be favoured over another, or religion favoured over irreligion; the removal of all state funding for religious organisations; the introduction of a legal right to practice the religion of your choice, including no religion; the prohibition of teaching religion in state schools (except as literature); the prohibition of defining children by the religion of their parents.",
