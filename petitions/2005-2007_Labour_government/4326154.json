            "background": "Most families require a larger vehicle to carry their family. There is also the issue of people who need a larger vehicle for towing.  Those who take their holidays by caravan for instance are 'Greener' than those who fly and yet are penalised. The law requires a tow vehicle to be of a proscribed size and then penalises those who abide by it.  It penalises those families with more than two children and those in the lower income bracket.\nThis taxation class system is dangerous in that people will use vehicles that are not 'up to the job' it is also an infringment of civil liberty and a contravention of human rights. This government has no shame when it comes to filling it's own pockets at the expense of the hard working people of this country",
