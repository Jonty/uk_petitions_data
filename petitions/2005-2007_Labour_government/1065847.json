            "background": "The only problem we have with the custody centre proposals for Teddington is the lack of parking and the problems this will cause the surrounding area. As a wealthy area many people who live here already have two cars per household so parking is at a premium - to place this centre here with NO parking would make life very difficult indeed.\n\nVery basic principles of Christian love mean that we believe that the geographical placing of the custody centre in Teddington should not be an issue to object against.",
