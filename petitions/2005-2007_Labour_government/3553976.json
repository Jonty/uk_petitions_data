It is in line for listing as a \u2018Positive Building\u2019, but the new Conservation Area appraisals have not yet been agreed, but that would still not protect it from demolition; we need your help to save the structure.   \nThe Planning Committee have already refused Gloucester City Council permission to demolish the structure, but the Council found a way of bringing it before the Committee again on Tuesday 6th March 2007 seeking permission to demolish -  democracy skewed?\n\nLes Branchett - for\nGLOUCESTERSHIRE HERITAGE AND CONSERVATION HELPING TO SAVE HISTORY",
