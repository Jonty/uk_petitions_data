            "background": "I am fed up of people campaigning to raise the driving age. It won't solve anything. I am a safe young driver and all the run-ins I have with other motorists are never young drivers but middle-aged school run parents in 4x4s and tradesmen in their white vans. Stop scapegoating young drivers. The only real way to safer drivers is less cameras and more traffic police on the roads.",
