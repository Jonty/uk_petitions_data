            "background": "During State Visits and other diplomatic/governmental events, large sections of London's transport system are closed down to facilitate the movement of VIPs etc.  This causes unnecessary inconvenience and economic loss for the everday users of London's streets and does nothing but pander to a few inflated egos and the interests of minority groups. As an example the visit by the President of Ghana on 12 Mar closed central London streets for 3 hours.  About 400 people lined the Mall to watch his rapid transit while other motorists had 30 minutes added on to their journeys to facilitate this minority event. These events take up excessive police resources and contribute little to the wellbeing of this nation and it's capital.",
