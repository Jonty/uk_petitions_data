This is a direct result of you and your government failing to control the population, allowing the number of refugees and immigrants to increase alarmingly.  We, the people should not have to pay the price for this calamity. Nor should the poorest in society be swept up into a tax net that is only supposed to catch the very richest percentage of people.",
