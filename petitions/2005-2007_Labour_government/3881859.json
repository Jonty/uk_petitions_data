        "background": "People who live in the countryside like I do have to pay a lot more to fill their vehicles than maybe city people do. As we use our vehicles more and there are not many bus services and no train facilities,  then of course more fuel is purchased.  Cycling would not be an option as journeys of 20 - 70 miles to get to work would take far too long and would be far too tiring!!  I think prices of fuel for country people should be lower.... please help!!",
