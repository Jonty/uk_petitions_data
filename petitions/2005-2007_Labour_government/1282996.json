Businesses are particularly affected. In many sectors the market should run itself and trust consumers to make the right decisions!! One of the first things that would help this is if we were all encouraged to take responsibility for ourselves rather than partake in the blame culture, ambulance chaser society we live in! Lets not make it such a perfect world for Lawyers!!!",
