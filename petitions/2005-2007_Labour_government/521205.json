        "background": "Its estimated that Gordon Brown's tax grab on dividends has cost pensions something like \u00a3150 billion pounds . In one fell swoop Britain went from having one of the most stable pension systems in the world to one that is now extremely vulnerable.Scrapping the tax would start the process of restoring the health of pension schemes and give those in the private sector a chance of avoiding financial misery in old age.",
