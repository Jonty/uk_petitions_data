            "background": "Private business is run much more efficiently than the public sector. So what if they make a profit, when their efficiency gains would be so much more, meaning better care and more services.\nIt seems to me that the NHS is struggling to cope with rising demand and problems like superbugs, so let private business with its far more lean and effective management take on the role, with a government Watchdog to oversee things.\nAfter all food, water and energy supplies are left to the private sector so why not health care.",
