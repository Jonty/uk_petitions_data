            "background": "The Government is determined to impose road pricing yet they have abandoned plans for the above schemes. The Liverpool scheme was abandoned the day before construction was due to start. Also they are draining the Midland Metro of funding to the point where it may have to close. In Tyne and Wear operator Nexus is seeking funding for upgrading a 25 year old system as yet there has been no commitment from Government on this.\nCoincidentally funding for the above schemes was cut when London was chosen for the Olympic games and the Olympic area is to have vast sums spent on improving its transport links. That in a city which allready has one of the best intergrated transport systems in the World.",
