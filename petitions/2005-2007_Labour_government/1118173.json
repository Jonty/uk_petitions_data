The government are currently in the process of cutting many valued services, including care for the old.  \n\n\nPlease add your name to this petition, without your support there is little chance that there will be any anything left of the Civil Service in 10 years time.  Instead all the valid services will be delivered by hundreds of companies, who's only agenda is profit and more profit.",
