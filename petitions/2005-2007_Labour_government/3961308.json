            "background": "Dear Sirs,\n          it was with a degree of unbelievable amazement when I read an article which appeared in British News papers detailing the Governments subsidies of Free Massages and Facial treatments for the unemployed and people receiving benefeits.\nMy wife and myself work long hours just to pay for our existence and cover mortgage re-payments and food for our children. We cannot even afford to even go out for an evening.\nI would petition that the Government should be much more responsible on how it is spending the tax payers money.\nAll ministers should be made personally responsible for their departments expenditure.\nFor the equivalent spent on this perhaps our troops could have had better equipment or the NHS some of its debts paid to enable it to treat people who do want to work and not subsist off others.",
