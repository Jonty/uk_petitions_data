        "background": "This Petition, as the title suggests, is to prevent Ebay from allowing people / touts to auction off festival / gig / event tickets at rediculous prices. \n\n I myself on numerous occasions have gone to buy tickets maybe a couple of hours after they have gone on sale, only to find they are sold out and that a ticket costing \u00a3150.00, now costs \u00a3350 or more on Ebay.\n\n It is totally unnaceptable and Ebay's response basically suggested to me, they don't care, they're making too much money from it. It is ruining the live entertainment scene and really getting out of hand.\n \n I also have a hard copy and am well on the way to getting siginatures as so many people also feel strongly about this.",
