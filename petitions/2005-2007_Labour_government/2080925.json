            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Abolish the EMA system as a whole to prevent the wastage of tax-payers money on non-means tested income support. Instead introduce a scheme whereby further education institutions spend that money on materials, transport and learning support; which can be available for all students. At the moment governments supporting EMA cannot guarantee that students spend the allowance on educational resources. More needs to be done to recognise all students equally regardless of household income.",
