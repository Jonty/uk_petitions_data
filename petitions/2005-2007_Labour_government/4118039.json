            "background": "Over the past few months, there has been a dramitic increase in incidents involving school children being shot at with either pellet or BB guns whilst at school, some instances have involved seriously injured. I am proposing that schools run safety talks as part of their curriculum for parents and children by suitably qualified instructors to educate them in the dangers of using these \"toys\" whilst at school or in their free time. I urge you to sign this petition so that we can reduce the number of our children being seriously injured on a daily basis.",
