Furthermore, it hardly takes any effort from us to place our newspapers, bottles/cans etc into a recycling box. \n\nTaxing us for the amount of rubbish we create (by weight), on top of the Council Tax we pay for having a waste collection service in the first place, would obviously be unfair.  \n\nSo to encourage people to get into a regular routine of recycling: \n\n-  EVERY COUNCIL should introduce new LARGER RECYCLING BOXES to accommodate greater amounts of recyclable waste. \n\n-  And FORTNIGHTLY GREY BIN COLLECTIONS of non-recyclable waste.\n\nAn easy, cost-effective way to get the green balance right.",
