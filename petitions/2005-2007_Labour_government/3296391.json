            "background": "There is a growing problem of too much alcohol consumption on train journeys.This is particularly so in the case of GNER trains from King's Cross to Scotland.My daughter is a student at Dundee University and the journey from and to Peterborough(about 5-6 hours)is often marred by the actions of other passengers who are drinking excessively.This problem is surely exacerbated by the sale of alcohol on the trains-often at inflated prices to boost train company profits?In particular swearing and general poor standards of behaviour is of concern to people with young children on the train.Having paid a lot of money for a long train journey it seems unfair that fellow passengers have to endure this type of behaviour.It can be even be quite frightening at times.",
