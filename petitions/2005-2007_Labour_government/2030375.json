            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "'VIC' replaces outdated road tax methods yet it contains NO personal details only the vehicle owners name and contact number. However it does contain details of valid Insurance and MOT - (where required).\n\nPetrol stations are upgraded to have a 'go / no go' card reader installed on each fuel pump rendering an invalid vehicle useless without petrol if the documentation on 'VIC' is not in date.\n \nBENEFITS ......\n\nEverybody using roads will pay their way and the ones using the roads the most will pay the most.\n\nThe charge at the pumps can be adjusted to the area in which the vehicle are being driven, thereby effectively making congestion charging redundant.\n\nMost importantly - ALL VEHICLES will have be legal to use the roads.\n\nAnd the benefits linked to that are endless.",
