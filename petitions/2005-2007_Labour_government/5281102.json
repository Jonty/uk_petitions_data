        "background": "While PE departments across the country are now taking advantage of the warm weather we are experiencing, by taking pupils outside to do activities, I find it unfair that pupils are not offered any form of protection from the harmful rays of the sun (eg - sun cream) while outside.\n\nIf pupils are not given the choice whether to stay inside, they should at least have the option to protect themselves to the potentially cancer causing rays they may asorb outside.",
