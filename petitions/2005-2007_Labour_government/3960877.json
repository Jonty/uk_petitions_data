            "background": "The Mechanics\u2019 Institution building, listed Grade II*, has been unused and increasingly derelict since 1986. The Trust wants to see it restored, to provide an inspirational, community-led cultural space at the heart of Swindon. \n \nThey have a vision for its future use, and have obtained Listed Building Consent.  \n\nOver 20 years, 3 separate owners have failed to secure planning permission for a hotel on the site, which is at the centre of a proposed World Heritage Site.\n \nThe Trust urges the Government to intervene to break the deadlock and allow restoration, by securing a transfer of ownership to the Trust.  \n \nThe Institution, built in 1855 by GWR workers, served the people of Swindon in a wide variety of roles for 131 years.  It housed a library, theatre, lecture rooms, and was the cultural focus for a rapidly expanding and diverse community.  \n\nThis internationally important building must not decay further, but should be at the centre of Swindon\u2019s social and physical regeneration.",
