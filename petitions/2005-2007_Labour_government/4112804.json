            "background": "Enable Mobile phone usage on the London Underground System.  In other countries like Hong Kong for instance the MTR [Mass Transit Railway] has been enabled so that mobile phones can be used underground.  Surely this service could be introduced to the London Underground.  The TFL could own and operate their own service network and lease this service to mobile phone service providers such as Vodafone, O2 and Virgin then invest the profits into the London Underground introducing new trains, cleaner stations and also installing glass shields like those in place on the Jubilee line at all stations so that accidental falls onto the tracks can be prevented.",
