            "background": "It's time to end the local council control of awards of housing benefit and council tax benefit, and move it into the hands of the DWP or a similar organisation - to help put an end to the masses of bureaucracy, wasted time and effort that local councils force onto people that need to be looking for employment not wasting time calling their local council every week to ensure that their benefits are being paid, regardless of the fact they are being awarded benefits, for example JSA.\n\nThe national government knows who is getting benefits and controlling the awards of such benefits, thus is best placed to award other benefits, rather than adding in an extra layer of bureaucracy and paperwork, which is a scandalous waste of time, effort, paperwork and money. Not to mention the severe consequences that happen when local councils get it wrong - like homelessness, court appearances and huge personal debt for people with no money.",
