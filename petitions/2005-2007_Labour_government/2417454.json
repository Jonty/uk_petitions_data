            "background": "Stop the closure of sixth forms in Welsh and English secondary schools in favour of creating sixth form colleges. Retaining school sixth forms would enable continuity of education thereby retaining skilled teachers in schools and would be more cost effective. Transferring sixth form education into colleges requires massive investment in new buildings, facilities and staff all at a time when education budgets are being drastically cut. Most importantly, common sense dictates the continuity of trust, bonds and understanding in teacher pupil relationships which are formed in earlier years in secondary schools, which would be lost if pupils transferred to tertiary colleges. Please support keeping our school sixth forms open.",
