            "background": "i think all companys should pay full sick pay to employees.the statuary sick pay is not enough.people go to work when they are ill, because they cannot afford to have time off work because they do not get paid.some people should not be at work because of serious health matters but they go into work.surely it is against health and saftey matters.i know some peole take advantage of sick pay, but if they got paid full sick for 3 months during the year,then once they have expired the 3 months then the sick pay should stop.this would stop people going to work who have a serious health problem, and stop hard ship, and be with health and saftey.i know because my husband has done this which worries me for his safety.",
