        "background": "At night it can be very difficult to distinguish what is a car headlight from a motorcycle headlight which can make for very dangerous situations. Pedal cyclists who have red flashing lights are very easy to discern at distance therefore a similar arrangement for motorcyclists, i.e. having yellow headlights, would make them much safer at night.",
