            "background": "For families to afford a family home they invariably need to spend more than \u00a3250,000 this puts them over 1% stamp duty threshold. We believe the stamp duty charged should be on a sliding scale as with Income Tax. This would mean zero stamp duty on the first \u00a3150,000, 1% on \u00a3150,000 to \u00a3250,000, 3% on \u00a3250,000 to \u00a3500,000 then 4% for anything over \u00a3500,000. With the increase in house prices (the average house price is now over \u00a3200,000) in the last decade this sliding scale system would be a fairer policy for collecting stamp duty.",
