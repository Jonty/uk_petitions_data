            "background": "Until recent years spectators had a choice as to whether they sit or stand. Football is a passionate game, and many supporters prefer to stand, as they feel more involved, and it is more conducive to creating the unique atmosphere of British football.\n\nThe time spent on this issue by the safety authorities is out of all proportion to the risks involved, and a resolution would allow them to concentrate resources on other more pressing issues.\n\nThe Government appears unwilling to listen to reasoned argument, and although there is a very good case for the re-introduction of safe terraced areas, it appears unlikely that this will be permitted in the foreseeable future.\n\nA compromise solution based on common sense appears to be the best way forward for all concerned.",
