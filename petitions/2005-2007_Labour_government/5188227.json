        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Forget political correctness and human rights for paedophiles... If people have  inappropriate feelings for children, they should be forced to dress like very young children every day so that everybody knows what they are. Putting a tattoo on their hand saying \"can't buy or wear adult clothing\" would help to enforce it. Forcing such adults to go to work, shops etc in baby grows, nappies etc, may be a more affective deterrent... If governments passed tough laws like this, society would have more respect for politicians.",
