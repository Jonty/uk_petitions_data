        "background": "I urge the Prime Minister to scrap the chaotic MTS interview system which threatens the careers of so many young doctors and review the Modernising Medical Careers system, which makes training to become a specialist in any field of medicine so competitive that too many doctors will NOT be trained, and many might leave the country all together leaving the UK again short of doctors. We need to INCREASE the number of training places to avoid leaving many disillusioned doctors, who have so far invested time, money and hard work in the UK, many with little prospect of return.",
