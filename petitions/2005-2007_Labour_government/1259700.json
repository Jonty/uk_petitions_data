            "background": "The immigrants we had previously from the commonwealth were welcomed because they had parts of our culture and were skilled, unlike the EU. The EU immmigrants may be skilled but they do not have our culture and its destroying the British culture, and if the goverment is not carefull their may be a revolution in the UK at this rate. I suggest we only have immigration not from the commonwealth but commonwealth realms, this would be a great success as they all speak english, are all world advanced nations, all have our monarchy as theirs. The commonwealth real includes nations like Australia, canada, New zealand est. So lets end this insulting immigration from the EU which is killing our country and welcome back the commonwealth immigrants.",
