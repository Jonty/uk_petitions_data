        "background": "If all the repeat offenders were sent to national service instead of prison they would actually learn a lesson or two and sort out thier ways. In prison they most likely keep their head down and wait for the time to come when the leave the prison. On the other hand they could not just keep thier head down because everyone is will get hassle in the basic training. After thier national service has expired people were repeat offenders will have usually learnt a few lessons (respect being a main one) and will be better citizens because of it. Some people may like it that they stay on in the military. This is also a good way of keeping up numbers in the military.",
