            "background": "I read in my paper that far too many pensioners who are entitled to Pension Credit are deciding not to claim it because it is seen as demeaning and begging for charity; they also say that the questions asked when they do try to claim it are too intrusive.  I believe every pensioner who needs Pension Credit should be able to claim it without having to go through this; it's hardly a fortune and anyone whose income is less than the amount of it must be living in penury.",
