Last year with the help of The People Millions we got over 5,600 votes to win \u00a350k along with other substantail funds we now have enough to install the Multi Use Games Aarea and Children's Foundation Area - However our planning application has been deferred until a site visit can be made - the deffering of the project may in fact halt the project as we are on a tight time schedule and may lose the funding.  It would be a shame to lose this fantastic opportunity for our children",
