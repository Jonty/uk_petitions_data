        "background": "you see it every day, you walk down the street and there are massive signs exclaiming \"50% off now only 49.99.\" I feel that it is an unfair attempt to use psychological techniques to make us buy the shop's products. A common practice of a company is to raise its price for a short time and then claim they have cut the price. The law should be changed so that they can only advertise their price cuts for as long as the previous price was in use. this would then stop any of these unfair claims.",
