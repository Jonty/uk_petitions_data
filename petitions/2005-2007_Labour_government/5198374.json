        "background": "Ireland introduced the plastic bag levy back in 2002 and has since reduced the number of plastic bags used by 90%.  In addition to this the money raised has been fed back into environmental projects.  By introducing a similar levy we could reduce the number of plastic bags being disposed of in landfills and fund more environmental projects to help  keep England green.",
