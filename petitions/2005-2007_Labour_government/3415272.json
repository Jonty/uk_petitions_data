            "action": "Provide nationwide free training and assistance with implementation of the Eurocodes to all members of the professional institutions. Extend the co-existence period of BS's and Eurocodes to a sensible minimum of 10 years,say. Allow the continued use indefinitely of British Standards for UK local engineering designs.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The withdrawal of British Standards and their replacement in 2010 with Eurocodes, will cost industry dearly. This is a politically driven agenda and not widely supported in the UK engineering community. (Other than those that have a vested interest in supporting the implementation). If Eurocodes are to be forced upon us, then could we at least have financial assistance with e.g. training. There should be a generous period of co-existence before complete withdrawal of British Standards, and preferably British standards should be maintained for those that wish to use them when designing UK based projects.",
