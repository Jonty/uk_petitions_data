        "background": "After being told on more than 1 occassion that because i have a BFPO address and not been resident in the UK for afew years i am not eligible for credit/bank account/loan etc.  It infuriates me to think that my husband and thousands like him are in the forces and can be sent into war situations and fight for the country but are discriminated against because computer systems do not recognise BFPO addresses as legitimate addresses. \nWhat I would like to see is proper recognition of HM forces by the way of recognising BFPO addresses and that financial institutes do not penalise those who have been posted overseas.",
