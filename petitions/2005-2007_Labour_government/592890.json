Children will be travelling to schools that could be a considerable distance from home, and siblings attending different schools some distance from each other.Also, it will have a negative effect on the community - children living the same area no going to the same schools in the area and siblings attending the same schools. Surely this government should be concentrating on improving the schools that are under performing and leaving the ones that work alone!",
