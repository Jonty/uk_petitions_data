        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Considering the A166 (York to Bridlington) road is a primary route, to have traffic-light controlled, one way at a time vehicle flow in 2007 is unacceptable.  The current bridge causes long queues even at quiet times and leads to loss of time and money for individuals and businesses alike.  Ten minutes could be taken off journey times and increase regeneration oportunities in an area which badly needs it.",
