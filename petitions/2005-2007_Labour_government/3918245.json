            "background": "A reduce in the voting age would entise more younger people in to politics. The large majority of 16 year olds are no longer influenced by the parents on how to vote they now  have there own political views. So it would benefit the younger population if they had a voice as it appears that partys want to appeal to younger voters but fail to let them have a say in who speaks for them. So lets see a change and give 16 and 17 year olds a voice.",
