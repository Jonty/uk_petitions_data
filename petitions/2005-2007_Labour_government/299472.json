            "background": "Religion, or the organised worship of a mythical deity, is not only divisive, but dangerous and frankly immoral. While this country remains a nominal 'christian' state it is making a statement that is not supported by the vast majority of the population and is actively hated by many. Including a deity in the oath of allegience or legally binding oaths is illegal under European Human Rights legislation and therefore makes them null and void, imposing religious beliefs via said oaths is also illegal. Allowing high ranking members of cults such as the C of E to comment publicly on political and social issues must also be banned, they have nothing to offer beyond their own restricted agenda and are leading people down a sectarian path that is again, immoral.\nPeople must also be allowed to publicly, and of record, disassociate themselves from any religion without let or hinderance from said religion.",
