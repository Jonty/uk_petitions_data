I have always worked up until I left my last job, I am intelligent, have various qualifications and I have been more than capable of carrying out the duties required for the jobs I have applied for.\nHowever, on far too many occasions, my interviews have been more like an interrogation as to where I'm going to park my kids off to when I go to work, and the usual what if's? \nEmployers should ask questions relevant to the job and not base their questioning on the applicants ability to find suitable childcare, nor should they use the fact that somebody has children as an excuse not to employ them.\nThis is discrimination at it's worst, because no one is able to stop these people getting away with it",
