            "background": "I would like to see the regulations on making employees redundant revised. The current minimum redundancy payment is a joke, it is a small payment compared to the time spent with a company, and on top of that it is also capped to a maximum weekly wage which is extremely low for living in 2006.\nRedundancy is becoming more common in this country as competition grows from other countries. The lack of government support in helping companies to survive (Unless well known like Rover) does not help.\nMany companies get taken over by power-hungry Americans who make the british redundant as its so much cheaper and easier to lay-off british workers.\nI am heading for my second redundancy in 5 years. The minimum payment is a joke. With the high cost of living it will not even cover 1 months rent. I am still paying for the first redundancy experience thanks to the tax credits system who helped for a few months, then decided they got it wrong and asked for the money back.",
