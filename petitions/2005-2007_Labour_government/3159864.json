            "background": "I feel that it should be compulsory that fathers names are shown on all Birth Certificates.At present only the mother can decide whether the fathers name is shown on the certificate. This is wrong, as the child has a right to know it's roots.I know from experience how awful it is not to know your parentage. It has completely ruined my life and I suspect hundreds and thousands of others too. I have never known the details who my father was as my mother to this day, will not divulge. No matter how dreadful the circumstances of my birth I feel I have a right to know. I have always felt like half a person,I hate it that others are feeling the same way!  let's do something about this.Thank You!",
