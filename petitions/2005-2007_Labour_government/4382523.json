            "background": "We as humans eat the meats of chickens, fish, cows, pigs and sheep and have plenty. I think it is just greedy to eat rabbits aswell. And they don't do anyharm and just play and don't kill anything else since they are herbivours so there is absoulutley no reason to shoot them. Some people shoot them for power and for fun which is very cruel considering your idea of fun is to kill another life. Therefore I think that killing or hunting or anything harming rabbits should be banned.",
