The children and their mother Jannatal, 41, have now been told they will be deported within three days after immigration officers raided their home in Liverpool at 6am. Last night, Mrs Chowdhury wept as she spoke of their ordeal from the room where she and her children are being detained. \u201cWe are so scared, said 41-year-old university graduate Mrs Chowdhury. \u201cI want to kill myself but I know I have to be strong for the children.\u201cThey put us in a van, it was like a prison van with bars, and they brought us here. My children think they are in jail but they haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201cWe can\u2019t go back to Bangladesh, it\u2019s impossible for us to survive there alone. There is no-one to protect us. I\u2019m very afraid for their safety.\u201dTwo years ago, Mrs Chowdhury\u2019s husband, Nauchad, died of a heart attack, aged just 43.\n\nPlease help us keep this lovely family here.",
