            "background": "We consider it unfair that a person who has had a clean driving record for many years should be penalised for a moment's inattention and prosecuted as though they were careless drivers.\n\nWe ask the government to introduce a system similar to that used by insurance companies for \"No Claims\". A driver who has had no driving offences for a period of 10 years would be entitled to one minor (note: MINOR) speeding offence which would incur only a warning.\n\nAdditional periods of 10 years safe driving would accumulate additional \"bonuses\".\n\nWe believe that this would be a popular decision and would also help to alleviate the perception that speed cameras are being used as a means of generating revenue.",
