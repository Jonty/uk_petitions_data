Most of the tyres are like new and some ARE new.\nWhen I asked about these tyres I was informed that they would be sold on.\nThe new tyres have been fitted on the spare wheel and NEVER been on the road but some body in their wisdom decides that it is no longer fit for purpose. I suspect this is not unique to the police service and that it affects all emergency/government service vehicles.\nWhen will this waste end?",
