            "background": "Anyone who's tried to buy tickets for a concert or high-demand sporting event over the past couple of years will have found that they sell out seconds after the tickets are launched - and within minutes there are tickets on e-bay for 2 or 3 times the list price, and other websites (lastminute.com, double8.com for example) offering tickets with sometimes up to \u00a3200 commission. We request some legislation to allow genuine fans to buy tickets to events at the asking price and not be forced to miss out or pay exorbitant fees to online touts.",
