            "background": "Since the introduction of \u201cDecriminalised Parking Enforcement\" many local authorities are using Parking Attendants as a way of generating extra income from the motorist. Parking Attendants are not employed to service the local community and to ensure the flow of traffic in city centers, they are merely walking cash machines waiting to pounce on you because you are 5 minutes late returning from a shopping trip, miss read a sign, or parked on yellow lines which have been in place for many years and no longer serve there purpose of road safety. We need to bring back common sense and rid our streets of these quota filling nuisances. This is yet another \u201cstealth tax\u201d on the innocent motorist.",
