            "background": "Third Party Top up fees are a dubious way of saving the social services money and they also maximise the Care homes profits. Care homes use a top fee to pressure a family to pay the top up fee by using the threat to move their relative out if the family cannot pay. This adds up to emotional blackmail of a families that feel guilty about putting their loved ones in a care home. Homes that don't charge the fee are usually the ones with a poor reputation, thus families are forced to pay this profit lead fee to make sure their loved ones are living in a decent care home for the rest of their final years.",
