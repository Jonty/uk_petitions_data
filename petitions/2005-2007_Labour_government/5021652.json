        "background": "Given the recent outpouring of xenophobic sentiment on the numerous internet forums dedicated to the Eurovision Song Contest (including the BBC messageboard), it is felt that the current system of televoting encourages people to vote for songs based on their country of origin or ancestry, or other factors rather than the quality of the song itself. This is leading to a high level of mistrust of newer Eurovision countries (mainly in the East) among people in Western Europe. A full or partial return to the jury system would help to alleviate these feelings, creating a fairer contest and promoting the initial idea behind Eurovision, i.e. unity and harmony between nations.",
