        "background": "By providing cheap and efficent park and ride schemes to all major towns and cities we can ease traffic congestion and make our towns and cities safer places to visit. It should therefore be a legal requirement that this facility is provided. It is also crucial that the charge is levied per car NOT per passenger. If not it can still be cheaper to park in the town or city if you have more than one person travelling in the car. Lets all get this right now! Sign up to indicate your support!",
