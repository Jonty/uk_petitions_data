            "background": "Road building policy in Britain seems to favour roundabouts on main roads. This is surely bad for a number of reasons, and is surely based on a short term budget than a long term budget.\n\nIf main roads were built/altered to include 'flyovers' or 'underpasses' at interchanges, this would in the short term cost more, but in the long term cost considerably less due to the following:\n\ni) Considerably less accidents/collisions/loss of life caused by the interaction of traffic.\n\nii) Considerably less cost to the tax payer from emergency service call outs to the above.\n\niii) Very large savings on fuel, emmisions and a saving to the environment due to the traffic not having to continually vary speed.\n\niv) A greatly reduced level of cogestion, as there would be less bunching of traffic on the main through road. i.e. imagine having to stop at each junction on a motorway to negotiate a roundabout?",
