Conveniently these heavy handed tactics do not extend to the vast untaxed wealth of international tax avoiders, but instead are only used against individuals and small businesses, who often cannot afford the time or legal representation to argue against the unfettered demands of overzealous tax inspectors, whose performance related pay is now linked to how much extra in taxes/fines they can squeeze out of us.",
