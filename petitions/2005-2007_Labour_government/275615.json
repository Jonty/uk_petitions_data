            "background": "Mr Coke was involved in a charity race car incident on the 3rd Dec.  He sustained a broken hip and two broken ribs.  He had to go to Oxford for an operation.  Ipswich Hos, refused to pay for it and so did Oxford hospital, so he was left for two weeks whilst they argued.  Eventually Mr Coke had to pay for his own operation - \u00a310,000, he has had to borrow this from his employers.  He should be reimbursed and compensated.  He was lied to at the hospital and made to pay or face another 6 weeks at least before funding would be available.  The operation was longer and more complex due to the length of time he was left without treatment.  Do all sporting injuries get the same treatment?",
