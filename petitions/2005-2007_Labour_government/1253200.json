        "background": "It is a folly to suggest that the extra money raised by the increase in APD will be used successfully to tackle global warming. It will not deter people from flying, rather this is just a further tax rise that the already tax burdened British public will have to swallow. Revert back to the previous (high) level and rethink the strategy on global warming.",
