        "background": "Hello how are you today?\n\nThe reason that I have started this petition is to raise awareness that I am after at least a 25 hour contract or a full-time paid job in Youth Work. I have and still am trying to get a paid job in Youth Work. I have had interviews but I have not got the job sadly. I have been trying for about one and a half years now. I cannot apply to my local Council because they are under going a HUGE restructure and people are losing jobs etc. I am currently enhancing my knowledge through a university course in Hull, and i am going to be doing the DEGREE course in September 2007. (I am studying in my home town because I cannot afford to go out of town to another university because of tuition fees and cost of living and I don't want to get into debt. Nevertheless, that's another matter) \n\nI have been volunteering in a local Youth Centre for about one and a half years as well. I have undergone lot's of training courses etc but I cannot seem to get a job. I am a well loved volunteer and i get on well with my peers, Young People and other members of staff.\n\nPlease help me to get a full-time paid job so I can help others not just now but in the longer term as well. Please help.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nWayne Beacock",
