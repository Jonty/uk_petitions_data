There is no practical alternative available for their journey.\n\n2. Their employment conditions demand that they travel during peak hours.\n\n3. The costs associated with public transport are prohibitive.\n\nUntil the public transport system in this country meets the needs of people living outside of major centres the issue of road pricing should not be considered.",
