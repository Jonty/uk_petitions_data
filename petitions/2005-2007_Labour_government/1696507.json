We desire an England manager that will endeavour to inspire our nation through instilling in the team the importance of playing stimulating and exciting football, a manager that will step outside the box and pick players on their current form and influential ability not the same old faces. If the FA won\u2019t listen to the fans of English football then we hope the prime minister will. Steve Maclaren should be sacked as England manager ASAP!",
