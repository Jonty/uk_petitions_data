        "background": "In recent years, the Ministry of Defence has been exposed as a \"decomposing\" institution. All citizens who live near military areas will know about the inexcusible state of the armed forces. The Ministry of Defence needs to be greatly reformed and/or reinvented along with a much larger budget for the purchasing of new and better equiptment along with refurbishing of some military bases. The gist of this petition is to ensure Britain's security and ensure the might of Britains defence is not lost because of underfunding and poor management.",
