            "background": "Below the Wallace Monument on Wolfscraig near Stirling (one of Scotland's great landmarks and architectural gems) should be found a tranquil barren landscape, as was there when the monument was constructed. Yet every visitor to the monument has to pass a poorly executed, graphically violent, vandalised and caged statue based on the Hollywood star Mel Gibson's portrayal of William Wallace in the popular film Braveheart. Obviously, this cheapens the memorial to Wallace, and the graphic depiction of a severed head is sure to traumatise small children. While Wallace's love of his country should be celebrated, his violence against his country's southern neighbours should not be commemorated in this way. Both the area's tourism prospects and the memory of William Wallace would be best served by the removal and possible destruction of this shabby object.",
