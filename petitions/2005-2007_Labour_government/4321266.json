            "background": "Due to the increasingly lacklustre performances, the lack of imagination & confidence in him by the nation I propose to sack him & replace him with Terry Venables (in the short term) until the nation has decided on a suitable replacement. His obvious lack of experience & positional sense has cost the nation heavily in it's pride. This replacement has to be in place before England take to the Euro 2008. A successful campaign will help the England 2018 campaign no end.\nI also propose to shave the thinning hair from the front of his head to make him look more like Sven, seeing as he seems to take the same uninspiring decisions.",
