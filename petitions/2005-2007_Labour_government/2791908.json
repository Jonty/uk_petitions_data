        "action": "ensure that Ofcom refuses to give permission for Sky's current attempt to remove its 3 Free to Air Channels Sky Three, Sky News and Sky Sports News, currently available to watch in over 8 million UK homes, from Freeview and to replace them instead with pay to view sports and movie channels only likely to be watched in a few hundred thousand UK homes.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Sky's decision to withdraw its 3 free to air channels from Freeview appears to be part of a quite deliberate strategy to devalue the choice of channels on offer on Freeview so it ultimately only provides an extended multi channel tv range from just the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Five, thereby ensuring UK homes who want to watch other channels feel pressurised to sign up to pay tv services such as Sky Digital. The widening of Free to Air television choice on Freeview has been enormously popular with the public and for Ofcom to allow valuable and extremely limited bandwidth currently used by Freeview channels to be converted for pay tv would be a clear cut dereliction by Ofcom of its principal duty to protect UK citizen consumers. Allowing Sky to offer a pay tv service on digital terrestrial is also likely to constitute an anti competitive threat to the fledgling efforts of its smaller pay sports tv rival Setanta to offer a single pay per view sports tv channel on digital terrestrial.",
