        "background": "this is what he has done \n\nNorth Wales Police has unveiled photographs of a decapitated biker in its latest anti-speeding campaign.\n\nThe image showed the man\u2019s head with his eyes still open lying on a grass verge. In another shot the torso is embedded into a car.\n\nNorth Wales Police Chief Superintendent Geraint Anwyl said the head was torn off by the force of the impact, he explained: \u201cHis oxygenated brain went flying down the road for 50 metres, before he expired. It\u2019s horrific, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree.\u201d\n\n\n\nNorth Wales Police Chief Richard Brunstrom said excessive speed caused the accident. Brunstrom said: \u201cWe did it to serve a purpose. The images are there to make an impact today.\u201d\n\nHowever, Brunstrom also confirmed that the families of the dead men were not aware the images were being used in the presentation. The identities of the victims were not given however the details of a distinctive T-shirt worn by the motorcyclist was shown with the slogan: \u201cPiss off and catch some real criminals\u201d.\n\n\nhe should be taken to task for this totally sick and outragous stunt , as it has said above the family was not even asked if the pictures could be used",
