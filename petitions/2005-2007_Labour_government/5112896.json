            "background": "I ask the government to help the authorities to increase public awareness of 419 scams which (as of 1995) had taken over 2.5 Billion pounds. You can imagine the huge amounts that the scams take now, as the internet is expanding with access  to more and more possible victims. People need to know of the dangers, both to their wallets,a and their safety as these scams are run by dangerous criminals. 419s have been going on since the 1980s and live strong today - not enough is done by authorities.\n\nI also ask that those who try to combat the scams are properly supported, by a government agency, to which they can easily submit details (as well as correspondences) of scammers for investigation.\n\nThere should also be easy safe access for the public to report information of emails they receive.\n\nThese scams are a huge danger to the British public, and it is partly the responsibility of the government to protect the public, the possible victims of this multi-billion pound organised crime.",
