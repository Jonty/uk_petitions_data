            "background": "As a former DSA assessor with a physical disability of my own, I was staggered by the number of students who had no history of dyslexia at school, but would at university, would \u201cbecome\u201d dyslexic and use DSA to get 1000's of \u00a3s worth of computer equipment & specialist tuition (at \u00a360 apx per hour) which would be provided by the university and charged to the student\u2019s local authority\u2026 A few of this students who I assessed had a history of dyslexia and were genuine, but a lot were not. The few genuine ones could have benefited from other forms of support too. \n\nI call upon the PM to give more literacy support and perhaps a low cost AlphaSmart or DANA laptop to genuine dyslexic students, and take them out of the \u201cdisabled\u201d label. The money saved from not giving DSA to \u201cnon disabled students\u201d could better support disabled students who can us  higher education as a spring board into a career that gets them out of the benefits system. Surely this is why DSA was set up?",
