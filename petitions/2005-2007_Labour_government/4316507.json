            "background": "Diabetes is an increasing epidemic, in the long term it would be cheaper to increase funding to look at ways of curing or failing that finding more long term treatments for sufferers of diabetes, not only does diabetes drain resources but the complications due to diabetes also drains resources, it also causes a great deal of suffering for those with diabetes and their families. We can spend ridiculous amounts of money sending soldiers to kill and die in iraq... but we cant spend ridiculous amounts of money funding research into curing a disease that left unchecked could become one of the most widespread problems the world has known. What is this world coming to?",
