            "background": "For many years, the plight of the badger has been overlooked.  In old age, many badgers find it difficult pay for proper healthcare, simply because they are not given access to free prescriptions.\nMany people are not aware of the unfairness of this situation - for example, squirrels get free prescriptions from 3 years old.\nPlease sign my petition.",
