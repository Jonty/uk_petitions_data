Historically, its list of recommended viewing items was interspersed with occasionally amusing contributions from its readers. I never got anything published in the TVARG, but I still hope that, maybe one day, I can make someone chuckle with a tale about how I got irresponsibly drunk one night and woke up the next morning  with a badger nibbling my earlobe, or some other such shenanigens, while said reader serches for something to watch on the TV in the hope that it might ease the soul-destroying existential agony of modern Britain.",
