            "background": "Currently members of the public can burn any materials they wish including toxic materials under the banner of a domestic garden bonfire and so long as they do not have a bonfire too frequently, there is nothing that the Environmental Health can do to stop them. Surely the EH can be given more powers to prevent the public from burning anything other than true garden waste under this bannner. If it can be done to prevent Commercial premises burning putrid smelling waste then I don't see too much of a problem extending their powers to Domestic premises as well? Please help by signing this petition.",
