        "background": "Stop making policies which hit hardest those who live outside of cities.  All Transport, Education, Law & Health polices, are aimed at City dwellers and hit everyone else hard in their pocket.  We dont have the same infrastructures, no public transport, only one hospital to choose from, less children in our schools making many new initiatives unaffordable. No police available as they're off in the cities and large towns. We pay as much in PAYE taxes more Council Tax for less services and more on fuel tax as we have no alternative but to drive.  So please stop making all your policies solely for the benefit of the city dwellers and start thnking about the less urban areas and how we have to live before you hammer us with more taxes.",
