        "background": "Over the past few years the Prime Minister has awarded knighthoods to outstanding British musicians, Sir, Paul, Sir Elton & Sir Mick. I feel that Eric Clapton should join this illustrious company. For 45 years Eric has been at the forefront of British popular music & is widely acknowledged to be the the world's finest guitarist. He has overcome many personal problems that may have overwhelmed others. Combined with his work in setting up the Crossroads charity, I feel that Eric is a prime candidate to receive this honour",
