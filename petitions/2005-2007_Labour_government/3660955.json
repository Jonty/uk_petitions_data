            "background": "The existing rate relief is 50% for business premises with a rateable value of \u00a314,999 or less. \nBusiness Centres  are designed for small businesses to grow. For example a printer might start working in a unit with a rateable vale of \u00a34,000 and is granted 50% rate relief. If he then grows his business and requires an additional unit within the same Business Centre that has a rateable value of \u00a32,200, he will loose the 50% relief because the additional unit is greater than \u00a32,199 even though the total Rateable value is less then \u00a314,999.\n\nThe relief should be given regardless of the number of units (rooms) the business occupies within a Business Centre if the total rateable value is still \u00a314,999 or less",
