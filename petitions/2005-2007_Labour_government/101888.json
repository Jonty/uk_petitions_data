        "background": "The rheumatology and dermatology clinics are currently provided by Newham University Hospital Trust and are funded by Newham Primary Care Trust. They are currently reviewing a plan under the Government's new initiative to bring services in the community. Hospital bosses have not yet decided what the new scheme will be just as yet but it could mean patients would have to travel further for appointments, see different specialists and consultants, and make more than one trip for routine tests, i.e. blood tests, X-rays. They seem to be forgetting about the nature of the diseases people are being treated for at the rheumatology clinic. Many patients have different forms of arthritis and it can be crippling and debilitating. Having to see different specialists that do not know the patient is not going to benefit the service user. It would only make it more difficult for them to receive the same treatment. This new initiative is not going to benefit patients.",
