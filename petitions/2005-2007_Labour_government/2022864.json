            "background": "We all understand that tax is a necessary instrument of government - and income has to be raised in a variety of ways.\nHowever, the current level of inheritance tax exemption is unfair as most estates of homeowners are liable for this tax (even if this is delayed for the spouse exemption). It cannot be right that the original intention of this taxation was to tax almost every homeowner's family by 40%. With current property prices remaining high, the inheritance which young families will often need to even get onto the housing ladder, is being unfairly taxed.\nIf, like me, you feel that you believe in progressive taxation, but that this needs to be kept in line with changes in society and wealth overall, please sign this petition.",
