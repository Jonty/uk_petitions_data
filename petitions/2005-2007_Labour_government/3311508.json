            "background": "An 'English Parliament' is, at first glance, an attractive idea. This apparently would molify English people discontented by the unfairness of Scottish MPs voting on legislation affecting only England. \nBut this will just put another layer of expense, bureaucracy and law-making on the overburdened taxpayer. Better would be to abolish the Scottish Parliament. This institution costs all the taxpayers of Britain fantastic sums of money. The benefits of the Scottish Parliament to the people of Scotland are debateable. Also abolish The Welsh Assembly and The Ulster Assembly as well for similar reasons. The people of Ulster are heartily sick of their home grown politicians so this would do them a favour.\nWe can thus return to the time honoured tradition of the entire country being governed from Westminster - less confusing and less expensive.\nAbsolute acres of money would be saved, life will be simpler, and the people will be happier.",
