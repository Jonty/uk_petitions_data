We can only drive one car at any given time. If enough roads are built to cover this, then, providing the population is kept broadly the same, there will be enough room for all the motorists cars. \n\nIt could be as simple as widening every motorway by one lane (still keep a hard shoulder). After all it is hardly as if the ground beside a motorway is a rich rain forrest of area of natural beauty since there is already a motorway next to it!",
