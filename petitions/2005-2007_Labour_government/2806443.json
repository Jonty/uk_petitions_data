        "action": "Change the law to ensure it is the norm for there to be joint custody when parents divorce/separate",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "At present the law favours women in terms of custody of children, taking it as the norm that children remain with the mother. I feel this breaches human rights and equal opportunity laws discriminating against the rights of children and men. In many European countries the norm is joint custody by law. If the UK law were reversed and men were the beneficiaries then I am certain womens' lobbists would decry this as sexual discrimination. We are often told Fathers are equal parents when referrring to financial responsibilities but this is also the case in terms of emotional development for children. As such they deserve equal footing with mothers. Men and women are supposed to be treated with equality for employment, education and criminal law and women's rights are protected by UK, European and Interantional law as well as a host of campaigners. Should not family law then provide for the same equal treatment regardless of gender?",
