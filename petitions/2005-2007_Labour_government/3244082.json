        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The property tax proposed to be introduced into England and already in place in Northern Ireland is an intrusion into the personal privacy of individuals who out of already taxed income  chose to improve their homes and gardens and generally increase the local amenity well being. The creation of inspectors with rights of access is an intrusion into an Englishman's home. The position of a home in any area already determins its market value and the stamp duty tax paid if over a certain threshold. The proposals are likely to encourage run down and poorly maintained properties and thus lead to a decline in standards of living and of neighbourhood values.",
