If you have a dispute with your builder, the NHBC can step in to arbitrate but they are paid for by the builders(about 10% of your house price goes to them).\nHouses can be handed over from the builders with hundreds of defects and getting them rectified can take months/years. You have more consumer rights buying a tin of beans from your supermarket. I petition the Government to introduce a government regulator to oversee this industry.",
