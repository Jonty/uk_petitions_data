            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Britain has only eight public holidays per annum whereas some of our European partners have up to twelve. To introduce two further such days would therefore bring us up to ten. I suggest that the first should be in the period between New Year's Day and Easter and the second between the August Bank Holiday and Christmas. This would then reduce the long periods where there isn't one at the moment. I would therefore further suggest one should be a Monday in February, nearest to Shrove Tuesday or that day itself and the second the last Monday in October, when school children are normally on holiday.",
