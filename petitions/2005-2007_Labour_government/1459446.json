            "background": "Now that the application fee is rising to \u00a3245 through no fault of the industry employees, I think now is the time to abolish a certain security governing body and find a new regulatory body to govern the industry. I think that another \u00a3245 on top of your course fees (\u00a3200 upwards) is too much, it doesnt even guarantee you your licence. If you agree, please, You know what to do.",
