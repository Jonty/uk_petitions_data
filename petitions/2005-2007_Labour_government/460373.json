        "action": "Scrap all existing taxes and replace with the Sales Tax",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The existing taxation system destroys family life by putting undue strains on an average family finance. Council Tax, TV Licence, Road Tax not to mention all the other taxes presently in place. All these taxes have separate administrations controlling the collection and monitoring. The cost to the taxpayer and the stress and strain it places on both business and private lives is incredible and over complicated. If you take the total turnover of all UK business and use a basic multiple of 20% you raise the same amount of revenue for the government as all the other systems put together. Why is this issue avoided as it would reduce the staggering cost of central administration and remove a lot of taxes that cause such political scandals.\n\nThe sales tax could replace Council Tax, Business Rates, TV Licence, Income Tax, Corporation Tax, VAT, Capital Gains Tax, Inheritance Tax, Savings Tax, Stamp Duty and National Insurance just to name a few.",
