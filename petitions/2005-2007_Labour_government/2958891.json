            "background": "Much money has been spent on a minority road user group, to provide them with protected and segregated cycle paths, at no specific cost to that group, who frequently ignore cycle way directions and traffic law instructions. Enforce cycle way use where provided, make cycle user insurance compulsory, if only for their own protection. So many cycle verses car incidents are down to inattentive and ignorant cyclists. Cycle use on the highway should be regulated, cycle lane use should be compulsory and cyclists should contribute to the costs of providing that facility.",
