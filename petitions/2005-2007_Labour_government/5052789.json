            "background": "The recent widespread coverage of Prince Harry's possible deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan has highlighted a serious problem with our media culture. The constant reporting of details of possible deployments only serve to make him and his division more of a target, should they make the battlefield. I petition for there to be a law preventing the reporting of any details of Royals in active service, thus allowing them to disappear into the system, with the exception of public events such as parades. This would allow them to serve as any other serviceman would, and protect members of their regiment from becoming increased targets in the battlefield.",
