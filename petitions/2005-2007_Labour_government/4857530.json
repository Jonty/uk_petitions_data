            "background": "Current measures to dissuade motorists from using large vehicles (including 4x4s) have concentrated on increasing excise duty.  This is not effective for the wealthier sections of the community, who are just the people who are most likely to want to drive these vehicles. Reducing speed limits would be a massive disincentive, while not much affecting the few people who have a genuine need for this type of vehicle (for example farmers).  There is precedent for differential speed limits, goods vehicles and vehicles towing trailers already have lower limits.",
