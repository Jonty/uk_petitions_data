            "background": "Foreign registered cars that are driven in the UK for more than 3 months should be charged a 'UK Highways Tax' and should be able to demonstrate that they have a roadworthy car (via an MOT type test) and valid insurance.\n\nIt appears there is an increasing number of foreign registered cars that have owners resident in the UK. Whilst these drivers have free use of the highway, to date no contribution towards the upkeep of the highways has been levied. \n\nIn addition there is no assurance that these cars are roadworthy or appropriately insured when they enter the country.\n\nIt is recommended that a process be installed that ensures drivers with a frequent use of the British road network can demonstrate that their cars are in a road worthy condition (just as British drivers need to) and that these drivers contribute financially to the upkeep of the British road network.\n\nUpon entry to the UK drivers from overseas also need to be able to present suitable insurance provision.",
