        "background": "The BBC prides itself on an ability to communicate with those who fund it, and the messageboard service is key to that.  It allows them to review raw data and it allows us the chance to discuss a large variety of topics, from TV to the willingness of government to protect licence fee payers rights.  \n\nNow though, that ability is being curtailed with no consultation, with no consideration and with no courtesy.  The Radio 2 \u2018Coffee Lounge\u2019 is just the latest in a long line of board closures, where vibrant communities have sprung up, each with their own character and each of vital importance to those who use them.  \u2018Points Askew\u2019 was another which was skewered.\n\nWe urge the Prime Minister to compel the BBC to realise that the many thousands who use it's messageboards are at least as important as those who they waste money on, in inflated celebrity salaries.\n\nMore info at:\n\nhttp://www.mfbb.net/speakerscorner/speakerscorner-forum-26.html",
