The government\u2019s aim of improving the overall skills level of the UK workforce is laudable but it will not be achieved by keeping disaffected young people in school by an act of compulsion.\n\nThose who wish to continue their education have plentiful opportunities and, through Educational Maintenance Allowances, financial inducements.  Those who reject these opportunities and inducements clearly do so because they are not motivated to continue.  Motivation to learn will not come by legal compulsion.  If compulsion is introduced, schools, colleges and training providers will become institutions forced to offer worthless  and wasteful time-serving.",
