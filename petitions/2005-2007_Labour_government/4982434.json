        "background": "It has long been known that the rampant deforestation causes many ecological changes, and is a major contribution to climate change. It is felt that the government could put pressure on countries that turn a blind eye to this and allow unacceptable levels by plancing an import tax - similar to the air fare tax - on all items imported that use materials from such countries until such time as their deforestation is controlled and within acceptable limits and balances by re-forestation.",
