            "background": "Litter is a serious problem.  One method of combatting litter is a refundable tax on drinks containers; this has been introduced in several countries including Germany(where it is called the \"Dosenpfand\"), Sweden, Norway, Denmark and several US states.  Under this scheme, an extra charge is introduced on drinks cans and bottles, but this extra charge can be refunded by returning the empty container to a shop.  This places an incentive on the consumer both not to litter and to pick up litter that they may find in the street.  Introducing a similar scheme in Britain could do much to improve the littered streets of the country.  It can also encourage recycling.",
