            "background": "There are only around 26,000 commercial airliners in service yet they produce around 3% of all world greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, much of their pollution occurs in sensitive higher layers of the atmosphere such as the ozone layer.\n\nA tax on aviation fuel will inspire the rapid development of more efficient engines. Since there are only 26,000 aeroplanes it will be relatively rapid and straightforward to install this new technology, and make a real difference very quickly. This one step can lead in the direction of a 3% reduction in global CO2 emissions. It will also raise funds now to pay for other global warming mitigation measures later.\n\nCurrently UK motorists must pay tax on their fuel. Airline companies do not, yet both pollute. This is unjust. Let the polluters pay.",
