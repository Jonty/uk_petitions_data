            "background": "The lack of affordable housing is a major challenge facing Britain, particularly for the younger generation. More and more families are finding they are having to spend more time working and less time with their children just to pay off the mortgage. This situation needs to be redressed. A major obstacle to addressing this problem and allowing people to take control over their housing are the planning laws that make it very difficult for people to build their own houses. In Australia, where planning permission is much easier to obtain, it is considerably easier to build one's own house which, including the purchase of land, can be done starting from around \u00a3120,000. Changing the planning laws to allow people to purchase more land and build their own houses at a much CHEAPER cost than buying an existing property needs to be given serious consideration if we want to solve the problem of unaffordable housing.",
