He has become an auto didact of considerable accomplishment and acclaim.\nStan Tracey has demonstrated beyond doubt or reproach the ability to transcend poverty, lack of formal education, addiction and develop his gifts into their fullest expression. He remains a modest  and dedicated family man, and is an example to all. He is a model of resolution, contribution and artistic excellence on a par with the highest levels of achievement in the arts and sciences in our culture.",
