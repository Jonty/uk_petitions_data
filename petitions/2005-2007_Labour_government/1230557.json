However it must not be forgotten the damage Badgers do to wildlife, most especially ground nesting birds. They are also detrimental to conservation work and recently cost an alleged \u00a389,000 to re-home when undermining a road. It could have been carried out quickly and effectively by a licensed Culler for a lot less than that.",
