            "background": "Until the sight-saving drugs Lucentis and Macugen are approved by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, it is up to individual Primary Care Trusts to decide whether to fund them.\nThis means many people who need treatment for the wet form of age-related macular degeneration are missing out or paying thousands to receive it privately. This petition aims to bring pressure on Devon Primary Care Trust to make the drugs more readily available on the NHS.",
