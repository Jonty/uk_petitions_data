        "background": "Many people retire to St Andrews because they get cheap golf with a St Andrews address. This is not extended to people physically born in the town who have been forced out by ever increasing house prices (which are fuelled by people retiring for the golf or for use as an HMO). The law should be changed to allow those born in the town access to this privilege if they so wish.",
