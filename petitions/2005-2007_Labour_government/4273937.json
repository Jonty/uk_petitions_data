            "background": "Replace unemployment benefit with a universal tax credit for all adults not in education or retirement and allow any money earnt to be kept by those who earn it (minus tax at an appropriate level as at present).\nCurrently, unemployed people can face marginal tax rates of 100% (through loss of benefits) or more if they work. This creates the poverty trap and fuels the black economy. It also creates an underclass \u2013 the benefit class \u2013 that live at the edge of or outside the rules of normal society in a culture of crime and drugs.\nIt took a decade (the 1980s) to establish this culture contained in the remaining council estate ghettoes of poverty and it could take another decade to dismantle it. But doing so would mean the government really was being tough on the causes of crime as well as on crime itself.",
