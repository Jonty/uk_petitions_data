        "background": "Plastic bottles take 1000's of years to degrade and are a major contributor to the UK's fast-growing litter problem. I hate it with a passion and wish, as a nation, people would be prepared to accept for a few minor inconveniences for an improved living environment.\nSo, imagine what would happen if you got (say) 50 p for each plastic bottle returned?\na) Far fewer would be dropped in the first place.\nb) Current litter would be picked up and returned for the deposit.\nThis idea has the advantage of not costing the consumer anything-just take the bottle back to any shop and you get your money back!!!",
