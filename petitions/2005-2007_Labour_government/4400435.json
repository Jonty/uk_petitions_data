            "background": "Some companies are still failing to meet their duties under this law.  Individuals making complaints are often answered politely but no changes are made and the individual is left with the option of allowing the company to continue to ignore their needs or to seek legal advice which can be costly.\n\nI would like to see a task force/adjudicator appointed to and check that companies are complying with the act and investigate complaints made under the DDA.  I would like them to have powers over all sectors covered by the DDA and have powers to issue fines and order compensation payments.  This would remove the burden from the individual and ensure that the requirements of the act are met for the benefit of all disabled people.",
