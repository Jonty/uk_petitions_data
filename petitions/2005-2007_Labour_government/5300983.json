        "background": "In order to achieve route schedule targets, london transport buses are delivering an appalling service to the very public they are suppose to offer!, ie; not stopping at bus stops, not allowing passengers to leave the bus at desired stop, ignoring complaints made by the public in regards to this problem and often ignoring requests to be let on or off a bus! Although complaints are placed through the appropriate channels this problem continues on a wide scale daily basis often resulting in extremly frustrated and angry customers.",
