            "background": "We call for you to tax major retailers as about 80% of our waste could be reused or recycled. Most will agree that it is plastic packaging that makes up for the bulk of our household waste. \n\nIreland introduced a tax on carrier bags back in 2002 and it has reduced bag use by over 90%. \n\nSo why do we not introduce it here and take it further so that all retailers will have to pay a tax on packaging? It is about time that the major retailers are forced to make a real difference to what is unnecessarily produced and ultimately ends up in a landfill for centuries. \n\nThe tax should pay for environmental projects around the country and not into the chancellor's pocket. \n\nThe U.K. Could lead the way for much needed environmental reform.",
