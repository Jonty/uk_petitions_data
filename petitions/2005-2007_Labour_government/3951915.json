            "background": "The aims of the EU ban are laudable, but in practice many aspects have been overlooked.  Politicians must incentivise or demand that industry  find solutions to the following issues BEFORE introducing a ban on incandescent bulbs, or find different ways to achieve the planned energy reductions.  The issues are: 1) The total cost to the economy and the environment of replacing light fittings that will be unusable with low energy bulbs. 2) Permitting use of dimmer switches. 3) Long startup times which will increase accidents - especially among the elderly and the young - and encourage lights to be left on for extended periods. 4) Light quality & brightness - an issue the German Chancellor acknowledges and one that may cause long term health and psychological issues, especially during wintertime. 5) Aesthetics - both of the bulbs and the tone of the light produced 6) Effective disposal of low energy bulbs without environmental impact due to mercury content. 7) Embedded ceiling lights.",
