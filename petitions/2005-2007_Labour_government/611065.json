        "background": "A system described as \"intelligent proximity analysis\" will allow valuation officials to differentiate between thousands of neighbourhoods and adjust bills accordingly. First, they want to log and record every feature of your home, from double glazing to the number of bedrooms. Next, they want clipboard-wielding bureaucrats to have the right to inspect your home. And with that, householders will face fines of a \u00a31000 and \u00a3200 every day after the 1st visit, for refusing to co-operate with inspectors sent round to help value their homes. We have already paid tax on our ernings, and on the products we have bought to improve our homes, and bring them up to a modern and eco friendly standard. This taxation move must be stopped now.",
