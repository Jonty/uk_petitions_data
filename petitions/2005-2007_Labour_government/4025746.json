PEOPLE IN STABLE RELATIONSHIPS, WORKING, OR WITHOUT CHILDREN SHOULD NOT BE PUT AT A DISADVANTAGE IN EVERY GOVERNMENT SYSTEM.  TAXES SHOULD BE MORE LENIENT ON THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO BUILD THEIR OWN FUTURES, EG. TAX BREAKS FOR GRADUATES, APPRENTICES AND THOSE IN FIRST EMPLOYMENT, ALSO FOR 1ST TIME BUYERS. STOP OVER CHARGING THE HARD WORKING TO PAY FOR EVERYONE ELSE.",
