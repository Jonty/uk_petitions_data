            "background": "I feel that we the general public are constantly ripped off, by internet sites selling tickets at several times the face value. this situation needs to stop, new laws should be established to prevent the re-sale of tickets for excessive profit. Tickets on a popular auction site are going for 4x & more their face value. People are not happy to pay this but find it impossible to obtain tickets, also the amount of tickets some of these sellers are selling appear to be excessive",
