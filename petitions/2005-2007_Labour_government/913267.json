            "background": "The current driver theory tests are purely a money making exercise. \n\nThere should be one standardised theory test which must be passed by all perspective licence holders instead of individual tests for each vehicle type (ie: Motorcycle, Car, HGV etc). \n\nPassing of this new \u2018single standardised theory test\u2019 would then enable the holder to sit the practical test for whichever type of motor vehicle they prefer and also allow them to undertake further practical tests for other types of motor vehicles (within 5 years from date of theory test pass) without the need for sitting another theory test.\nAlthough the test would probably be longer than the present testing process and marginally more expensive the overall quality and actual usefulness of the qualification would be far more beneficial to the driver and to public safety in general as it would provide a much broader scope of knowledge requirement and application.",
