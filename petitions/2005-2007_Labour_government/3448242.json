The UK being one of them. \n\nIf the USA want to carry on their pointless war-mongering then they should do it off our land and leave us to be free from their control. We are not a puppydog for the USA (although Mr Blair might disagree with me on that one) and we do NOT want their military on our soil (any more than they already are).",
