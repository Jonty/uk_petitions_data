            "background": "It is stupid teaching our children french and german as these are not world languages, the real reason our children are taught these languages is EU brainwashing. I suggest spanish and mandarin are taught so our kids have 2 options to pick from, this makes sense as nearly a whole continent (s.america) speaks spanish and centra america and it is second most popular in the U.S, and it would proberly be used as most Brits go to spain at one point in their life. Also Mandarin as it is the most spoken language in the world and will need to be spoken as china is a emerging superpower. Curently schools are independant to choose what languages they teach this isnt fair for a child from one school thats wants to learn the language being taught at another school. We need to and only two to make it fair, and if our kids are going to learn a language it should be a world spoken language unlike french, german and urdu.",
