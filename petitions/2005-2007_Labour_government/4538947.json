            "background": "Con-artists manipulate & can become very violent towards their victims, but police put a time scale on this type of crime, it can take the victim a long time before they go to the police to press charges, most of the time it's not until the victim confides in smeone that they are able to do this, even so, many victims still do not press charges & the ones who do, do not get the support they need to deal with this type of crime. There is not a time scale on other crimes, which the police feel happy to investigate, they don't like to get involved in this type of crime, which is allowing many people to get conned.",
