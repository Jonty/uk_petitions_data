Because I have a psychological issue that makes me literally terrified of the building and the people iv had some home tuition but I probably wont be able to sit my GCSE\u2019s and my dreams of gong to sixth form are shattered. The point to this petition is to get those in office to understand students who are ill and doing GCSE\u2019s do not always get the best help and support.",
