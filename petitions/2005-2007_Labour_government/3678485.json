            "background": "I myself had to pay out over \u00a3400 to go onto a course that leaded me to a degree placement.\nBecause i decided to take a year out and also as there were no courses that weren't vocational i then chose to go back to college at the age of 19. i then had to pay fees. someone who is a year younger than me can get EMA and free courses. why cant this be extended to people who did not do very well at school and wanted to get some life experience before going back to college? i understand there are funding for these people at individual colleges but the colleges DO not have the funding. I have been referred to other means; I.E grants from other sources and CDL, but with a CDL you have to have a good credit rating. this is very unfair. and ther support stops there. i know this first hand. i find it unfair when i have to pay bills and work 24 hours a week to live and study 16 hours?",
