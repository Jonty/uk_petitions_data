In this inclement weather we need every incentive to be lured out of vehicles & onto vunerable & exposed bikes. But they are efficient, eco friendly, economic to run, compact & nippy, though comparitively expensive, regards RRP,\naccessories, servicing & spares. If Jeff Capes, for eg. can ride a bike downhill, at speed, achieving the resultant mass & collision potential & it's legal, why can't a little old lady on a 50cc moped be allowed to also? She will be on a more stable & controlable platform too.\nAt least include it as a FREE alternative if u have already paid all on a car & have exhibited road sense. Insurers must recognise the  risk/liability reduction to their benefit. We even restrict electrically assisted pedal bike motor torque!\nWhy does a drop of petrol & a piston in the equation trigger such an over reaction -  do they smell a rat, witchcraft, fumes or maybe just money? I mean, stick a 10cc petrol motor on a skateboard & you have their intervention. Do they have to throttle the throttle?",
