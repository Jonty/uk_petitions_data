            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The unbridled rise in the cost of tube, train and bus travel in London has considerably reduced the quality of life for residents of the capital. Mayor Livingstone and indeed the Govt. wish to encourage the public to refrain from using their cars, in favour of one of the \"greener\" options, one of these being the use of public transport.  However the cost of public transport and fare structure is prohibitive, and not much different from filling a full tank of petrol, avoiding congestion charge areas.  Public transport is therefore, not cheaper than car usage. Paying the same fare for the longest bus journey in a single fare, and the same for the shortest bus journey, is an unfair  way of running a bus service.  On tubes and trains, the cost of a one day travel card is now six pounds.  These fare increases in 2006,2007 have gone much higher than the cursory 10% per annum usually allowed Transport for London, and are extremely high for people on low incomes.",
