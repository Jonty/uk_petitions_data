            "background": "The taxation for pollution prevention purposes should be via the tax on fuel which is in direct proportion to use and hence pollution created by a vehicle.  Taxation via a fixed charge (Road Fund Licence) is a taxation on ownership regardless of use and has no correlation to the use and hence pollution.  Therefore a person with low use and making low pollution will have a higher marginal rate of taxation than a person with high use- this is a fundamentally wrong concept and use of taxation as a weapon.",
