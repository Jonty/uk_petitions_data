            "background": "The closed wards are now derelict and the NHS still owns the land - which is costing money every day it is sat doing nothing. The NHS are short of beds and there are numerous 28-bed wards at Saint Luke's Hospital available. This hospital is less than one mile from Bradford City Centre making easy access for patients. It is sad that the buildings are now derelict and it makes me angry that the NHS could and should be using them.",
