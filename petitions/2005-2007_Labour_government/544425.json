        "background": "Many accidents are caused by a sudden change in vehicle speed.  These step changes in velocity are common near speed cameras because many drivers are unaware of the speed limit of the road upon which they travel.  Displaying the speed limit clearly on the back of each camera so that the approaching driver can see, understand and confirm that their speed is acceptable will prevent many people from inappropriate use of their brakes and could reduce the number of road accidents.",
