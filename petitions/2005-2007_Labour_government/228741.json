        "background": "Dihydrogen Monoxide (DHMO) is a colourless and odourless chemical compound, also known as hydronium hydroxide or hydric acid. \n\nDHMO is known to be the cause of thousands of deaths each year due to accidental inhalation. Prolonged exposure to solid DHMO causes severe tissue damage, while in its gaseous form it can cause severe burns. It corrodes and oxidises many metals. It is widely used in industry as a solvent and coolant.\n\nDHMO contributes to soil erosion, is a significant greenhouse gas a major component of acid rain. DHMO is also found in many known carcinogens, and in the tumours of cancer patients.\n\nDHMO has been found to contaminate many foods, and is even used as a food additive. It also contaminates lakes and rivers, yet industry dumps thousands of tons of it into the environment every year unchecked.",
