            "background": "Section 10 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 affords the Crown (Ministry of Defence) immunity to claims brought by servicemen for injuries sustained whilst on front line tours of duty from 1947 until it was repealed on 15th May 1987.  Any qualifying claimant restricted by this Act (1947 to 15th May 1987) would be claiming damages against the MOD not for actual exposure to a traumatic event but for medical negligence during any treatment for a physical or psychological injury received whilst in service.  Section 10 promotes undue stress, discomfort, illness and severe financial detriment for the injured serviceman at a time when the nation and the elected government should be striving to repay the debt of the nation to these citizens. I move that the Act be retrospectively repealed at best or at least remains an Act that is not applied by the Ministry of Defence under any circumstances to comply with their obligations under a duty of care and as a matter of national honour and debt.",
