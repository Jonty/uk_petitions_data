        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The provision of the hard shoulder is an expensive and wasteful use of motorway road space. During peak periods this could be effectivly used as a semi-continuous crawler lane for heavy goods vehicles and lorries at reduced speeds this would not present a safety issue. This could be achieved at any time through the use of variable message boards or through fixed periods by the use of appropraite signage both of which would be significantly cheaper then making physical changes to existing infrastructure. It is already accepted to be an effective method of reducing congestion so why not commit to a national acceptance",
