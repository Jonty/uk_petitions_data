Stop this pretence of democratic process and pull the E-Petitions facility from this Government website.\n\n\"The Government is to press ahead with preparations for nationwide congestion charging despite the millionth signature on a petition opposing the idea.\n\nAn experiment in internet democracy, in which people were invited to place petitions on the No 10 website and vote for them by e-mail, has embarrassed ministers. \n\nThe petition calling on the Government \u201cto scrap the vehicle tracking and road-pricing policy\u201d was due to gain its millionth signature last night, less than three months after it was posted on the website.\"\n\nBen Webster, Transport Correspondent, Times Online",
