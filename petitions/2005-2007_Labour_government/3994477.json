        "background": "Highworth in Wiltshire used to have its own railway station and line into Swindon. The line was removed and station closed some years ago and now we only have the roads. Highworth contains a large commuter base of people who travel by cars into Swindon for work every day and re-opening the line/station makes sense. It worked before and it will work again.",
