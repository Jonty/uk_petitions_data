        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Demand should bring down the cost not increase it.  Ordinary families are heavily penalized when wanting to take their families on holiday, being forced to go during term times when holidays are cheaper. They now face a heavy fine if permission has not been granted by the school, making holidays abroad only for the wealthy. Same flight, same hotel and destination, but in some cases almost three times the price during school holidays.",
