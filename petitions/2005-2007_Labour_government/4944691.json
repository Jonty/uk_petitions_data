            "background": "I for one am sick and tired of hearing about Paedophiles being released from prison. These \"people\" cannot be re-habilitated. If someone is convicted of such an offence they should be given a death penalty and never allowed to walk the streets again. They should lose all their \"Human Rights\" as they have taken the same from the child. Given a death penalty would mean that \"they\" think twice before commiting such diabolic acts upon our innocent children.Every child has the right to be protected, every child has the right to a childhood and no child should have to go through what can only be described as hell at the hands of such people. This would undoubtedley solve the problems of overcrowding prisons and do humanity a favour by getting rid of these evil people. I'm sure you would'nt have much trouble getting people to \"flip the switch\" with these people.      \nPlease, it's more than time that we all stood together on this, and if signing this petition is a start, then lets do it.",
