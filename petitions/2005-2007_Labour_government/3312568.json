            "background": "Childcare for my two children costs \u00a31,200 per month, 50% of my take home salary. I do not have a private nanny, just a registered childminder who I share with two other families. I am not entitled to any 'working families' benefits etc. \n\nAll I can get is a voucher worth \u00a355 per week from my employer which I can offset against my taxable income. The voucher system is highly bureaucratic and since inception has engendered a whole industry of agencies offering to manage the system on behalf of employers. The maximum allowable weekly voucher value is \u00a355 whether the family has one child or six children. \n\nA simpler, more effective and less bureaucratic system would enable the full costs of childcare to be eligible for tax relief (to a reasonable level).",
