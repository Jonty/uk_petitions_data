        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The sentence should fit the crime so that punishment means punishment and repeat offenders should be punished more severely. Criminals should lose their civil rights as part of the punishment so that you don't get claims for drug users having to come off their drugs when in prison. If community service is given it should be hardened labour such as the chain gangs you see in films.\n\nPrisons should also be run more like the military prison in Colchester as this would make prison life less appealing to offenders.\n\nAll immigrant offenders should be exported and their DNA, fingerprints and retinal scans taken so they can't regain entry into the UK at a later date",
