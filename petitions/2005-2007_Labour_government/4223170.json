        "background": "The olympics are a great thing - lots of fun and some inspiration to be had but why can't we use the money (somewhere upwards of \u00a34bn and rising) for a cause which will echo the ages and not just be repeated by some other country 4 years down the line? Will the facilities now being built really mean that much for the country? Can we not do without a luxuary swimming pool centre for a few years whilst we allow thousands of people to eat and, more importantly, live? I think we can and I think you know it. Please sign up if you agree - we might not get anywhere but it would be nice for the government to see where a lot of peoples hearts lie on world issues.",
