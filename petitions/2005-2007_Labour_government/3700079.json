        "action": "progress with one of the recommendations of the Eddington Report, i.e to reduce congestion at pinch points, by requiring that all changes to road layouts, made in recent years, that have increased congestion be reversed. These include road narrowing, build outs, bus lanes, chicanes, humps, etc.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Eddington Report recommends that \u2018Smaller projects which unblock pinch points\u2026.are likely to offer the very highest returns\u2019 (Recommendation 12). Many of these pinch-points have been deliberately created over recent years by local authorities in an attempt to deter vehicles from using their streets. Congestion causing pinch points have been created by road narrowing, chicanes, kerb build outs, one way streets, bus lanes, cycle lanes, turning roads into cul de sacs, road humps, re-phasing traffic lights, banning turns, home zones, etc. Such actions cause congestion and increase air pollution as a direct result of slow moving traffic. It would be quick, easy and very beneficial both  to the economy and to the environment to reverse these actions.",
