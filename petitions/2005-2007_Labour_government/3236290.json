        "background": "i feel that i, like the majority pay my dues to this country in terms of tax and insurance only to find the minority of this country being given free handouts. i feel that a lot of these people think \"if this country is a soft touch then why should i work\". this attitude to me is disgraceful and i would like to see greater checks and stricter criteria to those offered money, as it seems anyone with a good act of a limp will be signed off. i feel the truly genuine cases would not mind being quizzed or greater indepth checks conducted. we will see the response that this survey generates and hopefully save this countries nhs service and save millions if not billions in fraud. i have had enough of people coming into this country claiming millions in benefits, free housing, disability allowances, and what do we get...........nothing just higher taxes and 6 hour waiting times at hospitals.",
