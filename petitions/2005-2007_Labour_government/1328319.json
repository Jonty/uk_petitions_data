            "background": "The Department of Health asserts that water fluoridation is the most cost-effective means of reducing tooth decay.\n\nThe American Dental Associaton claims that fluoride, when ingegrated, systemically prevents tooth decay while teeth develop, and topically when applied to mature teeth. Fluoride is said to strengthen teeth and make them decay-resistant as it is absorbed onto the surface of teeth: enamel is made less soluble, plaque organisms reduce their ability to produce acid, and tooth enamel undergoes remineralisation in areas where acids have demineralised it. \n\nIn short, we want to reduce national levels of dental decay nationwide. fluroide in our drinking water can do just that. think of our children, especially, who would benifit with stronger healthier teeth if this petition  becomes law.",
