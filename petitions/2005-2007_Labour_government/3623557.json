            "background": "The NHS data system is a shambles. One hospital cannot see any records from say a GP or a hospital at the moment & if they can get them it's pure luck.\n\nThe airline industry has SITA, which connects together the disparate systems of all airlines & airports in the world, translating data into a known format to the recipient.\n\nWe petition the PM to impliment a similar system to this for the NHS & abandon any dramatic redesign & rollout of new systems to GPs, Hospitals etc. This will cost much less (if not botched) & work much better",
