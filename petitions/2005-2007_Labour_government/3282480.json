            "background": "Although inheritance between spouses is free of IHT when both are UK domiciled, this allowance does not apply if the surviving spouse is not UK-domiciled, but the deceased is. The maximum IHT-free transfer is then only \u00a355000. \nSince the condition is that of domicile, even if the non-domiciled surviving spouse has been resident, working, and paying tax in the UK for many years, IHT will have to be paid on the value of the marital home in the UK.\nThis is clearly very unfair treatment compared with\nthe usual situation when both members of a couple are UK-domiciled, and especially so when the non-British one is a citizen of another EU country, who would otherwise be protected from discrimination on the grounds of nationality by the ECHR.\nFreedom from IHT should therefore apply for inheritance by non-domiciled spouses who are citizens of other EU countries.",
