Recently 2 men were charged with aggravatd burglary and released on bail by Magistrates who clearly live in a different world to the rest of us. \n\nThe present system will never support ordinary, law-abiding families, until Magistrates are elected rather than 'chosen'. \n\nOrdinary people, living in ordinary towns and villages, need protection!",
