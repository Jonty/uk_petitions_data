        "background": "We petition the Prime Minister to introduce a range of speeds per lane on a few targetted motorways in Britain.\n\nThe idea breaks down as follows, \n\nThe first lane would have a 'speed range' of 50-60mph. This would cater for those who are not confident upon motorways and drive vehicles fitted with speed limiters.\n\nThe second lane would have a 'speed range' of 60-70mph. This lane would be used traditionally as an overtaking lane for the first lane and also for faster flowing traffic.\n\nThe third lane would have a speed range of 70-80mph. This third lane allows for traditional overtaking by those in the second lane. This third lane also provides an environment for those who would have used excessive speed to do so legally and amongst other users travelling at the same speed. \n\nThis would act as a concessionary measure to those calling for Britain's motorways to be modelled on Germany's autobahn network and also those asking for a rise in the speed limit.\nDriving beyond 80mph already occurs in Britain and the best measure to tackle speeds beyond that is to enforce these speed ranges on some of the Motorway network.",
