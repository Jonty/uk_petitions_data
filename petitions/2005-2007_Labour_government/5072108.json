            "background": "Recently many people have lost faith in democracy in this once great Britain we inhabit. For example the government's refusal to back down over issues such as road pricing despite 1.8 million signatories of a petition on this very website opposing the idea. Furthermore the idea of the Gordon Brown sweeping to power unopposed is reducing confidence in democracy across the nation. We ask that you call a general election on Monday the 23rd of July simply to allow the people a voice which you are unable to ignore.",
