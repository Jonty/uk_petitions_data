            "action": "Reduce the 'White Van Man'  standard of driving by introducing a penalty points system for businesses/companies operating vehicles, similar to that for drivers, whereby the business/company is banned from operating vehicles once their penalty point quota is reached.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Whenever a driver of a company/business owned vehicle receives penalty points for a road traffic offence, the company/business operating the vehicle would similarly receive penalty points. The company/business would need a licence to operate the vehicles that would be revoked, similar to a driving licence, when their penalty point quota (based on the number of vehicles they operate) is exceeded.  This measure would force employers to take responsibility for the standard of driving of all those using their vehicles.\n\nThe result of implementing this measure would be a huge reduction of the manic and dangerous driving standards (and deaths) we see on our roads today.",
