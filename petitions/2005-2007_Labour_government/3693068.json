We are very worried about further detrimental effects involving possible brain injury to him and to others in the vicinity, including the many visitors who come to New Brighton in their leisure time, should this new proposal go ahead. \nThe local council have refused planning permission for this mast site at the first hearing, but Vodafone have put in an appeal to the Planning Inspectorate.",
