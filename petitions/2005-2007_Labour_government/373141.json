            "background": "Caroline Flint (Public Health Minister) has bowed down to pressure from the ill-informed religious lobby, bolstered by sensationalist scare-mongering from the press, and clearly does not understand the implications of this ban. It will irreparably damage the UK\u2019s current status as world-leader in the field of stem-cell research, delay even the possibility of cures, and prolong suffering for millions of people worldwide. Religion has always been the enemy of scientific enquiry and human progress.  It didn\u2019t show us how to make fire, build houses, grow crops, clothe ourselves, cure disease, land on the moon or make a mobile phone call. We cannot allow this superstitious fear of knowledge to strangle research aimed at the analysis, understanding and eventual remedy of debilitating, fatal and currently incurable diseases.  There is no moral justification for either the Church or the Government to stand in the way of scientific research designed to benefit the entire global population.",
