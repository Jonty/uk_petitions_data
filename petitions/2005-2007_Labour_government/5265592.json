But there is no equivalent if it gets too hot \u2013 which is farcical and dangerous, according to the Trades Union Congress. \n\nTUC General Secretary Brendan Barber said today: \"Employees should not have to suffer in sweat at work. There is a legal responsibility on employers to make their staff safe but this should be backed up with a legal limit on how much heat workers have to bear.\"",
