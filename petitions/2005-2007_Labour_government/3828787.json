            "background": "Many oppose an elected upper chamber because it would challenge the primacy of the Commons.  The House of Commons' primacy is justified by the fact that its Members are democratically elected. Unfortunately, primacy of the Commons now effectively means primacy of the Executive.  If both Houses are elected, we would have the primacy of Parliament. The recommended voting system would mean that every MP would have been elected by the majority of voters (albeit as a second preference for some) and the House of Lords would have a composition which reflected the range of political opinions across the country.  Together they could ensure that the executive was truly answerable to the people.  The result should be a much more consensual approach to policymaking and legislation. Should consensus between the Houses not be found on any issue or proposal, the Commons, as representative of the majority of the population, would still hold sway. This could be declared by statute.",
