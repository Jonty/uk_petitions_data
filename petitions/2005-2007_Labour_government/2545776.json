            "background": "In the 1960's & 1970's when records had nice lyrics, nice tunes and melodies Radio 1 deservered to be called the national radio station. Everyone knew the words to the songs and would sing along with them while listening in. Theses days, it's just a loud noise. Every record seems to be similar. The words are rude, crude and often talk of killing etc. The singer shouts out the words at the top of his voice. The dance tunes seem as though they are twenty minutes long. The disk jockeys think that they are the best. They are nothing like the old ones eg. Tony Blackburn, Steve Wright, Dave Lee Travis. We have piped music played through speakers at work and the difference in the attitude with the men on the days that the local radio station is played is unbelievable. Our local radio station, Real Radio South Wales plays records from the 60's through to today but only the ones that are seen to be playable.",
