        "background": "Government takes money out of council housing, leaving many councils unable to meet the government's Decent Homes standard. The government then offers extra investment - but councils have to access one of 3 options to get it, transferring either their homes or the management of them into the private sector. We are asking for the 'fourth option' \u2013 a level playing field so that the same amount of money can be invested in council housing directly. If all council housing rents and receipts were ringfenced there would be more than enough to do all the work that is needed. Private sector interests are now lobbying to take away our security of tenure, and bring in market forces, because they claim our estates have become 'unsustainable'. But there is a massive housing crisis in this country and the private market is incapable of solving it. Adequate investment, coupled with building new council homes again, would solve problems of sustainability and help to solve the housing crisis.",
