        "background": "I will quote from a recent article by Peter Hitchens, who writes in the Mail on Sunday.\n\n'When, 20 years ago, a couple of children's books portrayed homosexual households as normal, there was a huge fuss. This alerted us to the fact that the cultural Marxists were hoping to get their ideas taught to children as young as possible.\n\nThe famous 'Section 28', banning the promotion of homosexuality in schools, and its portrayal as a 'pretended family relationship' was the result. So far as I know, this law was never used nor was a prosecution even threatened.\n\nAnd yet the Left used all their political muscle to get this law overturned. And now we know why.\n\nThey fully intended to promote homosexuality in schools and, specifically, to persuade young minds of the contentious opinion that single-sex relationships are normal and equivalent to heterosexual marriages.\n\n\u2026Our society has changed, in just 20 years, by the deliberate and systematic actions of the anti-marriage revolutionaries.\u2019\n\nSign now.",
