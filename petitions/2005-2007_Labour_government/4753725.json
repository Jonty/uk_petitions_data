            "background": "It is considered that monkeys would form a valuable addition to the UK park environment, with their mischeivous antics and uncannily human expressions providing entertainment for all. Their introduction would prove something of a boon for UK tourism and their presence would also provide a stimulus for residents of the UK to get out into nature, make full use of the acres of available Parkland, and keep fit. Perhaps if parks were full of law-abiding monkey-lovers then their image as dangerous no-go areas infested with tramps and drug addicts would be a thing of the past.",
