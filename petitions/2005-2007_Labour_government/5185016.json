        "background": "David Tennant is the most talented actor on television at present, and the future looks bright too. It's not just Doctor Who he has us all spellbound with, he has a whole back-catalogue of brilliance. He needs recognising as the best in British talent.\nNot only is he giving children of this country an imagination again, he gives the family a reason to sit down together on a Saturday evening and the adults something to talk about at work.\nHe has brought television alive again and he should be recognised for this.",
