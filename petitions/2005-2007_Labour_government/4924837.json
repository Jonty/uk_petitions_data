We're crying out for skilled graduates to contribute to the economy and the Highly Skilled Migrant Program's criteria set the bar too high. Its very difficult to get in unless you're a young doctor or an MBA.\n\nLet's make the UK a world leader in every field by encouraging skilled people with talent we need by widening the scope of the Highly Skilled Migrants Program.",
