There has been many points to the case saying that her remains are buiried in the Tarry Burn, but yet the police will not search it. They should atleast search it and give Moiras family peace. I have mailed Straphclyde Police many of times to get them to search it, because if they do search it - and theres nothing - then they haven't lost anything have they? There is many ways if they do find remains to find out if it is Moiras body - for example: dental records, face remodeling etc.",
