        "background": "Currently producers of manufactured goods have to meet their own production costs, but not the disposal costs of what they produce. It is therefore not in their interest to pay any regard to the effect on the environment of what they produce. The consumers and local authorities have to find a way (and the cost) of disposing or recycling of unwanted products and packaging. Recycling is only scratching at the surface of the waste problem. The real answer is not to produce so much rubbish in the first place. This will only happen when producers have an incentive not to produce rubbish.",
