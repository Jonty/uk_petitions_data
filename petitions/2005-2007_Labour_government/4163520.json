            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "South West Trains have announced a further 20% increase to off peak train fares between 10am and noon.  Customers using these services will be liable for a further 20% increase in fares, 5 x the rate of inflation. They argue that this is to stop overcrowding. Whether or not you believe this is irrelevant. The public have been given incentives to avoid peak hour travel.  SW Trains have gone against the national spirit of off peak travel.  Further all 1st class passengers will have to pay 15% more proving this is nothing about avoiding congestion but is a sly way to raise more funds.  We already have one of the most expensive train services in the UK without the commenserate quality. This action needs to be stopped.",
