            "background": "The York and North Yorkshire Primary Care Trust have created a panel to vet each patient's hospital referral, made by their GP. That panel, not the GPs or the hospital consultants, will decide whether or not treatment should be given. In many cases patients are not being given the treatment they desperately need. This causes them greater suffering. What has happened to the NHS? Was it not set up to enable us all to have the medical treatment we require. Please sign this petition and let us get what we are entitled to.",
