            "background": "Cannabis has been scientifically proven to provide effective relief from the symptoms of Cancer, Multiple Sclerosis, HIV, Parkinsons, Huntingdons, Neuropathy, Anorexia, Nausea, Arthritis, Epilepsy as well as many other serious conditions.\n\nLegal pharmaceutical drugs are often many times less effective than cannabinoid medicine, and often create many unpleasant side effects. \n\nFor many sufferers, there is no other alternative than to buy over-priced, inferior and polluted cannabis from an unregulated market, and run the risk of prosecution for the sole crime of wanting to be well.\n\nWe, the undersigned, demand that the Government permits people with proven chronic medical conditions the right to grow medicinal cannabis without fear of persecution.",
