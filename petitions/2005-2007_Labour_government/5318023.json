        "background": "If all the money paid in taxes by motorists was invested in roads we would have the finest roads in the world. If it wasn't for the little money that is spent, what would cyclists cycle on? Who do they think pays for their nice smooth roads? Why should motorists play second fiddle to the cyclists who do not pay for the roads? Stop getting at the motorists, without us there would be no roads. Don't build cycle lanes. Save the money  and instead, improve the roads for the people that pay for them. The poor b****y motorist.",
