            "background": "The RMT union threaten strike action on a regular basis. Their various grievances are always alleged to be with their members' employers. But they must know that the people who really suffer as a result of strike action (or the threat of it) are ordinary London commuters - the very people who, in effect, pay their members' wages, mainly through ever-increasing fares but additionally in their capacity as taxpayers. Strike action to restrict provision of an important public service is surely one of the worst abuses of monopoly power imaginable, and totally out of keeping with the 21st century.",
