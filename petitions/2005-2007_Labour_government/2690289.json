            "background": "CMHT centres have had funding reduced, thus causing many patients suffering from mental health disorders to go untreated except for 'medication', which is , alone , inappropriate. For many disorders talk therapy or weekly one to one contact and in emergency situations by CMHT support in the patients home are needed but funding no longer allows for this in many areas.In Mansfield such care would be offered, in Maidenhead it is not. It has become a postcode lottery.Lack of duty of care may well lead to sections or even suicides.",
