            "background": "A huge amount of conjestion at peak times is caused by HGV's becoming grouped together restricting the flow of traffic past them. By banning the movement of HGV's during peak times the flow of traffic during those periods would be much easier and quicker. HGV's could then travel in the less conjested times giving them much easier movement and reducing their fuel costs and carbon footprint. This would also ensure that the drivers of HGV's take regular enforced breaks with a potential reduction in accidents. Lorry parks could easily be added to motorway service areas and built on major trunk roads.",
