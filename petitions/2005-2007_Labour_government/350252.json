        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Any party that is voted into power should honour their manifesto commitments entirely. To ensure this happens, we propose that a council be created to monitor manifesto commitment implementation. In the event that a party does not honour one of its commitments, the council should have the resources to publish online and in print the extent to which the commitment has not been honoured and the reason/s why. Of course, it will be absolutely necessary for the council to be made-up of impartial and trusted individuals, with no official links to the party of government or opposition, or indeed any other. We feel this will give greater meaning to a party's manifesto and enrich the democratic process in Britain.",
