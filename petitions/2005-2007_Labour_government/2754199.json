            "background": "This petition is to make sure that faith schools are not abolished and that the teaching of creationism is not prohibited in uk schools. This is because faith schools are there to support people in what they beleive so they can grow in that religous beleif. \nI am also against creationalism not being tuaght because i think it is unfair that we should not allow children as they grow older to decide for themselves if creation did happen or not. I also think that it means people with this beleif that creation did happen will not be able to express there beleif that this did occur. I find it wrong that people are not aloud to express there beleifs",
