There are many thousands of locally listed structures all across the Country - they often encapuslate a particularly poignant or important part of the local heritage, and they are quite unprotected.\n\nWe strongly urge that locally listed buildings and monuments are protected in the same way that nationally listed buildings are protected.   Please can they be given the same status as nationally  listed buildings in the Heritage White Paper",
