            "background": "Standards in education are steadily falling and reading petitions posted by the public illustrates this beautifully. \n\nThe biggest irony being that many people raising petitions around the subjects of education and celebrating 'Englishness' are incapable of spelling even the simplest words correctly in their own language. \n\nIn this instance the result is that no matter how valid the argument, the petitioner is let down by appearing lazy or ignorant. \n\nWhy should anyone take an argument seriously if the person making the point is incapable using the English language correctly or worse, can't be bothered.\n\nPlease sign this petition to raise the standards of one of the most basic educational requirements.",
