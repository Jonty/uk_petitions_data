The government pays for medication whilst the patient is on dialysis, but not before. These drugs are effective at avoiding dialysis and are NECESSARY. It is ridiculous that these patients should have to pay for something that in most cases they have not done anything to require these drugs in the first place, much like asthmatics (who also have to pay), epileptics (who don't) and diabetics (who also don't).",
