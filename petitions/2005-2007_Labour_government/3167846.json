            "background": "If signed it means the British people have decided (by proxy) to fully adopt the EU Constitution. There will be no need for a General Election in May 2010 - as British political parties will be abolished - all of them. We will have to be prepared to hand over all our weapons (including Nuclear) and Armed Forces to this new Police State.  The signing of this Treaty will force the Queen to commit Treason, as she is signing away her Monarchy over Britain. The Frankfurt School of Indoctrination will have won and a Leftist State will rule over us!",
