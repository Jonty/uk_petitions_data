            "background": "Bbring back the 11 plus and grammar school education system; investing in secondary education to give young people the best chance to develop their strongest skills whether traditionally academic or technical or artistic. People with strengths in physical, artistic and technical areas should be valued and their skills developed and encouraged without the pressure of academic acheivement. While those with traditionally valued strengths in the sciences, arts and languages should be allowed to exploit their abilities without being held back by a constraining curriculum designed as a compromise but which merely prevents all students from fulfilling their potential.",
