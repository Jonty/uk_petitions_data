        "background": "After last years summer drought and the water ban that shortly followed, I have come to a conclusion that something need to be done, before this incident re-occurs again this year. The solution that will put a stop to drought is to build more water purification sites around the coastlines of the UK. I realise that this will cost money but it would be much more beneficial to the UK than the Olympics. These sites should be powered by wind turbines, saving on the increase of global warming is it is a never ending renewable energy. With these sites in place the whole of the United Kingdom will be able to receive fresh clean water from many pipe lines coming from each of the purification sites. This would surly put a stop to drought and save from water bans occurring in the UK.",
