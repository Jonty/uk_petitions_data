Namely, bringing into the public arena issues of justice and liberty, an increase in public discourse and a reduction in voter apathy.\n\nGuido Fawkes is an independent blogger who was the 2005 winner, Best Political Commentary - The Backbencher Political Weblog Awards (The Guardian).\n\nHis blog has over 400,000 page views in the month of January and this can be shown to be helping public discourse and reducing voter apathy.\n\nWe therefore believe these services to politics deserve recognition, and a position as a peer would greatly assist further reductions in apathy.",
