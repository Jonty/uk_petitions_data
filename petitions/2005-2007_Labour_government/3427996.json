        "action": "Apply a rise in petrol duty, the profits of which will be used to develop a cheap and efficient public transport network, whilst simultaneously revamping the road tax system so that cleaner cars don't pay anything and high polluting cars pay an extremely heavy price (in thousands of pounds) for their pollution",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "These measures should be coupled with:\na) making the train service public again and slashing prices by approximately 75% so that taking the train is much cheaper than going by car, not 5 times the price;\nb) ensuring that the public transport system developed is clean and is more than just extra buses (which get caught in traffic), eg light railways or monorails. \nc) imposing small congestion charges in cities but only during rush hour periods, to encourage people onto public transport. Invest profits into public transport.\nd) switch of traffic lights during nighttime hours, which will help reduc pollution from powering these lights.\n\nThese measures don't impose tracking on anyone and criminals won't be able to dodge paying for it as they probably would for a technologically driven scheme",
