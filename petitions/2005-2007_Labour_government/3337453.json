This should be considered in the best interests of a true democracy. It would make the tax paying/voting public more part of politics in this country.  I would venture to suggest that it would encourage more people to complete their Annual Returns in the belief that they have some 'ownership' over the disbursement of their tax paid. More revenue for the HMRC and less chasing too! GET IT SPENT WHERE IT'S MEANT.",
