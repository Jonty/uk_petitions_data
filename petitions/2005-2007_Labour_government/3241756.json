            "background": "Only MPs can claim expenses from their employer (namely the UK Public) with out providing a receipt for all costs incurred. Currently a large number of MPs claim more in expenses than they earn as an MP. This unless they have a large private income or savings would be impossible to achieve or maintain. Every Employee or Self Employed person is required to provide receipts and failure to do so would lead to dismissal and charges of fraud, in the case of the self employed this could be classed as criminal offence under Tax and VAT legislation.",
