            "background": "The Channel Tunnel is not an entity onto istelf. It's part of a publicly owned rail and motorway network, and running it like a private enterprise is incompatible with this. The rail and motorway links on both sides of the tunnel are fully funded by taxpayers. Why make an exception to this short stretch? The high tolls charged by tunnel operators undermine the benefits of the billions of public funds already spent on those links.\n\nPrivate ownership was a flawed concept from the beginning. The tunnel never could, and never will be able to \"pay for itself\". But its macroeconomic benefits (eg. increased trade) would far outweigh its price of construction if it was offered as a free public service, like most other transport links.\n\nCurrently the tunnel is a very underused piece of kit. This is because the operators are forced to finance their unsustainable debt.\n\nI suggest that the tunnel is bought back into a shared public ownership by the UK and France. Future tolls should cover operating costs only, and not be used to finance the tunnel's contruction costs.\nWe would see a great increase in tunnel traffic and cheaper train fares, which would benefit the economy and environment.",
