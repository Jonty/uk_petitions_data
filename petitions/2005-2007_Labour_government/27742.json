        "background": "Software patents are used by convicted\nmonopolists to threaten\ncustomers who consider using rival\nsoftware. As a result, patents stifle\ninnovation.\n\nPatents are supposed to increase the\nrate of innovation by\npublicising how inventions work.\nReading a software patent\ngives no useful information for\ncreating or improving software. All\npatents are writen in a sufficiently\ncryptic language to prevent them from\nbeing of any use. Once decoded, the\npatents turn out to be for something\nso obvious that programmers find them\nlaughable.\n\nIt is not funny because the cost of\ndefending against nuicance lawsuites\nis huge.\n\nThe UK patent office grants software\npatents against the letter and the\nspirit of the law. They do this by\npretending that there is a difference\nbetween software and 'computer\nimplemented inventions'.\n\nSome companies waste money on\n'defensive patents'. These have no\nvalue against pure litigation\ncompanies and do not counter threats\nmade directly to customers.",
