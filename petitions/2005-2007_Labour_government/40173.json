            "background": "Air Transport is promoted by the air transport industry and its backers as being vital to the economic well-being of the UK, when in fact no objective study has ever been carried out taking into proper account the environmental, health and tourist loss impacts that air transport creates. An independent review, carried out on the behest of the Royal Commissions, would clarify whether there is any such economic benefit, in relation to other forms of transport, and thus whether air transport should benefit from its current economic subsidies (air fuel, parts and manufacture being zero-rated) and the beneficial planning regime offered in the recent Air Transport White Paper.",
