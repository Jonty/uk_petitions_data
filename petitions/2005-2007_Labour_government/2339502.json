            "background": "I am one of the many regular bus users in East anglia. Yet every week i am charged a  ridiculous amount of money for a week long ticket, and I only have to buy a half! First bus are raising ticket prices regularly and it is unacceptable. They have poured money into thier number 8 service (Great Yarmouth) but have neglected the overused \"school run\" services such as the number 2. First bus should either lower prices and spread its resources around its services fairly, or get out and let a much more competant bus service take over.",
