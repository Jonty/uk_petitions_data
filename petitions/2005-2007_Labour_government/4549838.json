            "background": "with the growing number of 'youth crimes' it is obvious a large number of the new generations lack the responsible nature to enter todays society. i call them the 'simpsons' generation because they appear to believe that whatever they do or however they act that all will be ok in the end, however, life is not a show and everything is not alright now and they are ruining their and others lives so i propose national service be bought back which would give role models for the youth of today to follow and admire,all society in my opinion would benefit. i am imagining the most frightened and effected of the apparent breakdown in responsibility, manners and respect are the elderly so if you have an elderly relative or friend please ask them to add their name here or help them by adding with their permission. it is not the full answer and there could be ways of diluting national service to offenders or police recommendations but this initial petition would be for full service of an age group to be agreed and include any persons entering the country of that age group too, lets persuade the govenment that the public would be behind them by reinstating national service, please help society today.",
