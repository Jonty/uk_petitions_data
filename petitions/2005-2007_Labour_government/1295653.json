        "background": "Special site's are contaminated sites as laid down in Environment Act 1990 Part 2A contaminated land Regime. Unfortunately it is up to the local councils to declare these sites as special and thus give remediation work and funding over the environment agency. Unfortunately unscrupulous councils at present are not doing this and can choose to let developers have the sites and thus the remdiation work is never undertaken correctly putting the health of local residents at risk.",
