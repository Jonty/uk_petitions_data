            "background": "During heterosexual sex, the \"double Dutch\" method of contraception\u2014where condoms or femidoms are used in combination with a hormonal or intrauterine method of contraception\u2014provides excellent protection against unplanned/unwanted pregnancy, as well as good protection against STIs.  \"Double Dutch\" also shares the responsibility for sexual safety between the man and the woman involved.  It is suitable for use by people of all ages in all types of relationships, and would minimise the rates of both STI infection and unplanned/unwanted pregnancy.\n\nTherefore, to promote joint sexual responsibility and minimise the unplanned/unwanted pregnancy rate, the \"double Dutch\" technique should be explicitly taught in schools as part of the basic sex education programme, and pupils of both sexes should be encouraged to use it at all times during their lives when parenthood would be undesirable.",
