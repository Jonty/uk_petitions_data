            "background": "If the public transport system was more efficiant, especially in cities, then there would be an alternative to ownership of cars. It is no use persecuting car drivers when there is no alternative provided by the government. We need to have options, because as it stands people owning cars are being discriminated against, when many of them have no other way of getting around. It is no use increasing car tax if there isn't another alternative, because the majority will continue regardless; it is  an essential part of many peoples lives.  Then it won't help the enviroment and people will be needlessly out of pocket.",
