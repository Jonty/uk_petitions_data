            "background": "Increasing the speed limit for Hgvs to 50 mph on single carriageways would stop most traffic congestion  and reduce accidents on A roads. At the moment Hgvs can only travel at 40 mph when cars can travel at 60 mph. Other road users get impatient when stuck behind a hgv traveling at 40 mph and take risks when overtaking. Increasing the speed limit to 50 mph would make the traffic flow better for all road users.",
