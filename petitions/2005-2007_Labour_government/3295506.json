        "background": "It is a disgrace that Patient Line is allowed to take advantage of the sick in our hospitals. The cost of phoning a patient in hospital is 39p per minute off peak and 49p at peak times this high cost cannot be justified, it costs the patient 10p per minute to ring out \u201ctwice the cost of BT\u201d Also the minimum charge of \u00a33.50 for 24hrs television is outrageous, once the card is inserted it is valid for 24hrs, even if you only watch for 30 minutes over that period the cost is the same, those who are unable to leave their bed must pay this for radio or TV, if you are well enough you can go to the day room and watch TV for free, this is taking advantage of the sickest people.",
