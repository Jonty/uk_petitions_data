            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I have discovered that one of the reasons unemployed people are reluctant to find work may be due to the unbelievably generous handouts that the government have decided to give to them.\n\nA family of four not only get their Rent, Council Tax and numerous other things paid for them BUT also receive besides family allowance and unemployment benefits .... - \u00a38250+ as TAX CREDITS ??\n\nHow can get TAX CREDITS if you dont even pay tax?\n\nThey actually (EARN) get more of an income than most working families. So dont bother getting exams and a job, just have kids and the government will keep you in comfort.\n\nI work hard and have to support a wife and child with no help from anyone, and apparently with less disposable income than unemployed people...... I cant afford several mobiles or more to the point more than one child because we dont have the income.\n\nObviously numerous mobile phones, runnigs cost of a car and Sky TV(full package) is a must need on the dole, oh and yeah the odd holiday.\n\nThese people have a better life than the workers of this country, who are burdened with mortgages and other spirraling liviing costs. \n\nHOW IS THAT RIGHT .... Sort it out government and stop flitering our taxes away on wasters.",
