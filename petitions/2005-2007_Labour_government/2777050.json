            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Many water companies now install water meters compulsorily, particularly if a property changes hands. This is a form of extra revenue gathering and is unfair, leading to neighbours being charged differentially.\nThere is no real water shortage in this country, only mismanagement by water companies. \n\n1. Water companies should be taxed on wastage.\n2. Those with large families should not have this extra tax burden.\n3. Gardening should be encouraged as it improves the environment. Gardens are, after all, the lungs of Britain.\n4. There should be a reduction in charges when water companies fail to supply or impose restrictions on water use. \n5. Sewerage charges should not be based on water meter readings, since for many the garden takes the majority of the water and this does not find its way back to the sewers.",
