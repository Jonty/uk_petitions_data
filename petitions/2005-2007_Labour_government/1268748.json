Giving police the power to:\n\"disperse groups (2 or more people where the relevant officer has reasonable grounds for believing that their presence or behaviour has resulted, or is likely to result, in a member of the public from being harassed intimidated, alarmed or distressed. Individuals can be directed to leave the locality and may be excluded from the area for up to 24 hours.\" The use of the term 'is likely to result' is the most frightening. In addition to the fundamental illiberality of this law there are also safety concerns: The idea of the government forcing people to walk alone through an area they themselves have defined as dangerous seems counter intuitive to say the least.",
