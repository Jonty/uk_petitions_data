            "background": "Even though people living on their own are given a discount on their council tax they still pay more per head than two people who live together.  If you split the council tax bill in half for two people who live together they pay far less per head.  Why should those who live on their own have to pay more per head than those who live with someone and invariably have two incomes coming in.  COUNCIL TAX SHOULD BE HALF PRICE FOR SINGLES AND NOT JUST GIVEN A GESTURE DISCOUNT.....",
