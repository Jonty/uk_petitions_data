            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The M62 motorway has become a nightmare in recent years due to the amount of traffic folowing over the Pennines via this route. Extending the M65 to Leeds would make an viable alternative route over the Pennines as traffic regularly queues over 14 miles to proceed into Leeds, even during times that would be regarded as off peak. The M65 extension plans were kileed off years ago but i think it is time to revisit the plans before the M62 reaches gridlock. It would also provide a much shorter route for people wishing to cross the pennines to a location other than south of Bolton.",
