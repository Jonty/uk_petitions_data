            "background": "Licensing laws foster binge drinking which costs >\u00a320bn per year according to the official cabinet office report. This proposed order extending licensing hours will make a bad situation worse. \u00a320bn is 3x the tax revenue from the sale of alcohol - evidence for a reduction in licensing hours not an increase. The media point out that research indicates binge drinkers could be causing rapid damage to their brain cells. Study on rats show that 2 days of binge drinking is enough to cause damage to an area of the brain called the \u2018olfactory bulb\u2019, responsible for smell - damage to other regions occurs after 4 days. Professor Michael Collins, Loyola University Chicago, said \"It is possible that neuronal degeneration after a couple of days of heavy intoxication in the rat might translate to the human drinker who is not even a chronic alcohol abuser.\" Department of Social Development is called upon to withdraw this order and work to promote healthier drug-free lifestyles.",
