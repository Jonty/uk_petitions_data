            "background": "In the UK, the government has initiatives to help fund the creation of British films, but not the creation of interactive entertainments, such as video games. Surely with the increasing development costs of such entertainments giving the largest publishers more control over the industry than ever, it is time to begin a system of funding, much akin to that of the British Film Industry, and to similar game-funding initiatives in France and Norway, to help support smaller British game developers, and to encourage innovation and creativity within the industry.",
